Man-made electromagnetic fields: are we at risk?

However, is there a darker side to this, are waves from human-made electromagnetic fields damaging our health? Belgian Liberal Member Frédérique Ries is sufficiently concerned that she is urging fellow MEPs to back precautionary measures before the full weight of scientific knowledge weighs in. On Wednesday evening the full European Parliament will consider her report on the matter.
It is now two years since the number of mobile phones in Europe exceeded the number of people. As you will have noticed phone network coverage is almost everywhere - something that we have now come to expect. Add to this Wi-Fi networks, phone masts, power lines, GPS receivers and we are talking about a growing amount of electromagnetic waves.
The health risks are as yet unknown. What is known is that human beings are now almost constantly exposed to what Ms Ries calls "a cocktail of electromagnetic fields".
The World Health Organisation has already said that given the novelty of mobile telephony it will not know the public health consequences until 2015. Put grimly, this is when people could start dying of cancer.
The Ries report calls for action now based on the precautionary principle used in other forms of public policy. It calls for the following steps:
An EU limit of 3 volts per metre. Nine countries already have this limit.
Antennas and phone masts should be set a specific distance from schools and hospitals.
Maps of exposure to high-voltage power lines, radio frequencies and microwaves should be publicly available online.
At present there are no EU-wide laws governing the safety of mobile telephony, just a recommendation. The report will be presented late on Wednesday evening - 1 April.
Electromagnetic fields
Electrically charged objects create the electromagnetic field
EU recommends the limits of 41.25 volts/metre for GSM technology
Reduce radiation by using hands-free, keeping calls short, switching off phones when not in use
