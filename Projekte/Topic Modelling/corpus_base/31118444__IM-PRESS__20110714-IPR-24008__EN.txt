The deadly bomb attacks in Mumbai have been condemned by the President of the European Parliament, Jerzy Buzek, and by the chair of Parliamentâ€™s delegation for relations with India, Sir Graham Watson.
Jerzy Buzek said:
"I am devastated by what happened today in Mumbai. My thoughts are with the many victims, with their families and friends. On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to express my deepest condolences and sympathies to them and to the Indian people.
I condemn these attacks in the strongest possible terms. Nothing can justify such vile acts of terror. Killing innocent civilians is against everything the most basic laws of humanity stand for. I am deeply appalled by these acts.
India and the wider region should strive for the peaceful coexistence among its multiple cultures and religions. I hope that those responsible for terror will be brought to justice. I also hope that forgiveness and reconciliation will prevail."
Sir Graham Watson said:
"Mumbai seems particularly plagued by such outrageous actions. Just twelve weeks ago my delegation and I lit candles at the memorial at the Taj Mahal hotel for the victims of the last terrorist outrage in Mumbai; the city now sees further bloodshed. Only yesterday I saw friends from Mumbai before they left Brussels to return there."
It is precisely attacks like these, possibly organised by criminals working across borders, which underline the importance of the growing EU-India co-operation in the fight against international crime. I hope we will soon see the perpetrators of these outrageous attacks serving prison sentences."
