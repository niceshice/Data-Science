At the opening of today's plenary session in Brussels, Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek voiced support for Russian journalist Oleg Kashin, brutally beaten by unknown assailants in Moscow on 6 November, welcomed the 31 October opposition rally in Moscow, condemned attacks 10 days ago on Christians worshipping in Baghdad, and deplored Chinese pressure on EU Member States not to attend the Nobel Prize award ceremony in Oslo on 10 December.
Mr Buzek condemned the brutal beating of Russian journalist Oleg Kashin on 6 November, and praised the rapid response and personal commitment of President Dmitry Medvedev to finding the perpetrators.
He then welcomed the 31 October opposition rally in Moscow, as a sign that Parliament's appeals for democratisation are beginning to take effect.
The President condemned the 31 October attacks on worshippers at the Baghdad Syriac Catholic cathedral, which caused deaths and injuries. He called on everyone to respect freedom of worship, and deplored violence committed on religious grounds.
Lastly, Mr Buzek condemned the pressure being put on EU Member States by China not to attend the Nobel Prize award ceremony in Oslo on 10 December. "Parliament strives to see inviolable human rights respected everywhere, including China", said the President, adding that the EU will be represented in Oslo by the head of its Norway delegation.
