2008-12-18 - 12:25
The European Parliament adopted the 2009 general EU budget at second-reading. The level of payments is set at €116.096 billion which amounts to 0.894 percent of the European Union's Gross National Income (GNI). The level of commitments has been set at €133.845 billion, which is 1.03 percent EU GNI. EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering signed off the official 2009 EU budget in Strasbourg.
Food facility for developing countries
MEPs approved the agreement with Council that will allow the payment of around €1 billion in farm aid to developing countries. Parliament successfully pressed for this instrument, known as the "food facility", to be financed mainly from €760 million of new money, with transfers from Heading 4 (external relations) being limited as far as possible. It was on this condition that MEPs agreed to spread the programme, originally earmarked for 2008/2009, into 2010.
For 2009, the European Parliament created a special budget heading of €568 million in commitments and rectified the structure of the expenditure, to take account of the amounts needed to finance this aid.
EU economic recovery plan
Parliament expresses its strong willingness to enter into negotiations with the Council on the basis of the Commission's proposal for a revision of the financial frameworks 2007-13 for €5 billion n the framework of the proposed European Economic recovery plan. MEPs takes note in this regard of the Conclusions of the December 2008 European Council in that respect.
The rapporteur for the 2009 general EU Budget, Jutta HAUG (PES, DE), said: "For me, it was particularly important to give strong financial support to the following: firstly, policies that tackle climate change, secondly, maintaining the social dimension in the context of growth for jobs, thirdly, in measures shaping globalisation, and finally in the support of small and medium-sized enterprises. Generally, the European Parliament safeguarded its priorities. Additionally, it was important for the European Parliament to finance the €1 billion for the Food Facility."
Janusz Lewandowski (EPP-ED, PL), rapporteur on the "other institutions" part of the 2009 EU Budget, stated that "there are no routine budgets and the procedure for preparing the 2009 EU budget illustrates that. We are glad that Parliament's concerns were met thus leading to a satisfactory agreement. Next year's budget is characterised by three main topics - it responds to current challenges, enhances the safety and security of our citizens and is efficiently managed".
The Chair of the European Parliament's Budgets Committee, Reimer Böge (EPP-ED, DE) said: "With this budget we are able to finance the basic needs of the European Union. We also agreed on the establishment of the Food Facility for developing countries. Other steps which we need to take now are new provisions on structural funds and the rural development plan, as well as the Economic Recovery plan. On the first, the simplification of procedure announced by the Commission will mean a request to amend the budget. As regards the recovery plan, the European Parliament is ready to open negotiations including on energy interconnections and high speed internet."
