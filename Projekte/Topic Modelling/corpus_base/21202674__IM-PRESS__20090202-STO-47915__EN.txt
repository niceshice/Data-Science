A Member applauds during the 1 minute speeches that opened the Session MEPs discussed Europe's energy security and the Doha trade round when parliament opened on Monday. MEPs debated an energy review which proposes deep cuts in Europe's CO2 emissions by the end of the century. This was followed by a debate on the stalled Doha trade round and whether progress could help or hinder economic recovery.
The energy debate focused on the "2nd Strategic Energy Review" which proposes a 50-80% cut in CO2 emissions by the middle of the century. French Liberal Anne Laperrouze, who drafted a report for Parliament on the review, told the House: "As the climatic constraints deepen, we need to rethink our strategy. Instead of 60% we propose an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions, a 35% increase in energy efficiency and to reach renewable energy use of 60% by 2050."
Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs said "we have agreement on supply for 10 years; we have a monitoring system; but we should not rest idle on this issue, the EU is more robust than we think; its weakness is lack of infrastructure."
Doha trade round - is it developing?
Given the economic recession and fears of growing protectionist and nationalist tendencies there were different views about whether the Doha Development trade round, which has been stalled since July, would help or hinder a recovery.
European Trade Commissioner Baroness Ashton said pressing ahead with Doha would be a step towards recovery. For the centre-right EPP-ED Georgios Papastamkos called for a "new international economic architecture" that was more transparent.
Glyn Ford, a British Labour MEP, said the Socialists are "committed to a successful outcome to the Doha round." With elections in India, a new European Parliament and Commission in June "the current financial and economic crisis is a reason to move forward and not to retreat," he said
