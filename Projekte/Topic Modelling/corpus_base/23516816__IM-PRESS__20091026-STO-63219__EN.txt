New European Commissioners yet to face MEPs questions

Who will emerge as part of the EU's executive will become clearer soon As the life-term of the existing European Commission comes to a halt on 31 October attention is turning to how the next EU executive is going to look and who will get which portfolios. EU countries have already begun jockeying for jobs and positions before naming their candidates. It is the job of the Commission President José Manuel Barroso to allocate posts, but before Commissioners can take office they must be endorsed by the European Parliament.
Anyone who thinks this is just a formality should speak to Italian politician Rocco Buttiglione. He was rejected by MEPs in 2004, forcing a new candidate to be appointed and the Commission reshuffled.
This time there is speculation about whether there will be a specific "Climate Change" Commissioner and if the "communication" and "EU enlargement" portfolios will remain as they are. Whether they do or not will send a powerful signal about the direction of the EU executive for the five years of its mandate.
At present it's not certain how many of the current Commission will remain. It is up to each EU country, along with Mr Barroso, to come up with candidates. Different countries prize different jobs and although they can lobby for a post it will be Mr Barroso who will decide who gets what job, after a careful process of bargaining.
Q&A session - a sort of job interview
Each prospective Commissioner will have to answer questions before the parliamentary committee, or committees, that covers their area. This is to test their suitability for the job - it's a bit like a job interview. This will be followed by a general discussion about whether this person is suitable.
Following the committee stage, the whole house will look at the make-up of the new Commission, after which it will vote.
Parliament only has the right to hold a vote on the suitability of the whole of the new Commission, so if one poor candidate emerges and has little support it could endanger the whole group.
Full coverage of the Hearings
A special part of the Parliament's website will soon be dedicated to the forthcoming parliamentary hearings.
