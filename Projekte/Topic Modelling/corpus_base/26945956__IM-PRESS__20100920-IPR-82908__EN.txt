At the opening of this week's session in Strasbourg, MEPs mourned the death last weekend of Egon Klepsch, former President of the European Parliament. "Mr Klepsch devoted most of his working life to the unification of Europe", said Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek before asking the House to observe a minute's silence. MEPs also voted to postpone Thursday's vote on a resolution on human rights in the Democratic Republic of Congo until the Brussels October session.
