At the beginning of the debate, group leaders will make statements on the financial crisis. On 15 November in Washington DC, the G-20 will hold a key summit on resolving the financial crisis and modernising the world's financial institutions.

British and Commonwealth Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks to address MEPs
Sir Jonathan Sacks , Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the British Commonwealth, will address a formal sitting of the House on Wednesday 19 November as part of the series of speeches by eminent guests in the context of European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. Born in London in 1948, Sir Jonathan Sacks has been Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth since 1 September 1991.
MEPs to debate the situation in DR Congo
On Wednesday morning, 19 November, the House will debate the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo after hearing statements from Council and Commission. The House will also vote on a resolution on this topic. The Head of UN peacekeeping has recently asked the UN Security Council for more than 3 000 extra troops to protect civilians in the eastern DR Congo.
EU Court of Auditors 2007 annual report to be presented to plenary
The President of the European Court of Auditors Vítor Manuel da SILVA CALDEIRA will present its report on how EU funds were spent in 2007 on Thursday 20 November. Although the accounts themselves have been approved without qualification, the same cannot be said of the "transactions underlying the accounts". The Court said that for the 14th year in a row it was not able to issue a "statement of assurance" that the EU money had been spent well and according to the rules in all policy areas.
Regulation on investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)
The Committee on Budgetary Control is tabling a report introducing 92 amendments to a Commission proposal, which proposes changes to regulation on investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF). To strengthen the efficiency of the European Anti-Fraud Office and to clarify the legal framework of its mission, the report, drafted by Ingeborg GRÄßLE (EPP-ED, DE), asks the Commission to progress without any further delays on a consolidation of the legal texts on Community administrative investigations.
MEPs seek improvements in rules on excise duties
The Economics Committee is generally supportive of Commission plans to update the rules on excise duties, and most of the amendments MEPs in the committee propose aim at clarifying the text. Other amendments set out when can travellers have access to duty free shops, and whether there should there be guidelines for the amount of alcohol and tobacco citizens can take across borders.
Challenges ahead after 10 years of Economic and Monetary Union
MEPs are to debate a comprehensive overview of how all aspects of the Economic and Monetary Union could be developed in the years to come. The report from the Economics Committee gives Parliament’s views on the ECB, the Lisbon Strategy, the Stability and Growth Pact, external representation for the eurozone and financial services supervision, among other issues.
Raising the ceiling on financial assistance for non-euro Member States
The Commission proposes raising the ceiling for financial assistance to non-euro area Member States facing balance of payments difficulties from €12 to €25bn. It also wants to be granted the power to decide on further changes to the ceiling without going through a full legislative process. Parliament will vote on Tuesday morning on whether to apply an urgency procedure to this proposal – if it does, it could complete its passage through Parliament during this plenary week.
CAP health check: finding the right balance
Parliament will adopt its position on the Common Agricultural Policy health check just before EU agriculture ministers decide on the final shape of this legislation. In reports tabled to plenary, the Agriculture Committee calls for a smaller cut in farm aid and a limited increase in milk quotas as well as special aid for milk producers and livestock farmers. It also argues that, for certain sensitive sectors, intervention schemes and the link between subsidies and production should be preserved. The four reports, drafted by Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos (PES, PT), strike a balance between the various proposals put forward by MEPs during debates on the health check and also reflect the variety of situations facing farmers in the European Union.
Bees and bee-keepers face emergency
The decline in the number of bees all over the world but especially in Europe poses a threat not just to honey production but to the pollination of plants and hence to food production. In a debate based on an oral question, followed up with a resolution, MEPs will press the Commission to take action. The threat to bees comes partly from the use of modified and treated seed, which has led to a reduction in pollen and nectar, and partly from the reduction in agricultural set-aside land.
CAP further simplified as wine is brought into common market organisation
The process of simplifying the Common Agricultural Policy will take another step forward when Parliament approves plans to bring the wine regime into the single "common market organisation" regulation. Previously there were twenty-one different market organisation regimes, making the CAP unnecessarily complex. The latest reforms do not change any of the market arrangements but will simplify the regime and make it more transparent. Neil Parish (EPP-ED, UK) will be putting forward the report.
More fruit and veg for children at school
The House will vote on a draft report by the Agriculture Committee which urges an expansion in the EU programme for distributing fruit and vegetables in schools. The aim is to encourage healthier eating habits in children and combat the obesity epidemic. MEPs would like to see more funding for the programme and they also suggest giving priority to local seasonal produce. In the European Union around 22 million children are overweight and more than 5 million are obese, mainly owing to excessive consumption of fatty, sweet or salty food. The World Health Organisation recommends consumption of at least 400g of fruit and vegetables per day for children under the age of 11.
A European "Blue Card" for highly-skilled immigrants
The EU's "Blue Card" plan to attract highly-skilled immigrants to take jobs in EU economic sectors suffering from skill shortages, modelled on the US "Green Card" system, needs clearer definitions, says the EP Civil Liberties Committee. The committee proposes clarifications, and more flexibility for Member States, whilst urging them not to "steal" brains from third countries and reaffirming the "Community preference" principle. The Blue Card, proposed by the European Commission, is designed to attract highly-qualified workers from third countries by giving them access to the 27 Member States. This card would not replace existing national systems, but would provide an additional channel of attraction, with a common grant procedure.
Civil Liberties Committee: Single application procedure could have been more ambitious
The directive on a single application procedure and common set of rights for third-country nationals wishing to legally reside and work in the EU could have been "more ambitious", says the EP Civil Liberties Committee, but it does complement the Blue Card directive, the EU plan to model the US "Green Card" system.
HIV/AIDS: early diagnosis and early care
MEPs will hear statements by the Council and Commission on HIV/AIDS: Early Diagnosis and Early Care on Wednesday 19 November, less than one month away from the 20th anniversary of World AIDS day on 1 December 2008. In Europe, the numbers of newly diagnosed infections are increasing throughout the 25 EU Member States, with the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Spain seeing the highest rates of new HIV infections (EuroHIV, 2007).
Economic and social impact of demographic tendencies in the EU
MEPs will hear statements from the Commission and Council on the economic and social impact of demographic tendencies in the EU on Wednesday 19 November. With profound changes in Europe's population structure, demographic change is high on the European policy agenda. Eurostat, the Commission statistical agency, expects the EU population, standing at 495 million on 1 January, 2008, to rise to 521 million in 2035. The UK population is predicted to become the largest in the EU, reaching 77 million by 2060.
European Union Solidarity Fund: obstacles to its reform - questions to the Commission
The Commission proposal modifying Council Regulation on the European Union Solidarity Fund has been kept on hold by the Council for more than two years since the European Parliament gave it its first reading. Parliament considers it to be of paramount importance to have a Solidarity Fund Regulation which meets the challenges and allows the Union to deliver prompt and effective assistance when Member States suffer a disaster. The Commission will be questioned on the European Solidarity Fund and obstacles to its reform.
Recommendations to reduce the pay gap between men and women
Edit BAUER (EPP-ED, SL) will be tabling an own-initiative report on equal pay for men and women. The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality recommends a revision of existing legislation on equal pay to bring about a "significant reduction in the pay gap" between men and women. Women earn on average 15% less than men in the European Union and up to 25% less in the private sector.
EU Passenger Name Records - MEPs to vote on a resolution
Parliament will vote on Thursday 20 November on a resolution on PNR data. PNR data are data originally collected for commercial purposes, while now serving an increasing number of security purposes (such as aviation security, immigration control, fiscal fraud, money laundering, preventing terrorism and crimes and prevention of communicable diseases, etc) as introduced since September 2001 by the US, Canada, Australia and more recently by the UK, France and Denmark.
How to bring space down to earth, ask MEPs
The EU and its Member States have been involved in financing and developing space technology and science for over 30 years. The adoption of the EC-ESA Framework Agreement in November 2003 gradually led to a European Space Policy (ESP). The resolution of the ‘Space Council’ on 22 May 2007 confirmed its commitment. The draft Lisbon Treaty and its Article 189 of the TFEU provide the EU with a legal framework for translating Council resolutions into policy initiatives. Questions on the European Space Policy and how to bring space down to earth will be put to both the Council and Commission.
Convention on cluster munitions - questions to the Council
In Dublin, at the end of the international meeting of States held on 19-30 May 2008, 107 States adopted the Convention on Cluster munitions, which bans the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of this class of weaponry. The Convention will be opened for signature on 3 December 2008, in Oslo. It will enter into force six months after 30 States have deposited their instruments of ratification with the UN Secretary General. The Council will be asked what have they taken to convince all States - in particular those who are Member States of the European Union - to sign, ratify and immediately implement the Convention on Cluster munitions?
Minimum criteria for environmental inspection in the Member States - questions to the Commission
Miroslav OUZKÝ (EPP-ED, CZ), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, will be asking the Commission questions on the review of Recommendation 2001/331/EC providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections in the Member States.
Carbon capture and storage technology needs prompt and direct financial commitment
Christian EHLER (EPP-ED, GER) is tabling an own-initiative report, supporting early demonstration of sustainable power generation from fossil fuels, but warns that the measures unveiled by the Commission are "not sufficient to provide the desired incentives". The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy calls for a direct financial commitment to ensure that 12 demonstration projects testing the permanent underground storage of CO2 are constructed by 2015.
Languages used by the Council Presidencies - Support for German
The report endorses the conclusions of the Ombudsman on the complaint by an association for the defence of the German language who asked the Dutch and the Luxembourg governments to offer the websites of their respective Presidencies not only in English and French but also in German. The report calls upon the Council to examine the question of the language options of the website of its Presidencies, in order to ensure that the entire population of the EU has easy access to information.
The future of social security systems
The increasing ageing population will affect social security systems. In this own-initiative report, MEPs in the Employment Committee express their preoccupation with maintaining the core of European social models. Encouraging higher employment rates are among the recommendations of the report. Social security systems under pressure: The ageing population is expected to lead to increases in public spending, most of it for pensions, health care and long-term care, in most Member States by 2050 if current policies are pursued.
Protecting the consumer: improving consumer education and awareness on credit and finance
MEPs will hear an own-initiative report drafted by Iliana IOTOVA (PES, BG) on protecting the consumer: improving consumer education and awareness on credit and finance. Overall, the report welcomes the Commission initiatives to educate consumers on finance and credit because "empowered and educated consumers help to foster competition, quality and innovation within the banking and financial services industries".
Increase awareness of Consumer Market Scoreboard, says Internal Market Committee
When consumers have the right information, education and conditions, they can make good and well-founded choices. As such, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection calls for increasing awareness of the Commission's Consumer Markets Scoreboard, a tool for identifying and analysing problems from the point of view of the consumer, and stepping up media coverage.
Human rights debates and resolutions
As usual the session ends with three debates and votes on human rights issues in the world, on this occasion the topics are: Somalia, death penalty in Nigeria, and the case of the al-Kurd family (East Jerusalem)

Financial crisis, G20 summit and Commission's legislative and working plan for 2009
2008-11-13 - 10:47
On 18 November at 3pm, MEPs will debate the financial crisis, the outcome of the European Council and G-20 summit in Washington DC and the Commission's legislative and working plan for 2009. At the beginning of the debate, group leaders will make statements on the financial crisis. On 15 November in Washington DC, the G-20 will hold a key summit on resolving the financial crisis and modernising the world's financial institutions. MEPs will vote on a resolution on the Commission work programme. What is the G-20?
The members of the G-20 are the finance ministers and central bank governors of 19 countries, country leaders will attend the summit in Washington DC: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. The European Union is also a member, represented by the rotating Council presidency and the European Central Bank. To ensure global economic fora and institutions work together, the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the President of the World Bank, plus the chairs of the International Monetary and Financial Committee and Development Committee of the IMF and World Bank, also participate in G-20 meetings on an ex-officio basis.
The G-20 thus brings together important industrial and emerging-market countries from all regions of the world. Together, member countries represent around 90 per cent of global gross national product, 80 per cent of world trade (including EU intra-trade) as well as two-thirds of the world's population. The G-20's economic weight and broad membership gives it a high degree of legitimacy and influence over the management of the global economy and financial system.
Work programme 2009
In 2009, the Commission aims to follow up on the initiatives launched in recent weeks to address the financial crisis and to set out a European framework to address the economic downturn. At the same time, the Commission will use the final year of its mandate to complete the work already under way.
On 24 September 2008, Parliament rejected a proposed joint resolution (from the EPP-ED, ALDE and UEN groups) on the European Parliament priorities for the European Commission Work and Legislative Programme 2009 with 102 votes in favour, 306 against and 207 abstentions. All individual group resolutions were also rejected by the House.
Among the more controversial issues were the votes on a proposed amendment calling on the Commission to bring forward a raft of proposals for new social legislation as well as an amendment underlining the importance of continuing the accession process with Croatia and Turkey in the expectation that both countries will in due course meet all the criteria for membership.

British and Commonwealth Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks to address MEPs
2008-11-13 - 10:47
Sir Jonathan Sacks, Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the British Commonwealth, will address a formal sitting of the House on Wednesday 19 November as part of the series of speeches by eminent guests in the context of European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
Born in London in 1948, Sir Jonathan Sacks has been Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth since 1 September 1991. At his installation as Chief Rabbi, Dr Sacks set out his vision of a reinvigorated Anglo-Jewry and launched it with a Decade of Jewish Renewal, followed by a series of innovative communal projects. In 1995, he received the Jerusalem Prize for his contribution to diaspora Jewish life. In September 2001 he began his second decade of office with a call to Jewish Responsibility and a renewed commitment to the ethical dimension of Judaism.
Covenantal relationships
In a widely publicised speech given in London in July 2008, the Chief Rabbi spoke of the importance of "covenants", which he defined as "arenas of cooperation" between individuals. As examples of "covenantal goods" he cited love, friendship and influence, "things that only exist by the virtue of sharing".
These could be contrasted with power and wealth, which he described as "arenas of competition" or a zero-sum game, since if a person shares his wealth or power he surrenders a part of those things. Love, friendship and influence, however are not diminished by being shared; indeed they only exist through sharing.
According to Dr Sacks, "If there is only competition and not co-operation, if there is only the state and the market and no covenantal relationships, society will not survive." He attributed the problems of modern society - from marriage breakdown through depression to drug abuse and violence - to a decline in the social, or covenantal, bonds that were traditionally underpinned by religion.

Amendments on publication and translation obligations should reduce costs for companies
2008-11-13 - 10:47
Piia-Noora KAUPPI (EPP-ED, FI) will be putting forward a report which introduces amendments to the Commission proposal on the publications and translation obligations of certain types of companies. On the whole, the Committee on Legal Affairs supports the proposal, which is aimed at diminishing administrative burdens and, in turn, boosting competitiveness in the economies of Member States. Amendments to clarify points in the proposal
The objective of the Commission proposal is to remove additional publications requirements in national law that cause additional costs to companies. The proposed amendments by the Committee on Legal Affairs clarify the practical implementation of the provisions related to the publication costs and translation provisions. The report also introduces one technical amendment in order to ensure a correct cross-referencing with the Second company law Directive (77/91/EEC).
Reducing the burden of publishing requirements
The Commission considered four options to diminish administrative burdens relating to publishing requirements. The Committee on Legal Affairs considers the adoption by Member States of an electronic platform, which contains full information or provides access to this information in the companies' electronic file in the register, to "balance the interests in question at best".
Amending translation requirements should lead to reduced costs
The Commission gave three options for reducing administrative burdens and costs related to excessive translation requirements of documents that have to be filed in the registers of company branches. Option three, which asks for mutual recognition of translations, was deemed to lead to benefits for companies by achieving a certain reduction in costs while ensuring the reliability of the translations.

MEPs to debate the situation in DR Congo
2008-11-13 - 10:47
On Wednesday 19 November, the House will debate the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo after hearing statements from Council and Commission. The House will also vote on a resolution on this topic. The head of UN peacekeeping has recently asked the UN Security Council for more than 3 000 extra troops to protect civilians in the eastern DR Congo. The Foreign Affairs Council meeting on 10 and 11 November stated that "the Council firmly condemns the continuing unacceptable violations of human rights in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in particular the numerous cases of sexual violence and the recruitment and use of child soldiers by the armed groups. It calls on all the parties involved to stop such violations of human rights. It would point out that the DRC Government is responsible for the behaviour of its armed forces and urges it to make every effort to strengthen the protection of the civilian population and to fight against impunity."
The Council urges the authorities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Rwanda to step up their cooperation in order to implement the commitments entered into in Nairobi, and to give priority to dialogue and consultation to help bring about lasting peace in the east of the Congo and stability in the region.
Commission response
On 7 November, The European Commissioner responsible for development and humanitarian aid, Louis Michel, has welcomed the positive results achieved at the special consultative meeting of heads of state from the African Great Lakes region, held in Nairobi, on the conflict in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (RDC).
Mr Michel said, "I congratulate the heads of state of the region on the willingness they have shown to bring the conflict to an end through a negotiated settlement in which regional structures are to play a decisive role."
He welcomed the direct involvement of African diplomacy, in particular through the nomination of former presidents Olusegun Obasanjo and Benjamin Mpaka as facilitators and mediators in the conflict. The region has also declared itself willing to play a direct part in finding a solution to the conflict.
The Commissioner confirmed that he was ready to support the international community in rebuilding the eastern part of the RDC.

Budgetary control
EU Court of Auditors 2007 annual report to be presented to plenary
2008-11-13 - 10:47
The President of the European Court of Auditors Vítor Manuel da SILVA CALDEIRA will present its report on how EU funds were spent in 2007 on Thursday 20 November. Although the accounts themselves have been approved without qualification, the same cannot be said of the "transactions underlying the accounts". The Court said that for the 14th year in a row it was not able to issue a "statement of assurance" that the EU money had been spent well and according to the rules in all policy areas. The Court had some good news as well. Expenditure on administration and for economic and financial affairs (enterprise, internal market, etc.) got a clean bill of health, as did the revenue side of the EU budget. There were improvements in internal policies and external actions, though not enough to affect the overall judgement. But the policy areas of agriculture, research, energy and transport, external aid, development and enlargement, education and citizenship were still "affected by material levels of error". The most prone to error were funds to promote economic and social cohesion, where some 11 per cent of the spending was not in line with the rules. In other policy areas the level was between 2 and 5 per cent.
When presenting the report to the Budgetary Control Committee, Court of Auditors President Vítor Manuel Da Silva Caldeira took care to point out that this concerned irregularities such as the omission of a public tendering procedure or the co-financing of VAT. Asked by Jean-Pierry Audy (EPP-ED, FR), who is the rapporteur on the 2007 discharge, about possible fraud and the ratio between fraud and irregularities, Mr Caldeira said that the Court was not a judicial authority and could only notify others, i.e. the EU fraud-fighting office OLAF, when it finds clear indications of possible fraud. This year, the Court had done so nine times. He also stressed that 80 per cent of the EU budget is managed at the final beneficiary level by the Member States.
More on-the-spot checks?
In order to improve the situation, Mr Caldeira advocated more on-the-spot checks, although it should be considered, he added, whether the cost of making such checks would outweigh the benefits. The budgetary authority - Parliament and the Council - should take a political decision on what would be a level of "appropriate tolerable risk". Mr Caldeira also called for a simplification of the regulatory framework.
Committee chair Herbert Bösch (PES, AT) pointed out that 2007 had been a particularly challenging year, as it was the first one under the new financial framework. It will also be the last discharge exercise for the Commission which had set itself the task of obtaining a positive statement of assurance from the Court during its term of office (2004-2009).
The Budgetary Control Committee will now proceed to have a series of hearings of Commissioners. The final vote on the 2007 discharge is scheduled to take place at the April 2009 plenary session.

Budgetary control
Regulation on investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)
2008-11-13 - 10:47
The Committee on Budgetary Control is tabling a report introducing 92 amendments to a Commission proposal, which proposes changes to regulation on investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF). To strengthen the efficiency of the European Anti-Fraud Office and to clarify the legal framework of its mission, the report, drafted by Ingeborg GRÄßLE (EPP-ED, DE), asks the Commission to progress without any further delays on a consolidation of the legal texts on Community administrative investigations.
OLAF staff should work in full independence
The report also proposes that a human resources management be established, which is more adapted to the operational needs of OLAF, so as to ensure that staff can execute the mission of OLAF in full independence.
Similarly, in order to reinforce complete independence, the Director General should be appointed for a term of five years, renewable once. "The Director General shall neither seek nor take instructions from any government or any institution, body, office or agency in the performance of his duties with regard to the opening and carrying out of external and internal investigations or to the drafting of reports following such investigations," the report says.
Member States and EU institutions should report regularly to OLAF
To improve the operational, legal and administrative framework for combating fraud, the Committee on Budgetary Control proposes that the competent authorities of Member States and the European institutions, bodies, offices and agencies should be required to report regularly to OLAF on progress made as regards action taken in response to the final investigation report issued by OLAF.
Freedom of the press to be guaranteed
To make it possible to provide objective information to European taxpayers and in order to guarantee freedom of the press, the report asks that "all EU bodies involved in the investigation respect the principle of protecting journalists' sources in accordance with national legislation". This amendment is made with reference to the "Tillack Affair", in which judicial abuses were committed against a German journalist who had revealed corruption in the operations of an EU agency.
Respect for people's rights
The report mentions the fundamental rights of the persons concerned by investigations, stating that they "should be respected at all times, particularly when providing information. There is a need to clarify the basic principles of OLAF's information policy. Rapporteur Ingeborg GRÄßLE EPP-ED DE Procedure : Codecision (1st reading)

Challenges ahead after 10 years of Economic and Monetary Union
2008-11-13 - 10:47
MEPs are to debate a comprehensive overview of how all aspects of the Economic and Monetary Union could be developed in the years to come. The report from the Economics Committee gives Parliament’s views on the ECB, the Lisbon Strategy, the Stability and Growth Pact, external representation for the eurozone and financial services supervision, among other issues. The committee’s report, drawn up by Pervenche Berès (PES, FR, Chair of the Committee) and Werner Langen (EPP-ED, DE) stresses that euro has helped economic stability, but that more needs to be done to get most from the Economic and Monetary Union, including coordinated economic reforms as set out in the Lisbon Strategy.
They stress the need to need to stick closely to the Stability and Growth Pact, and argue for more budgetary consolidation - but also efficient public spending.
Price stability and inflation targeting
MEPs in the committee say wage moderation should not be seen as the exclusive way to achieve price stability – in fact, real wages should rise in line with productivity levels.
They strongly back the independence of the European Central Bank. When it comes to its definition of price stability, MEPs suggest the ECB should move towards a direct inflation targeting regime, where a point inflation target is supplemented by a range of permitted fluctuations around the target rate – this would be similar to the targets set for the Bank of England in Britain. This should not, say MEPs, preclude focussing on the dynamics of monetary aggregates in order to avoid new asset bubbles.
The committee is calling for the EU to play a leading role in international efforts to reform regulatory system for financial markets.
Euro area enlargement
MEPs in the committee stress the need for equal treatment for euro Member States and those seeking to join. They also insist that joining the euro requires full adherence to all the Maastricht criteria. They argue that the Commission should Commission should undertake intensive information campaign in new MS to prepare citizens for euro.
Governance and international representation of the euro area
The committee says it regrets the lack of progress in improving euro area international representation and that ultimately, the area should have single seat in international financial institutions. In the meantime, the MEPs encourage the idea that common EU positions could be represented by Eurogroup chair, Commission and ECB President in international bodies.
The report identifies a wide range of areas where the economic governance of the euro area could be improved. Among the proposals are the idea that the Eurogroup should have formations consisting of competitiveness, environment, employment and education ministers as well as the current Eurogroup of finance ministers.
MEPs in the committee want to see a world monetary conference for global consultations – and perhaps also a monetary dispute settlement mechanism under the IMF.

MEPs seek improvements in rules on excise duties
2008-11-13 - 10:47
The Economics Committee is generally supportive of Commission plans to update the rules on excise duties, and most of the amendments MEPs in the committee propose aim at clarifying the text. Other amendments set out when can travellers have access to duty free shops, and whether there should there be guidelines for the amount of alcohol and tobacco citizens can take across borders. The full Parliament will now debate and vote on the issue, based on a report by Astrid Lulling (EPP-ED, LU).
Duty free shopping in regional airports
The Commission’s original proposal suggested that air and sea travellers should have access to duty free purchases only when their immediate destination was outside the EU. The Committee says those with a final destination outside the EU can also take advantage of such shopping (so if you are flying from Manchester to Shanghai via Paris, you will still be able to buy, for example, duty free whisky in Manchester, and not have to wait to make your purchase in Paris).
The Commission’s proposal has the effect of abolishing duty free shops on external land borders. The rapporteur had proposed to reinstate them, but the Economics Committee did not support her on this point.
Guidelines on personal tobacco and alcohol imports
Individuals are allowed to buy alcohol and tobacco duty paid in one Member State and transport it to another without paying further duty if it is for your own personal use. The current EU legislation sets out indicative guidelines for what quantities could be considered for personal use.
Some Member States’ tax authorities have on occasion apparently acted to enforce the guidelines as absolute limits – for example, the Commission took action against the United Kingdom on this point. The case did not come to court as the UK amended its practice in the meantime.
To avoid such possible misinterpretation, the Commission is proposing to delete all reference to guideline amounts. The Economics Committee however, feels that this may create more confusion, and says the indicative guidelines should remain.
Regarding fuel duty, MEPs in the committee propose to add a provision that when fuel bought duty-paid in another Member State is transported in “atypical” containers (e.g. not in the tank of a car or a normal spare fuel container), the receiving Member State can choose to impose its own duties.
Clarifications on rules concerning goods in transit
The Economics Committee is also proposing a series of amendments to clarify how the rules apply to goods lost, stolen or destroyed in commercial transit and on issues surrounding the transport of goods with duty suspended: for example between tax warehouses, before the goods are put out for retail sale.
As usual with tax policy, Parliament’s position is only consultative and the final decision is taken by unanimity in the Council.

Raising the ceiling on financial assistance for non-euro Member States
2008-11-13 - 10:47
The Commission proposes raising the ceiling for financial assistance to non-euro area Member States facing balance of payments difficulties from €12 to €25bn. It also wants to be granted the power to decide on further changes to the ceiling without going through a full legislative process. Parliament will vote on Tuesday morning on whether to apply an urgency procedure to this proposal – if it does, it could complete its passage through Parliament during this plenary week. An EU law from 2002 established a facility providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States balances of payments, replacing previous rules from 1969. This facility is provided for in the Treaty (Article 119), whereby the EU can grant mutual assistance to a Member State "in difficulties or seriously threatened with difficulties as regards its balance of payments either as a result of an overall disequilibrium in its balance of payments or as a result of the type of currency at its disposal", provided this Member State does not belong to the euro area.
The 2002 regulation lowed the ceiling on such funding to €12 billion, from €16 billion, as at the time there were only three Member States outside the euro area. Recent events suggest this may not be enough, should several Member States need significant support. The Commission is therefore proposing to raise this ceiling to €25 billion.
Streamlined procedure for future changes?
The Commission also wants, given the possible need for urgent decisions during periods of market turmoil, to avoid the need for full legislation if the ceiling urgently needs to be changed again. It is therefore asking to be granted itself the power to decide a revision of the ceiling, after consulting the Economic and Financial Committee (EFC) of the Council on both the urgency and the new ceiling to introduce.
Parliamentary procedure
The Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee will consider the proposal at its meeting on Monday evening. The full Parliament will then vote on Tuesday morning on whether to apply the urgency procedure (Rule 134). If this is approved the proposal itself will be debated and put to the vote later in the week.
Support under this scheme has recently been proposed for Hungary – for more information see the press release from the Commission via the link below. No such support is available for euro area Member States.

CAP health check: finding the right balance
2008-11-13 - 10:47
Parliament will adopt its position on the Common Agricultural Policy health check just before EU agriculture ministers decide on the final shape of this legislation. In reports tabled to plenary, the Agriculture Committee calls for a smaller cut in farm aid and a limited increase in milk quotas as well as special aid for milk producers and livestock farmers. It also argues that, for certain sensitive sectors, intervention schemes and the link between subsidies and production should be preserved. An additional Agriculture Committee meeting will be held in Strasbourg on Monday 17 November to sift through the high number of amendments proposed to the report.
The four reports, drafted by Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos (PES, PT), strike a balance between the various proposals put forward by MEPs during debates on the health check and also reflect the variety of situations facing farmers in the European Union. These compromises were adopted by comfortable majorities in the Agriculture Committee last month but new amendments cannot be ruled out on certain points, given the sensitive nature of the legislation.
In agriculture policy, the Parliament's opinions currently have only consultative status. If the Lisbon Treaty enters into force, MEPs - who are directly elected by the voters - will have joint decision-making power with the Council of agriculture ministers. However, because of the importance of the CAP health check, which will make the last major changes to this policy area before the negotiations on the EU's next multiannual budget framework (which starts in 2013), the French presidency of the Council has promised to cooperate closely with MEPs, thereby enabling the two institutions to find common ground on most key issues.
MEPs call for smaller shift towards rural development
An important feature of the last CAP reform was a decision to shift part of EU agriculture spending away from direct farm income support towards national rural development programmes, so as to support activities such as rural tourism (a policy known as "modulation"). This decision was linked to the need to comply with WTO rules on farm subsidies.
As part of the health check, the Commission has proposed speeding up the process of switching funds towards rural development. This subject was hotly debated in the EP Agriculture Committee, which in the end adopted a compromise calling for the transfer of funding to proceed more gradually so as not to hit farmers too hard. MEPs want the current 5% transfer rate applicable to farmers receiving more than €5000 in EU subsidy to rise to only 7% by 2013, rather than the 13% proposed by the Commission. MEPs agreed to a higher rate for farms that receive over €100,000 from the EU, but not nearly as high as the rate proposed by the Commission (1 percentage point extra between €100,000 and €199,999 rather than 3 points, 2 points between €200,000 and €299,999 rather than 6, and 3 points beyond €300,000 rather than 9).
In addition, MEPs contend that the extra funding released by the increase in modulation should be used to finance more "challenges" than the four identified by the Commission (climate change, renewable energy, water management and biodiversity) and that this Community money should not have to be co-financed by national budgets as is currently the case for rural development programmes.
MEPs are also calling for the link between certain types of aid and production volumes to be kept for livestock farmers, given the current climate of high feed prices, and for small producers (of fodder, protein and flax etc.).
One amendment adopted by the committee calls for an increase in compulsory modulation to be balanced by a decrease in voluntary modulation so that farmers are not discriminated against because of national government policy. Supplementary modulation on the biggest farms is opposed by some Member States, including the United Kingdom.
Dairy sector: review in 2010
The Commission's proposal to increase Member States' milk quotas by 1% per year until 2013, in order to pave the way for the complete abolition of ceilings in 2015, also exposed differing views within the committee. Dairy farmers in several Member States where sale prices are already low face difficulties, while in other Member States farmers want to increase production to take advantage of new opportunities on world markets. The committee finally opted for an increase in quotas by 1% in 2009 and 2010 but asked the Commission to review the situation in 2010 before making proposals for later years. MEPs also want to allow Member States to increase their quotas temporarily if the quotas of other Member States are under-used. They call for the creation of a milk fund to help restructure the sector.
Support for hard-hit sectors, insurance and market intervention
Other compromises adopted by MEPS would allow Member States to use up to 15% of the Community funding they receive to support hard-hit sectors such as livestock and dairy farming and to contribute to insurance and mutual schemes (Article 68 support), to broaden insurance coverage, notably for all types of climate damage and for major losses caused by animal or plant disease, and to increase Community co-financing of these insurance schemes and mutual funds.
MEPs also adopted a number of amendments calling for the retention of market intervention or management instruments in the grain, meat and dairy sectors. Rapporteur Luis Manuel CAPOULAS SANTOS PSE PT CAP (common rules for direct payments)

Bees and bee-keepers face emergency
2008-11-13 - 10:47
The decline in the number of bees all over the world but especially in Europe poses a threat not just to honey production but to the pollination of plants and hence to food production. In a debate based on an oral question, followed up with a resolution, MEPs will press the Commission to take action. The threat to bees comes partly from the use of modified and treated seed, which has led to a reduction in pollen and nectar, and partly from the reduction in agricultural set-aside land.
Without adequate food sources, bees are vulnerable to parasites, viruses and other diseases. Not only will the usual products of beekeepers, such as honey, be affected but more importantly without bees to pollinate plants it will be impossible to produce the same yields of crops, fruit and vegetables.
In an oral question accompanied by a draft resolution, MEPs will urge the Commission to conduct research into this problem, including how far it is caused by the use of pesticides, and create ecological buffer zones. Financial aid should also be provided for beekeepers in difficulty, says the draft resolution. Neil PARISH EPP-ED UK Oral question - Situation in the bee-keeping sector

CAP further simplified as wine is brought into common market organisation
2008-11-13 - 10:47
The process of simplifying the Common Agricultural Policy will take another step forward when Parliament approves plans to bring the wine regime into the single "common market organisation" regulation. Previously there were twenty-one different market organisation regimes, making the CAP unnecessarily complex. The latest reforms do not change any of the market arrangements but will simplify the regime and make it more transparent.
The report on this subject was drafted for Parliament's Agriculture Committee by its chair, Neil Parish (EPP-ED, UK), who said "We have a long way to go before we truly succeed in making the CAP transparent and simple, but this latest addition of wine follows recent additions of fruit and vegetables, and will certainly contribute to making the whole regime far more transparent for farmers."

More fruit and veg for children at school
2008-11-13 - 10:47
The House will vote on a draft report by the Agriculture Committee which urges an expansion in the EU programme for distributing fruit and vegetables in schools. The aim is to encourage healthier eating habits in children and combat the obesity epidemic. MEPs would like to see more funding for the programme and they also suggest giving priority to local seasonal produce. In the European Union around 22 million children are overweight and more than 5 million are obese, mainly owing to excessive consumption of fatty, sweet or salty food. The World Health Organisation recommends consumption of at least 400g of fruit and vegetables per day for children under the age of 11.
Parliament has already - on 25 September - adopted an own-initiative report on the fight against obesity, in which it called for fruit and vegetables to be stocked in vending machines in schools and for school curricula to include information on balanced diets.
How much funding is needed?
When the fruit and vegetable sector of the CAP was reformed last year, the European Parliament and the Member States called for a programme to be set up for distributing fruit and vegetables in schools to encourage children to eat more healthily.
The European Commission has proposed a budget of €90 million for this programme for the school year 2009-2010. This budget is not enough, argue MEPs: it is equivalent to giving every child aged 6 to 10 one piece of fruit a week for 30 weeks.
The Agriculture Committee's report calls for the Community contribution to be increased to €500 million for the year in question. However, the rapporteur, Niels Busk (ALDE, DK), believes this is unrealistic and intends to table an amendment calling for a figure of €360 million.
Preference for fresh produce, grown in Europe
The draft report also calls for the practical arrangements for the programme to be clarified. MEPs say it should cover only fruit and vegetables produced within the EU and only fresh produce, since processed products have less nutritional value.
The fruit and vegetables should meet the highest quality standards and should preferably be seasonal varieties, grown locally. Priority should be given to sustainable production.
The report also suggests that the programme not be restricted to children at school in the 6-10 age group but should also be available to pre-school children. In addition, MEPs want the fruit to be accompanied by health and dietary advice in an appropriate style for children.

A European "Blue Card" for highly-skilled immigrants
2008-11-13 - 10:47
The EU's "Blue Card" plan to attract highly-skilled immigrants to take jobs in EU economic sectors suffering from skill shortages, modelled on the US "Green Card" system, needs clearer definitions, says the EP Civil Liberties Committee. The committee proposes clarifications, and more flexibility for Member States, whilst urging them not to "steal" brains from third countries and reaffirming the "Community preference" principle. The Blue Card, proposed by the European Commission, is designed to attract highly-qualified workers from third countries by giving them access to the 27 Member States. This card would not replace existing national systems, but would provide an additional channel of attraction, with a common grant procedure.
Most highly-skilled migrants prefer destinations such as the USA, Australia or Canada to the EU, due to the fragmentation of EU labour markets. The "Blue Card" would enable holders who have spent three years in a first EU country of residence to access other Member States thereafter. The card would therefore normally be valid for three years, renewable for a further two years. If a worker's contract is for a shorter duration, then the card should be granted for the duration of the contract plus three months, say MEPs in the committee.
Who should be eligible for a Blue Card?
In a consultation report drafted by Ewa Klamt (EPP-ED, DE) in co-operation with the Employment Committee the Civil Liberties Committee MEPs seek to clarify Blue Card eligibility requirements: an applicant must have found a job in the EU, and have at least five years' experience in the sector concerned or a university qualification recognised by the Member State. The applicant's contract must guarantee an income of at least 1.7 times the average gross salary in the Member State of residence, add MEPs in the committee, who stipulate that this salary must not be lower than that of a comparable worker in the host country.
It must also be possible to grant the card to third country nationals already legally staying in the Union under other regimes, but it should not be granted to asylum applicants or third country nationals admitted to the Union as seasonal workers, as the latter are covered by a specific proposal for a directive, say MEPs in the committee.
Guaranteed access to social protection
The Blue Card will also entitle its holder to family reunification - his or her spouse would also be able to seek a job in the Union - and to social welfare coverage in the Member State concerned. A holder who loses his or her job should have six months to find another, rather than three as proposed by the Commission, say MEPs in the committee.
MEPs reiterate Community preference...
MEPs in the committee consider that Member States should be able to decide how many Blue Cards they wish to grant each year. The card should not be viewed as a "right" for migrants, and may be refused even where they meet the criteria. National authorities must also be able to reject holders of Blue Cards granted by other Member States in favour of a national or Community solution, they say.
... and seek to prevent a "brain drain"
MEPs in the committee also say that Member States should not actively encourage the "brain draining" of third countries through the Blue Card in sectors where these countries suffer from labour shortages, particularly in the areas of health and education. Moreover, Member States should grant the card only to the nationals of third countries with which co-operation agreements on immigration have been established, say MEPs in the committee.`
British and Irish government decided not to opt-in to the Blue Card scheme
In January 2008, the UK decided not to participate in the adoption and application of the Legal Migration Directives including the Blue Card. One of the main reasons for this decision being that it is at odds with the UK's Points Based System and with managing migration on the basis of a national assessment of labour market needs.
The Irish government has also decided not to opt-in to the Blue Card. Rapporteur Ewa KLAMT EPP-ED DE Procedure : Consultation

Civil Liberties Committee: Single application procedure could have been more ambitious
2008-11-13 - 10:47
The directive on a single application procedure and common set of rights for third-country nationals wishing to legally reside and work in the EU could have been "more ambitious", says the EP Civil Liberties Committee, but it does complement the Blue Card directive, the EU plan to model the US "Green Card" system. While the committee generally welcomes the proposal, it regrets that "it was not more ambitious" and that "it does not cover the entry conditions for all third-country nationals wishing to pursue an economic activity in the EU". However, Member States’ reluctance with regard to such a proposal is understandable, it says.
Member States rights not affected
MEPs in the committee consider it important to make clear that "the content of this directive does not affect the Member States’ right to determine the entry conditions nor the number of migrants they wish to admit to their territory". In addition, "the period of validity of the single permit is to be determined by each Member State," says the report drafted by Patrick GAUBERT (EPP-ED, FR).
"The procedure in no way interferes with the Member States’ competence as far as the processing of requests is concerned, only as regards the time limit which needs to be complied with".
The directive complements the EU's Blue Card plan
The single application procedure is meant to complement the EU's Blue Card plan, which seeks to attract skilled workers. Adopting the two simultaneously would therefore avoid a "twin-speed immigration policy", which favours highly-skilled workers and refuses access to those who are less skilled, the report emphasises.
The single procedure
The proposal for a Directive seeks to put in place a single application procedure leading to the issuing of a single residence and work permit. The report claims there are several advantages to this, including simplified administration and less bureaucratic procedures.
The common set of rights
Currently in the EU there are major differences among the Member States regarding the treatment of migrant workers. Equal treatment of third-country nationals in Member States, particularly in areas connected with employment "must be guaranteed", says the committee, and granting these rights "is a minimum requirement".

HIV/AIDS: early diagnosis and early care
2008-11-13 - 10:47
MEPs will hear statements by the Council and Commission on HIV/AIDS: Early Diagnosis and Early Care on Wednesday 19 November, less than one month away from the 20th anniversary of World AIDS day on 1 December 2008. In Europe, the numbers of newly diagnosed infections are increasing throughout the 25 EU Member States, with the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Spain seeing the highest rates of new HIV infections (EuroHIV, 2007). This is in spite of figures released in 2007 by UNAIDS, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, which states that on a global scale the number of people living with HIV has reduced from nearly 40 million in 2006 to around 33 million.
Early Diagnosis and Early Care
The focus of the Council and Commission statements will be on timely diagnosis and treatment for HIV/AIDS. Both HIV infection and AIDS cannot be cured, but they can be treated. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), a combination of three or four drugs which inhibit the production of virus, significantly prolongs the lives of AIDS patients and is generally available. However, resistance to these drugs is a problem (EUPHIX).
In terms of prevention, there is currently no effective vaccine to prevent transmission of HIV. According to EUPHIX, an EU public health information system, several candidate vaccines are in development and tested in clinical trials, but so far results have been disappointing. Most European countries have reduced the rate of HIV transmission in medical settings (through blood screening and universal precautions) and from mother to child (through routine screening, use of preventive drugs, preventive measures during the delivery, and advising mothers who are infected not to breastfeed).
Current EU activities in tackling and preventing HIV/AIDS
The HIV/AIDS epidemic has been an important focus of concern and action of the European Union's public health activities since the late 1980's. The EU funds research projects, has established networks to facilitate cooperation and the exchange of information between the Member States, Candidate and EEA countries (Lichtenstein, Iceland and Norway), and has taken action to address specific challenges facing vulnerable groups such as migrants, drug users or sex workers (Health-EU).
The EU has also been active in developing countries and at global level, providing 55 percent of the funding for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (GFATM). However, in light of the latest wave of the HIV epidemic, measures and action already being taken will have to be reinforced. Council and Commission statements

Economic and social impact of demographic tendencies in the EU
2008-11-13 - 10:47
MEPs will hear statements from the Commission and Council on the economic and social impact of demographic tendencies in the EU on Wednesday 19 November. With profound changes in Europe's population structure, demographic change is high on the European policy agenda. Eurostat, the Commission statistical agency, expects the EU population, standing at 495 million on 1 January, 2008, to rise to 521 million in 2035. The UK population is predicted to become the largest in the EU, reaching 77 million by 2060. France and Germany will come second and third with populations reaching 72 million and 71 million respectively by the same year . However, countries facing the largest population increases are Cyprus (+66%), the Irish Republic (+53%), and Luxembourg (+52%).
Challenges related to demographic change
Problems facing the EU include an ageing population, low fertility rates, and high unemployment levels, according to a 2007 report by the Commission entitled Europe’s demographic future: facts and figures on challenges and opportunities . "Demographic change will gradually limit the scope for future employment growth," the report said .
Similarly, Eurostat figures for 2008 to 2060 point to a projected decrease in the number of births, and an increase in those aged between 65 and 80 (from 17.1% to 30%). The agency also predicts that there will be almost three times as many people aged 80 and more in 2060 (4.4% in 2008 to 12.1% in 2060).
European Parliament calls for action
In 2004, the European Parliament requested that the Commission carry out a "preparatory action to encourage account to be taken of demographic change in European and national policies". On this basis, the Commission commissioned five studies from 2005 to 2006 to examine how current and projected demographic trends are affecting society and to promote pro-active policy responses in a wide range of areas.

European Union Solidarity Fund: obstacles for its reform - questions to the Commission
2008-11-13 - 10:47
The Commission proposal modifying Council Regulation on the European Union Solidarity Fund has been kept on hold by the Council for more than two years since the European Parliament gave it its first reading. Parliament considers it to be of paramount importance to have a Solidarity Fund Regulation which meets the challenges and allows the Union to deliver prompt and effective assistance when Member States suffer a disaster. Gerardo GALEOTE (EPP-ED, ES), on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, will be asking the Commission the following questions on the European Union Solidarity Fund and obstacles for its reform:
Could the European Commission explain to Parliament what are the causes of Council’s inability to reach a Common Position?
Which Member States are in favour of Parliament’s and the European Commission’s approach and which are reluctant to agree to the reform of the Solidarity Fund and on what grounds?
Does the European Commission foresee any action or political initiative in the future which will successfully unblock the situation?
Michel Barnier’s report ‘For a European civil protection force: Europe Aid’ was published back in 2006 and received the full support of Parliament in so far as it proposed the creation of a European civil protection force. This proposal is intimately related to the revision of the Solidarity Fund but as yet we have seen no follow-up.
Does the European Commission envisage any legislative initiative in this field? Gerardo GALEOTE EPP-ED ES Oral question European Union Solidarity Fund: obstacles for its reform Procedure : Oral question

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Recommendations to reduce the pay gap between men and women
2008-11-13 - 10:47
Edit BAUER (EPP-ED, SL) will be tabling an own-initiative report on equal pay for men and women. The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality recommends a revision of existing legislation on equal pay to bring about a "significant reduction in the pay gap" between men and women. Women earn on average 15% less than men in the European Union and up to 25% less in the private sector. Thirty years of legislation has not reduced pay gap
The report states that in spite of the significant body of work of legislation in force for more than thirty years, actions taken and resources spent, the gender pay still exists and progress has been "extremely slow". The gender pay gap varies between 4% and more than 25% in Member States and this gap does not show a significant narrowing trend.
Reducing the pay gap was one of the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs, but it has not been sufficiently addressed by most Member States, the report says.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality calls on the Commission to submit "an analysis" of EU or national legal acts to find "an appropriate means of bringing about a significant reduction in the pay gap", stressing that "better and earlier implementation" of the provisions of the Directive 2006/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 July 2006 is "essential".
European Equal Pay Day
MEPs in the committee also call for EU Institutions to organise a European Equal Pay Day to mark the day on which women in Europe have earned (on average) the pay which men earn (on average) in a year. This is to raise awareness of the existing wage gap and encourage all those involved to take additional initiatives to eliminate this gap. Rapporteur Edit BAUER EPP-ED SK Procedure : own-initiative

How to bring space down to earth, ask MEPs
2008-11-13 - 10:47
The EU and its Member States have been involved in financing and developing space technology and science for over 30 years. The adoption of the EC-ESA Framework Agreement in November 2003 gradually led to a European Space Policy (ESP). The resolution of the ‘Space Council’ on 22 May 2007 confirmed its commitment. The draft Lisbon Treaty and its Article 189 of the TFEU provide the EU with a legal framework for translating Council resolutions into policy initiatives. Pierre PRIBETICH (PSE, FR), on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy will be asking the Council and Commission the following questions on European Space Policy: How to bring space down to earth. The House will also vote on a resolution on this topic.
1. Given the fact that the European space market is growing at 7% per annum, could the President of the Council assure the EP of the policy initiatives that it will undertake to enhance the contribution of space to the Lisbon Strategy, namely, to R&D and the competitiveness of the European industry, based on Europe's technology-based aerospace industry that supplies a significant part of the world’s commercial requirements for satellite manufacture, launch and services?
2. Has the Presidency of the Council arrived at policy options for two priority areas:
a. Galileo and Egnos: namely on cooperation with international partners on the issues of compatibility and interoperability of the system and applications, and on how to make the best use of R&D for satellite navigation systems, telecommunication satellite networks, services and applications?
b. Kopernikus initiative: namely on the use of Member States’ earth observation infrastructures, their funding, legal framework and data policy, and information policy, on the assumption that it is a public good?
3. Given that space systems are strategic assets that guarantee EU independence, what model of Governance will the Council envisage for an ESP in three areas: a) Space and Security, b) Space Exploration, including human presence and c) Space and Climate Change?
4. Does the Presidency of the Council intend to investigate and support sub-orbital flight, which is currently under commercial development, as the USA has already proposed rules for this activity and spaceports are beginning to be targeted for use?

Convention on cluster munitions - questions to the Council
2008-11-13 - 10:47
In Dublin, at the end of the international meeting of States held on 19-30 May 2008, 107 States adopted the Convention on Cluster munitions, which bans the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of this class of weaponry. The Convention will be opened for signature on 3 December 2008, in Oslo. It will enter into force six months after 30 States have deposited their instruments of ratification with the UN Secretary General. The recent use of this type of weapon during the Georgia crisis demonstrates once more the urgent need to establish this Convention.

Minimum criteria for environmental inspection in the Member States - questions to the Commission
2008-11-13 - 10:47
Miroslav OUZKÝ (EPP-ED, CZ), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, will be asking the Commission questions on the review of Recommendation 2001/331/EC providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections in the Member States. On 14 November the Commission published a Communication (COM(2007)0707) on the review of Recommendation 2001/331/EC providing minimum criteria for environmental inspections in the Member States. The Communication recorded inter alia that:
– the information submitted by the Member States on how they were implementing the Recommendation was 'incomplete or difficult to compare';
– there are still large disparities in the way environmental inspections are being carried out by national, regional and local authorities in the EU;
– the scope of the Recommendation is inadequate and does not include many important activities, such as Natura 2000, and the control of illegal waste shipments;
– inspection plans in many instances have not been implemented and, where they do exist, are often not publicly available.
Good and even enforcement of EU environmental law is essential. Anything less disappoints public expectations and undermines the reputation of the EU as an effective guardian of the environment.
Can the Commission therefore explain:
1. Why does it wish only to amend the Recommendation and why does it not propose to take up the reference in the Recommendation to the possibility of it submitting a proposal for a directive on environmental inspections?
2. Why has it opted instead for a piecemeal approach, and proposes to attach environmental inspection requirements to existing directives individually – a process that is bound to take time?
3. Why is it not prepared to use a directive to define terms such as 'inspection' and 'audit', which it admits are 'interpreted in different ways by Member States' when set out in a Recommendation?
4. Why it is not prepared to transform IMPEL into an effective EU environmental inspection force with the right to demand the cooperation of Member State authorities, since ultimately it is only through the creation of such a force that the Commission will free itself from reliance on those it is trying to control?

Energy
Carbon capture and storage technology needs prompt and direct financial commitment
2008-11-13 - 10:47
Christian EHLER (EPP-ED, GER) is tabling an own-initiative report, supporting early demonstration of sustainable power generation from fossil fuels, but warns that the measures unveiled by the Commission are "not sufficient to provide the desired incentives". The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy calls for a direct financial commitment to ensure that 12 demonstration projects testing the permanent underground storage of CO2 are constructed by 2015. "The time delay between the potential support from emissions trading from 2013, and the necessary planning and construction phase of demonstration facilities, can be overcome by making financial resources available."
Support for financing via EU Emission Trading System from 2013
Funding for the new carbon capture and storage technology (CCS) could be supplemented by providing allowances to operators of CCS technology from the EU's Emission Trading System, the report says. "Incentives for CCS technology production should be increased, by allocating, within the EU ETS, allowances for anticipated CCS technology production with an increase of at least 25 % from 2013."
Similarly, it supports the proposal made by the Environment Committee to award up to 500 million trading allowances to large-scale commercial demonstration projects in the EU.
Additional funding from the Seventh Research Framework Programme
MEPs propose to use the EUR 500 million of the Risk Sharing Finance Facility (RSFF) which was held back until the mid-term review of the Seventh Research Framework Programme. According to the rapporteur, this amount could be supplemented with other funds in cooperation with the European Investment Bank.
Selection criteria for projects
When it comes to selecting storage sites, "binding and strict criteria should be set for long-term safety", says the Industry Committee. It cites the example of "storage under the seabed, which can, in the event of an accident, endanger marine ecosystems". This could have implications for the UK, which would have the option of storing large quantities of CO² under the North Sea.
The report also strongly recommends that the 12 demonstration projects have a minimum output of 180 Mega Watts, and that the facilities be sited over a maximum geographical spread across the EU.

Ombudsman
Languages used by the Council Presidencies - Support for German
2008-11-13 - 10:47
The report endorses the conclusions of the Ombudsman on the complaint by an association for the defence of the German language who asked the Dutch and the Luxembourg governments to offer the websites of their respective Presidencies not only in English and French but also in German. The report calls upon the Council to examine the question of the language options of the website of its Presidencies, in order to ensure that the entire population of the EU has easy access to information. Context
In 2004, the petitioner, an association for the defence of the German language, wrote to the Dutch and the Luxembourg governments to ask them to offer the internet presentations they were to provide when holding the Presidency not only in English and French but also in German.
Both the Dutch and the Luxembourg governments rejected the complainant's request. On 22 January 2005, the complainant wrote to the Council and, in its reply of 4 March 2005, the Council pointed out that the Member State holding the Presidency was solely responsible for the information published on its website.
The Ombudsman was not satisfied with the Council reply, and, therefore, made a proposal for a friendly solution inviting the Council to consider the complainant's request that the Presidencies' websites should be made available in German. The Ombudsman argues that these websites do not only complement the Council's website, but go far beyond the contents of the latter.
Key points of the report
The report endorses the conclusions of the Ombudsman, namely that the Council, like every EU institution, is, in the first instance, itself responsible for the websites of its presidency and the languages used thereon.
The Petitions Committee also underlines that the information on these websites should, ideally, be made available in good time in all official languages of the Community. Although, if the number of languages is to be limited, the choice of the languages used must be based on criteria of objectivity, reasonableness, transparency and manageability.
The Council’s refusal to address the substance of the complainant’s request constitutes an instance of maladministration.
MEPs in the committee are astonished to note that the Council does not consider itself empowered to address this question, even though it is one which affects all Member States and the Council could make recommendations to all future presidencies.
The Committee regrets that the Council has avoided addressing the question of the language options of the websites of its presidencies and invites this institution to conduct a "comprehensive review" of the question. The aim is to ensure that the entire population of the European Union has easy and direct access to information on its activities. The Council should also inform Parliament of the results of its deliberations.
French Presidency doing a good job
The text welcomes the fact that, in contrast to the practice of past presidencies, whereby websites were only available in English, French and the language of the incumbent presidency, the French Council Presidency publishes its official website in the most widely spoken languages of the European Union (English, German, French, Italian and Spanish). MEPs urge all future Council presidencies to use in their websites the most widely spoken official languages according to an order of priority.

Employment policy
The future of social security systems
2008-11-13 - 10:47
The increasing ageing population will affect social security systems. In this own-initiative report, MEPs in the Employment Committee express their preoccupation with maintaining the core of European social models. Encouraging higher employment rates are among the recommendations of the report. Key points
Social security systems under pressure : The ageing population is expected to lead to increases in public spending, most of it for pensions, health care and long-term care, in most Member States by 2050 if current policies are pursued. It will also put serious pressure on the active work force, stated the report by Gabriele Stauner (EPP-ED, DE).
MEPs in the committee recall that the core of European social models is the principle of solidarity between generations and that it is primarily financed by work-related earnings.
The trend towards individualisation could also enable people, especially women and other vulnerable groups, to have more freedom of choices and be able to build up their own, additional pension rights, stresses the report.
New ways of taxation and/or other alternatives could be also be considered to improve the financial sustainability of social pending.
- Higher employment rates: A decreasing work force will lead to a decrease in the total number of hours worked. In order to reverse this trend, measures could be taken to reduce the unemployment rate and increase recruitment by combining training and retraining.
Higher employment rates are heavily dependent on the necessity to keep all groups active. That is why MEPs in the committee stress the need to fight discrimination on the labour market.
They also call on the Member States to create financial and social incentives in order to encourage employees voluntarily to continue to work even after reaching the statutory age limit.
Pensions
Public pension systems strengthen social solidarity and are the responsibility of Member States and safeguarding these systems should be a political priority, MEPs say. They believe that a greater use of alternatives to state-funded pensions, such as supplementary schemes, could also be a viable alternative and that pension systems need to adapt to "patchwork biographies" becoming increasingly common.
Healthcare
It is important to preserve the values and principles underpinning all health care systems of the European Union, which comprise universal coverage, solidarity in financing, equity of access and the provision of high quality health care, MEPs in the committee insist. By improving the organisation and provision of services in accordance with the principles of subsidiarity, a potential exists for both better quality and financial efficiency of health services, they underline.

Protecting the consumer: improving consumer education and awareness on credit and finance
2008-11-13 - 10:47
MEPs will hear an own-initiative report drafted by Iliana IOTOVA (PES, BG) on protecting the consumer: improving consumer education and awareness on credit and finance. Overall, the report welcomes the Commission initiatives to educate consumers on finance and credit because "empowered and educated consumers help to foster competition, quality and innovation within the banking and financial services industries". The recently set up Expert Group on Financial Education and the proposed online database of financial education schemes and research in the EU are particularly welcome, it says.
Finance education in schools
The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection calls on the Commission to develop educational programmes relating to personal finance, which can be adapted to the specific needs of each Member State, and encourages Member States to include financial education in primary and secondary schools.
Training programmes should also be set up in Member States for social workers who deal with persons at risk of poverty or excessive debt, the report says.
Quality information over quantity
The rapporteur states that "effective, clear and comprehensible information, particularly in advertisements for financial products, is necessary". "Financial institutions should provide sufficient information before contracts are concluded and should strictly apply the rules laid down in Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on markets in financial instruments (Mifid) and Directive 2008/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2008 on credit agreements for consumers."
However, the report acknowledges that "overloading" the consumer with information would be counterproductive, stressing the need for "quality over quantity".

Consumers
Increase awareness of Consumer Market Scoreboard, says Internal Market Committee
2008-11-13 - 10:47
When consumers have the right information, education and conditions, they can make good and well-founded choices. As such, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection calls for increasing awareness of the Commission's Consumer Markets Scoreboard, a tool for identifying and analysing problems from the point of view of the consumer, and stepping up media coverage. Five indicators used to identify problems are "useful"
The own-initiative report drafted by Anna HEDH (PES, SE) states that while it is impossible to monitor all aspects of the single market, which has close to 500 million consumers, it is important to use analytical resources where they are most needed. The indicators used in the scoreboard to identify problems relate to complaints, price levels, satisfaction, switching and safety. "These five indicators are relevant and useful," the report says.
Price indicators are important for consumers
Some stakeholders have raised questions on the use of price indicators, since prices are "influenced by so many factors". The report argues that prices are important for consumers and price indicators are easy to communicate. "While most market failures, directly or indirectly, will have an effect on the consumer price the price level indicator combined with other indicators related to the effective functioning of the market will most likely provide valid results."
Increased awareness
To raise awareness of the scoreboard, the committee stresses the importance of disseminating the information in "an easily accessible language", making the scoreboard visible on relevant websites, and stepping up media coverage.
Consumer Markets Scoreboard to be kept separate from the Internal Market Scoreboard
Since 1997, the Commission has been using the Internal Market Scoreboard to monitor and highlight the Member States implementation of internal market legislation. MEPs recognise the importance of this tool, which encourages Member States in taking their part in the common and continuous effort to develop the single market, but state that "it is not likely to build trust from the ordinary consumer" because it doesn't "communicate the Internal Market to the consumer". In view of this, Consumer Markets Scoreboard should "complement" the Internal Market Scoreboard, but should be kept separate.
