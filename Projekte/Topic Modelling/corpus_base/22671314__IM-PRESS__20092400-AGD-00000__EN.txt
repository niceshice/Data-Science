Election Results
Election results. The week will see the completion of elections counts for the 2009 European Parliament elections and the announcement of official results. Several press conferences are planned on Monday by MEPs from the 2004-2009 Parliament to give their reactions to the election results.
The next few weeks mark the transition between the sixth and seventh directly elected European Parliaments, as the political groups reorganise themselves in the light of the election results and the new rules for forming groups - at least 25 MEPs from at least 7 countries - and as newly elected MEPs begin meetings with their new colleagues. In formal terms, the previous Parliament continues to exist until 13 July, with the newly elected Parliament coming into existence at its inaugural session on 14 July in Strasbourg.
