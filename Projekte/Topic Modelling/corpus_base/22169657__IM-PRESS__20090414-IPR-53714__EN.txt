An opinion poll on interest in the 4-7 June European elections and on EU policy issues reports that 34% of possible voters surveyed across the EU say they are already certain that they will go and vote in June, while 19% of respondents said they were already certain that they would not vote.
The poll, which was taken from mid-January to mid-February, does not predict the final turnout at the June elections; it provides instead a sliding scale between those who, at the time of the poll, definitely intended to go and vote and those who definitely intended to stay at home.
Late in March, the European Parliament unveiled its institutional campaign to raise awareness of the elections. Concerned at the steady decline in turnout over the years and polls reporting that respondents felt they lack information, the European Parliament devised an eye-catching campaign which focuses on specific policy options available. It is hoped that as the different parts of the campaign become visible from April in all EU countries, interest in and knowledge of the elections will rise. Also, in the weeks leading up to the elections, the political debate will heat up. More solid indications of voters' intentions are expected in those weeks.
On policy issues, respondents expressed greatest concern about the economy: the topic which preoccupied them most was unemployment (57%), closely followed by economic growth. Other major concerns were inflation and purchasing power, and pension security. The first non-economic subject on the list of respondentsâ€™ stated interests was crime (29%) followed by the security of energy supply (27%) and climate change (26%).
