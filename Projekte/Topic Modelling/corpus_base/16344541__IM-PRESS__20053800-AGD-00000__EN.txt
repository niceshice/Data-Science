Thirty years after the end of the war in Vietnam, which also had terrible consequences for Laos and Cambodia, the human rights situation in all three countries remains a matter of profound concern to the European Parliament.
The three countries have problems guaranteeing basic human rights, including the right to life, freedom from torture, free expression and freedom of opinion, as well as the right to cultural and religious self determination. The EP subcommittee has invited prominent human rights defenders from these countries in order to hear about their experiences and listen to their recommendations for EU human rights policy towards the region.

Politicians and experts will debate "blogging", the Internet as a tool for political campaigning, and the Internet as a tool of government information on Monday afternoon, Tuesday morning and Tuesday afternoon respectively. In between, on Tuesday morning at 10am, European Parliament President Josep Borrell will present the new EP website to journalists. Afterwards, there will be the opportunity to take a closer look at the site, while enjoying coffee and croissants. The debates can be followed on the Internet, of course, but it may be useful to come to the Parliament building in person, as there will be a number of support products for the website available on Tuesday, such as a CD ROM, a USB key and black-and-white T-shirts carrying our European "political geek" slogans! 09:00 19:00 2005-09-13 The President's diary New website Launch of the European Parliament's new website 10:00 12:00 Yehudi Menuhin room (PHS building, 1st floor, Open space) Brussels Press conferences Parliamentary Assembly at the UN
