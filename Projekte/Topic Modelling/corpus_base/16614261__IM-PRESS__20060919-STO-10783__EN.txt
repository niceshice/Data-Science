Pres. Borrell sees the damage for himself in Beirut
Josep Borrell, President of the European Parliament, used a two day visit to Lebanon to stress Parliament's support for a "sustainable peace" in the region. He held talks with Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, acting Foreign Minister Tarek Mitri and leading MPs during his visit. He also toured areas of Beirut damaged during the recent conflict with Israel. Before leaving, he formally invited Mr Siniora to Strasbourg on 27 September to meet MEPs and leaders of Parliament's political groups.
Mr Borrell said that the invitation showed the "steadfast commitment" of the Parliament towards "galvanising the EU's actions" in Lebanon. He went on to say that "Europe has a duty to maintain a vision for Lebanon's future".
The 14-15 September visit coincided with the arrival of some 500 troops from Spain as part of the EU's contribution to United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). This takes the force to around 4,600 with more from other European countries set to arrive. The force will help with the implementation of Resolution 1701, passed unanimously by the UN Security Council aimed at ending the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. It calls for the Lebanese army to deploy to the south of the country and for an "immediate withdrawal" of Israeli forces from Lebanon.
Pledging support for the UN operation, President Borrell said the objectives of the European military presence were "to collaborate with the Lebanese army...and guarantee the full sovereignty of Lebanese institutions throughout Lebanese territory".
The visit was timely as just two weeks ago at the opening of the September plenary session Mr Borrell reminded MEPs that Parliament was the first EU Institution during the war to call for an immediate ceasefire. That statement on 20 July also stressed the need for a strong European participation in UNIFIL.
This was backed up by a parliamentary resolution of 7 September calling for a comprehensive settlement in the region and stating that there is no "military solution" to the problems of the Middle East. The resolution also demanded rapid aid to the Lebanese government to help with reconstruction efforts. Thus far the EU has contributed â‚¬107 million in aid - not including individual donations by member states. The aid could go someway towards the massive reconstruction effort required after the conflict.
