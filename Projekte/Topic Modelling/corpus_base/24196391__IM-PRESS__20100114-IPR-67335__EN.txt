2010-01-18 - 21:24
Members of the industry, research and energy committee questioned the Italian Commissioner-designate for Industry and Entrepreneurship, Antonio Tajani, on concrete measures for supporting European enterprises, particularly in the automotive sector, to boost economic growth and improve competitiveness. MEPs were also interested in a possible revision of the REACH legislation and cutting the red tape burdening businesses.
During the three-hour hearing on Monday, Mr Tajani outlined his plans for a new industrial policy, which should be focused on small and medium enterprises (SMEs), together with promoting innovation hand in hand with sustainable development. The Commissioner designate advocated the idea of the "green economy in a marriage of convenience with industrial policy to fight climate change". He was also keen on innovation, standardisation as a way to cut costs, and horizontal coordination in European efforts to prevent the economic crisis evolving into a social one.
A new industrial policy, based on knowledge and innovation
Patrzia Toia (S&D, IT) wanted more details on the horizontal approach for European industry. Mr Tajani explained that there is no way back to the practices of past decades. The new approach should be in line with the EU 2020 strategy directed towards a green, low-carbon economy; it should enhance growth, knowledge and innovation, improving European international competitiveness. The Commissioner-designate also saw horizontal communication as a key, focussed on more cooperation, especially in research.
Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL, PT) was curious about ways of avoiding the negative consequences of deindustrialisation. Mr Tajani expressed his conviction that the EU should use the instruments already at its disposal, but also encourage young people to become entrepreneurs, allocate more resources to creating jobs in tourism and promoting the innovative elements of the textile
sector.
The Automotive sector: part of Europe’s quality orientated manufacturing
Replying to Werner Langen (EPP, DE) and Bernd Lange (S&D, DE) on the strategy for the car manufacturing sector, Mr Tajani replied that it will evolve with new standards on CO2 emissions, but the industry will also have to adapt in the light of new ways for manufacturing electric, hybrid and hydrogen vehicles. He also mentioned a possibility of developing standard batteries and infrastructure for electric cars. He concluded saying that although the automotive sector will continue to be essential in Europe, cars will change, becoming greener, safer and better.
Tackling REACH and additional regulation in the pharmaceuticals sector
Amalia Sartori (EPP, IT) was interested in progress in implementing the REACH legislative package, which is approaching the final phase. Mr Tajani recognised that there are some problems with translating the complex text and ruled out an early revision since the review is still ongoing and is due to be concluded in 2012.
Replying to Françoise Grossetête (EPP, FR) on innovation in pharmaceuticals, the Commissioner-designate pledged to push through legislation on transparency and create a task force to look into the social responsibility of pharmaceutical manufacturers.
Better access to funds with less bureaucratic burden for SMEs
Several MEPs, including Aldo Patriciello (EPP, IT), Jan Březina (EPP, CZ) and Zoltán Balczó (NI, HU) asked Mr Tajani about his commitment to help SMEs to steer out of the crisis. The Commissioner-designate pledged that he will meet the president of the European Investment Bank in the very near future in order to discuss financing and guarantees, and declared that the access to funds for those enterprises remains his top short-term priority. Funds should also enable SMEs to restart as green businesses.
Giles Chichester (ECR, UK) wanted less red tape hindering enterprises in their development and Mr Tajani promised that legislative proposals will also have an SMEs impact assessment built into them.
Quality - European advantage when competing with quantity
Henri Weber (S&D, FR) and Niki Tzavela (EFD, GR) asked Mr Tajani to elaborate on ways to improve European competitiveness when challenged by mass production from Asia where the same environmental and social standards are not respected. The Commissioner-designate said that he was certain that the solution lies in a green economy and better quality: "We should strengthen our advantages, find production niches, develop new models and reach a level-playing field with China through mutual agreements." Mr Tajani was also confident that climate change can be good opportunity for innovation, as can be testified in the case of the car industry.
