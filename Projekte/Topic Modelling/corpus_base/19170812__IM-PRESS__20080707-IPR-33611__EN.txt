In response to the Commission's 2009 Preliminary Draft Budget, MEPs call for finances to be available for the EU to respond to new financial needs, for the budget to include a proper reflection of the climate change priority and for the budget to be easier for EU citizens to understand.
The report, adopted by 570 votes in favour to 49 against and 72 abstentions, is the first assessment by the European Parliament of the Commission's Preliminary Draft Budget (PDB) for 2009 and gives a provisional mandate to Parliament's negotiations with the Council in the July conciliation.
Payment appropriations and flexibility
In the report MEPs point out that at EUR 116 796 million, the level of payment appropriations is "extremely low" compared to the commitment appropriations adopted in the 2007 and 2008 budgets (totalling EUR 126 500 million and EUR 129 100 million respectively).
The report notes that the 2007-2013 financial perspective doesn't allot the EU to respond to new political needs flexibly and "the Union's capacity to react to policy changes in budgetary terms is extremely limited".
MEPs also note that they cannot always see a clear correlation between the Commission's political priorities and the PDB, and are "still not satisfied with the attempts of the Commission to include Parliament's priorities in the PDB".
Clarity, consistency and transparency
The report stresses "the importance of clarity, consistency and transparency in the presentation of the EU budget, which is an absolute necessity also with regard to the need to communicate to European citizens how EU money is spent".
Changes with the PDB headings
With heading 1a, the report deplores the limited margin available and recommends additional funding if "new priorities are to be set".
With heading 1b, the report "deplores the sharp decrease in payments which, when compared to 2008, fall by 13.9%" and MEPs state the EU must be able to deal with "current and future challenges to the solidarity principle".
With heading 2, the report welcomes the increase of expenditure for LIFE + (the new Financial Instrument for the Environment), but "considers that the horizontal budgetary priority of combating climate change is not properly reflected in these figures".
With heading 3a, MEPs say they are concerned about the poor funding for "fundamental rights and justice" activities, which has decreased by 10% in payments compared to the 2008 budget.
With heading 3b, MEPs consider that the funding of "vital policies with a direct impact on the every day life of citizens" is not sufficient and that the possibility to finance pilot projects and preparatory actions (which is important for the European Parliament) is very limited.
With heading 4, MEPs call for clarification as to its total needs, including the Common Foreign and Security Policy, and considers that the Commission's budgetary approach is "vague" and "rather arbitrary". The report is concerned by the under-financing of this heading, particularly with regards to Kosovo, Palestine, the Middle East, food aid and macro-financial assistance. The report also "repeats its conviction that neither Flexibility Instrument nor Emergency Aid Reserve must be diverted or misused to finance long-planned policies and activities of the EU".
The first reading resolution of the 2009 PDB will be voted on in October 2008.
