Debate on freedom of information in Italy
Freedom of information in Italy will be the subject of a debate between MEPs and the Commission. A vote on this issue is due take place at the next plenary session in Strasbourg (19-22 October).
A special committee on the financial and economic crisis
MEPs will look at the impact of the financial crisis and set up a new body to assess measures taken by the EU and its Member States. The decision to create a special new 45-member committee will be put to the vote on Thursday (8 October) and the committee will have to complete its work within one year.
Should passengers get money back when airline goes bankrupt?
Passengers who have booked flights with airlines that go bankrupt should get compensation, MEPs will argue this week. In a debate on Wednesday, Parliament will ask the Commission to revise existing legislation or come up with new laws to ensure passengers are protected, including the possibility of establishing "a reserve compensation fund" financed by airline operators.
Resolution on the G-20 summit in Pittsburgh
Parliament will deliver its verdict on the outcome of the G-20 summit held on 24 and 25 September in Pittsburgh. The EU's common stance on the financial crisis has already been debated by Parliament, at the previous plenary session in Strasbourg. In that debate, MEPs urged the EU to adopt a firm position on the supervision of financial markets. Vote on the conclusions of the summit will take place on Thursday (8 October).
Financial crisis: MEPs demand more help for poorest countries
In response to the global economic crisis, Parliament will vote on a resolution calling for reform of international financial institutions and other measures.
MEPs to evaluate the Statute for European Companies
What is the state of play regarding the Statute for a European Company, which was supposed to make it easier for businesses to operate in more than one EU country?
Cross-border criminal cases: more rights for defendants
People charged in cross-border criminal cases must not be tried twice for the same crime in two different Member States, believe MEPs. Parliament is expected to back a Council proposal aimed at integrating this principle into EU law, but may also adopt amendments to ensure that people in this situation also have the right to appeal, a right to make representations as to the best placed jurisdiction and get translation and legal aid, wherever they are finally tried. The judicial authorities would be required to exchange a specified minimum set of information in cross-border cases. 20090929BRI61393 Agenda - 7-8 October 2009 EuroparlTV

MEPs to debate result of Irish referendum on Lisbon Treaty
2009-10-05 - 16:30
The outcome of the Lisbon Treaty referendum in Ireland on 2 October will be discussed by the European Parliament's political groups on Wednesday afternoon with Commission President José Manuel Barroso and, for the Council, Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt. Irish voters approved the Treaty with 67.1% of votes in favour and 32.9% against. The turnout was 59%, which was 6% more than in the vote in 2008.
Ireland's approval was needed in the ratification process of the Lisbon Treaty, which is still pending in Poland and the Czech Republic. The implementation of this new treaty would give Parliament more legislative powers in areas such as immigration and criminal law. MEPs would also have a full say on the EU budget and on agriculture, and play a bigger role in the appointment of the Commission President and the EU's foreign policy representative.

MEPs will look at the impact of the financial crisis and set up a new body to assess measures taken by the EU and its Member States. The decision to create a special new 45-member committee will be put to the vote on Thursday and the committee will have to complete its work within one year.
The EP's current standing committees for financial, economic and social affairs will preserve all their current powers. The special committee's prime task will be to assess the situation, the measures taken by the EU and the Member States to deal with the crisis and also the cost of inaction.
The committee's findings will be presented in two reports, half-way through and at the end of its mandate. The committee will also hold hearings with both sides of industry, experts and representatives of governments and national parliaments. In addition, it will be able to take part in the legislative work of standing committees by contributing opinions.

In a debate on Wednesday, Parliament will ask the Commission to revise existing legislation or come up with new laws to ensure passengers are protected, including the possibility of establishing "a reserve compensation fund" financed by airline operators.
A total of 77 airlines have filed for bankruptcy in the European Union since 2000. This summer, Sky Europe was the latest, leaving many of its customers with no compensation for tickets purchased.

Financial crisis: MEPs demand more help for poorest countries
2009-10-05 - 16:30
In response to the global economic crisis, Parliament will vote on a resolution calling for reform of international financial institutions and other measures. The current crisis is turning into a human and development crisis, pushing a further 90 million people into extreme poverty in 2009 alone, warn MEPs in a resolution to be put to the vote on Thursday. Funding promised by the international community will be neither sufficient nor rapid enough to make the necessary difference for developing countries, says the draft text. It calls for a reform of the international financial institutions, more innovative funding and better regulation at global level to prevent a further financial crisis.
As of July 2009, 82% of the newly loaned resources of the IMF have gone to European area countries, and just 1,6% have gone to countries in Africa, which is an indication that most of the available resources might be devoted to high-income emerging markets and middle-income countries that are likely to be able to repay the loans they receive.

Statute for European Companies under scrutiny
2009-10-05 - 16:30
What is the state of play regarding the Statute for a European Company, which was supposed to make it easier for businesses to operate in more than one EU country? Five years after the entry into force of the Statute for a European Company (SE), allowing for example companies located in different Member States to merge without having to deal with 27 different legal systems, MEPs will ask the Commission to review the implementation of the Statute. Among other things, they will query whether it is appropriate to allow an SE’s head office and registered office to be located in different Member States.
The regulation on the Statute for a European Company was approved in 2001 (although it only entered into force in 2004) and contains rules for European Public Companies known as a Societas Europaea (SE).
An SE can be registered in any Member State and the registration can be easily transferred to another EU country. However, there is so far no EU-wide register of SEs (an SE is registered on the national register of the Member State in which it has its head office). As of September 2007, more than 60 registrations have been reported.
