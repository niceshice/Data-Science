Hans-Gert Pöttering pays tribute to the Mumbai victims of terrorism EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering expressed his indignation at the "co-ordinated series of terrorist attacks" in Mumbai, and extended his sympathy to the family of victims who had lost their lives and those who were seriously injured through these crimes "that cannot be accepted".
According to the Indian Ministry of Interior, the attack caused the death of 190 people, 22 of whom were foreign citizens, and left over 200 people injured and many in a critical situation.
Hans-Gert Pöttering said, "Today we are all Indians. Terrorism is a direct attack on freedom, human rights and democracy. Terrorism is an attempt to use blind violence to destroy our values, values which bind us in the European Union and our Member States."
Relief for MEPs and staff who came home amongst great sadness
Noting that the EP Committee on International Trade was present in Mumbai at the time of the attacks, Mr Pöttering expressed his relief "amongst the great sadness" that all "participants of the EU delegation arrived back home safe and sound". He welcomed home MEPs Sajjad Karim, Ignasi Guardans, Erika Mann, Syed Kamall, Bela Glatterfelder, Daniel Caspery, Jan Tadeusz Masiel and staff of the European Parliament, all of whom were in Mumbai at the time of the attacks.
Pöttering also stressed that "at a time of events like this, citizens of Mumbai can turn to any EU Member State for support. This is the kind of solidarity that the EU is all about".
A minute's silence for businessman killed by ETA
MEPs also observed a minute of silence in tribute to the victims of terrorism in Mumbai and Mr Ignacio Uría Mendizabal, a 70-year old business man killed by the illegal Basque group ETA in Azpeita, Spain.

One in ten of the infections were in people under 25. President Pöttering called for better information and early treatment and underlined the importance of people having the infection not being stigmatised by society.
