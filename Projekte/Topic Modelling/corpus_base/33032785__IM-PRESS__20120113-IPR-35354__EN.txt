MEPs are expected to give their views on the Commission's decision.
The Commission decided on Tuesday to launch infringement proceedings against Hungary on three issues: the independence of the national central bank, the retirement age of judges and the independence of the data protection authority.
President Schulz will hold a press point next to the plenary chamber after the debate, at about 16:15h.
