The Foreign Affairs Committee has decided to postpone its vote on the enlargement strategy. MEPs felt they needed more time to discuss such important issues as the future of the EU and its relations with present candidate states and possible future candidate states.
The Foreign Affairs Committee was scheduled to vote on Tuesday on a report drawn up by committee chair Elmar Brok (EPP-ED, DE) in reaction to the enlargement strategy paper which the European Commission published on 9 November. However, a consensus was reached to postpone the vote after a proposal by Mr Brok to create " an option between full membership of the Union and the status of 'neighbourhood country', along the lines of the European Economic Area (..) as an intermediate step towards full accession " led to a lively but inconclusive debate. The vote will now be taken on 12 December in Strasbourg, so that the report can be debated and put to the vote by the full Parliament during its January session.
