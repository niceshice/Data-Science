Working in a foreign country: Are new rules required?
Employment policy
2006-01-31 - 12:30
A business which temporarily sends one of its employees to provide a service in another country in the EU is currently subject to the measures governing the "posting of workers". These have, of course, made the free movement of workers and services easier, but their implementation in certain EU members raises major issues. Last Thursday, MEPs on the Parliament's Employment Committee discussed the situation with experts. It remains to be seen if any new legislation is needed in this area.
How does this work in practice? We can use the following hypothetical example: Mr Martin works for a small engineering company in France who have just won a contract to install 50 lifts as part of a building project in Bratislava. Mr Martin has been sent to Slovakia by his employer to carry out their installation. He leaves his native Marseille for a given period but remains bound by his French work contract. He has become a “posted worker”. So who pays his salary? How much will he earn? What is his annual paid holiday entitlement? Does French or Slovak law govern his working conditions? The Posting of Workers Directive, which Parliament and the Council adopted in 1996, tries to answer these questions. But ten years after directive’s adoption, and in the light of its shortcomings, some are asking about the improvements that need to be made; or are even wondering about completely revising it. Before preparing an initiative report (to be written by Elisabeth Schroedter of the Greens-EFA Group) in which Parliament will give its opinion, the Employment and Social Affairs Committee organised a public hearing on 26 January to look at the issue.
The directive’s aim is to facilitate the mobility of workers and the provision of services beyond national boundaries by creating a legal framework making such exchanges possible while at the same time preventing abuses and unfair competition. For posted workers, the directive guarantees that certain minimum conditions (pay, leave, security, health and safety at work and working time) are respected. These are determined either by legislative, regulatory or administrative measures or by collective agreements of the state where the service is being provided. The company of the country of origin must be bound by the directive. In order for it to be part of different national systems, an information exchange mechanism (contact points and websites) has been set up by member states.
MEPs, along with the experts invited to meeting, agreed that the directive has too many grey areas. What is meant exactly by a minimum wage or a collective agreement? How should the issue of self-employed workers be dealt with? Member States all have different systems, and, for businesses, information is often inaccessible. According to Catelene Passchier of the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) several areas need improving: but she cautioned that it is better to leave well alone, as the directive’s basis is in good shape and should not be tampered with. This viewpoint was shared by the majority of the speakers, including Agnès Thibault of the European Association of Craft, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Theresa de Liedekerke of the European employers’ organisation, UNICE.
Is it a case of making adjustments to the directive or starting again from scratch? For the Belgian Socialist MEP, Anne Van Lancker, it is an open issue, although she believes that there are too many abuses. But the European Commission must speed up the preparation of its long-awaited report on the directive’s implementation. However, speed is of the essence. From May the 1 st , the labour markets of several of the older Member States will be opened up more widely to the states which became EU members in 2004. The Spanish Socialist MEP, Alejandro CERCAS , attacked gaps in the directive which in his view allow “work conditions to be sacrificed”, adding that: “We don’t want an unregulated system for posted workers.”
The European Commission representative, who came in for sharp criticism, promised to present his analytical report to Parliament this coming March.
