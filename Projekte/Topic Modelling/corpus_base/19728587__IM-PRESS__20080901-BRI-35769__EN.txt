Telecoms package: MEPs to vote on European Parliament's position
MEPs will vote on the European Parliament's first reading position on the telecoms package at midday on Wednesday 24 September following the debate that took place on 2 September 2008. The Industry and Internal Market Committees have already backed the amended "telecoms package" seeking to strengthen consumer rights and privacy protection, to ensure a consistent application of regulatory measures and to modernise radio spectrum use. Malcolm HARBOUR (EPP-ED, UK) is rapporteur on the report on electronic communications networks and services, protection of privacy and consumer protection.
MEPs to debate impact of financial market crisis
Council and Commission representatives will make statements on the world financial system and the impact of recent crises on the European economy at the start of a debate with MEPs on the extraordinary events on financial markets in the last week.
Call for new legislation to ensure financial stability
MEPs in two committees are calling for new legislation to improve regulation of financial markets, in particular regarding hedge funds and private equity investors. They also want measures to deal with some of the causes of the credit crunch. If the plenary agrees, the two reports will become formal requests from Parliament for the Commission to propose legislation. In a report drawn up by Poul Nyrup RASMUSSEN (PES, DK), the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee asks for a series of legislative measures on issues related to hedge funds and private equity. A related report from the Legal Affairs Committee, drafted by Klaus-Heine LEHNE (EPP-ED, DE) focuses in particular on transparency issues affecting these sectors.
Updating VAT rules on financial services
MEPs look set to back an update of the rules regarding the VAT treatment of financial services and insurance, with some proposals for changes. The aim is to ensure legal certainty in a sector which has changed dramatically since the current rules were drawn up over 30 years ago. Most financial services are exempt from VAT, but the legislation setting out how this exemption works in detail dates from 1977 and is out of date. The increasing level of cross-border supply of such services within Europe’s single market and the greater use of outsourcing of services to third countries have led to situations not provided for in the original legislation, which means there is unhelpful legal uncertainty.
MEPs to debate the social package - patient mobility
The social package was first debated in Parliament on 2 September 2008. Most MEPs speaking in the debate on the Commission's new "social agenda" welcomed the package of measures, though some said there were insufficiently specific and substantial. On Thursday, 25 September, Parliament will debate the second part of the Social Package relating to health aspects. . Altogether, the package contains 19 initiatives in the areas of employment and social affairs, education and youth, health, information society and economic affairs. The House will also vote on a resolution on the whole social package. John BOWIS (EPP-ED, UK), has been appointed the European Parliament's rapporteur on the new EU directive on cross-border healthcare.
MEPs to adopt written declaration on the proclamation of 23 August as European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism
European Parliament President Hans-Gert PÖTTERING will announce the adoption of the written declaration on the proclamation of 23 August as European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism since it has been signed by more than half of all MEPs (409 out of 785 on 15 September)
Written declaration on combating the trafficking of children to be adopted
The President of the European Parliament will announce that the written declaration on combating the trafficking of children has been adopted since more than half of all MEPs have signed the declaration (407 out of 785). The declaration calls on the Member States to recognise the fight against child trafficking as a priority objective in their national child protection policies. The declaration, together with the names of the signatories, are now forwarded to the Council and the Commission.
Priorities of the European Parliament for the legislative and work programme of the Commission for 2009
For the first time the European Parliament will debate its priorities for the legislative and work programme of the Commission for 2009 before the Commission formally presents their work programme to the Parliament. On 13 February, the Commission presented its Annual Policy Strategy setting out its political priorities for 2009. It outlines the Commission's policy objectives in five priority areas: growth and jobs, climate change and sustainable Europe, making a reality of the common immigration policy, putting the citizen first, and Europe as a world partner. The Commission will seek to gain approval for its legislative initiatives and also look forward by stimulating debate on the internal market, social agenda and budget reviews.
Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters: MEPs seek stronger personal data protection
The Civil Liberties Committee is seeking to beef up the data protection provisions of a proposed Council framework decision on police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters in its third report on this proposal. MEPs in the committee feel that the text had been weakened by the political agreement in the Council, which needs unanimity.
Terrorism: MEPs favour making incitement a crime, but with safeguards for fundamental rights
The fight against terrorism must not constrain freedom of expression, says the European Parliament Civil Liberties Committee in a report on a Commission proposal to include three new offences in European law: public incitement to commit terrorist offences, recruitment for terrorism, and terrorist training.
Vote on resolution on freedom, security and justice
Following the debate which took place on 31 January on the progress made in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (Articles 2 and 39 of the EU Treaty) - see also Oral Questions O-0005/2008 and O-0006/2008 tabled by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. MEPs vote on a resolution on this topic.
Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to address MEPs
The Ecumenical Patriarch BARTHOLOMEW I will address a formal sitting of the European Parliament on Wednesday 24 September. The patriarch's visit to the EP is one in a series of similar visits as part of European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. The role of the Patriarch of Constantinople in the Eastern Orthodox Church - also known as "Archbishop of Constantinople — New Rome" - is that of "first among equals" among the Eastern Orthodox bishops. He is thus the spiritual leader of the 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide.
Call to defend media pluralism, but questions over blogging
Parliament will vote on draft resolution tabled by the Culture Committee that calls for steps to be taken to ward off threats to media freedom and diversity from owners, shareholders and governments. At the same time the committee voices concern about the uncontrolled nature of blogs and other on-line media. The own-initiative report, drafted by Marianne MIKKO (PES, ET), argues that "the unrestricted concentration of ownership jeopardises pluralism and cultural diversity" and that there is a "considerable risk" that concentration of ownership and the private media's pursuit of profit can compromise its ability to act as a watchdog for democracy.
2009 to be designated European Year of Creativity and Innovation
The Culture Committee is recommending that Parliament back a Commission proposal for 2009 to be designated 'European Year of Creativity and Innovation’. However, while the Commission chiefly wishes to emphasise lifelong learning, the Culture Committee proposes a broader focus, highlighting a wider range of EU programmes.
Transport Committee still at odds with Council on third maritime package
In reports for the Transport Committee, MEPs in the committee deplore the fact that, over a year after Parliament's April 2007 first-reading vote on seven proposals to protect Europe against maritime accidents and pollution, transport ministers are still blocking two - on flag state obligations and civil liability - and have not taken up most of Parliament's recommendations on the other five. In the case of the third maritime package's two "missing files", on flag state obligations and on civil liability, MEPs propose to insert key amendments on these issues into other reports. They also reinserted all key amendments from the first reading, approving them almost unanimously in the committee vote.
Fight obesity earlier in life
Europe has almost 22 million overweight children, and a further 1.3 million will be overweight or obese by 2010, says the Environment Committee in a report that calls for an earlier start to measures to prevent obesity. Remedies include clearer food labelling, better food in schools and kindergartens, restrictions on advertising unhealthy food to children, and VAT reductions for fruit and vegetables.
Collective management of copyrights on-line
Giuseppe GARGANI (EPP-ED, IT), on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs will be asking the Commission questions on collective management of copyrights on-line.
Forthcoming EU-India summit to be debated by MEPs
Parliament holds a debate on Wednesday with the Council and Commission on the EU-India summit being held in Marseille on 29 September. Climate change, energy and the world food situation are among topics on the summit agenda. A revised joint action plan, to adapt the 2004 strategic partnership, is due to be adopted by the summit. Further progress is expected in talks on a maritime agreement, a free-trade agreement and an aviation agreement.
Petitions Committee: listening to the EU's citizens
Parliament's Petitions Committee had another busy year, as is described in its annual activity report for 2007. The number of petitions submitted by the public increased, as did the proportion lodged electronically through the EP website, while members of the committee undertook six fact-finding missions. Environmental issues and fundamental rights were the subjects most frequently raised by petitioners.
International Tropical Timber Agreement 2006
Caroline LUCAS (Greens/EFA, UK), newly elected leader of the Greens in the United Kingdom, will be putting forward a non-binding report on the International Tropical Timber Agreement 2006. The key point is the request by Parliament to modify the legal basis. As the agreement establishes a specific institutional framework by organising cooperation procedures, it means that the EP should have assent instead of being only consulted on the International Tropical timber Agreement of 2006.
MEPs question Commission on International Tropical Timber Agreement (ITTA) 2006
There is growing concern about the impact of deforestation and forest degradation and the consequences for climate change and biodiversity. As part of a more general approach, also covering temperate forests, demand for fair and sustainable timber products and traceability all along the supply chain, an effective ITTA could make a significant contribution to protecting the world’s forests and ensuring the sustainable use of timber. Helmuth MARKOV (GUE/NGL, DE), on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, will be asking the Commission questions on the International Tropical Timber Agreement (ITTA) 2006.
Mountain farming: a special case
In an own-initiative report tabled to the House, the Agriculture Committee calls for the Commission to devise within six months a special strategy for the sustainable development and use of resources in Europe's mountain areas. Farming is difficult in hilly areas and needs support, partly because of its environmental role, say MEPs. Mountain areas cover 40% of Europe's total surface area and are home to 19% of Europe's population. However, farming in these areas is vulnerable, facing transport and communication problems and high production costs. Dairy farming is in a critical situation, as milk quotas will soon be increased - bringing the prospect of falling prices for many producers - and the EU dairy regime as such will end in 2015.
Progress report on the reform of the European Schools
In the light of the successive enlargements of the EU, the increase in the number of agencies and places of work and the introduction of more flexible employment contracts, is a reform of the European Schools model, devised more than 50 years ago, now not urgently needed? MEPs will debate an Oral Question to the Commission which suggests that the European Schools system be thoroughly reviewed.

Telecoms package: MEPs to vote on European Parliament's position
2008-09-18 - 09:50
MEPs will vote on the European Parliament's first reading position on the telecoms package at midday on Wednesday 24 September following the debate that took place on 2 September (see links below). Malcolm Harbour (EPP-ED, UK) is rapporteur on the report on electronic communications networks and services, protection of privacy and consumer protection. The Industry and Internal Market Committees have already backed the amended "telecoms package" seeking to strengthen consumer rights and privacy protection, to ensure a consistent application of regulatory measures and to modernise radio spectrum use.
The telecoms package will reform the current set of electronic communications rules dating from 2002 by amending five existing directives and one regulation, and by establishing a new European body of national telecommunications regulators.
In July, Industry Committee MEPs adopted amendments to the framework directive for electronic communications networks and services so as to ensure that radio spectrum management is better coordinated and harmonised across the EU, especially in view of the switchover from analogue to digital TV by 2012 which will release a large range of frequencies currently reserved for broadcasting. The report drafted by Catherine Trautmann (PES, FR) also expands the tools available to national regulators to include, as "an exceptional measure", functional separation – a regulatory instrument which requires an incumbent operator to separate its network infrastructure from the business units offering services using this infrastructure.
To ensure a consistent application of the regulatory framework, the Industry Committee also backed Pilar del Castillo 's (EPP-ED, ES) proposal for a Body of European Regulators in Telecommunications (BERT), rather than the European Electronic Communications Market Authority (EECMA) advocated by the Commission. British national regulator OFCOM has already introduced functional separation in the UK telecoms market.
By proposing a report drafted by Malcolm Harbour (EPP-ED, UK), also in July, Parliament's Internal Market Committee voted for improved consumer rights such as the obligation on operators to provide more transparent information on tariffs and contractual terms and easier access to e-services for users with disabilities. The report equally aims to strengthen personal data and privacy protection, for example, by requiring access providers to warn internet users of the risk of malicious use of their personal data or other illegal practices. A range of measures enhancing data protection were also included, based on an opinion drawn up by Alexander Alvaro (ALDE, DE) for the Civil Liberties Committee under the enhanced cooperation procedure.
Speaking in the plenary debate on 2 September, Malcolm Harbour spoke of the need to give consumers clear information on prices, tariffs and contractual conditions as well as on ways of protecting themselves against threats to the security of their personal data. Good quality universal emergency services and the needs of disabled users were other points emphasised by Mr Harbour. In addition, "consumers are entitled to be informed about some of the problems they might encounter, whether it is potential for infringing copyright, whether it is potential for unauthorised use, whether it is potential for example for buying things that could damage their health like counterfeit medicines". To help consumers, he asked "why should we not demand that electronic service providers carry public service messages in the same way that television channels do at the moment?"
Missing child hotline pushed
Arlene McCarthy (PES, UK) speaking in the debate on 2 September said: "I want to draw the attention of this House to one provision – an amendment I made and backed by the committee – to make the introduction of the 116000 missing child hotline a legal obligation on all Member States. The Commissioner will be aware that a recent report has shown that, a full 18 months after its introduction in 2007, only seven Member States have assigned the missing child hotline. The voluntary approach is clearly not working. Across Europe every year approximately 130 000 children go missing. These statistics show that this is an area where Europe can help, must act and must identify, track down and recover missing children. Therefore I urge the European Commission and the Member States to support this provision, to speed up the implementation of the missing child hotline and give a major boost to Europe’s efforts for an EU-wide missing children amber alert system."
What happens next?
The Council is scheduled for 27 November where it will work on its own common position.

MEPs to debate impact of financial market crisis
2008-09-18 - 09:50
Council and Commission representatives will make statements on the world financial system and the impact of recent crises on the European economy at the start of a debate with MEPs on the extraordinary events on financial markets in the last week. The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the sudden takeover of Merrill Lynch, the effective nationalisation of insurance group AIG in the United States, and the turmoil surrounding HBOS in the UK are just the latest developments in the financial market crisis which began in August 2007. MEPs will discuss policy options to help restore stability - and to reduce the risks of such problems occurring again in the future. Debate: 24.09.08

Economic and monetary affairs
Call for new legislation to ensure financial stability
2008-09-18 - 09:50
MEPs in two committees are calling for new legislation to improve regulation of financial markets, in particular regarding hedge funds and private equity investors. They also want measures to deal with some of the causes of the credit crunch. If the plenary agrees, the two reports will become formal requests from Parliament for the Commission to propose legislation. In a report drawn up by Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (PES, DK), the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee asks for a series of legislative measures on issues related to hedge funds and private equity. A related report from the Legal Affairs Committee, drafted by Klaus-Heine Lehne (EPP-ED, DE) focuses in particular on transparency issues affecting these sectors.
Financial stability and capital requirements
Regarding financial stability, capital and regulatory coverage, the Economics Committee report says, among other points, that capital requirements should apply to investment firms on the basis of risk rather than the particular type of entity. The interests of investors and loan originators should be aligned, either by obliging originators to retain a portion of securitised loans on their own books or by measures with equivalent effect.
Valuation of illiquid financial instruments, access to venture capital
MEPs want to see principles based legislation on the valuation of illiquid financial instruments and better transparency requirements on prime brokers. They say there should be a harmonised EU-wide framework for venture capital and private equity, especially to ensure cross-border access to capital for SMEs.
Takeovers: information for employees, no “asset stripping”
Employees of companies which are taken over should always have the same rights to information and consultation under EU law, including when private equity investors or hedge funds are involved. The committee says measures should be introduced where needed to avoid unreasonable asset stripping of companies taken over by private investors. Capital rules should ensure the level of leverage is sustainable for both the private equity firms and the target company and there should be no unfair discrimination between different types of fund using similar strategies. Similar points are made in the Legal Affairs Committee’s report, which asks for rules forbidding the “plunder” of companies by investors, and also asks whether and how banks might be held responsible, in some circumstances, for the use made by investors of the money they lend. They also want a review of the relevant parts of the Transfers of Undertakings Directive.
Conflicts of interest and market concentration
Measures are also needed to tackle conflicts of interest within financial institutions of all kinds. Credit rating agencies should separate their rating business form any other services they offer, such as advising on structuring transactions – and there should be a mechanism for EU-review of these agencies.
The effects of market concentration in the financial services industry should be given a general review by the Commission’s Competition Directorate General, and assess among other things, whether there is legislation favouring incumbents which needs to be removed.
Wide-ranging review to find gaps in legislation
Finally the committee asks the Commission to review all existing financial market legislation to identify any gaps regarding hedge funds and private equity and put forward any legislation needed for better regulation of these or other actors.
Transparency requirements
Regarding transparency, the Economics Committee wants to see a European Private Placement Regime which would allow for the cross border distribution of investment products, including alternative investment vehicles (such as hedge funds), to eligible groups of sophisticated investors. This would involve disclosure of their general investment strategy, leverage, risk-management and portfolio valuation methods, the source and amount of funds raised, rules for transparency on top executives remuneration and registration of shareholders beyond a certain proportion.
In its report, the Legal Affairs Committee expands on this, calling for contract terms for alternative investments to provide “unambiguous disclosure and management of risk” and “full transparency of managers’ remuneration systems through formal approval by the general meeting of the company’s shareholders.”
It also wants the Commission should consider whether hedge funds and private equity investors should be required to register and identify shareholders beyond a certain proportion.
Securities lending and voting on borrowed shares
The Legal Committee wants more transparency on voting by hedge funds in general meetings, calling for exploration of whether intermediaries should be obliged to enable original shareholders to participate actively in voting. It wants to see a code of practice on how to rebalance corporate governance structures to reinforce a long-term orientation. The MEPs in the committee ask for an investigation of securities lending and voting on borrowed shares. It also asks whether reporting requirements should apply to cooperation agreements between several shareholders.
The two reports are presented under Rule 39 of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, whereby Parliament can use its right formally to request that the Commission draw up legislation on a particular subject (Article 192 of the Treaty). To be adopted by the plenary, an absolute majority of MEPs must support the measures (i.e. at least 393 votes in favour).

Updating VAT rules on financial services
2008-09-18 - 09:50
MEPs look set to back an update of the rules regarding the VAT treatment of financial services and insurance, with some proposals for changes. The aim is to ensure legal certainty in a sector which has changed dramatically since the current rules were drawn up over 30 years ago. Most financial services are exempt from VAT, but the legislation setting out how this exemption works in detail dates from 1977 and is out of date. The increasing level of cross-border supply of such services within Europe’s single market and the greater use of outsourcing of services to third countries have led to situations not provided for in the original legislation, which means there is unhelpful legal uncertainty.
Clarifying the scope of the exemption
While looking set to approve the update in general, MEPs in the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee adopted – in a report drawn up by Joseph Muscat (PES, MT) – a number of amendments which would clarify the scope of the VAT exemption – for example by explicitly including all derivatives. The committee also adopted a number of amendments aimed at ensuring a level playing field between different Member States and different types of financial institution.
Option to apply tax
Another aspect of the proposal from the Commission would give financial services companies everywhere in the EU the option of taxation on their services, which would enable them to claim back VAT they pay on their expenses in providing those services (which is not possible if the ultimate supply is exempt). MEPs in the committee want to ensure that the Council adopts uniform rules for applying this possibility across the EU and that its operation is subsequently reviewed by the Commission.
Cost-sharing groups
The Commission’s other proposed innovation is to allow for cost-sharing group so economic operators to pool investments and re-distribute the costs for these investments exempt from VAT. MEPs in the committee want to broaden the scope of this arrangement.
As usual with taxation matters, Parliament’s position is not binding, and the final decision requires unanimity among the 27 Member States in the Council. Rapporteur Joseph MUSCAT PSE MT A6-0344/2008 Value added tax on the treatment of insurance and financial services Procedure : Consultation

Accounting standards: proposals for improved governance structure
2008-09-18 - 09:50
MEPs will debate the future of the International Accounting Standards Board after hearing the Commission’s response to an oral question on the issue. Parliament adopted a report calling for changes in the governance structure of the IASB in April and since then its oversight body, the International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation, has issued a consultation document with proposed changes. The question to the Commission, tabled by Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee Chair Pervenche Berès on behalf of the committee, reads as follows:
“On 21 July the International Accounting Standards Foundation issued a consultation document "Review of the constitution – Public Accountability and the Composition of the IASB Proposals for Change". It should be recalled that the European Union transposes the international accounting standards developed by the IASB into EU law through comitology.
The proposed changes to the constitution of the IASCF are partly a response to a European Parliament resolution on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the Governance of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
Against this background, will the Commission explain:
1. how it intends to respond to the consultation?
2. how it intends to ensure that the interests of the European Union are adequately taken into account?
3. how it sees the link between the new governance structures and equivalence of accounting standards?” Debate : 24.09.08 Text adopted 24.04.2008 - International Financial Reporting Standards and the governance of the IASB

Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters: MEPs seek stronger personal data protection
2008-09-18 - 09:50
The Civil Liberties Committee is seeking to beef up the data protection provisions of a proposed Council framework decision on police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters in its third report on this proposal. MEPs in the committee feel that the text had been weakened by the political agreement in the Council, which needs unanimity. The report, by Martine Roure (PES, FR), was adopted unanimously minus one abstention in committee. The vote was taken after MEPs had expressed the hope that this would be made a co-decision issue in 2009, if the Lisbon Treaty could enter into force in time.
"A lowest common denominator deal" in Council
The European Parliament had already been consulted on this issue, but when a November 2007 agreement in Council diverged substantially from the Commission's original proposal, MEPs were invited to comment on the new text. The rapporteur regretted that "the Council had emptied the Commission's initial proposal of its content and arrived at an agreement on the lowest common denominator". For example, the text drafted in Council would apply only to exchanges of data among Member States, and not to the processing of data within them, as originally planned.
MEPs in the committee consider on the contrary that the text should also apply to data processed at national level and that particular attention should be paid to the purposes to which personal data may be utilised. Article 7, on the processing of a special category of personal data to do inter alia with race or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs, is strengthened: the processing of these data is prohibited save in exceptional, clearly-defined, circumstances.
MEPs in the committee also reinsert the idea, proposed by the Commission but not taken up by the Council, of a working party on the protection of people with regard to the processing of personal data, which would deliver opinions and recommendations to the institutions.
Private operators, transfers to third countries or international organisations
MEPs in the committee stipulate that Member States' competent authorities must have access to data held by private operators case by case, subject to judicial control. Private operators entrusted with public service tasks should be subject to requirements at least equivalent to those imposed on the authorities.
MEPs in the committee also stipulate that the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations must be better governed, by doing it case by case, and that Member States must meet tougher conditions in order to avail themselves of an exemption from the requirement to ensure adequate protection for data transferred to third countries. The assessment of whether the level of protection offered by a third country is adequate should moreover be done by an independent authority.

Terrorism: MEPs favour making incitement a crime, but with safeguards for fundamental rights
2008-09-18 - 09:50
The fight against terrorism must not constrain freedom of expression, says the European Parliament Civil Liberties Committee in a report it on a Commission proposal to include three new offences in European law: public incitement to commit terrorist offences, recruitment for terrorism, and terrorist training. Aiming to produce a balanced text that can best serve those seeking to prevent radicalisation and the emergence of potential terrorists whilst affording maximum protection to fundamental rights, MEPs adopted a consultation report by Roselyne Lefrançois (PES, FR) with 35 votes in favour, 4 against and one abstention.
Tighter definition of public incitement
MEPs in the committee first seek to clarify the definition of "public provocation". This initially used term was replaced by "public incitement", as being clearer and more widely used in legal language.
Furthermore, where the proposal would have made it a criminal offence to make available to the public any message intended to incite the commission of a terrorist act, MEPs in the committee specify that this conduct would be an offence only if it created a "genuine" danger and not just a "hypothetical" one.
Explicit safeguard clauses
MEPs in the committee propose inserting safeguards, throughout the text, for fundamental freedoms and in particular freedom of expression. These provisions took up the safeguard clause already present in the Council of Europe Convention, which the Commission had left out of its proposal.
The approved report also reiterates the need to abide by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights.
Finally, it stresses that the framework decision must not prevent the airing of radical, polemic or controversial views, even on terrorism and that the contents of private communications such as e-mail must be protected.

MEPs to adopt written declaration on the proclamation of 23 August as European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism
2008-09-18 - 09:50
European Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering will announce the adoption of the written declaration on the proclamation of 23 August as European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism since it has been signed by more than half of all MEPs (409 out of 785 on 15 September) The written declaration was put forward by Marianne MIKKO (PES, EE), Christopher BEAZLEY (EPP-ED, UK), Inese VAIDERE (UEN, LV), Zita GURMAI (PES, HU) and Alexander ALVARO (ALDE, DE) and proposes that 23 August be proclaimed European Day of Remembrance for Victims of the Crimes of Stalinism and Nazism, in order to preserve the memory of the victims of mass deportations and exterminations, at the same time rooting democracy more firmly and reinforcing peace and stability in our continent.
The written declaration points out that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 23 August 1939 between the Soviet Union and Germany divided Europe into two spheres of interest by means of secret additional protocols.
The mass deportations, murders and enslavements committed in the context of the acts of aggression by Stalinism and Nazism fall into the category of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Under international law, statutory limitations do not apply to war crimes and crimes against humanity,
Finally MEPs say that the influence and significance of the Soviet order and occupation on/for citizens of the post-Communist States are little known in Europe.

Written declaration on combating the trafficking of children to be adopted
2008-09-18 - 09:50
The President of the European Parliament will announce that the written declaration on combating the trafficking of children has been adopted since more than half of all MEPs have signed the declaration (407 out of 785). The declaration calls on the Member States to recognise the fight against child trafficking as a priority objective in their national child protection policies. The declaration, together with the names of the signatories, are now forwarded to the Council and the Commission. The adopted text calls on the European Parliament and the Council to provide the necessary resources in the framework of the Commission’s strategy on promoting and safeguarding children’s rights. The written declaration was originally put forward by Marusya Ivanova Lyubcheva, Zita Gurmai, Diana Wallis, Eva-Britt Svensson and Anna Záborská.
MEPs also call on the Member States to continue actively cooperating and exchanging knowledge and experience with the relevant EU authorities and NGOs, in order to prevent and combat child trafficking, and provide adequate treatment for victims of such trafficking.
The written declaration points out that child trafficking is still a persistent problem, with more than two million children annually trafficked for forced labour and sexual exploitation.
MEPs say that the development of new communication technologies increases the trafficking in children, making the managing of this phenomenon more difficult,
Finally, the House points out that national authorities and NGOs in the Member States are still not acting efficiently against child trafficking, due to insufficient cross-border cooperation, lack of specialised training or inadequate implementation of existing legal standards.

Priorities of the European Parliament for the legislative and work programme of the Commission for 2009
2008-09-18 - 09:50
For the first time the European Parliament will debate its priorities for the legislative and work programme of the Commission for 2009 before the Commission formally presents their work programme to the Parliament. On 13 February, the Commission presented its Annual Policy Strategy setting out its political priorities for 2009. It outlines the Commission's policy objectives in five priority areas: growth and jobs, climate change and sustainable Europe, making a reality of the common immigration policy, putting the citizen first, and Europe as a world partner. The Commission will seek to gain approval for its legislative initiatives and also look forward by stimulating debate on the internal market, social agenda and budget reviews.
During 2009, the Commission will maintain its focus on delivering results for the benefit of citizens and businesses. Growth and jobs remain a major policy priority for the Union, backed up by further efforts to tackle climate change and to meet the energy needs of the Union. The Commission will follow up on the Single Market review and on the revised Social Agenda. The Commission will also look forward, laying the foundations for the years ahead. On of the main highlights will be the work on the budget review, based on the consultation now underway, which will pave the way for the preparation of the next financial perspectives.
The development of a common immigration policy will be a fundamental priority in order to meet the challenges and harness the opportunities provided by migration in an era of globalisation. Initiatives will be put forward to simplify the life of citizens and ensure their security. Negotiations with candidate countries will be pursued on the basis of the renewed consensus on enlargement. Work to develop closer political and economic ties with partners around the world will continue to intensify, and new partnerships with African countries will be implemented in the context of the Africa/EU strategy. The Commission will also continue to deliver on its better regulation agenda, to focus on the proper enforcement of EU legislation and to ensure the sound management of financial programmes.
2009 will be an important year for the European Union, marked by the possible entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, a new European Parliament and a new European Commission.
In addition to the Commission's policy priorities to be taken forward in 2009, the Annual Policy Strategy proposes an allocation of human and financial resources to reinforce the Commission's ability to deliver in priority areas. The Annual Policy Strategy also identifies the main communication priorities for 2009. The Commission will give specific focus in 2009 to the new possibilities and benefits offered by the Treaty of Lisbon to the citizens of the Union (subject to its entry into force), the review of the EU budget, growth and jobs presented in the perspective of citizens' concerns, and energy and climate change.
On the basis of this Annual Policy Strategy, the Commission will initiate an exchange of views with the European Parliament and Council on where the policy priorities should lie in 2009, and how this should be reflected in the Commission's legislative and work programme to be adopted in October and in the budget for 2009.

Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to address MEPs
2008-09-18 - 09:50
The Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I will address a formal sitting of the European Parliament on Wednesday 24 September. The patriarch's visit to the EP is one in a series of similar visits as part of European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. The role of the Patriarch of Constantinople in the Eastern Orthodox Church - also known as "Archbishop of Constantinople — New Rome" - is that of "first among equals" among the Eastern Orthodox bishops. He is thus the spiritual leader of the 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide.
Bartholomew I, who has been the Patriarch since November 1991, has devoted much effort to rebuilding the once-persecuted Eastern Orthodox churches of former Eastern Bloc following the fall of Communism.
He has also continued the reconciliation with the Roman Catholic Church started by his predecessors, and initiated dialogues with other faiths, including Christian, Muslim and Jewish sects.
In addition, he has gained a reputation as an environmentalist, putting the support of the Patriarchate behind various international environmental causes and thereby earning the nickname "the Green Patriarch". He is noted for declaring at a conference in California in 1997 that "crime against the natural world is a sin". I n 2002 he received Norway 's $100,000 Sophie Prize for his environmental work.
After the Ecumenical Patriarch has delivered his address to the House on Wednesday, he will take part in a press conference at 12.30pm with EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering . Formal Sitting

Collective management of copyrights on-line
2008-09-18 - 09:50
Giuseppe GARGANI (EPP-ED, IT), on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs will be asking the Commission the following questions on collective management of copyrights on-line. 1. Noting that the Commission’s decision on CISAC does not impose fines but seeks changes in its practices, does the Commission envisage allowing those changes, as would seem preferable, to take place as part of a broadly-based consultation involving all interested parties, in order to avoid the inconsistence of the current legal situation provoked by various statements of the Commission?
2. Does the Commission intend to take account of the European Parliament's resolution of 13 March 2007 (P6_TA(2007)0064, see link below) and in particular to revise the evaluation report published on 7 February 2008 , which completely ignores the recommendations made by this House?
3. In future, how does the Commission envisage associating the European Parliament with the preparation of the recommendation on creative content online which the Commission plans to publish in some weeks' time, and which will also deal with the implementation of multiterritorial licences?
4. Having regard to this experience and the application of soft-law, is the Commission not acting inconsistently and contrary to the principle of legal certainty (the adoption of such a recommendation is liable to infringe the legitimate expectations of stakeholders, who have no means of redress, since the recommendation will not be able to be the subject of a reference to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling)?

Culture
Call to defend media pluralism, but questions over blogging
2008-09-18 - 09:50
Parliament will vote on draft resolution tabled by the Culture Committee that calls for steps to be taken to ward off threats to media freedom and diversity from owners, shareholders and governments. At the same time the committee voices concern about the uncontrolled nature of blogs and other on-line media. The own-initiative report, drafted by Marianne Mikko (PES, ET), argues that "the unrestricted concentration of ownership jeopardises pluralism and cultural diversity" and that there is a "considerable risk" that concentration of ownership and the private media's pursuit of profit can compromise its ability to act as a watchdog for democracy. MEPs believe "the custody of media pluralism should not be left purely to market mechanisms".
Protecting journalistic independence: editorial charters, media ombudsmen, disclosure of ownership
To protect journalistic and editorial independence, the committee urges creating "editorial charters", to be applied in the same way in all Member States, so as to prevent owners, shareholders or governments from interfering with news content. They also suggest creating independent media ombudsmen or comparable institutions in Member States that do not already have them. And they encourage "the disclosure of ownership of all media outlets", to shed light on the aims and backgrounds of broadcasters and publishers.
In addition, MEPs want to ensure that "the public service media carry out the function entrusted to them by Member States in a transparent and accountable manner", so as to prevent "the abuse of public funding for reasons of political or economic expediency".
Blogs: a right to reply?
Turning to blogs, however, the draft report, while describing them as "an important new contribution to media pluralism", also suggests "clarifying the status of weblogs and sites based on user-generated content, assimilating them for legal purposes with any other form of public expression". It speaks of "a need to establish legal safeguards providing for the assignment of liability in the event of lawsuits, and establishing the right to reply".
Fees and privacy safeguards for private user-generated content?
The report also notes that "in commercial media outlets private user-generated content, especially audiovisual content, is increasingly utilised for a nominal fee or without any payment, raising problems of ethics and protection of privacy". It therefore suggests that "for private-user-generated content in commercial publications and channels, ethical codes of conduct and terms of usage should be encouraged and royalties, commensurate with its commercial value, should be introduced".
Lastly, the committee believes that legal measures are needed to protect the privacy of citizens and public figures in cases where this is breached by the growing use of user generated content.
The draft report was adopted in committee by 33 votes to 1, with no abstentions.
Alternative resolutions tabled by political groups
Under a new parliamentary procedure for own-initiative reports (see link below), instead of tabling amendments to the committee resolution, political groups can table alternative, or rival, resolutions. On this occasion, four alternative resolutions have been tabled alongside the Culture Committee's text, one by the EPP-ED group, one jointly by PES and ALDE, one by Greens/EFA and one by GUE/NGL. The topics on which the alternative resolutions differ from the Culture Committee text include blogging and the idea of ethical codes of conduct and royalties for user-generated content.
There is still time for the groups to reach agreement on joint resolutions, the deadline being Monday at 5pm. Parliament's plenary vote will then take place on Tuesday.

2009 to be designated European Year of Creativity and Innovation
2008-09-18 - 09:50
The Culture Committee is recommending that Parliament back a Commission proposal for 2009 to be designated 'European Year of Creativity and Innovation’. However, while the Commission chiefly wishes to emphasise lifelong learning, the Culture Committee proposes a broader focus, highlighting a wider range of EU programmes. Each year the EU chooses a theme for a campaign aimed at raising public awareness of, and drawing national governments' attention to, a specific issue. Rapporteur Katerina Batzeli (PES, EL) backs this tradition, calling it a means of "heightening public awareness, disseminating information concerning good practices, stimulating political debate and exchanges, and activating the public." Previous years saw 2006 designated as European Year of Workers' Mobility, 2007 as European Year of Equal Opportunities and 2008 as European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
For 2009 the Commission suggests highlighting the role that creativity and innovation play in fostering economic and social prosperity through benefits to the individual and society. It argues that more needs to be done on this front across the European Union, particularly in the field of education where the approach should be based on 'lifelong learning.'
The rapporteur "shares the Commission's view regarding the need for Europe to highlight its creative and innovative capacities for both social and economic reasons and to step up Europe's potential to rise to the challenges and opportunities of globalisation." The committee suggests only a few alterations to the proposal but, while the Commission highlights the Lifelong Learning Programme, the committee stresses the importance of all EU programmes that promote creativity and innovation.
As for previous European Years, measures will include promotion campaigns, events and initiatives at European, national, regional and local levels. The Commission is not seeking special funding for the year in question. This will be provided under existing Community programmes and administrative budgets.

Transport
Transport Committee still at odds with Council on third maritime package
2008-09-18 - 09:50
In reports for the Transport Committee, MEPs in the committee deplore the fact that, over a year after Parliament's April 2007 first-reading vote on seven proposals to protect Europe against maritime accidents and pollution, transport ministers are still blocking two - on flag state obligations and civil liability - and have not taken up most of Parliament's recommendations on the other five. In the case of the third maritime package's two "missing files", on flag state obligations and on civil liability, MEPs propose to insert key amendments on these issues into other reports. They also reinserted all key amendments from the first reading, approving them almost unanimously in the committee vote.
Maritime safety is top priority
Members in the committee reiterate that maritime safety had always been Parliament's priority, and that they did not want Council to water down important suggestions on port state control, a Community vessel traffic monitoring system, accident investigation, the liability boat passenger carriers and ship inspection and survey organisations.
Five maritime package reports
A Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system
(Rapporteur: Dirk Sterckx (ALDE, BE)
The committee reinserts amendments on the designation of an independent competent authority for the accommodation of vessels in distress. Successive disasters and near-disasters have shown that much time is often wasted because it was not clear who was responsible for what, it said. The committee favours setting up a competent with the independent expertise to decide, should an incident occur, on the best course of action to avoid a disaster. In the event of an accident, masters and crews should be treated fairly and not criminalised, it added.
Absence of evidence of financial security must not be a factor in assessing and deciding whether to accommodate a ship in distress, and accommodation in a place of refuge should not be restricted to insured vessels. MEPs in the committee also propose so-called "political" amendments, inserting the key elements of the civil liability issues blocked by the Council, into this report.
Investigation of accidents in the maritime transport sector
(Rapporteur: Jaromir Kohlicek (GUE/NGL, CZ)
MEPs in the committee propose amendments on the independence of investigative bodies, a deadline for starting investigations and an obligation for Member States to implement IMO guidelines on fair treatment of seafarers. The committee wants safety investigations of serious accidents, and not only of "very serious" accidents as Council is proposing, to remain mandatory and distress alerts to remain within the scope of the Directive. Finally, it is essential that Member States apply a common methodology in investigating accidents, it said.
Ship inspections and survey organisations (Directive and Regulation)
(Rapporteur: Luis de Grandes Pascual (EPP-ED, ES)
Classification societies are private sector organisations to which flag states delegate some ship inspection functions. Here, the main disputes with the Council are over the name of the new body or system for assessing and certifying these societies and the liability of recognised organisations when carrying out work on behalf of a Member State. Amendments to restore the key elements of the missing proposal on flag state control are also proposed.
Port state control
(Rapporteur: Dominique Vlasto (EPP-ED, FR)
Committee amendments reveal disagreement with the Council on the frequency of inspection of vessels in various risk categories, the inspection rate target which national authorities would be required to meet and the fact that Council wants to exclude vessels calling at offshore anchorages from inspection requirements, whereas Parliament wants them included. Finally, whilst ministers want a ban on sub-standard vessels using EU ports to be temporary, MEPs in the committee want it to be permanent.
Liability of boat passenger carriers in the event of accidents
(Rapporteur: Paolo Costa (ALDE, IT)
MEPs in the committee also insert amendments on the extension of the scope of the Regulation transposing the Athens Convention to all domestic carriage by sea, the scope of which the Council wishes to limit to large A-class ships, on the inclusion of inland waterways and on the Council's rejection of the application of the €21,000 advance payment to victims of permanent invalidity or severe injuries.
The committee also reinstates first-reading amendments proposing a harmonised approach on ceilings on the amounts to be paid to passengers in the event of accidents. They rejected any derogating reference to the global ceilings of the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims which might prevent passengers from recovering a substantial part of their claims under the Athens Convention.
What happens next?
The plenary debate and vote on these reports are scheduled for the September II session. If the Council does not accept Parliament's second-reading verdict and makes no progress on the two missing files, then a conciliation procedure cannot be excluded.

Social policy
MEPs to debate the social package - patient mobility
2008-09-18 - 09:50
The European Parliament will debate the Commission's proposed social package which was launched on 2nd and 3rd July and in particular the proposal on patients' access to healthcare. Altogether, the package contains 19 initiatives in the areas of employment and social affairs, education and youth, health, information society and economic affairs. The House will also vote on a resolution on the whole social package. The social package was first debated in the Parliament on 2 September 2008. Most MEPs speaking in the debate on the Commission's new "social agenda" welcomed the package of measures, though some said there were insufficiently specific and substantial.
Patients' access to healthcare
Another legislative proposal contained in the package aims to facilitate patients' access to healthcare in other European countries. Despite several clear European Court of Justice rulings confirming that the EU Treaty gives individual patients the right to seek healthcare in other Member States and be reimbursed at home, uncertainty remains over how to apply the principles of this jurisprudence more generally. With this proposal the Commission aims to provide legal certainty on this issue. This follows calls from both the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers for the Commission to propose a specific initiative on cross-border healthcare, in a way explicitly adapted to, and respecting, the unique nature of the healthcare sector. John BOWIS (EPP-ED, UK), has been appointed the European Parliament's rapporteur on the new EU directive on cross-border healthcare.
The directive's goals:
Overall, this directive, once adopted by the Council and the European Parliament, will provide a clear framework for cross-border care. Under its major provisions:
Patients have the right to seek healthcare abroad and be reimbursed up to what they would have received at home. The directive will provide clarity over how these rights can be exercised, including the limits that Member States can place on such healthcare abroad, and the level of financial coverage that is provided for cross-border healthcare.
Member States are responsible for healthcare provided on their territory. Patients should be confident that the quality and safety standards of the treatment they will receive in another Member State are regularly monitored and based on good medical practices.
The directive will facilitate European cooperation on healthcare. It will provide a basis to support the development of European reference networks, which will bring together, on a voluntary basis, specialised centres in different Member States. This collaboration has great potential to bring benefits to patients through easier access to highly specialised care. It can also be useful to health systems as it would facilitate the efficient use of resources, for example by pooling resources to tackle rare conditions.
Health technology assessment is another clear area of European added-value. This initiative will help to reduce overlap and duplication of efforts in this field and hence promote the effective and efficient use of resources.
Activities in the field of "e-Health" will also be strengthened. Information and communication technologies have enormous potential to improve the quality, safety and efficiency of healthcare. The Commission already supports existing e-health projects covering areas such as remote provision of specialist support from large hospitals to smaller local facilities. What is lacking, however, are shared formats and standards that can be used between different systems and different countries. The directive will help these to be put in place.

Public health
Fight obesity earlier in life
2008-09-18 - 09:50
Europe has almost 22 million overweight children, and a further 1.3 million will be overweight or obese by 2010, says the Environment Committee in a report, that calls for an earlier start to measures to prevent obesity. Remedies include clearer food labelling, better food in schools and kindergartens, restrictions on advertising unhealthy food to children, and VAT reductions for fruit and vegetables. Overweight, obesity and diet-related disease are approaching epidemic proportions, notes the own-initiative report by Alessandro Foglietta (UEN, IT), which the committee adopted unanimously. Obesity already accounts directly for about 6% of health spending, but the indirect costs are much higher, says the report. Obesity is one of Europe's most serious public health problems, because it significantly increases the risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers.
The Environment Committee advocates a multi-level, comprehensive approach to fighting obesity, and points out that there are many European research, health, education and life-long learning programmes that can help to tackle this scourge.
Fight the fat early in life
Since childhood obesity correlates closely with obesity in adults, the Commission and other stakeholders should make fighting it their priority, says the report. School curricula should be designed to ensure that physical exercise and a balanced diet become part of every child's behaviour.
MEPs in the committee also want the quality and nutritional standards of school and kindergarten meals to be improved, inter alia by providing fresh fruit and vegetables in school vending machines. They encourage the move away from selling children in schools foods and drinks that are high in salt, sugar or fat (HSSF) and of poor nutritional value, sand say that sponsorship and advertising for HSSF products should be restricted and monitored.
Food labelling - MEPs in the committee call for mandatory front-of-pack labelling using colour coding
The committee sees comprehensive information on labels as the key to enabling consumers to choose between good, better and less good nutrition. They welcome the Commission's new proposal to revise the directive on nutrition labelling of foodstuffs, and urge that the label be made visible, clear and easily understandable to the consumer. These rules should include mandatory front-of-pack nutritional labelling using colour coding, say MEPs in the committee, who recommend that nutrient content be expressed per 100g/100ml.
Curb advertising of unhealthy food to children
MEPs in the committee also ask for protected times and for restrictions on unhealthy food commercials that specifically target children, adding that such restrictions should also apply to new media such as online games, pop-ups and text messaging. The committee views as "a step in the right direction" the voluntary approach that the TV without frontiers Directive takes to the advertising of food of poor nutritional value to children. If 2010 review of the Directive finds that this voluntary approach has failed, then stricter measures should be brought forward, they add. MEPs in the committee also encourage media service providers to develop codes of conduct on inappropriate audiovisual commercial communication relating to food and beverage products.
Industry self-regulation good, but not good enough
MEPs in the committee stress that the food industry should do much more to tackle the problem of obesity, e.g. by offering a broader range of smaller portion options. MEPs in the committee acknowledge the role of recent industry initiatives on advertising self-regulation in fighting obesity, but note that regulation is sometimes necessary to deliver substantial and meaningful change in the industry, particular with respect to children.
EU- wide ban on artificial trans-fatty acids
The committee calls for an EU-wide ban on artificial trans-fatty acids, stressing that the present state of scientific knowledge shows that excessive consumption of trans-fatty acids (over 2% of total energy intake) is linked to significantly higher cardiovascular risks.
Lower VAT rates for fruit and vegetables
MEPs in the committee call on Member States which have not yet done so to reduce VAT on fruit and vegetables, recalling that Community law authorises them to do so. Furthermore they want the Community texts in force to be amended to allow fruit and vegetables to benefit from a very low rate of VAT.

Petitions
Petitions Committee: listening to the EU's citizens
2008-09-18 - 09:50
Parliament's Petitions Committee had another busy year, as is described in its annual activity report for 2007. The number of petitions submitted by the public increased, as did the proportion lodged electronically through the EP website, while members of the committee undertook six fact-finding missions. Environmental issues and fundamental rights were the subjects most frequently raised by petitioners. The Petitions Committee deals with petitions from EU citizens on any matter falling within the Community's sphere of competence. Members of the public often encounter shortcomings in the application of EU policies and programmes, and the petitions process is important in giving them an opportunity to draw such matters to the attention of the European Parliament. The EP can then, for example, press the European Commission to take action.
In 2007 the membership of the committee was expanded from 25 to 40, 1,506 petitions were registered (representing a 50% increase compared to 2006), of which 1,089 were declared admissible and a total of 159 petitioners took part in meetings of the committee. In addition, fact-finding visits were organised to Germany, Spain, Ireland, Poland, France and Cyprus.
The top-ten general topics covered by the petitions received in 2007 were as follows:
Environmental issues, water, etc
288
Fundamental rights
226
Urbanisation
131
Social Affairs & Discrimination
207
Internal Market & Consumers
192
Health
105
Justice
99
Transport issues & Infrastructure
88
Property & Restitution
72
Education & cultural issues
103
More specifically, petitioners expressed concern about the weakness of Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, the Water Framework Directive, the Drinking Water Directive, the Waste Directives, the Habitats Directive, the Birds Directive, the Money Laundering Directive and other general matters, including pollution and climate change, individual and private property rights, financial services, free movement and rights of workers including pension rights and other social provisions, recognition of professional qualifications, freedom of establishment and allegations of discrimination on grounds of nationality, gender or membership of a minority.
Recommendations in this year's report
The committee believes it could do its work even better if it had "its own investigatory facilities" but this would require an increase in staff. It calls for an urgent review of the "Citizens Portal" on Parliament's website with the objective of enhancing its visibility as regards the right of petition. And it makes other recommendations for enhancing working procedures.
MEPs believe more needs to be done to ensure Community law is properly implemented and they press for "more stringent timescales" for concluding inquiries into alleged infringements of EU legislation. The Commission is urged, when dealing with petitions and complaints related to environmental policy – which is the predominant concern of petitioners in the EU – to be more ready to act to prevent breaches of EU law, rather than waiting for the law to be infringed.
Ireland: drinking water in Galway, Tara heritage site and problems in Limerick
The committee's draft report "expresses its ongoing concern about the lack of implementation of the provisions of the Drinking Water Directive in Ireland", "the absence of any assessment in advance of a 2007 decision to remove a national monument situated at Lismullin in the path of the M3 motorway project near Tara in County Meath", the "problems faced by local communities in Limerick", and other issues raised in the report of the committee's fact-finding visit to Ireland.
Britain: property confiscated by Customs
It also "records that, in 2007, many British petitioners who had their property confiscated by the British Customs & Excise authorities were still without redress" and "urges the British authorities to come up with an equitable solution including the payment of ex gratia payments to petitioners who suffered serious financial loss before the authorities reviewed their practice and, according to the Commission, began to act in conformity with the relevant directives".
A single seat for EP in Brussels? Parliament should state its view, says committee
The draft report records that the petitions considered by the Committee on Petitions in 2007 included "the so-called "One Seat" petition, which was supported by 1.25 million EU citizens and which called for a single seat for the European Parliament, to be located in Brussels". It adds that "in October 2007 the President referred the petition back to the committee, which subsequently called for Parliament to give its opinion on this question, bearing in mind that the seat of the institution is governed by the provisions of the Treaty and that the Member States have the responsibility for taking a decision on this matter".

International Tropical Timber Agreement 2006
2008-09-18 - 09:50
Caroline Lucas (Greens/EFA, UK), newly elected leader of the Greens in the United Kingdom, will be putting forward a non-binding report on the International Tropical Timber Agreement 2006. The key point is the request by Parliament to modify the legal basis. As the agreement establishes a specific institutional framework by organising cooperation procedures, it means that the EP should have assent instead of being only consulted on the International Tropical timber Agreement of 2006. Aside from this procedural issue, MEPs say that an effective ITTA could make a significant contribution to protecting the world’s forests and ensuring the sustainable use of timber.
There is growing concern about the impact of deforestation and forest degradation and the consequences for climate change and biodiversity. As part of a more general approach, also covering temperate forests, demand for fair and sustainable timber products and traceability all along the supply chain. (Oral question by Helmut Markov)
Parliament therefore asks the Commission to propose by mid-2008 a comprehensive legislative proposal that prevents the placing of timber and timber products derived from illegal and destructive sources on the market. The European Commission is expected to adopt this communication on the 24th of September.
The mandate for the revision of ITTA 2006 should propose a voting mechanism for the International Tropical Timber Council that clearly rewards the conservation and sustainable use of tropical forests. According to the rapporteur, the ITTO’s voting structure gives additional votes to producer countries that export more timber while consumer member countries’ votes are primarily determined by their average net imports of tropical timber.
The Commission should also submit to the European Parliament and the Council an annual report with an analysis of the implementation of the International Tropical Timber Agreement (ITTA) 2006 and of measures to minimise the negative impact of trade on tropical forests.

MEPs question Commission on International Tropical Timber Agreement (ITTA) 2006
2008-09-18 - 09:50
Helmuth MARKOV (GUE/NGL, DE), on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, will be asking the Commission the following questions on the International Tropical Timber Agreement (ITTA) 2006.
The Council consulted Parliament on the proposal for a Council decision (11964/07) on the conclusion of ITTA 2006 on the basis of Article 300(3), first subparagraph, of the EC Treaty. On 28 January 2008 the President of Parliament wrote to the Council to request that Parliament be consulted on the basis of the assent procedure, as the agreement establishes ‘a specific institutional framework’. Aside from this procedural issue, there is growing concern about the impact of deforestation and forest degradation and the consequences for climate change and biodiversity. As part of a more general approach, also covering temperate forests, demand for fair and sustainable timber products and traceability all along the supply chain, an effective ITTA could make a significant contribution to protecting the world’s forests and ensuring the sustainable use of timber.
In this context, could the Commission:
1. In the light of the fact that overexploitation and illegal logging remain widespread, provide its assessment of the effectiveness of 20 years of tropical timber agreements?
2. Explain how it envisages ITTA interacting with other agreements, such as the Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biodiversity, and with initiatives taken under the EU’s Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) action plan?
3. Set out how it intends to ensure that environmental protection requirements are integrated into trade agreements, in line with Treaty obligations, and, in particular, that the current negotiations with the countries of south-east Asia will include measures to protect forests?
4. Indicate whether it is willing to submit annual reports to Parliament and the Council on the implementation of ITTA and the impact of trade on tropical forests, including with regard to bilateral agreements concluded under the FLEGT programme?

Agriculture
Mountain farming: a special case
2008-09-18 - 09:50
In an own-initiative report tabled to the House, the Agriculture Committee calls for the Commission to devise within six months a special strategy for the sustainable development and use of resources in Europe's mountain areas. Farming is difficult in hilly areas and needs support, partly because of its environmental role, say MEPs. Mountain areas cover 40% of Europe's total surface area and are home to 19% of Europe's population. However, farming in these areas is vulnerable, facing transport and communication problems and high production costs. Dairy farming is in a critical situation, as milk quotas will soon be increased - bringing the prospect of falling prices for many producers - and the EU dairy regime as such will end in 2015.
MEPs believe EU agriculture policy must find ways to meet the challenges facing these regions so as to support farming, which forms a basic source of income and an attraction of tourism (thanks to landscape, biodiversity and high quality traditional food production).
"There are as many different legal frameworks for Europe's mountain areas as there are Member States in the European Union itself", says rapporteur Michl Ebner (EPP-ED, IT). "What is required is a sensible framework that combines regulations and assistance in the best possible way to assist Europe's mountain regions in their efforts to achieve sustainable and forward-looking competitiveness".
Strategy needed within six months
The draft report urges the Commission to devise an integrated EU strategy for the sustainable development and use of resources in mountain areas within six months, accompanied by national action programmes involving regional authorities and civil society. It also suggests that rural development and structural assistance be combined. The importance of demarcating mountain areas as a first step is emphasised.
Special funding and storage of genetic material
Among its detailed proposals the report calls for:
- greater account to be taken of the multifunctionality of hill farming in future CAP reforms, for example by compensating hill farmers for the environmental benefits they generate;
- compensatory payments for mountain areas to be guaranteed in the long term;
- special targeted financial assistance for mountain areas,
- a fund for disadvantaged areas (containing resources from the second pillar which have not been used on account of a lack of national co-financing);
- special financial assistance for the dairy sector (dairy farmers and processors) and special payments to reduce any negative impact of the disappearance of quotas;
- greater support for producer associations, farming cooperatives and other intersectoral partnerships, such as Leader-groups;
- continuation of grass premiums and the introduction of additional per-hectare payments for organic farming and extensive grazing;
- measures to protect and promote high-quality regional and traditional products or their manufacturing procedures and their certification;
- the establishment of repositories of indigenous genetic material from animal and plant species, particularly farm animals and mountain flora, to preserve biodiversity.

Education
Progress report on the reform of the European Schools
2008-09-18 - 09:50
MEPs will debate an Oral Question to the Commission which suggests that the European Schools system be thoroughly reviewed. The text of the Oral Question, tabled on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education by Katerina Batzeli (PES, GR), chair of the committee, and Erna Hennicot-Schoepges (EPP-ED, LU), is as follows.
"In its resolutions P5_TA(2002)0605 and P6_TA(2005)0336 Parliament called for a thorough going reform of the European Schools system with a view to improving its governance and opening it up.
In the light of the successive enlargements of the EU, the increase in the number of agencies and places of work and the introduction of more flexible employment contracts, is a reform of the European Schools model, devised more than 50 years ago, now not urgently needed? Is it not time to offer European citizens a multilingual and flexible educational model which takes account of their mobility and their wish to offer their children a genuinely European education, whilst safeguarding the achievements of the existing system: the teaching of each pupil's mother tongue, the use of teachers who are native speakers of the language in which a subject is taught, the final diploma and the recognition of that diploma by all the EU Member States?
On that basis, are not the perception of the European Schools as elitist, the gradual exclusion over recent decades of pupils who are not children of officials and the division of pupils in the European Schools themselves into categories I, II or III - depending on whether or not they are children of officials - developments which are at odds with the objectives of greater labour market mobility?
What progress has been made with the work of reforming and opening up the European Schools system with a view to transforming it into a genuinely European educational system, whilst safeguarding its achievements? What progress has been made in the area of education for special-needs pupils?" Oral question to Commission on progress report on the reform of the European schools

Energy
Controlling energy prices - MEPs question Commission and Council
2008-09-18 - 09:50
In recent months, oil prices have experienced a sharp increase, reaching their highest level since the 1970s and unleashing protests around the EU by truckers, farmers, fishermen and others. Moreover, it is likely that in spite of recent price decreases they will remain high in the medium and long term. Hannes SWOBODA (PES AT) will be asking the Council and the Commission the following questions on getting a grip on energy prices. The House will also vote on a resolution on this topic. 1. Structural reform aspects: What measures are envisaged to break that unjustified direct linkage between electricity and oil prices? What is the level of competition in the sector? What are the preliminary findings/options of the consultation regarding the revision of the existing legislation on emergency oil stocks?
2. Speculation and pricing aspects: How can oil markets be made more transparent? How are the financial markets affected by oil price speculation? Have the oil companies reduced fuel prices after the recent oil price reduction? Is there a symmetry between fuel prices and oil prices?
3. Aspects of energy efficiency, promotion of renewables and diversification of energy sources: What will be done to address the issue of energy efficiency more strongly, including ways of encouraging better implementation of existing legislation within the Member States? What measures are envisaged towards more investment into financing alternative energy technologies and research?
4. Energy security and foreign policy aspects: What are the objectives regarding dialogue with key producers like Russia, Norway and the OPEC and what steps will be taken to ensure adequate access to secure and affordable energy supplies? What assistance will be given to oil-importing developing countries to develop alternatives to fossil fuels?
5. Macro-economic and social aspects: Increased energy prices on inflation contributed to the ECB decision to raise interest rates. What measures will be taken (a) to protect vulnerable groups and (b) to mitigate the negative macro-economic and social impact of higher energy prices? Where are the best practices regarding 'short-term and targeted' measures, with what results? Debate : 24.09.08
