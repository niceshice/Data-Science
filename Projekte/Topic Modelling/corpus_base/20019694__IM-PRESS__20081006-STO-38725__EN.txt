MEPs backed the symbolism of keeping the EU flag Thursday saw MEPs vote 503 to 96 to keep the EU flag and anthem. Despite being left out of the reform treaty as official emblems of the Union, Members reaffirmed their commitment to the symbols of European unity. Thursday also saw a debate on a forthcoming health action plan for the whole European Union. It highlights the need to deal with rising medicine costs and the importance of prevention rather than cure.
MEPs opt to keep 12 stars and Beethoven
MEPs to keep the blue flag with the 12 stars, Beethoven's "Ode to joy" anthem and the motto "united in diversity". This means that at meetings held in the European Parliament the flag will be prominently displayed. The anthem will also be played at formal sittings and other occasions.
These symbols had been dropped from the reform treaty after objections from some EU countries that having the flag and stars would be too "federalist".
Spanish Socialist MEP Carlos Carnero González who was in charge of assessing parliament's reaction to the dropping of the symbols said "it is very clear: the symbols of the Union are very much alive in the Institution that represents, more directly than any other, the 500 million inhabitants of our 27 Member States".
Health - 40% of diseases linked to lifestyle
Better prevention and closing the disparities between countries in terms of healthcare are just issues raised in a health action plan debated on Thursday. Slovenian MEP and cancer survivor Alojz Peterle (EPP-ED) drafted parliament's response to the proposed Commission action plan over the next five years.
The report highlights adverse health trends, especially "lifestyle diseases"; the rising cost of medicines and variations in life expectancy (9 years women/ 13 years men).
It also says that prevention-only treatment amounts to 3% of health spending in the EU and that 40% of diseases are linked to lifestyle.
Speaking in the debate Alojz Peterle said that the European Union must make "a strategic shift towards disease prevention". Swedish Socilaist Åsa Westlund highlighted the "inequalities within member states". This point was taken up by Cypriot Liberal Member Marios Matsakis who spoke of the "shameful differences between richer and poorer countries".
