Schengen: MEPs to call for fair decision on whether Bulgaria and Romania can join
2011-10-10 - 10:27
Was it "fair" or "legal" for the Netherlands and Finland to block a bid by Bulgaria and Romania to join the Schengen border check-free area? MEPs say the candidates already meet all Schengen membership requirements, and should not be held hostage to populist discourse. Parliament will put the question to the Commission and the Council, and vote a resolution on Thursday. The Netherlands and Finland postponed the bid indefinitely, demanding that Bulgaria and Romania first meet additional criteria.
On 8 June 2011, Parliament gave its green light for Bulgaria and Romania to join the Schengen area with a large majority: 487 votes in favour, 77 against and 29 abstentions.

New rules on firearms exports
2011-10-10 - 10:27
New EU export control rules for civil-use firearms, such as sports and hunting weapons, will be put to a vote on Thursday. The bill has already been informally agreed with the Council. Parliament wants to ensure maximum safety, but also to preclude unnecessary checks on hunters and sports shooters leaving the EU temporarily. The new EU regulation is to give effect to the United Nations Firearms Protocol (UNFP), which aims to combat illicit manufacturing and trafficking in firearms by controlling exports of civil-use firearms more effectively. It will not apply to fully automatic, deactivated or antique firearms.
EU exporters will have to seek authorisation from Member States to export firearms and ammunition to countries outside the EU. Before issuing an export authorisation, Member States will also have to make sure that the destination country has no objection to import or transit.
No authorisation will be required for hunters and sports shooters if they provide proof of the reasons for their journey, and return to the EU within 24 months.
Procedure: Co-decision, 1st reading

Shaping Europe's new VAT system
2011-10-10 - 10:27
Value added tax reform proposals will be debated and put to a vote on Thursday. The draft resolution aims to reduce complexity, uncertainty and inefficiency, and better balance the interests of EU Member States, businesses and citizens. It advocates levying VAT at the place of consumption and exempting NGOs. The resolution is a reply to the European Commission's December 2010 Green Paper on the future of VAT. It will feed into a "strategy on the future of VAT", which the Commission is to publish by the end of 2011.

Duty-free trade for the Western Balkans
2011-10-10 - 10:27
The Western Balkan countries will continue to enjoy duty-free access to EU markets for nearly all goods until the end of 2015, under plans to be voted on Thursday. Their duty-free access was to expire at the end of 2010. If prolonged, it will apply retroactively, from 1 January 2011. In talks with the Council, MEPs have ensured that the European Commission may suspend concessions if farm or fisheries imports cause serious disturbance to EU markets.
Duty-free access is an exceptional trade preference for countries and territories taking part in the Stabilisation and Association process (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia).
