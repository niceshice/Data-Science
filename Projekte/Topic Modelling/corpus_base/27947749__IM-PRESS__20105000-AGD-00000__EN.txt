High level Panel on Children's Rights and Development Policy
The Development Committee of the European Parliament will organise a high level panel entitled " Development for the Next Generation - Children's Rights in Development Policy."
The meeting will particularly focus on the need to ensure effective empowerment of children and adolescents in order to allow them to play an active role in matters which affect them directly.
After the entry into force of Lisbon Treaty, the protection of the rights of the child has become a specific objective of the EU external policy. The EU attaches an increasing importance to children's rights, but much remains to be done in order to put the political commitments into practice.
The two panels will concentrate on the following questions:
What Makes a Better Development Policy for Children? Involving Children in Developing Policy Planning. What is missing? - moderated by Gay Mitchell, MEP
EU Development Cooperation for Children. What More Do We Need to Do? - moderated by Véronique De Keyser, MEP
Silver Hall, 13.15-14.15
Press Conference
The high level panel will be followed by a press conference by Eva JOLY (Greens/EFA, FR), chair of the Development Committee Véronique DE KEYSER (S&D, BE ) and Gay MITCHELL (EPP, IE).
