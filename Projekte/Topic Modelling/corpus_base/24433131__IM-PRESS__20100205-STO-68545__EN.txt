Also this week Members voted in a new executive for the EU, discussed further expansion of the Union, the eurozone, Iran and body scanners at airports. Blue fin tuna got a new lease of life as MEPs strongly supported putting them on a UN list of species in which trade is prohibited. The photo slideshow conveys some of the images of the week.
Habemus European Commission : as the Commission proposes EU legislation on everything from transport to trade its membership will always be a source of political debate. Prior to Tuesday's vote, many MEPs were in lively form as they traded views on each other and the Barroso II Commission. Despite the charged atmosphere, the 488-137 votes in favour told its own story.
SWIFT shot down: a transatlantic row could be brewing after MEPs voted to strike down an agreement by EU governments to allow the US Administration access to financial data from the SWIFT data clearing house (80% of global transactions) in the fight against terrorist financiering.
Croatia, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Turkey all had their progress towards EU membership reviewed this week. Zagreb scored the highest marks with Skopje close behind and Ankara with work still to do.
Iran's playing for time over its nuclear programme was criticised sharply by MEPs . Members deplored the Iranian government's latest rejection of a compromise over the nuclear issue. Parliament said that Tehran "was apparently seeking to use this issue both as a means of distracting attention from the crisis within the country and as tactics to win time".
MEPs voted on a measure to ensure housing for the poor in Western Europe will now qualify for EU renovation funds - previously this fund had only been for Central and Eastern Europe.
Many positions were exposed on the debate on body scanners Wednesday. MEPs are still divided on whether they really represent another way to fight terrorism or constitute an over-reaction.
Fathers could be welcoming MEPs' decision to back calls for greater paternity leave. It was part of a series of measures including equal pay and action against domestic violence that formed part of the annual equal pay debate.
With the euro facing its greatest challenge , MEPs called for the European Union to show solidarity towards members that were struggling.
If you are a blue fin tuna connoisseur you may be disappointed that MEPs threw their weight behind getting it made an endangered species by the UN. Stocks have been decimated, but it can still be caught in small amounts so we can still enjoy it.
In other news, the House called for international help for Yemen in its fight against terrorism as well as solidarity with Haiti. The results of the election in Ukraine were also discussed.
