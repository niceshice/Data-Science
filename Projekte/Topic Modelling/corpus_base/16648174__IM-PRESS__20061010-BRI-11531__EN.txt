Opening of the Brussels plenary session - Parliament pays tribute to murdered Russian journalist
2006-10-13 - 10:35
Opening the session, President Josep Borrell drew the House's attention to two recent tragic events. The first was the death of former Spanish MEP Antoni Gutiérrez Díaz, a one-time vice-president of Parliament and chair of the Regional Committee. "Politics has lost one of its best representatives", said Mr Borrell. The House observed a minute's silence in memory of Mr Gutiérrez Díaz. The second tragic story was the murder of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya . The EP should pay its respects to this journalist for her great bravery, said Mr Borrell, and send its condolences to her family. The President asked the House to observe a minute's silence in memory of Anna Politkovskaya and other journalists imprisoned unjustly or murdered around the world.
Mr Borrell reported that Cecilia Malmström (ALDE, SE) had been appointed European Affairs Minister in the Swedish government and would therefore vacate her seat in the European Parliament.

Fundamental rights
Postponement of final vote on new Fundamental Rights Agency
2006-10-13 - 10:35
The European Parliament decided to postpone the final vote on the reports by Kinga GÁL (EPP-ED, HU) and Magda KOSANE KOVACS (PES, HU) on the establishment of the EU Fundamental Rights Agency to signal that it insists the scope of the new body to be extended to intergovernmental cooperation in policing, justice, immigration and counter-terrorism issues. MEPs adopted, by a large majority, amendments to the initial proposals of the European Commission but postponed the final vote on the legislative resolutions of the reports, deciding to refer both reports back to the Civil Liberties Committee for reconsideration. The rapporteurs proposed that the final vote be postponed in order to give more time to the European Commission in consultations with the Council to reach an eventual compromise.
The European Commission proposed that the agency should deal not only with first pillar issues but also third pillar ones such as police and justice cooperation which also includes measures on immigration and counter-terrorism. Several Member States are opposed to this but the MEPs strongly support the proposal of the European Commission.
The new agency is scheduled to take over the work of the existing European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia. Like the monitoring centre, the agency will be based in Vienna. Its tasks will include gathering information, giving advice to the EU and its Member States and issuing annual reports on fundamental rights issues. It will also engage in awareness raising. The Finnish presidency wants to have the agency up and running by 1 January 2007.
The European Parliament says that as well as fundamental rights issues in the Member States, the agency should also deal with problems in candidate countries and countries with which a Stabilisation and Association Agreement has been concluded.
MEPs want the involvement of the European Parliament with the new Agency to be strengthened by being consulted on the five year framework for the agency and on the candidates for the post of Director. They want not only the Council but also Parliament and the European Commission to be able to draw on the technical expertise of the Agency. They add that duplication of activities with the Council of Europe can be avoided through mechanisms to ensure complementarity and added value.
To ensure good cooperation with civil society, the European Parliament supports the establishment of a Fundamental Rights Platform which will help the exchange of information and knowledge. They also add that the Agency should have a scientific committee which will consist of eleven independent experts and will guarantee the scientific quality of the work. Member States will have to nominate national liaison officers to guarantee good cooperation with the agency.
The European Parliament also wants the deadline for the independent external evaluation of the Agency to be 31 December 2011, rather than 31 December 2009 as originally proposed, and said that the evaluation should include "an assessment of the possible need to modify the Agency's tasks, scope, areas of activity or structure".

External relations
MEPs condemn North Korean nuclear test in debate with Javier Solana
2006-10-13 - 10:35
In a debate on the recent nuclear test carried out by North Korea, MEPs were unanimous in their condemnation as the test had destabilised the entire region. Nevertheless, divergent views were expressed on sanctions and the effectiveness of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Javier SOLANA, High Representative for the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy, said that North Korea on Monday morning had "quite possibly or probably" carried out a nuclear test. The North Koreans, he said, had carried out an explosion of a plutonium device from a reactor built in the 1980s and 1990s. "It is most likely that it was a nuclear test", he said.
The test, he said, could have negative consequences for speeding up the arms race in the region. He said that he had spoken to South Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the US and countries in the region had reacted "serenely". He recalled that the test had been carried out just after the election of the new Japanese Prime Minister who had visited Beijing and Seoul. Mr Solana stated that Japan and China, so far, had offered constructive comments. He also said that he had consulted the future Secretary-General of the UN.
The test, he said, represented a threat to the whole region and recalled that the North Korea's population was poor. Mr Solana said that the North Korean government was wasting millions of dollar trying to develop nuclear weapons whilst the population suffered. The international community had reacted well to the situation and was considering a possible UIN resolution condemning North Korea. The EU condemned the test on Monday and the EU should now reaffirm its solidarity with the people of North Korea.
External relations Commissioner Benita FERRERO-WALDNER said North Korea's actions were not only a threat to the region but to the entire non-proliferation regime. It was acting "in defiance of the international community", increasing its isolation and worsening the plight of its long-suffering population. Its "deliberate escalation and provocation" was perhaps intended "to test the ability of the international community to remain united". China's quick response was therefore "particularly significant and welcome".
The big question was "What should we do?". The EU was a major donor, having provided €345 million in assistance since 1995. As a global actor it should play a part in any action taken and as a "staunch advocate of multilateralism" the EU must pay attention to what was decided in the United Nations. She called on the EU Member States with seats on the Security Council to "take due account of the EU's views".
Turning to humanitarian assistance, she stressed that the Korean people had already "suffered enormously". She wished "to maintain the humanitarian assistance" provided by the EU in the future. "The people should not be punished even more by their terrible regime", were her concluding words.
Political group speakers
For the EPP-ED group, José Ignacio SALAFRANCA SÁNCHEZ-NEYRA (ES) stressed that it was "important that the international community react quickly and appropriately". He wanted to know the position of the Council on the list of proposed sanctions, which "allows for economic sanctions". At least good news had come with China's decision to contemplate the application of sanctions.
At the same time, the world must not forget Iran and he welcomed Mr Solana's efforts on this front. It was important not to remain "blind, deaf and mute" to these two problem regions. Ultimately "we must respond as people who support peace and democracy, international solidarity and multilateralism, of which the EU is a symbol".
The leader of the Socialists, German MEP Martin SCHULZ, said the EU was "struggling to respond appropriately". The standard reaction was anger at this "moribund regime trying to attract attention" and there would be an urge to "draw a red line" at its actions. However, he went on, we must distinguish between the need to oppose "the decision of a crazy dictatorship and the starvation of its people".
Despite everything, it was important to maintain dialogue, said Mr Schulz. He contrasted the policy of the Clinton administration, with the Kedo programme, which was designed to keep North Korea "linked to the rest of the world" and what he described as the "bankruptcy" of the Bush administration, which had cut off that programme. He concluded by saying that any nuclear enrichment plant could result in material falling into the hands of criminals.
On behalf of the Liberal group, István SZENT-IVÁNYI ( HU) told the House that "North Korea has always tried to negotiate with threats and intimidation". It must be made clear "that it will not work for them this time".
There seemed to be "an unprecedented international consensus" on counter-measures against the regime. This gave "the opportunity to send a signal that we will not tolerate acts that lead to instability and further increase tensions".
He too mentioned Iran, saying that by taking a firm stand on North Korea "we also create incentives for Iran to return to the negotiating table". The aim of the six-party talks must be to ensure that North Korea took part once more in the NPT regime.
Gérard ONESTA (Greens/EFA, FR) said that his country, France, was one that "deals in nuclear technology" which lent an air of "hypocrisy" to the proceedings. However, he stressed that North Korea was not just a dictatorship but the "biggest asylum in the world", with a near-Orwellian character.
Like other speakers he emphasised that the world's response must not result in starving the people of the North Korea. The only card left to play was China, which had created and sustained the regime. But lastly, he repeated, "we must be humble" when we ourselves are "dealers in nuclear technology".
Tobias PFLÜGER (GUE/NGL, DE) said that the North Korean nuclear test deserved to be condemned and would only lead to the destabilisation of the region. It was sad that the North Korea regime was focusing on developing nuclear weapons rather than feeding its people. North Korea, he said, had become the ninth nuclear power in the world despite the Nuclear non-proliferation Treaty (NPT). Sanctions would not work as the population would suffer. North Korea was exploiting double standards as the EU also possessed nuclear weapons despite the NPT. "There is no such thing as a good nuclear bomb."
Ģirts Valdis KRISTOVSKIS (UEN, LV) was another speaker to underline that the whole region's stability had been undermined by the nuclear test. He too stressed the double standards regarding non-proliferation as Dr El Baredei from the IAEA had pointed out. Why was it okay for Israel to possess nuclear weapons and North Korea not, he asked.
Bastiaan BELDER (IND/DEM, NL) said that the whole region had been destabilised. Russia and China need to shoulder their responsibility for finding a solution to this crisis. The international community could stop trading with North Korea.
Jan Tadeusz MASIEL (NA, PL) said that North Korea's population had suffered considerably over a long period and that the North Korean regime should concentrate on feeding its people rather than building nuclear weapons. This would be of benefit to the entire region and not only North Korea.
British speaker
James ALLISTER (NA, UK) said it was "chilling" to think of the North Korean regime's nuclear capacity, particularly as it "may now be in the marketplace with crazed terrorist groups for the export of nuclear technology". He argued that "it behoves the EU to be extremely robust and resolute" in the circumstances and said "severe sanctions" might be required.
Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner's response to the debate
Replying for the Commission, Benita Ferrero-Waldner said the need was "to find the right smart response", one which would "focus on the authorities but spare the population". Only diplomacy could achieve this goal and she was adamant that "the six-party talks remain the best hope" for a medium- to long-term solution. The EU was not a participant in these negotiations but "as a responsible global actor, it is profoundly supportive of this framework". In the end, she believed "dialogue will be the answer".
High Representative Solana's response to the debate
Mr Solana said that the debate had shown that all MEPs that had spoken condemned the nuclear test. It was difficult to assess why North Korea had chosen this moment to carry it out. Mr Solana praised the Chinese for their constructive reactions and for leading the six-party talks, however no date had been set for the next meeting and instead a nuclear test had been carried out. He also agreed with those MEPs that had said that the NPT had to revised. North Korea must be condemned for the nuclear test, he said. North Korea had probably examined the international community's reaction to the nuclear test carried out by Pakistan and drawn the conclusion that they too could carry out a test. Finally, he recalled that the North Korean population was suffering both economically and politically.

EP calls for stricter animal protection and animal welfare rules
2006-10-13 - 10:35
Parliament adopted a report by a large majority - 565 votes in favour to 29 against and 15 abstentions - calling for stricter animal welfare rules in the EU. The report calls on the Commission to submit plans for animal protection labelling, to urge the strengthening of animal protection in WTO negotiations, and to ban seal and 'cruelty products' imports into the Union. The report also calls on the EU to bring an end to dog and cock fighting, although a similar plea to end bull fighting was rejected by MEPs during the vote.
The own-initiative report by Elisabeth JEGGLE (EPP-ED, DE) on a Community Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals points out that "animal protection and animal health impact closely on each other." It therefore calls on the Commission to "take greater account of animal protection aspects in the fight against animal diseases." MEPs also noted that "in practice, EU rules on the transport of animals [...] are frequently disregarded." In order to strengthen incentives for better treatment of animals, the report supports the development of "animal protection labelling" as well as voluntary private labels that would guarantee even higher standards of animal protection.
However, the House also considered that new rules and labelling requirements could "lead to a decline in the competitiveness of Community production," and to "animal protection dumping" by third countries. For this reason, the report "urges the strengthening of animal protection within the framework of the WTO" to raise animal welfare standards all over the world.
Members also expressed their regret that "the focus of European policy on animal welfare has so far been almost exclusively on the welfare and protection of farm animals." Therefore, the report also suggests widening the scope of EU legislation on animal testing, calls on the Commission to make permanent the ban on EU imports of wild birds, and to also ban seal and 'cruelty products' imports.
Finally, the EP called upon the EU to "bring an end to dog and cock fighting, through national or community legislation as appropriate, and by ensuring that those involved receive no state or national subsidy relating to their activities." The House voted against extending this passage to bull fighting, as well (178-412-15).

Soft fruits and cherries - MEPs want Commission to devise anti-dumping measures
2006-10-13 - 10:35
In adopting a resolution on soft fruits and cherries intended for processing, MEPs also want the Commission immediately to devise and implement measures restricting excessive imports of soft fruits from third countries, particularly those which apply dumping prices. The House calls on the Commission to take immediate steps to initiate cooperation projects and training measures for the farmers concerned and support for improvements to the marketing infrastructure in order to create better opportunities for growers of soft fruits and cherries in the EU to make a living.
Parliament calls for soft fruits such as strawberries, currants, raspberries, gooseberries, sour cherries and sweet cherries to be included in processing aid systems similar to those currently applied in the case of tomatoes, pears, peaches and citrus fruit, with a view to stabilising the market in these products more effectively. The House draws attention to the fact that these products are of strategic importance in certain regions of the old Member States and to the new Member States, where they are of social, and not just economic, value as well as enhancing the landscape.
The House calls on the Commission, in the long term, to consider adopting qualified market access for soft fruits, which would make imports of products from third countries conditional on compliance with environmental and social standards in their production corresponding to those of the European Union. MEPs considers that, if such standards are not complied with, a levy should be imposed on the imports to protect European producers against dumping and that the revenue from this levy should be used to finance rural development projects in the exporting countries concerned.
Parliament wants the Commission to take vigorous action with a view to including products which are subject to low customs tariffs (as is the case with soft fruits) on the list of sensitive goods and bringing soft fruits under special safeguard clauses (SSGs) and the entry price arrangements. The resolution calls on the Commission to enter discussions with the Member States with a view to introducing financial support for projects to take old soft fruit and cherry plantations out of production in the event of prolonged supply surpluses.
MEPs call on the Commission to simplify the relevant provisions and the crisis support arrangements for soft fruit and cherry producers suffering losses as a result of adverse weather conditions. The House takes the view that such simplification should in particular seek to ensure that compensation for the impact of adverse weather conditions does not require prior approval by the Commission, which would significantly speed up payments to farmers. The House calls on the Commission to introduce compensation arrangements for producers as part of the reform of the CMO in fruit and vegetables, to cover situations in which crops of soft fruits and cherries are not brought to market as a result of unforeseen and temporary difficulties stemming from supply surpluses.
The House calls for the introduction of a labelling system to indicate the country of origin of agricultural products used for processed foods, and for such labelling to be required on the end product as well, making it possible for consumers to choose whether to purchase regional products.
Parliament wants appropriate funds to be allocated, in connection with regulations seeking to promote agricultural products, to increasing consumption of high-quality European soft fruits and soft-fruit products.
Finally, the House calls on the Polish Government to eliminate the fiscal disadvantages suffered by producer groups so as to encourage producers to form associations to sell their products and so that they can make optimal use of the EU's common-organisation-of the-market budget for fruit and vegetables.

External/international trade
Boosting ties between EU and Mercosur
2006-10-13 - 10:35
Parliament adopted an own-initiative report on economic and trade relations between the EU and Mercosur. The report looks at the plans for an interregional association agreement launched at the first summit of heads of state or government of the EU and Mercosur in Rio de Janeiro (June 1999). The House believes both continents have an interest in seeing Mercosur open up to Asia, South Africa and the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council. MEPs also urge the Mercosur countries to create their own parliament, composed of representatives of different national parliaments. Parliament also wants to create a Mercosur - European Parliament inter-parliamentary delegation to further boost ties and the establishment of a Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly comprising Members of the European Parliament and of the Latin American integration parliaments.
The House reaffirms the need for the EU to conclude, as soon as possible, a full, ambitious and balanced Association Agreement with Mercosur, based on three pillars: a political and institutional chapter reinforcing democratic dialogue and political cooperation, a cooperation chapter promoting sustainable economic and social development, and a trade chapter establishing an advanced free-trade area with a broad agenda including, as well as reciprocal liberalisation of trade in goods and services, investment, public procurement, the protection of intellectual property rights, cooperation regarding competition and trade protection instruments, trade facilitation, and a binding dispute settlement mechanism.
As to the Doha round, Parliament regrets the fact that, despite Parliament's recommendations that negotiation of the agreement with Member State should be decoupled from the WTO's Doha Round, the delays in the negotiations with Mercosur have led to their temporary de facto subordination to the development and finalisation of the Doha Round. Parliament believes that the two processes, rather than being mutually exclusive, are complementary.
MEPs stress the importance of core labour standards and decent jobs for the development of Mercosur; states therefore that the agreement must include a specific agenda on decent work tailor-made for Mercosur Member States and a commitment by the EU to offer all necessary assistance in achieving that agenda.
Finally, the House considers that in addition to the repressive aspect concerning the fight against drugs, the agreement should insist on delivering aid to farmers to help them start new alternative production.

Call to remove unjustifiable barriers to competition in the professions
2006-10-13 - 10:35
Parliament has given a welcome to dialogue between the Commission, Member States and professional bodies aimed at dismantling unjustified or harmful barriers to competition in professional services. With 534 votes in favour, 62 against and 9 abstentions, Parliament adopted an own-initiative report, drawn up by Jan Christian EHLER (EPP-ED, DE) in reaction to the Commission’s latest communication on the issue. It says effective and transparent self-regulation can be appropriate, but that Member States should ensure it does not damage consumer interests. MEPs support the adoption of codes of conduct by professional service providers.
Parliament acknowledges the right to issue regulations based on traditional, geographic and demographic specificities, but emphasises that such rules should restrict competition as little as possible, and that substantive reform of the existing system is needed to help attain the Lisbon targets.
MEPs say that the mandatory fixed or minimum fees and a ban on negotiating fees based on results might be detrimental to the quality of service to the public and to competition. They therefore call on Member States to overcome these constraints through measures which are less restrictive.
MEPs want restrictions on advertising by professionals to be largely dispensed with, limited only to duly justified exceptional cases.
Parliament urges the Commission to examine more carefully the expected impact of the full removal of unnecessary obstacles to competition, including on sectors that have limited resources or that are restricted to certain regions.
Finally the report raises the issue of subdividing regulatory protection by category of consumer group, suggesting this may need further analysis.

MEPs ask for more democratic control over patent procedures
2006-10-13 - 10:35
MEPs adopted a resolution on the future of European patents by 494 votes in favour, 109 against and 18 abstentions, in which they want to postpone any decision on whether to approve the Community accession to the European Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA), and called for "significant improvements" of the text. During the debate held in Strasbourg on 28 September, Commissioner McCreevy advocated the ratification of the Agreement saying it would make the European patent system more effective. The debate on how to improve the protection of Intellectual Property Rights in the EU goes on. With the Community Patent dossier blocked in the Council for lack of agreement over the language regime, the Commission put forward the proposal of acceding EPLA. The EPLA would introduce a European Patent Court with jurisdiction to deal with infringement concerning European patents. The EC accession to the agreement would therefore allow the Court to rule over patents in all EU Member States.
The majority of the MEPs did not reject the idea of acceding EPLA, but stressed their reservations over the present form of the draft text. They were particularly concerned about the lack of democratic control over the procedures to grant a patent. Indeed, MEPs asked for significant revision of the provisions of the Agreement, with regard to democratic control, judicial independence and litigation costs. Moreover, MEPs asked the EP Legal Service to give its advice on the possible overlap between the EPLA and the acquis communautaire.
During the debate held two weeks ago, MEPs agreed that the best way to improve patent protection in the EU is to have a Community Patent. Nevertheless, they admitted that it is unlikely that the proposal will be approved in the near future.

Management of the European Satellite radio-navigation programme
2006-10-13 - 10:35
Parliament adopted a non-binding report by the Chairman of the Industry, Research and Energy Committee - Giles CHICHESTER (EPP-ED, UK) on the management of the European Satellite radio-navigation programme. The report was adopted with 555 votes in favour, 27 against and 27 abstentions. The purpose of the proposal is to amend Council Regulation 1321/2004/EC to enable the European GNSS Supervisory Authority (responsible for the European Satellite Navigation programmes - Galileo and EGNOS) to complete the development phase of the Galileo programme after the Galileo Joint Undertaking is wound up. the Galileo Joint Undertaking should be wound up on 31 December 2006 and its activities transferred to the Supervisory Authority. To this end, it is necessary to amend Council Regulation 1321/2004/EC on the establishment of structures for the management of the European satellite radio navigation programmes.
