Security and Defence: global response to global threats
Security and defence
2010-09-27 - 14:53
MEP Arnaud Danjean pictured in his office Defence in the 21st century has changed. Among the challenges: global communication, new threats, a civil dimension to some conflicts and difficulties in legitimising military intervention. So could a European defence strategy help? Ahead of a meeting of MEPs and MPs on Tuesday, we spoke to French Christian Democrat Arnaud Danjean, the author of a report on the European Defence strategy.
The EU has a Common Security and Defence Policy but so far "t he vast majority of the actions carried out by the EU under the CSDP have been the civil management of crises, with a European budget and European supervision mechanisms," he said.
Common defence policy must move forward
The changes to the geopolitical environment that began in the 1990s with the first Iraq war and the conflict in the Balkans and global threats like terrorism and nuclear proliferation mean "Western society is faced with new conflicts that require global engagement, both military and civil, over a long period (including crisis management, post conflict management and 'state building')," Mr Danjean said.
Defence has always been at the heart of national sovereignty, but global threats call for a global not simply a national response and given the financial difficulties in which some member states find themselves "some form of mutual defence effort seems inevitable," he added. "We can't go back, the development of a common defence policy can only go forward."
Increase legitimacy, EP control
Public opinion is also becoming more important as citizens become more vocal about the legitimacy of military intervention. " The legitimacy of our military actions must be perfectly clear so that those involved have not only political clarity but also the means to carry them out," Mr Danjean said.
Parliaments, national and European, have a role - to legitimise defence and security action and policy, he said. "We (MEPs) must follow-up on CSDP missions - their pertinence, integration into EU policy and...cost."
NATO Secretary General Anders Rasmussen will be at the meeting which begins Tuesday at 0930 CET. Click below to watch live.
