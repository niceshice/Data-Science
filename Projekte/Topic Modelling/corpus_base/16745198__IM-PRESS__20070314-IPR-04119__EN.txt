MEPs working to improve seafarers' working conditions
Mary Lou McDonald (SF/GUE-NGL) presented her first report to colleagues (784 other MEPs) during the plenary session on 13 March. The report urges that the EU Member States ratify as swiftly as possible the Consolidated Maritime Labour Convention adopted by the International Labour Organisation in 2006. The convention aims to improve working conditions for seafarers, thus reducing unfair competition on the global market as well as making merchant shipping a more attractive profession.
Ms McDonald explained that the report, which deals with the implementation of the Consolidated Maritime Labour Convention, "sets minimum requirements for seafarers, with provisions on: employment conditions and recruitment; working hours; wage protection; leave and repatriation; accommodation; recreation; food and catering; health and medical care; welfare and social security." She urged her colleagues to support her report which called for the speedy ratification of the Convention by EU Member States.
The Consolidated Maritime Labour Convention, which was adopted by the International Labour Organisation in 2006, brings together all existing conventions and recommendations on maritime labour conditions which have been adopted since 1919. Once ratified by a minimum of 30 states, representing a third of global merchant shipping tonnage, the Consolidated Convention will become the basis of the first universal Maritime Labour Code.
It deals in particular with vessels above 500 tonnes and aims, among other things, to put an end to the practice of 'social dumping' or the exploitation of differing national legal systems by maritime companies. It sets out minimum conditions for employment and the protection of workers (in 2001, 80% of maritime accidents were linked to human error) and will require appropriate inspections to ensure compliance.
Commenting on the report, Ms McDonald pointed out that "this type of race to the bottom, embodied by Irish Ferries in 2005, needs to be stopped. The adoption of my recommendation to the Parliament on the ..[..].. Convention is a first step ..[towards].. re-establishing fair wages for ferry workers and revitalising a career option for Irish seafarers." Ms McDonald also called on the European Commission "to re-table the proposal for a Ferries Directive."
Also commenting on the report, Proinsias De Rossa (Labour/PES) stated that "even though this Convention is extremely important ..[..].. it nevertheless does not give the same protection from exploitation of cheap labour which an EU Directive would guarantee." Also speaking about the need for a Ferries Directive and referring in particular to the situation of Irish Ferries in 2005, Mr De Rossa pointed out that if the 'Manning of Ferries Directive' had not been blocked, "then those of all nationalities working on ferries would have been enabled to use European-wide legislation to defend their working conditions."
