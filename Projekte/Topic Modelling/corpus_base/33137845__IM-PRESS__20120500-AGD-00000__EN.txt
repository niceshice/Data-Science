Plenary Session and Committee Meetings – Brussels
Fiscal Union. MEPs will react to the outcome of Monday's summit on the financial and economic crisis, and in particular the draft treaty on fiscal union. A resolution will be voted on Thursday (debate Wednesday, vote Thursday) .
Eurobonds. The desirability and feasibility of introducing Eurobonds is up for a debate by the full House. The Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee said last December that Eurobonds could become a source of stability for the Eurozone in the medium term, but cannot meet its short-term needs (debate and vote Thursday) .
Iran/Russia. MEPs will debate Iran, its nuclear programme and EU sanctions as well as the situation in Russia with foreign policy High Representative Catherine Ashton. A resolution on Iran will be put to the vote on Thursday, and one on Russia at the February plenary session in Strasbourg (debate Wednesday, vote Thursday).
Derivatives trading. Parliament, Council and Commission will meet to strike a deal on new legislation on trade in derivatives, which is widely believed to have aggravated the global financial crisis. The draft aims to enhance the safety, transparency and stability of the over-the-counter derivatives market (Tuesday).
European mortgage market. A press workshop on the new EU mortgage legislation, which aims to reduce the build-up of risk and improve access to mortgage markets, will enable journalists to exchange views with leading MEPs and representatives of other EU institutions as well as consumer and mortgage industry representatives (Tuesday, Wednesday).
