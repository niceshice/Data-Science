The Transport Committee called on Tuesday for proposed disabled access rights for air travel to be extended to the blind, partially sighted, deaf and hard of hearing.
The committee was voting at first reading on a draft regulation by the European Commission on the right of passengers with reduced mobility travelling by air. Members felt that the Commission proposals should cover not only individuals with reduced mobility but also certain other categories of passengers who do not necessarily have limited mobility but who can nevertheless encounter difficulties when travelling via airports.
In adopting a report by Robert EVANS (PES, UK) by 33 votes to 4 with 11 abstentions, MEPs approved compromise amendments on the responsibilities of the managing body of airports when such passengers arrive for onward travel by air, on their check-in conditions and on the training of air carriers' and airport managing bodies' staff in how to provide direct assistance.
Under the new regulation, airport staff should be able to move disabled people from a designated point to the check-in counter and enable them to check-in and register their baggage, proceed from the check-in counter to the aircraft and board the aircraft, with provision of lifts, wheelchairs or any other assistance needed. When people with reduced mobility are assisted by an accompanying person, this person must, if a request is made, be allowed to provide assistance in the airport with embarking and disembarking. The carriage of recognised dogs to and from the cabin should also be guaranteed.
