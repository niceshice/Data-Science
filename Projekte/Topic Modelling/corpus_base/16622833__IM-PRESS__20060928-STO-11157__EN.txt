Under the spotlight: Pericles will help combat forgery
When is a Euro not a Euro? - That is the question that the EU's "Pericles" programme against forgery of the currency has been dealing with for the last five years. With over nine billion banknotes in circulation across twelve countries they have a hard job. This is why MEPs backed a report that will guarantee funding of 1 million Euro a year until 2013 and will ensure it covers new countries - like Slovenia - who will join the currency soon.
Confidence in the currency is vital - from consumers buying milk in a local shop to the international financial markets. Agustín Díaz de Mera is the Spanish MEP from the European People's Party who drafted the report on Pericles. He said that the programme was "important for the confidence of citizens in our currency".
According to experts, the €20 and €50 are the forger's favourites - high value but widely in circulation and not too high value to attract attention. In the first half of this year 300,000 counterfeit notes were taken out of circulation. In addition to Pericles, the European Central Bank (who issue notes), all the national banks of the Euro zone, Interpol and national police agencies are constantly on the look out for forgeries. Despite the temptations, the design of the note has made counterfeiting far less widespread than was first feared.
How do I check if a note is forged? The advice is "feel, look and tilt". Feel - the print should be raised. Look - if you hold it against the light a watermark and see-through number are visible. Tilt - look for the shifting image of the hologram or a colour changing number (on notes of 50 and above). This simple method can easily verify whether a note is real or not.
