EP fights against anti-personnel mines - photo by Lupi Herrera
Politics and music will join forces Wednesday evening to raise awareness about the devastating suffering and casualties caused by anti-personnel mines. Every year in Colombia thousands of innocent people are killed or maimed by the deadly weapons. The EU's campaign against landmines is supported by the Colombian singer and anti-landmine activist Juanes, who will give a concert in the Parliament's hemicycle.
During a special ceremony in Brussels, the EP will reaffirm its determination to contribute to a mine-free world and to put an end to the threat landmines represent to human security. Every year these pernicious weapons cause 20,000 victims, most of them civilians - poor farmers and their children.
One of the main obstacles in the fight against anti-personnel mines is the refusal of influential countries like the US, Russia, China and India to sign the Ottawa Convention prohibiting the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of landmines. The EP adopted a resolution condemning this situation in July 2005.
The EU is one of the most important donors in the fight against anti-personnel mines. Last month the European Commission adopted a €17.5 million anti-landmine programme aimed at helping those affected to build a safer future.
Tomorrow's special event is an initiative of Spanish MEP José Ignacio Salafranca ahead of the fourth EU-Latin American Summit, which will be held in Vienna in May, and is also sponsored by the Colombian Embassy . "This event is a homage to the people who are suffering and, at the same time, a strong commitment to make landmines history and, step by step, to launch a process of disarmament," said Italian MEP Luisa Morgantini, Chair of the Committee on Development.
The event will be attended by the president of the European Parliament, Josep Borrell. As part of the ceremony, Juanes will sing in support of the EP campaign.
"We need the support of the international community"
Recently Colombia surpassed Afghanistan and Cambodia as the country with the most annual landmine victims; more than half of them are civilians, of whom 40% are children.
"We need the support of the international community to help the victims and to prevent more deaths and mutilations," said Juanes. In his opinion, people, including the media, are not well informed about the actual situation. Tomorrow's event is intended to "raise public awareness and persuade the guilty to stop using these weapons that are banned internationally".
Juanes will be the first singer ever to perform in the hemicycle, where the Parliament holds its plenary sessions. To watch the press conference and concert live on Wednesday 19 April from 1800, click on the webstreaming link below.
