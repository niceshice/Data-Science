Parliament adopted a legislative report by 584 votes in favour, 22 against and 19 abstentions on the system for choosing 'European Capitals of Culture' and monitoring their progress . The report makes a number of changes to the Commission's proposed reforms of the system.
The major innovation is the introduction of a monitoring phase after a city has been designated as a 'Capital of Culture' to ensure respect of the criteria established for the cultural programme and also to give advice and support to the city concerned.
The text also specifies details of the role of the selection panel and says that the prize, in the form of a financial allocation from the Commission, should be awarded at least seven months before the beginning of the event. It also makes appropriate changes to deal with the forthcoming accession of Romania and Bulgaria, adding them to the list for 2007 and 2019 respectively.
The amendments adopted have already been agreed with Council and Commission in informal negotiations so this report should signify the end of the procedure.
