V치clav Havel will attend Parliament's formal sitting to celebrate with MEPs the 20th anniversary of democratic change in central and in central and eastern Europe. Eighty-nine young people born in November 1989, when the Berlin wall fell, will also come to Brussels to celebrate the anniversary of a new Europe, which is theirs too.
On 9 November 1989, the wall of shame that divided Europe fell. Parliament will celebrate this event, which has become a symbol of unification and liberty, without forgetting a long series of tragic events - whether in Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, or the Baltic countries - which have changed the face of Europe.
"Europe took decades to recover from the second world war. It was divided for almost 50 years. In the west, countries found themselves on the same side, building a common future, even though they had lived the war in very different ways" said President Buzek. "In a way, I represent the countries that were left on the far side. That is what I feel, how I was elected and what I mean today. But I represent the whole of the European Union, as a symbol of our equality and of the fact that we are all jointly responsible for the EU. I am conscious of this enormous responsibility. We shall write the history of Europe together."
On Wednesday 11 November, V치clav Havel, former President of the Czech Republic, and Jerzy Buzek, Poland's former Prime Minister, both important players in the democratic changes of 20 years ago, will participate in Parliament's formal session in Brussels. This ceremony will be preceded by a debate between the President and 89 young people, all aged 20, from all EU Member States. They will exchange views on "What Europe means for me". A photo exhibition on the historic events of this time of change in Europe will be inaugurated by President Buzek.
