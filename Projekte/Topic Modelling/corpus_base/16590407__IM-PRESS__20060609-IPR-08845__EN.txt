Parliament has given its approval for Slovenia to join the euro zone on 1 January 2007. MEPs adopted a report by 490 votes in favour to 13 against with 63 abstentions drawn up by Werner LANGEN (EPP-ED, DE) which support the Commission's proposal for Slovenia’s accession, adding only a call to the Member States “to allow the Commission to assess compliance with the Maastricht criteria on the basis of definite, current, reliable and high-quality data.”
Parliament’s role in the process of euro zone enlargement is consultative – see the link below for more details on the procedure.
Another, more detailed, report from Mr Langen on the issues surrounding euro zone enlargement in general was adopted at the May II plenary session. See the link below to our press release on that report.
