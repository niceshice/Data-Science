He and his business partner were recently found guilty of theft and tax fraud thus extending their sentences which many see as politically motivated. Maria Logan of the Khodorkovsky legal team was also present on 10 January to discuss the case.
Speaking to those assembled Maria Logan noted: "The Khodorkovsky case clearly shows that you cannot count on the Courts to protect you against the government of Russia." She noted that after the trial, many leading politicians from the EU and the USA criticised the political motives behind the case and showed support to the Khodorkovsky family.
Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek said in a statement following the verdict: "I am very disappointed. The trials of Mikhail Khodorkovsky were the litmus test of how the rule of law and human rights are treated in today's Russia. In effect it has become the emblematic symbol of all the systemic problems within the judiciary."
British Liberal Graham Watson told the meeting that "this latest conviction is a severe setback. It became clear that the real reason was the financing of opposition parties".
German Green Member Werner Schulz noted that "there is no strategic partnership with Russia. The time for quiet diplomacy is over. Russia had an opportunity and missed it".
On New Year´s Eve Moscow saw clashes between the authorities and protesters angry over the Khodorkovsky verdict and restrictions on the freedom of assembly.
The police detained some 130 people, with three prominent opposition leaders arrested and jailed for "disobedience towards the police".
