Outcome of the Palestinian elections and the situation in the Middle East - resolution to be adopted
2006-01-27 - 08:40
The Council will make a statement on the results of the elections in Palestine, the situation in the Middle East and its decision not to publish the report on East Jerusalem. Following the debate, MEPs are also due to adopt a resolution on these subjects.
EP delegation says conduct of Palestinian election was " a model for the wider Arab region "
The European Parliament delegation sent to observe the Palestinian elections says the elections were well run - and that their conduct provides a model for the wider Arab region.
Speaking to reporters at a news conference in Jerusalem on 26 January, EP Vice President, Edward McMILLAN-SCOTT (EPP-ED, UK), who chaired the delegation of 27 MEPs, said:
“ The clamour for choice and change was on the streets in Palestine; we heard and we welcome the noise of democracy. The political environment has changed and the Quartet, which meets on Monday, will need to take stock. As we predicted after last year’s presidential vote, the Palestinian people have provided a model for the wider Arab region in the conduct of this election. The parliamentary dimension of the EU’s neighbourhood has been amplified, in particular through the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly in which members of the Palestinian Legislative Council and the Knesset uniquely participate .”
The parliamentary delegation has endorsed the preliminary finding of the wider EU Election Observation Mission that the elections were open and well-administered. This mission was also led by an MEP, Veronique de KEYSER (PES, BE). Follow the link below for full details of the EU EOM initial statement.
(For information: the Quartet is made up of four international partners to the Middle East Peace Process – the US, UN, EU and Russia.)
Cautious welcome in Brussels for outcome of Palestinian elections
At a meeting of Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee in Brussels, MEPs and External Relations Commissioner Benita FERRERO-WALDNER reacted cautiously to the results of the Palestinian elections. The Commissioner termed the elections a success in that they had been more or less peaceful, while members of the committee called on Hamas to strive for a peaceful co-existence with Israel and to recognise Israel's right to exist.
Mrs Ferrero-Waldner said that the EU focus should not be on parties but on principles, adding that Hamas was aware that it cannot be both a terrorist organisation and part of the Palestinian Authority. The situation is difficult and much will depend on how Hamas interacts with other parties. She added that the outcome of the elections was now on the agenda of the Council, but that a "subtle" approach was called for. The Commissioner congratulated Israel for having allowed balloting to take place in East Jerusalem.
Emilio MENÉNDEZ del VALLE (PES, ES) stressed the need for Hamas to foreswear the use of violence and called for an intelligent, tactful and flexible approach in order to integrate Hamas into the political framework. Pawel PISKORSKI (EPP-ED, PL) also called for Hamas to refrain from violence and to recognise Israel's right to exist. Michel ROCARD (PES, FR) warned that Hamas should not be pushed too hard and too fast, pointing out that Hamas itself was divided and that part of it had not wanted to take part in the elections.

EU position towards Cuba
2006-01-27 - 08:40
Graham Watson (UK), Cecilia Malmström (SE), Emma Bonino (IT) and Marco Pannella ( IT), on behalf of the ALDE Group will be asking the Council the following question on the EU position towards the Cuban Government.
For the EP, it remains inconceivable that people continue to be imprisoned in Cuba for their ideals and peaceful political activity. It is particularly unacceptable and shocking that some of these political prisoners are not receiving the help they need and are in very poor medical condition. Some of them are actually dying.
The EP, in line with former firm positions, stressed, in its resolution of November 2004, that 'the upholding of human rights and fundamental freedoms is an essential condition for any revision of the EU's Common Position on Cuba and the measures adopted unanimously on 5 June 2003' (i.e. sanctions imposed following the arrest and imprisonment of 75 dissidents and the subsequent summary executions of three hijackers).
In January 2005, the Council changed its policy towards the Cuban Government. The hope of a more open attitude from the Castro regime side has apparently not been fulfilled. On the contrary, the human rights situation has deteriorated.
The Council states, in its declaration of 13 June 2005, that 'there was no satisfactory progress on human rights in Cuba'. It nevertheless concludes that 'the measures taken on 5 June 2003 remain suspended'. What kind of initiatives is the Council willing to take in order to promote respect for human rights and real progress towards a pluralist democracy in Cuba?
After recent events (expulsion of European parliamentarians, ongoing repression of dissidents), does the Council still think that the results of its new policy are satisfactory and that its present policy with the Cuban authorities is the correct approach to improve the situation in Cuba ? Debate : 01.02.2006

MEPs criticise lack of information from Council on foreign policy
2006-01-27 - 08:40
In a wide-ranging report on the EU's common foreign and security policy, MEPs in the Foreign Affairs Committee express annoyance at the lack of consultation and information from the Council, and are proposing to see if legal action can be taken.
The Foreign Affairs Committee is asking Parliament's Legal Affairs Committee to see whether action can be taken against the Council at the European Court of Justice for a breach of Article 21 of the EU Treaty, which explicitly states that Parliament must be consulted " on the main aspects and the basic choices of the common foreign and security policy " and that its views must be taken into account.
The report, which was drawn up by committee chair Elmar Brok (EPP-ED, DE), also calls on the Council High Representative, Javier Solana, to participate actively in the annual debate on the CFSP. It calls on the Council to report to the Foreign Affairs Committee on every Foreign Ministers Council meeting and high-level summit with key international partners.
More generally, MEPs say that the future priorities of the CFSP should be the Mediterranean, the Near and Middle East, the Balkans, Eastern Europe and relations with the US, as well as conflict situations, the promotion of peace, security in all its aspects, the fight against terrorism, disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. MEPs believe security also includes aspects such as energy, climate change and the spread of poverty.
Turning to more specific issues, MEPs in the committee call for a solution to the future status of Kosovo which respects its territorial integrity, upholds minority rights and does not endanger the EU's overall policy for the Balkans. Special attention should be given to the development of Africa. MEPs in the committee express their deep concern over the large-scale war crimes and human rights violations "which can be construed as genocide" in Darfur.
The committee criticises the present partnership with Russia as reflecting "common economic interests without achieving any progress as regards human rights and the rule of law". The EU policy towards Belarus has achieved few results, MEPs say; therefore new measures should be proposed to strengthen links with the people of Belarus. Relations with China should be advanced in such a way that progress is also made on human rights and democracy.
MEPs in the committee call on the Council to renew efforts for a revival of negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians and to set up a comprehensive strategy for the broader region of the Middle East. Regarding Afghanistan, MEPs warn that ISAF's reconstruction mission should not be merged with the US Enduring Freedom operation.
Finally, the committee recommends that joint costs for military operations in the framework of the European Security and Defence Policy should come from the Community budget, doing away with the current Member States' subsidiary budgets. This should also be the case for any future ESDP operations in the fight against terrorism.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Combating violence against women and future action
2006-01-27 - 08:40
"One of the most important tasks of a common European policy based on respect for fundamental human rights" is to combat all forms of discrimination against women. This is the view presented in a non-binding report being tabled by Maria Carlshamre (ALDE, SE) for the Women's Rights Committee.
The report assesses the current situation in combating violence against women and advises on the future action it considers necessary. It primarily concerns itself with the extent to which violence towards women should be tackled through policies at an EU-level.
According to the report, studies in Sweden, Germany and Finland show that "at least 30 - 35% of women between 16 and 67 have at one time been victims of physical or sexual violence", and when including psychological violence, this figure rises to 45-50%. In view of these statistics, the committee calls for the Commission and Member States to consider violence against women as a violation of human rights, and as a "structural phenomenon and a crucial barrier to efforts to overcome inequality". Accordingly, it recommends the adoption of a "zero tolerance" policy, and the establishment of a harmonised exchange of information through cooperation between governments and non-governmental bodies.
Furthermore, the committee asks the Commission to "declare a European Year against men's violence against Women" , to enforce a system which adequately demonstrates in which Member States the situation of violence against woman is comparatively worse, and to monitor the progress made by each Member State in regard to improving the treatment of women in society.
The committee wants Member States to alter their national laws, where necessary, in view of combating violence against women. It advises that neither cultural practice nor alcoholic intoxication should be considered as "extenuating circumstances in cases of violence against women", and that any acts of female genital mutilation should be considered illegal. The report suggests the provision of economic, legal and social support to women who are victims of domestic abuse, and calls for the development of programmes designed to reduce the " social stereotyping of women in society" .

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Equality between women and men in the European Union
2006-01-27 - 08:40
Edite Estrela (PSE, PT) for the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality will be tabling a non-binding report on the equality between women and men in the European Union.
The report welcomes the advances that have been made so far regarding the promotion of gender equality throughout Europe. It commends the recognition of the importance in closing the pay gap ( "though the pay gap between the sexes has remained virtually the same") and the recognition that equality policies are instruments of social cohesion. The report also welcomes the creation of the European Institute for Gender Equality.
However, it advises that the area of political representation needs to be advanced in view of gender equality; it states that in some Member States, the proportion of female parliamentarians is lower than the worldwide average of 15.6%. It therefore calls on the Commission to "strengthen the representation of women on decision-making bodies" , and on political parties to "review their party structures and procedures so as to remove all barriers that directly or indirectly discriminate against the participation of women".
In addition, the committee urges the Commission to "use the structural funds to promote equality between men and women…to make sure that pension schemes are not discriminatory…to work out statistics on the establishment of childcare structures " and to provide statistics on the gender pay gap. Moreover, it asks the Commission to keep the Parliament informed of the progress made.
The report also recalls that European policy on equality should remain transparent, that there should be a continual monitoring of compliance by the Member States and that there should be coordination between the mainstreaming policy and the Lisbon Strategy.

Transport
Application of the postal directive
2006-01-27 - 08:40
"The transposition of the Postal Directive into national law has made good progress overall…however the effects of the reforms…have yet to be analysed in detail". This is the view of the non-binding report put forward by Markus Ferber (EPP-ED, DE) for the Transport and Tourism Committee, on the application of the Postal Directive.
The 1997 Postal Directive arose from the European Union's desire to harmonise the very divergent conditions that had governed the provision of postal services in Europe up until then. The report assesses the success and extent of the directive's application so far and highlights the issues that still need to be addressed.
The committee commends the progress that the reform of the postal market has already made. It notes in particular the improvements made in the areas of quality of service, business efficiency and the separation of regulators from operators. The report also acknowledges the achievements of the CEN (Comité Européen de Normalisation) within the realm of standardisation and says that the adoption and implementation of service standards developed by the CEN is "essential to guaranteeing transparency, reliability and quality in the postal market" .
The report notes however, that there has been a delay in the implementation of the directive and that, despite the greater openness to the market - due to the creation of independent regulatory authorities - employment levels in the sector have not always been maintained. The report calls on the Commission to examine the future funding and quality of universal service, "the retention of which remains relevant in economic and social terms". It also recommends that attention be paid to the monitoring and allocation of costs as well as to the impact of geographic coverage.

Social legislation relating to road transport - agreement to be approved
2006-01-27 - 08:40
Helmuth Markov (GUE/NGL, DE) will be recommending that Parliament approve a conciliation agreement relating to social legislation in the field of road transport. This procedure concerns two related proposals:
Regulation on working time, breaks and rest periods for drivers engaged in road transport of goods and passengers; and a Directive on the enforcement of the relevant legislation through checks and penalties.
Major points of disagreement between Parliament and Council, affecting both the Regulation and the Directive, concerned the introduction of a common spectrum of penalties for infringements of the relevant legislation, as well as the inclusion of the road transport into the Working Time Directive so that the time a driver spends driving to his place of assignment and/or to (un)load his lorry could also be taken into account. Other key issues concerned the introduction of digital tachographs (which are more difficult to falsify than non-digital tachographs), the number of minimum checks to be carried out by Member States and rest periods and breaks for drivers. Conciliation opened formally on 12 October. The key points of the agreement reached by the Conciliation Committee on 6 December were:
• from May 2006, all new vehicles will have to be fitted with digital tachographs;
• higher levels of checks will be introduced a year earlier than originally proposed;
• a list of common serious infringements was agreed and the Commission undertook to
draw-up in the future a more detailed list of common infringements;
• recitals acknowledging the risks arising from driver fatigue and the importance of the
Working Time Directive for the creation of a common market for road safety and for
working conditions were included in the text;
• Council and Parliament disagreed on the length of a compulsory daily rest period for
drivers: in order not to block the legislation, Parliament finally accepted the figure (11
hours) proposed by Council.
In more detail:
1) Rest periods for drivers Council and the EP had disagreed on the definition of a compulsory regulatory daily rest period for drivers. Council wanted this to mean an uninterrupted period of rest of at least 11 hours. Parliament would have preferred 12 hours but finally accepted the Council's figure in order not to block the legislation. However, it was agreed that this rest period may, as an alternative, be taken in two periods, the first an interrupted period of at least 3 hours and the second an uninterrupted period of at least 9 hours. 2) Minimum checks At Parliament's insistence the Council also had to accept that checks carried out by Member States should be increased from 2008 to at least 2% of days worked by drivers falling within the scope of the new legislation, and to at least 3% from 2010. The Council had originally proposed 2% from 2009 and 3% from 2011. 3) Common infringements and penalties Council could not accept any reference to the harmonisation of penalties, arguing that penalties were a matter for the Member States. Nevertheless at Parliament's insistence the Council finally agreed to the introduction of a list of common infringements in the annex to the directive. In a declaration issued by the Commission the latter undertakes to provide a detailed list in future, which will be based on proposals by Parliament. Thus, serious infringements against the new regulation will include the following: exceeding the maximum daily, six-day or fortnightly driving time limits by a margin of 20% or more; disregarding the minimum daily or weekly rest period by a margin of 20% or more, disregarding the minimum break by a margin of 33% or more and using a tachograph not fitted in accordance with the requirements of the regulation. 4) Working Time Directive On this issue, the Council stuck to its common position and refused to accept the inclusion, as Parliament wanted, of a reference to the Working Time Directive (Directive 2002/15/EC on the organisation of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities), so that a link could be established with the new legislation. All compromise proposals tabled by the EP delegation on this issue were turned down by the Council and this proved the most difficult issue to solve. The two institutions finally agreed to include, in the recitals (the preamble) to the new directive, a reference to the importance of the Working Time Directive for the creation of a common market for road safety and for working conditions, and to include in the same directive a new recital stating that the risks from driver fatigue should also be addressed through enforcement of the Working Time Directive. Comments by EP delegation Parliament's delegation leader, Vice-President Alejo VIDAL-QUADRAS (EPP-ED, ES), said the outcome of this conciliation agreement was a fair compromise between the two institutions. Rapporteur Helmuth MARKOV (GUE/NGL, DE), however, voted against the final compromise, explaining that he could not accept the conciliation agreement as long as it did not establish a clear link between the new legislation and the Working Time Directive. Background The aim of the regulation on driving times, breaks and rest periods, which will abrogate and replace Regulation 3820/85/EC is to update, clarify and simplify the EU legislation for drivers engaged in the carriage of goods and passengers by road. The accompanying directive dealing with checks and penalties will abrogate and replace Directive 88/599/EC and update and enhance the quality and quantity of enforcement operations relating to road transport activities.

Budgetary control
National management declarations - how Member States account for EU money
2006-01-27 - 08:40
Szabolcs Fazakas (PSE, HU), Terence Wynn (PES, UK) and Jan Mulder (ALDE, NL) , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control will be asking the Council the following question on national management declarations: In its 2003 discharge resolution (P6_TA(2005)0092, adopted on 12.4.2005) Parliament took the clear view that, after 10 years with a negative Statement of Assurance on payments and with the European Court of Auditors' (ECA) unequivocal indication of the origin of most of the errors regarding the legality and regularity of underlying transactions, new instruments were needed in order to enhance the Commission's insight into the Member States' management and control systems.
By an overwhelming majority Parliament expressed the view that the time had come to base the relationship between the Commission and Member States' administrative authorities on principles of good public administration such as transparency and accountability.
In concrete terms Parliament proposed that each Member State should provide an ex-ante disclosure statement and an annual ex-post statement of assurance as regards its use of EU funding.
What kind of action has the Council taken following the findings of the ECA as to the origin of most of the errors regarding the legality and regularity of underlying transactions?
Is the Council able to present documentation for the results of its actions?
Does the Council believe that there is a need for ex-ante and ex-post national statements from a high level authority by whose signature the accountability of a Member State should be recognised? And does it believe that such statements are in full conformity with Article 274 of the EC Treaty?
Does the Council believe that the second part of the first paragraph of Article 274 is equally important as the first part of that paragraph, and that the existing imbalance between the Commission and the Member States has to be rectified?
Will the Council name the Member States that are against the introduction of national management declarations? Oral question to Council (B6-0347/2005 by members of Committee on Budgetary Control

Fisheries
Mediterranean fishery resources
2006-01-27 - 08:40
Philippe Morillon (ALDE, FR), on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, will be asking the Council the following question on the adoption of management measures for Mediterranean fishery resources: In April, the European Parliament adopted its report on the proposal for a Council Regulation on management measures for the sustainable exploitation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean Sea. That report was the fruit of an agreement between Parliament and the European Commission that broke the deadlock over the most contentious points in the proposal, with both parties conscious that the Mediterranean cannot be excluded from the melding of the CFP with sustainable development guidelines, which is a basic objective of the renewed CFP - especially as the only legislation on management in the Mediterranean dates from 1994, when already it was considered somewhat removed from the responsible fishing standards applicable in other Community waters.
The Council has still not managed to reach a decision on the proposal in question.
Since failure to adopt this regulation could mean the EU not honouring international agreements that were inspired by the EU itself, could the Presidency indicate when it anticipates this proposal will be adopted?

Jacques Toubon (EPP-ED, FR), for the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, will be recommending that Parliament give its qualified approval to newly proposed legislation aimed at deregulating package sizes for pre-packed products. Once implemented, the law is certain to affect a wide range of products available to all European consumers.
By deregulating current rules on packaging for all but a few basic product groups (and consolidating existing legislation in a single act), the Commission aims to optimise competition for industry and to ensure freedom of choice for consumers. The legislation, if adopted, would give industry the opportunity to produce -- and customers the chance to buy -- goods in a potentially infinite range of sizes. In doing so, it would simultaneously prevent Member States from legislating on pack sizes other than those still regulated by EC law.
Such across-the-board deregulation, in the Commission's view, is in line with its global aim of simplifying internal market legislation.
However, argues committee rapporteur Mr Toubon, " better regulation " should not necessarily mean " no regulation at all ". Fellow MEPs in the committee agreed and, while welcoming the Commission's initiative, decided to cut away at some of its scope. While the Commission had proposed to retain mandatory sizes for only a handful of goods (spirits, wines, soluble coffee, white sugar and most products sold in aerosols), committee members are proposing to retain them for six other product groups: drinking milk, butter, ground or unground roasted coffee, dried pasta, rice and brown sugar. Products such as these, as staples of the average consumer's diet, should only be sold in a restricted number of sizes, argue MEPs in the committee -- otherwise, consumers (especially the most disadvantaged ones) risk being misled into buying a cheaper bottle of milk or a cheaper stick of butter without realising that it contains a smaller volume.
Whereas the Commission had pushed for a 20-year limit on all such derogations, committee members adopted a more flexible approach, introducing a clause that would oblige the Commission to revisit the legislation after eight years. This, they claimed, is a more appropriate solution, given that no-one today can possibly predict the market conditions in 2025.
