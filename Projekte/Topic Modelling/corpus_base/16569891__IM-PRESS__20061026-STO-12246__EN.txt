Hungarian President László Sólyom addressed MEPs on Wednesday
On Wednesday MEPs debated the results of the informal EU summit at Lahti and passed a resolution in support of press freedom. They also called for an "independent and efficient" investigation of Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya’s murder. They voted on resolutions on the Schengen Information System II, breast cancer, culture programmes and the “peace process” in Spain. The President of Hungary László Sólyom addressed MEPs to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1956 Hungarian uprising.
Parliament's President Josep Borrell introduced Mr Sólyom as someone who has always tried to keep the positive "legacy of the1956 revolution alive“.
President Sólyom told the house of "the historic importance of the 1956 Hungarian revolution and its freedom fight". He called it a significant keystone for the Prague Spring of 1968 and finally the events of 1989 when the iron curtain and the Berlin Wall fell. He also thanked Austria, Germany and Poland for acts of generosity to Hungarian refugees at the time.
Results of the European Union summit of Lahti
MEPs debated last weekend's informal meeting of EU leaders at Lahti in Finland. Energy security and the EU's dependence on Russia's oil and gas were top of the agenda. The summit included a dinner with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Many MEPs supported President Borrell's comments at Lahti that the EU could not “exchange human rights for energy resources”. They also backed the creation of a new European Institute for Technology (EIT) - in the hope it will boost innovation in the EU. Immigration policy for the EU and justice and citizenship issues also featured. In light of the dinner with President Putin the recent murder of journalist Anna Politkovskaya was much discussed.
Resolution on press freedom
MEPs adopted a joint resolution on relations between EU and Russia after the recent assassination of the journalist Anna Politkovskaya. The resolution condemns the murder and raises concern “over the increasing intimidation, harassment and murder of independent journalists and other persons critical of the current government”. It says freedom of the press is an “essential element in the democratic development of a country” and one of the main requirements for the renewing the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and Russia in 2007.
Peace process in Spain
After some impassioned debate, MEPs narrowly adopted (by 10 votes) a joint resolution by the Socialist, Liberal, Greens and the European United Left groups on "the peace process in Spain". It expresses solidarity with the victims of terrorism and supports the fight against terrorism and the peace initiative in the Basque Country undertaken by the Spanish democratic institutions. It also welcomed the decision to fight terrorism by the force of democracy. An alternative resolution by the European People's Party and the Union for Europe of the Nations was rejected.
Screening across EU to fight breast cancer
MEPs called for breast cancer screening to be extended to cover all 25 EU members to fight a disease that kills 88,000 women a year. The resolution also calls for research into breast cancer prevention and treatment. A 2003 resolution called on EU countries to try and reduce the mortality rate by 25% within 5 years. This resolution calls for a progress report on that goal. October marks international breast cancer awareness month.
Schengen Information System II (SIS II)
The European Parliament backed practical steps that will allow countries that joined the EU in 2004 to join the Schengen border free area as soon as possible. However, they blocked a last minute request by the EU ministers that would have allowed national intelligence services to have access to the information stored in SIS II.
Town Twinning, lifelong learning, youth in action
The Parliament adopted three further culture and education programmes:
“Citizens for Europe” covers the twinning of towns with those in other countries, projects between people in different countries and the events.
Mobility for students and teachers in school, university, vocational training and adult education is the main aim of the "Lifelong Learning" programme over the next six years.
"Youth in Action" is a programme designed to promote "active citizenship" and mutual understanding among young people across Europe.
Sulfonates in furniture, pictures...
Perfluorooctane sulfonates: Not exactly a commonly known substance but in fact they are all around us in everyday materials like furniture, tissues and paintings. Scientific research has shown that they add to the greenhouse effect and pose a threat to human health as they can accumulate in the body. MEPs adopted a report that attempts to tighten the European Commission's plans to cut the use of these sulfonates. The report was drafted by Swedish green Carl Schlyter and calls for a limitation of their use as far as possible, with some exceptions.
