The EU's 2010 budget was approved at the second reading by the Budgets Committee on Wednesday. This vote confirmed the 18 November budget conciliation agreement with the Council of Ministers and retained Parliament's first-reading priorities, notably on energy and entrepreneurship.
Wednesday's vote sets the total 2010 budget at €141.453 billion in commitments and €122.937 billion in payments.
"I am happy that we have had a very broad agreement to confirm the conciliation and retain the priorities adopted by the European Parliament at its first reading in favour of the most effective programmes to make the European economy more competitive and have found the means to finance all the economic recovery plan operations foreseen for 2010" said committee chair Alain Lamassoure (EPP, FR), after the vote.
Funding the recovery plan
At its second reading, the committee confirmed the agreements reached with the Council of Ministers on 18 November on funding for the EU economic recovery plan and support for closing the Kozlodoy nuclear plant in Bulgaria. Most of this was covered by using unspent funds or fresh money from the Member States.
Parliament's part of the deal was to cut some of the increased funding it previously sought in heading 1A (competitiveness for growth and employment). Despite doing so, the committee still managed to increase the amounts originally proposed by the Commission (in its preliminary draft budget) for priority areas such as financial services, intelligent energy, energy research, lifelong learning and entrepreneurship.
The 2010 budget procedure was the last conducted under the Nice Treaty rules.

With the Lisbon Treaty, in force as of 1 December 2009, the European Parliament has important new lawmaking powers. Virtually all EU legislation is now decided by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers together - including agriculture, immigration, energy and the EU budget. As the only directly-elected EU institution, Parliament's position in making sure the EU is accountable to its citizens is also strengthened, for example by MEPs having a bigger say in appointments to many of the EU's top jobs. 20091130IPR65547 2010 budget conciliation: funding of economic recovery plan solved EP's first reading budget 2010 Parliament's thematic site on the Lisbon treaty, including information on EP's new budget powers Committee on Budgets web site
