Czech PM Jan Fischer closes the Czech presidency of the Union with a speech in the hemicycle. Strasbourg, 15 July Caretaker Czech Prime Minister Jan Fischer gave the European Parliament Wednesday an overview of his country's Presidency of the EU that came to an end last month. He conceded that the collapse of the government half way through the six month term had hit the Presidency hard. However, he praised the "Three E Programme" - Economics, Energy and EU in the world - which the Czechs had initiated.
The Czechs had to deal with a gas crisis at the start of January between Russia and Ukraine which threatened supplies to Europe. They also had to deal with the conflict in the Gaza strip early in their term.
Mr Fischer also told the House that the worsening of the economic and financial crisis affecting Europe had weakened the Presidency.

Despite the challenges he was insistent that the balance of the Czech tenure at the held of the EU would be judged positive. He said many of the issues will now be followed up by the Swedish presidency, especially in view of the ratification process of the Lisbon treaty.
On the cultural front, the Czech presidency will be certainly remembered for its controversial art installation "Entropa" in the Council of Ministers building in Brussels, portraying the 27 EU Member States in a humorous and provocative way. Entropa can now be seen on permanent exhibit in Prague.
