The European Parliament's proposal for its own operational budget for 2011 includes the financing of measures in preparation for enlargement with Croatia. Its amended budget for the current year 2010 provides for extra funding to enable MEPs to cope with the important increase in their powers resulting from the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty.
In a vote on Tuesday, Parliament put forward a 2011 operational budget of €1.7 billion, which is 1.2 % of the whole EU draft budget for 2011. The 5.5% increase proposed will among other things prepare the Parliament for Croatia joining the EU: if Croatian observer MEPs start next year their salaries will be paid by Croatia but the European Parliament will need to recruit Croatian staff to support the observers, in particular translators and interpreters.
Other increases to the 2011 budget will be needed as a result of the Lisbon Treaty. Eighteen new MEPs are expected to join the Parliament as a direct effect of the treaty. Their salaries will be paid by Parliament and other facilities will need to be provided. Parliament also plans to further reinforce its staff to make sure MEPs can cope with the significant new legislative responsibilities resulting from the treaty.
"The EP budget for 2011 is the first real budget for this House after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. This means that the Parliament has more powers, we have more tasks, we have a greater responsibility, we have more legislative duties, that is we need more work capacity and for this we need more budget funding", said Helga Trüpel (Greens/EFA, DE), Parliament's rapporteur, during the debate.
Parliament's final 2011 budget will be decided this autumn, when MEPs and Council together adopt the overall EU budget for 2011.
On Wednesday, MEPs adopted an adjustment to Parliament's 2010 budget, entailing the creation of 150 new posts and a €1500 monthly increase per MEP in the budget for hiring MEPs' staff. This adjustment was approved by the Council of Ministers on Tuesday. As Parliament's rapporteur for the EP 2010 budget, Slovak MEP Vladimír Maňka (S&D) oversaw the passage of this decision through Parliament.
