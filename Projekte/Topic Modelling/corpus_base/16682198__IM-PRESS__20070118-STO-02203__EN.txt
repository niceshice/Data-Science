Steps to improve the EU's railways featured on Thursday
Strasbourg; protecting the rights of rail passengers and improving access to Europe's railways were at the heart of a series of rail initiatives adopted by MEPs yesterday. Separately, MEPs united to condemned death sentences on 5 Bulgarian nurses and 1 Palestinian doctor accused of infecting children with HIV in Libya, called for tougher rules on arms exports and moves to cut road deaths. They also called for more women to be represented at senior levels in the Parliament.
Rail: MEPs support compensation for delays, more accessible trains
The report on railway passenger's rights adopted by MEPs recommends more information and more accessibility for rail travellers. This would include assistance to people with reduced mobility and removing any obstacles that make getting on and off trains awkward. Special areas for prams, bikes and sports equipment should be made available says the report. MEPs also support moves towards compensation fro delayed travellers.
Also included in the "3rd railway package" are proposals to increase safety requirements for train crews and support for opening up international passenger services to competition by 2010. However, no date was set for liberalising national rail services - a move support by Parliament's transport committee - but not by a majority of Members. MEPs also want all train crews to have safety certification whereas EU transport ministers want just drivers to hold this certificate. Given these differences, the railway package is now expected to go to "conciliation" procedure where representatives of the Parliament and EU members will attempt to find a compromise.
MEPs condemn death sentences on medics in Libya
In a resolution passed by a huge majority, MEPs united to condemn the death sentences passed on 5 Bulgarians nurses and 1 Palestinian doctor. They were convicted of infecting 400 children with the AIDS virus in a Benghazi hospital in 1999. They have always claimed their innocence and their supporters say they are being made scapegoats for failures in Libya's health system. The Parliament's resolution expresses "full solidarity with the victims" and calls on Tripoli to annul the sentences.
MEPs seek tougher rules on Arms trade
Parliament adopted an annual report on the implementation of the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports. The own-initiative report by Raül Romeva of the Green group calls for the currently voluntary code to become legally binding. The report urges EU members "to keep under constant review the human rights situation in arms importing countries," and to "agree on a list of countries involved in armed conflicts to which arms exports should be banned in principle."
It calls for the continuation of the arms embargo against China "until there is a clear and lasting improvement in the situation regarding human rights and social and political freedoms", and demands stronger EU support for an international Arms Trade Treaty. Along with the US and China, the EU is the world's largest exporter of arms.
Cutting road fatalities by 20,000 a year
On average 40,000 people die a year on the roads of the European Union. Halving this figure by 2010 is the gaol of the EU's "Road Safety Action programme". However, according to a report of Transport Committee there is a lack progress thus far. The report calls for enforcing the existing legislation and makes a series of recommendations, e.g.:
an EU wide zero alcohol limit for new drivers,
harmonising road signs in Europe,
promoting new technologies like seat belt reminders, alcohol interlocks and speed limitation systems.
Getting more women into the work of the Parliament
A report adopted yesterday by MEPs calls for more women to be represented within the administration of the Parliament. In the Parliament itself the number of female MEPs has risen from just over 17% after the first direct elections in 1979 to 30.4% in 2007 The report adopted yesterday by Anna Záborská of the European People's Party suggests the following approach:
having one specially trained official per committee,
providing the committees with indicators, data and statistics,
allocating budget resources.
