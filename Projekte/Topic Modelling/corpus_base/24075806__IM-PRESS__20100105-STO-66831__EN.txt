82-year old Russian human rights activist Lyudmila Alexeyeva next to EP President Jerzy Buzek (right), December 2009 Some New Year goodwill was lacking from the Moscow police force when they briefly arrested some 50 human rights activists on 31 December. Among them was 82-year old Lyudmila Alexeyeva who in December was awarded Parliament's Sakharov human rights prize. They were detained whilst trying to prove their right to enjoy Article 31 of the Russian Constitution which guarantees the right to freedom of assembly.
In a statement the man who handed her the prize, Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek, said he was "deeply disappointed and shocked" and found the police action "absolutely disproportionate".
He went on to say that "in a democratic country, people should have right to organise protests, even against governments and authorities. Freedom of speech and expression is one of our basic human rights."
Writing on her blog after the arrest, Lyudmila Alexeyeva said that her arrest violated article 31 of the Russian Constitution and she demanded an apology from the authorities. With a small group of sympathisers she demonstrates at the end of every month to draw attention to the right to assembly which she feels is not respected by the Kremlin.
In her blog she promised legal help to those detained near Moscow's Triumph square. The good news for most of the demonstrators was that they were released from custody prior to midnight. The next march is planned for 31 January.
