Michaela FINDEIS BXL (+32) 2 28 31141 STR (+33) 3 881 72076 PORT (+32) 498 98 33 32 EMAIL tran-press@europarl.europa.eu The ambition of Debora Serracchiani (S&D, IT), rapporteur on the recast of railway liberalisation rules, is to help rail to develop and regain the ground it has lost to other modes of transport. Whilst this opening of the markets does not go far enough for some MEPs, others fear that it could lead to a disorganisation of the railways, to the detriment of quality of service and working conditions.
