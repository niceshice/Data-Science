Briefing - 12-15 February 2007 - Strasbourg
2007-02-07 - 19:08
The February plenary session will see Parliament's President Hans-Gert Poettering make his inaugural address setting out his priorities for the next two and a half years until the European elections in June 2009. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Commission President José Manuel Barroso will respond. Parliament will also turn its attention (with a debate and vote) to the final report from the Temporary Committee investigating the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners. The House will also debate and vote on a resolution on the forthcoming European Council on the Lisbon strategy to be held in Brussels on 8 and 9 March. On Wednesday at midday, the Italian President Giorgio Napolitano will address the House in a formal sitting. Among the legislative highlights is Caroline Jackson's (EPP-ED, UK) report on the revision of the framework directive on waste.
Monday 12 February
Monday starts off with a debate on a conciliation agreement on spatial information . Europe needs better map-based information to support its policies, especially on the environment. A new database designed to achieve this - known as INSPIRE - could be in place by early 2009. Parliament and the Council have struck a deal which will enable data to be shared across the EU, without undermining high quality services in the Member States.
The House will then focus on tabling two reports on waste from the Environment Committee. The first, authored by Caroline Jackson (EPP-ED, UK) on a draft directive from the European Commission, puts forward binding targets for reducing waste by 2010 and rejects Commission proposals to modify the existing five-stage "waste hierarchy"; the second looks at the Commission's proposed long-term strategy for preventing and recycling waste.
Also on Monday, MEPs will be asking the questions to the Commission on EU restrictions on liquids that passengers can carry on aircraft. Questions include whether the Commission carried out an evaluation of information and evidence presented by the United Kingdom's secret services upon requesting these restrictions.
Tuesday 13 February
At 10am on Tuesday, EP President Hans-Gert Poettering will make his inaugural speech on the priorities of his two and a half year mandate. German Chancellor and Council President-in-office Angela Merkel and Commission President José Manuel Barroso will participate in the debate which follows . All former Presidents of the Parliament have been invited to attend.
A highlight of this week's session will be the Tuesday afternoon debate with the Council Presidency and Commission President José Manuel Barroso on the - chiefly economic - issues to be discussed at the European Council meeting of 8-9 March in Brussels .
On Tuesday evening, the House debates the reform of the wine sector with the Agriculture committee recommending retaining distillation measures for now, empowering Member States to restrict grubbing-up of vines, and liberalising planting rights only gradually. It also advocates strict labelling rules and maintaining current regulations on acceptable winemaking practices. MEPs will also be asked to reject, for a second time, a European Commission proposal that would have allowed Member States to divert some Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) direct farm payments to rural development spending .
Fiona Hall (ALDE, UK) will table a non-binding report on a European policy on radio spectrum . The Industry Committee is calling for a "sustainable" approach to the use of radio spectrum in Europe so as to promote competition and innovative technologies, inhibit the hoarding of frequency rights and the power of monopolies and benefit consumers. MEPs say this approach should take account of technological change as well as the needs of market players and the public.
Wednesday 14 February
From 9am on Wednesday, the European Parliament will debate (vote also on Wednesday) the final report from the Temporary Committee investigating the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners . The committee deplores the passivity of some Member States in the face of illegal CIA operations as well as a lack of co-operation from the EU Council of Ministers. In fact, MEPs in the committee want the Council to launch a formal inquiry under EU Treaty Article 7 on breaches of fundamental rights.
The votes are due to start at 11.30am on Wednesday. During the votes, the House will vote on a resolution on climate change which u nderlines that the transport sector has the largest increase in energy consumption with road transport contributing to roughly 25% of the Community CO2 emission and the resolution therefore calls for a boost in public transport.
At midday on Wednesday, President Giorgio Napolitano of Italy will address the House in a formal sitting .
On Wednesday afternoon, there will be a joint debate on employment and the economy . Europe should take advantage of the present improvement in economic growth to make the changes and investment needed to enhance its potential growth rates for the longer term, so as to be able to generate more employment. This is the key message of a report from the Economics Committee on the EU’s Broad Economic Policy Guidelines.
Wednesday evening sees MEPs debating a report from the Fisheries Committee report on the implementation of the EU action plan against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing . The report points out that the Green Paper on a new maritime policy could serve as a framework for cooperation on the basis of which the fight against illegal fishing might be more effective. The committee also asks the Commission to publish blacklists of fishing vessels and to consider the idea of establishing an EU coastguard.
The last point on Wednesday evening is a question to the Commission on the free-circulation of Roma people within EU borders.
Thursday 15 February
On Thursday, the House will debate two reports from the Economics Committee. The first is on the 2005 annual report of the European Investment Bank with its President, Philippe Maystadt . The second is on the macro-economic impact of the increase in the price of energy. Europe should act now to prevent increasing energy prices damaging Europe’s economy. The Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee says that if no action is taken, Europe’s dependency on energy imports will rise from 50 per cent today to 71 per cent in 2030. The committee is calling for a massive investment in energy infrastructure and supply and new measures to improve energy-efficiency.
As is usual, the plenary session ends with three debates and votes on resolutions relating to human rights in the world. On this occasion, the topics are:
Dialogue between the Chinese government and envoys of the Dalai Lama
Humanitarian situation of refugees from Iraq
The situation in Guinea

President Giorgio Napolitano of Italy to address the House in a formal sitting
2007-02-07 - 19:08
President of the Republic of Italy and former MEP, Giorgio Napolitano will address the House in a formal sitting at midday on Wednesday 14 February. Giorgio Napolitano was born in Naples on June 29th, 1925. He graduated in law from Naples University in December 1947, with a dissertation on political economy entitled Il mancato sviluppo industriale del Mezzogiorno dopo l'unità e la legge speciale per Napoli del 1904 (The Failure to Bring about Industrial Development in Southern Italy after Italy's Unification and Special Legislation for Naples in 1904). In 1945-46 he engaged actively in the Student Faculty Councils movement, and was a delegate to the first National University Congress.
In 1942, as un undergraduate in Naples, he joined a group of young anti-Fascists and in 1945 he joined the Italian Communist Party, of which he was a militant and then a leading figure until the Democratic Party of the Left was established. From the autumn of 1946 to the spring of 1948 he was a member of the Secretariat of the Italian Economic Centre for Southern Italy, chaired by Senator Paratore. He took also an active part for over 10 years in the Movement for the Rebirth of Southern Italy, since its foundation in December 1947. He was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for the first time in 1953, and with the exception of the 4th Parliament he was a Member of Parliament until 1996, always re-elected in the Naples constituency.
His parliamentary activity began as a member of the Budget and State Holdings Committee, and focused - also in debates on the Floor of the House - on the issues of Southern Italy’s development and national economic policy. In the 8th (from 1981) and 9th Parliaments (until 1986) he chaired the Communist group at the Chamber of Deputies.
From June 1999 to June 2004 he chaired the Constitutional Affairs Committee of the European Parliament. In the 14th Parliament the then Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Pier Ferdinando Casini, appointed him as Chairman of the Foundation of the Chamber of Deputies, an office which he held until the end of that Parliament.
On September 23rd 2005 he was appointed life senator by the President of the Republic, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. On May 10th 2006 he was elected President of the Republic with 543 votes. He was sworn-in on May 15th, 2006.
His latest book Dal PCI al socialismo europeo: un'autobiografia politica (From the PCI to European Socialism: a Political Autobiography) was published in 2005. 12 noon, 14.02.2007 Biography of the Italian President Profile from the European Parliament

Member States' passivity in the face of illegal CIA operations deplored
2007-02-07 - 19:08
The Temporary Committee on CIA activities in Europe will be tabling a hard-hitting final report to the February plenary. The committee deplores the passivity of some Member States in the face of illegal CIA operations as well as a lack of co-operation from the EU Council of Ministers. In fact, MEPs want the Council to launch a formal inquiry under EU Treaty Article 7 on breaches of fundamental rights. Over a thousand CIA-operated flights used European airspace in 2001-05 and "temporary secret detention facilities in European countries may have been located at US military bases" in Europe, says the draft report, which was adopted in committee by 28 votes to 17 with 3 abstentions. It adds that European countries have been "turning a blind eye" to flights operated by the CIA which, "on some occasions, were being used for extraordinary rendition or the illegal transportation of detainees." All this is supposed to have taken place as part of the "war on terror".
The Temporary Committee therefore "expects the Council to start hearings and commission an independent investigation without delay, as foreseen in EU Treaty Article 7", and, "where necessary, to impose sanctions on Member States in case of a serious and persistent breach of Article 6".
"Not possible" to point to secret detention centres in Poland
In an amendment passed by a single vote (23 in favour, 22 against), MEPs state that from the available "circumstantial evidence", "it is not possible to acknowledge that secret detention centres were based in Poland." But the report notes that the names of "seven of the fourteen detainees" transferred from a secret detention facility to Guantánamo in September 2006 match those listed in a report by ABC News which identified the twelve top Al Qaeda suspects held in Poland.
From testimony gathered on their visit to Poland, MEPs conclude that the Polish Parliament's investigation was not conducted independently and that statements to their delegation were “contradictory” and compromised by "confusion about flight logs [...] which were first said not to have been retained, then said to have probably been archived at the airport, and finally to have been sent by the Polish government to the Council of Europe".
CIA flights
“At least 1,245 flights operated by the CIA flew into European airspace or stopped over at European airports between the end of 2001 and the end of 2005”, although, as MEPs emphasise, “not all those flights have been used for extraordinary rendition”.
Documents published by rapporteur Claudio Fava (PES, IT) also indicate “strong evidence of the extraordinary renditions analysed by the committee, as well as of the companies linked to the CIA (…) and the European countries in which the CIA made stopovers”. In their draft report, MEPs mention up to 21 well-documented cases of extraordinary rendition in which rendition victims were transferred through a European country or were residents in a European state at the time of their kidnapping. The report therefore "calls on the countries of Europe to compensate their innocent victims of extraordinary renditions".
MEPs see these renditions “as an illegal instrument used by the USA in the fight against terrorism” and condemn the “acceptance and concealing of the practice, on several occasions, by the secret services and governmental authorities of certain European countries”. They call on the Council and the Member States "to issue a clear and forceful declaration calling on the US Administration to put an end to the practice of extraordinary arrests and renditions".
Use of torture
The report notes that the renditions investigated by the committee “in the majority of cases involved incommunicado detention and torture” during interrogations, as was confirmed by the victims - or their lawyers - who testified to the committee. According to the testimony of former UK ambassador to Uzbekistan Craig Murray, the exchange of intelligence obtained under torture by third countries' secret services to the British services was a practice known and tolerated by the UK government.
In the light of the available evidence, note MEPs, there is a "strong possibility that some European countries may have received [...] information obtained under torture".
Reluctance to co-operate
MEPs also deplore “the lack of co-operation of many Member States and of the Council of the EU towards the temporary committee” and explain that “the serious lack of concrete answers to the questions raised by victims, NGOs, media and parliamentarians has only strengthened the validity of already well-documented allegations”. The Council initially withheld -- and then provided only partial fragments of -- information pertaining to regular discussions with high-level US officials. The report calls this behaviour "totally unacceptable". Such "shortcomings" of the Council, it says, "implicate all Member State governments, since they have collective responsibility as members of the Council". In fact, the Treaty-based "principle of loyal cooperation [...] which binds Member States and EU institutions to take any measures to ensure the fulfilment of the European obligations, such as the respect of human rights, [...] has not been respected".
The national governments specifically criticised for their unwillingness to co-operate with Parliament's investigations are those of Austria, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Britain. From the UK, only European affairs minister Geoff Hoon appeared before the committee. Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett, Defence Secretary Des Browne, Home Secretary John Reid and the heads of MI5 and MI6 all failed to attend despite being requested to do so.
The report also gives detailed evidence of investigations of illegal rendition or CIA flight cases involving Bosnia, Cyprus, Denmark, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), Germany, Greece, Ireland, Romania, Spain, Sweden and Turkey.
MEPs also complain about “omissions” in statements by Javier Solana, the Council's High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, regarding the Council’s discussions on fighting terrorism with US representatives. Mr Solana, they add, “was unable to supplement the evidence already in the possession of the temporary committee”. The same goes for EU Counter-terrorism Co-ordinator Gijs de Vries, who, MEPs concluded, was “unable to give satisfactory answers”. With this in mind, MEPs took the view that the competences and powers of the Counter-terrorism Co-ordinator should be strengthened and monitored by the European Parliament.
Policy recommendations
Looking ahead to the end of the committee's mandate, and acknowledging that its conclusions are not "exhaustive", the report encourages governments and/or national parliaments to launch (or to pursue) independent investigations. MEPs also ask the EP Civil Liberties Committee to follow up the proceedings of the Temporary Committee, to monitor developments and, if necessary, to recommend sanctions under EU Treaty Article 7 against Member States found to be in breach of EU fundamental rights.
Lastly, the report calls for the closure of Guantánamo and urges EU states "to immediately seek the return of their citizens and residents who are being held illegally by US authorities".
Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty
Article 6(1) of the Treaty on European Union states "The Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law, principles which are common to the Member States".
The EP committee is urging the Council to investigate the CIA affair pursuant to Article 7(2) of the Treaty, which states that the Council may "determine the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a Member State of principles mentioned in Article 6(1)". The Council may then decide to suspend certain rights of the Member State in question, including voting rights in the Council.
Paragraphs in full relating to the United Kingdom (67-78)
THE UNITED KINGDOM
67. Deplores the manner in which the UK Government, as represented by its Minister for Europe, cooperated with the Temporary Committee; is extremely surprised at the letter of the Minister sent to Parliament's President,
68. Thanks the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Extraordinary Renditions (APPG), comprising members of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, for its work and for providing the Temporary Committee delegation to London with a number of highly valuable documents;
69. Condemns the extraordinary rendition of Bisher Al-Rawi, an Iraqi citizen and resident of the United Kingdom, and Jamil El-Banna, a Jordanian citizen and resident of the United Kingdom, who were arrested by Gambian authorities in Gambia in November 2002, turned over to US agents, and flown to Afghanistan and then to Guantánamo, where they remain detained without trial or any form of judicial assistance;
70. Points out that the telegrams from the UK security service MI5 to an unspecified foreign government which were released to the Chairman of the APPG, Andrew Tyrie, suggest that the abduction of Bisher Al-Rawi and Jamil El-Banna was facilitated by partly erroneous information supplied by the UK security service;
71. Criticises the unwillingness of the UK Government to provide consular assistance to Bisher Al-Rawi and Jamil El-Banna on the grounds that they are not UK citizens;
72. Condemns the multiple extraordinary rendition of Binyam Mohammed, Ethiopian citizen and resident of the United Kingdom; points out that Binyam Mohammed has been held in at least two secret detention facilities, in addition to military prisons;
73. Is deeply disturbed by the testimony of Binyam Mohammed's lawyer, who gave an account of the most horrific torture endured by his client to the official delegation of the Temporary Committee to the United Kingdom;
74. Emphasises that the former UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Jack Straw, conceded in December 2005 that UK intelligence officials met Binyam Mohammed when he was arrested in Pakistan; points out in this respect that some of the questions put by the Moroccan officials to Binyam Mohammed appear to have been inspired by information supplied by the UK;
75. Condemns the extraordinary rendition of UK citizen Martin Mubanga, who met the official delegation of the Temporary Committee to the United Kingdom, and who was arrested in Zambia in March 2002 and subsequently flown to Guantánamo; regrets the fact that Martin Mubanga was interrogated by British officials at Guantánamo, where he was detained and tortured for four years without trial or any form of judicial assistance and then released without charge;
76. Thanks Craig Murray, former UK Ambassador to Uzbekistan, for his very valuable testimony to the Temporary Committee on the exchange of intelligence obtained under torture and for providing a copy of the legal opinion of Michael Wood, former legal advisor to the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office;
77. Is outraged by Michael Wood's legal opinion, according to which 'receiving or possessing' information extracted under torture, in so far as there is no direct participation in the torture, is not per se prohibited by the UN Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; expresses its outrage at any attempt to obtain information by means of torture, regardless of who is involved;
78. Expresses serious concern about the 170 stopovers made by CIA-operated aircraft at UK airports, which on many occasions came from or were bound for countries linked with extraordinary rendition circuits and the transfer of detainees; deplores the stopovers at UK airports of aircraft which have been shown to have been used by the CIA, on other occasions, for the extraordinary rendition of Bisher Al-Rawi, Jamil El-Banna, Abou Elkassim Britel, Khaled El-Masri, Binyam Mohammed, Abu Omar and Maher Arar and for the expulsion of Ahmed Agiza and Mohammed El Zari.
Paragraphs relating to Ireland in full (121 -126)
IRELAND
121. Welcomes the testimony given to the Temporary Committee by the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Irish Government as well as his unequivocal criticism of the process of extraordinary rendition; notes the fact, however, that he failed to answer all the questions in relation to the concerns that Irish airports may have been used by CIA aircraft travelling to or from extraordinary rendition missions (as in the case of Abu Omar);
122. Thanks the Irish Human Rights Commission (IHRC) for its testimony to the Temporary Committee and endorses its view which considers that acceptance by the Irish government of diplomatic assurances do not fulfil Ireland's human rights obligations, which oblige the government actively to seek to prevent any actions that could in any way facilitate torture or ill-treatment in Ireland or abroad; regrets the decision of the Irish Government not to follow the IHRC's advice on this matter to date; notes that there is continuing dialogue between the IHRC and the Irish Government;
123. Expresses serious concern about the 147 stopovers made by CIA-operated aircraft at Irish airports that on many occasions came from or were bound for countries linked with extraordinary rendition circuits and the transfer of detainees; deplores the stopovers in Ireland of aircraft which have been shown to have been used by the CIA, on other occasions, for the extraordinary rendition of Bisher Al-Rawi, Jamil El-Banna, Abou Elkassim Britel, Khaled El-Masri, Binyam Mohammed, Abu Omar and Maher Arar and for the expulsion of Ahmed Agiza and Mohammed El Zari;
124. Notes the absence of Irish parliamentary scrutiny of either Irish or foreign intelligence services and the potential that this creates for abuse;
125. Considers, that, in the absence of a system of random searches, a ban should be imposed on all CIA-operated aircraft landing in Ireland;
126. Urges the Irish Government, in view of the findings of the Temporary Committee, to agree to launch a parliamentary inquiry into the use of Irish territory as part of the CIA rendition circuit.

Easier travel between EU and Russia
2007-02-07 - 19:08
The Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs Committee will ask the House to approve two reports on facilitating the movement of people between Russia and the EU. This is the first serious attempt to put flesh on the agreement reached by the two sides, at the St Petersburg Summit in 2003, to strengthen their relationship by creating a common area of freedom, security and justice. In the two consultation reports, drafted by Maria Esteves (EPP-ED, PT), the committee supports without amendment an agreement concluded with Russia on the issuance of short-stay visas to foster travel by citizens in both directions, and another agreement on ensuring the readmission of illegal immigrants by Russia. The reports were adopted in committee by 41 votes to 3 with no abstentions.
The readmission agreement between the European Community and Russia is the fifth of this kind to have been negotiated and concluded by the EU with a third country. In the case of Russia, the two agreements are linked and should be signed and enter into force at the same time.
In her explanatory statement Maria Esteves argues that any agreement on visas with Russia should be based on genuine conditions of reciprocity but that visas for EU citizens wishing to enter Russia are currently subject to complex compulsory registration and people wishing to travel to Siberia or the Chechen Republic - for example journalists - require additional authorisation and must pay a supplementary fee, whereas a Schengen short-stay visa allows Russians unrestricted travel within the Schengen zone. She also notes the difficulties encountered by journalists, NGOs and members of the clergy in obtaining and renewing visas for Russia in recent years.

MEPs to vote on a resolution on Passenger Name Records and SWIFT
2007-02-07 - 19:08
MEPs will also vote on a joint resolution on Wednesday on the Passenger Name Records and SWIFT cases following the debate held during the plenary session last month in Brussels. The joint draft resolution s tresses that during the last few years several agreements initiated by US requirements and adopted without any involvement of the European Parliament, notably that of PNR and SWIFT, the existence of the US Automated Targeting System (ATS) has led to a situation of legal uncertainty with regard to the necessary data protection guarantees for sharing and transferring data between the EU and the US, for purposes of public security and notably for preventing and fighting terrorism.
The draft also says that MEPs b elieve that since such international agreements concern fundamental rights of EU as well as US citizens, the European Parliament and the national parliaments of the Member States should be fully involved as should the US Congress.
SWIFT
On SWIFT, the draft joint resolution r eaffirms its concern that for four years SWIFT, upon reception of subpoenas, has been giving access to the US administration to all data treated in its system, including data that did not concern US citizens and data not generated on the US territory, based on the purely commercial choice to have a systematic duplication of the data onto a mirroring information system based in the US, in violation of European and national data protection legislation. It c alls on the Commission which has competence both on data protection and on payment systems legislation to analyse the potential for economic and business espionage stemming from the current design of payment system in the broadest meaning, thus including notably messaging providers, and to report on ways to tackle it.

European Council
Looking ahead to the Spring Summit - debate with Council and Commission
2007-02-07 - 19:08
A highlight of this week's session will be Tuesday's debate with the Council Presidency and Commission President José Manuel Barroso on the - chiefly economic - issues to be discussed at the European Council meeting of 8-9 March in Brussels. The EU heads of state and government meeting at the summit will look essentially at the Lisbon Strategy, whose goal, as laid down at the Lisbon summit in 2000, was to make the EU into the world's most competitive and dynamic economy by 2010. Results at the halfway stage were disappointing and the strategy was refocused and relaunched at the March 2005 spring summit.
This year's summit is expected to note that the strategy is now bearing fruit but also to call for action in areas including financial and economic policy, the internal market (including financial markets) and innovation, research and education.
The EU leaders will also be asked to adopt an EU Energy Action Plan to tackle the problems of secure supplies, competitiveness and environmental sustainability. Lastly they are due to discuss protection of the climate and emissions trading.
After its debate on Wednesday, Parliament will vote on Thursday on a resolution on the Lisbon Strategy, to send the summit a signal regarding MEPs' wishes. This resolution can be expected to draw on the debate which took place at a meeting held on 5-6 February to discuss the future of the Lisbon Strategy by MEPs and members of EU national parliaments. That meeting focused on three key areas: sustainable energy; the internal market and innovation; human capital (education, job creation and social aspects).

Recycling Europe's waste policy
2007-02-07 - 19:08
The Environment Committee is tabling two reports to the House aimed at tackling Europe's growing mountain of waste. The first, on a draft directive from the European Commission, puts forward binding targets for reducing waste and rejects Commission proposals to modify the existing five-stage "waste hierarchy"; the second looks at the Commission's proposed long-term strategy for preventing and recycling waste. Around 500kg of waste is produced per person per year in Europe. Less than a third of it is recycled and the trend is for waste production to increase faster than GDP.
The two Commission texts aimed at tackling this problem are:
Waste directive (codecision, first reading). This is a revision of the 1975 Waste Framework Directive. It aims to enhance the latter's clarity and efficiency as well as strengthening standards and defining objectives. It simplifies the existing legal framework by repealing the Waste Oil Directive (1975) and incorporating the Hazardous Waste Directive (1991).
Thematic Strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste . This paper proposes long-term guidelines to turn Europe into a recycling society which tries to reduce waste production and use waste as a resource.
Waste directive
In September 2005, the European Commission proposed an overhaul of the 1975 directive, largely in order to lay down rules on recycling and to require Member States to draw up binding national programmes for cutting waste production.
The EP report on this draft directive was drafted by Caroline Jackson (EPP-ED, UK) and adopted by the Environment Committee by 48 votes to 6 with 2 abstentions under the co-decision procedure, first reading. The committee adopted nearly 140 amendments to the Commission text, including 14 compromise amendments negotiated by Mrs Jackson, which were all approved by a large majority.
Key amendments
• Prevention is the key, believes the committee. It calls for waste production to be stabilised by 2012 at the levels obtaining in 2008 . This is the first time the EP has introduced a legally binding target for stabilisation of waste. The Commission is required to submit (by 2008) a list of indicators to enable Member States to monitor their progress, to formulate (by 2010) a product eco-design policy and an action plan seeking to change consumption patterns and to set (by 2010) further qualitative and quantitative waste reduction objectives for 2020 .
• MEPs support the existing five-stage "hierarchy of waste ". The Commission's proposal would introduce a new concept of "life-cycle thinking" to give some room for manoeuvre when choosing the option which causes the least environmental impact (e.g. re-use or recycling of waste). But MEPs prefer to stick "as a general rule" to the current waste hierarchy, which ranks treatments in five categories - albeit without binding force - from the most to the least environmentally-sound:
- prevention and reduction of waste;
- re-use of waste;
- recycling of waste (less than a third of waste is recycled today);
- other recovery operations;
- safe and environmentally sound disposal.
However, the committee does believe Member States should be allowed to depart from these priorities under strict conditions: "when life-cycle assessments and cost-benefit analyses indicate clearly that an alternative treatment option shows a better record".
• MEPs are also calling for various clarifications in the directive including:
- a clear distinction between waste and useable by-products such as glass, metal or compost.
- a distinction between "disposal" (landfill or burning without energy recovery) and "recovery" (re-use of the energy), with the aim of promoting the latter.
Other amendments
• Uncontaminated excavated materials which could be used in their natural state should not fall within the scope of the directive, says the committee.
• Definitions of prevention, recycling and recovery are proposed.
• A new article is proposed on traceability and control of hazardous waste from production to final destination.
• The principle of producer responsibility is introduced, with suggestions for implementing it: take-back obligations, information for consumers saying how far the product is recyclable, requests to producers concerning materials and design, separate collection of the products at the end of their lives.
• To simplify the requirements for national waste management programmes and make them more compatible with the subsidiarity principle, MEPs say the requirement for Member States to ensure that "all waste undergoes recovery operations " should apply " where practicable ".
• National authorities must ensure that the collection, production and transportation of hazardous waste, as well as its storage and treatment, are carried out in optimum conditions for environmental protection. Mineral waste oils must be collected separately. And all hazardous waste treatment installations must have a permit.
Thematic strategy
The waste strategy is one of the seven thematic strategies required under the 6th Environment Action programme (EAP 2002-2012). This strategy aims to promote the prevention of waste, strengthen recycling activities, modernise and simplify waste legislation, improve its implementation and improve the recycling market. It requires Member States to develop national waste prevention programmes and encourage them to use economic instruments, such as landfill taxes, to promote other ways of managing waste.
In an own-initiative report drafted by Johannes Blokland (IND/DEM, NL), and adopted by the Environment Committee by 51 votes to 0 with no abstentions, MEPs approved a package of recommendations to the strategy.
MEPs deplore "the lack of quantitative and qualitative reduction targets covering all relevant waste, which were indicated as one of the priority actions in the 6th EAP" and say that "many concrete implementing measures and instruments are still missing". Since the Commission does not propose new legislation, MEPs call for:
- a revision of the waste incineration directive;
- waste prevention measures in the field of product policy, chemicals policy and eco-design;
- measures to promote re-use and repair activities;
- separate directives on biodegradable waste, construction and demolition waste, sewage sludge and PVC;
- a revision of the landfill directive with a clear timetable concerning a ban on landfill of various products.
The committee also demands that, in waste policy, the Commission's use of comitology (implementing decisions taken by committees of experts) be restricted to technical and scientific matters.
United Kingdom - Some statistics from Defra
According to the UK Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, in England and Wales alone the combination of industry, commerce and household waste amounts to over 100 million tonnes annually and is growing at around 3% each year. Provisional figures show that in 2004/05 English households recycled more than a fifth of their waste (approaching 23%) - but this is one of the lowest rates in Europe. The target is to increase this to 25% by 2005/06 and to reduce the amount of biodegradable municipal waste landfilled, in accordance with European Directives.
The UK is still a long way behind many of its European neighbours, who recycle well over half their municipal waste. There is a huge discrepancy in local authority performance, with the worst still only recycling in single percentage figures.

Better geographical data: conciliation agreement on INSPIRE
2007-02-07 - 19:08
Europe needs better map-based information to support its policies, especially on the environment. A new database designed to achieve this - known as INSPIRE - could be in place by early 2009. Parliament and the Council have struck a deal which will enable data to be shared across the EU, without undermining high quality services in the Member States. This deal will be debated and voted on in Strasbourg. INSPIRE (Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the Community), a project put forward by the European Commission in July 2004, aims to pool and improve the standard of geographical data generated in the various EU Member States (such as satellite images, temperature records, rainfall levels) in order to improve the planning and implementation of Community policies in areas such as the environment, transport, energy and agriculture. This should lead to better understanding of problems such as floods or air and water pollution, which recognise no national borders.
After two readings by Parliament and Council under the co-decision procedure, the chief points of disagreement remaining between MEPs and EU governments were intellectual property rights, derogations to the sharing of spatial data and the financial viability of publicly owned bodies. All these points were settled at a conciliation meeting on 21 November 2006, with the outcome being described as a "fantastic result" by Frieda Brepoels (EPP-ED, BE), who piloted the legislation through Parliament. "We had hoped for an agreement at first reading but meanwhile our proposal developed", she said.
Data protection, confidentiality and intellectual property rights
Parliament successfully insisted that the directive should not conflict with the provisions of the Aarhus Convention on access to environmental information nor with Directive 2003/4/EC by which the convention is implemented in the EU - a point stressed by the chair of the EP delegation to the Conciliation Committee, Alejo Vidal-Quadras (EPP-ED, ES). In this connection, the Council agreed to drop its amendment seeking to allow broad derogations to the application of the 2003 directive on grounds of confidentiality of statistics or of personal data, the wording of the amendment being judged too vague by MEPs. This decision was, according to the negotiators, one of the keys to reaching an agreement.
However, Member States will, for example, be able to restrict public access to network consultation services displaying panoramic views where there is a risk to international relations, public security or national defence. They will also be allowed to limit access to e-commerce services on a range of grounds (confidentiality of proceedings of public authorities; international relations, public security or national defence; confidentiality of commercial information; intellectual property rights; confidentiality of personal data; protection of any person who supplied the information requested on a voluntary basis; protection of the environment).
The agreed text also states that INSPIRE does not affect the existence or ownership of public authorities' intellectual property rights.
Guaranteeing the financial viability of public services
At Parliament's insistence, the Member States will have to make available free of charge the services for discovering and, subject to certain specific conditions, viewing spatial data sets.
However, because some Member States were concerned about the financial sustainability of their weather forecasting services, a derogation to the principle of free public access will allow the public authorities to levy charges "where such charges are securing the maintenance of spatial data sets and corresponding data services, especially in cases involving large volumes of frequently updated data".
More generally, the question of ensuring the financial viability of public services for supplying spatial data was another key point of the agreement. Under the compromise, Member States may allow public authorities which supply spatial data sets "to license them to, and/or require payment from, the public authorities or institutions and bodies of the Community" which use them. However, any such charges and licences "must be fully compatible with the general aim of facilitating the sharing of spatial data" and must "be kept to the minimum required to ensure the necessary quality and supply of spatial data sets and services together with a reasonable return on investment". Moreover, spatial data provided under Community legislation relating to the environment may not be subject to charging.

Vote on resolution on climate change
2007-02-07 - 19:08
Following the debate held on 31 January in Brussels on the pressing subject of climate change, MEPs will vote on a resolution on the subject. The draft resolution stresses the urgency to take concrete actions at a global level to tackle climate change, as well as the need for political leadership to drive the process forward. The draft resolution welcomes, in this context, the fact that both the European Commission and the Presidency-in-office have put climate change at the core of their political agenda. The draft urges the European Union to maintain its leading role in the negotiations in view of a post-2012 international framework on climate change and to maintain a high level of ambition in future discussions with its international partners.
The draft resolution stresses the need to significantly accelerate international negotiations on the post-2012 framework so as to ensure that there is no gap between the first and the second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol and give the international community time to plan the necessary measures.
CO2 emissions and public transport
The resolution underlines that the transport sector has the largest increase in energy consumption; road transport contributes to roughly 25% of the Community CO2 emissions and therefore, calls for the boost in public transport. The resolution welcomes the proposal of a binding target to increase the level of renewable energy in the EU energy mix to 25% by 2020. Debated on : 31.01.2007

EU restrictions on liquids that passengers can carry on aircraft
2007-02-07 - 19:08
MEPs from the PES, ALDE, GUE/NGL and Greens / EFA groups will be asking the Commission the questions below on EU restrictions on liquids that passengers can carry on aircraft. During the March plenary, MEPs are expected to vote on a resolution on this topic. At the end of the text are links to the questions from the various groups. The Council has adopted Commission Regulation (EC) No 1448/2006 on aviation security containing a secret annex with restrictive measures on liquids that passengers are allowed to carry on aircraft in their hand luggage.
Can the Commission explain and illustrate:
How can the secrecy of the annex comply with the democratic principle of publicity of the laws? What sanctions are applied in the event of refusal to follow or breach of the rules? How is it intended to avoid arbitrariness in the practical implementation of a secret rule and its exceptions?
Does this text provide for the right for information and the right of appeal of the passenger? How can airline passengers contest decisions and sanctions taken on the basis of the new hand luggage rules, on the spot or at a later stage, and look for legal remedy?
What is the justification for the measures? Did the Commission carry out an evaluation of information and evidence presented by the United Kingdom's secret services upon requesting these restrictions? Has specialised expertise been gathered before the decision? Are the measures based on proper risk assessment and will they yield an appropriate reduction of security risks? Will they be evaluated after implementation?
Have these measures been subject to an impact assessment on fundamental rights? Have they been deemed compatible with citizens’ rights and the free movement of persons and goods? On what grounds are these measures to be considered proportionate and necessary in a democratic society, in compliance with the European Convention of Human Rights? Have these measures been subject to an impact assessment on consumer rights and the practical impact on airport operations and passenger flows? Was there any prior assessment of the extra costs consumers and airports will face after the implementation of the new rules?
The aviation security implementing rules are developed by the Aviation Security Regulatory Committee, established in Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 This committee only gets external advice from the Stakeholder Advisory Group on Aviation Security (SAGAS), an informal body of aviation industry stakeholders. Would the Commission agree that this body needs to be formalised, as requested by Parliament during the first reading of the ongoing revision of Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002? Would the Commission accept the idea that the committee also needs to systematically take into account appropriate expertise on civil rights and consumer interests?

Call for more cooperation on fighting terrorism
2007-02-07 - 19:08
The Foreign Affairs Committee is urging more EU cooperation in the fight against terrorism, calling for a common definition, coordination with the United States, and clear and direct support for human rights within and outside the Union. "The most serious threat to Europe at the moment is posed by violent radical groups claiming to defend Islam, such as the criminal Al-Qaeda network and the groups which are affiliated to it or are inspired by its ideology," claims an own-initiative report by Luis Yañez-Barnuevo (PES, ES) passed by a large majority (43-4-3) in the Foreign Affairs Committee.
Against this background, the report advocates a larger degree of coordination and cooperation at EU level. It "regrets the fact that [...] some Member States have not yet signed and/or ratified some of the 16 United Nations universal instruments on combating terrorism," and urges them do so. It also "calls on the Council to adopt a common position establishing a definition of terrorism," "reiterates the need to exercise effective control over various Islamic charities," and "considers that it is essential to develop intercultural dialogue and other confidence-building measures within and outside the EU."
Members of the committee make further recommendations for the Union's foreign policy, emphasising "the need for greater cooperation and coordination with the United States in the fight against international terrorism, while stressing the need for fundamental Human Rights principles to be protected." They also call "on countries with which the EU has commenced accession negotiations or which have expressed their intention of joining the EU to take immediate measures to disband nationalistic and fanatical organisations which are directly opposed to the democratic principles of the Union and stir up animosities and racial hatred."
Finally, the report "calls on the Commission and the Council, in order to make the International Criminal Court (ICC) more acceptable and realistic, to include acts of terrorism within its jurisdiction, as these constitute crimes against humanity." Committee members insist on "the need to continue defending human rights and fundamental freedoms in the fight against terrorism," since "their violation clearly jeopardises the fight against terrorism and constitutes a failure of democracy."

Call for action to soften economic impact of rising energy prices
2007-02-07 - 19:08
Europe should act now to prevent increasing energy prices damaging Europe’s economy, according to a report from the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee now due for debate in plenary. It says that if no action is taken, Europe’s dependency on energy imports will rise from 50 per cent today to 71 per cent in 2030. The committee is calling for a massive investment in energy infrastructure and supply and new measures to improve energy-efficiency. The report, drawn up by Manuel Antonio dos SANTOS (PES, PT), notes that the present increase in oil prices is of a similar scale to those of the 1970s and early 1980s, but differs from those shocks in that a substantial element is caused by growing demand from economies such as China, so part of the rise will be permanent.
Economic impact – especially on the poorest
MEPs in the committee stress the tangible effect of oil price increases on the EU, which have reduced growth, investment and employment while increasing inflationary pressure and interest rates. They note in particular the social consequences of higher energy prices, which hit the poorest and most vulnerable especially hard.
The transport and housing sectors in particular are most affected, say MEPs. The report includes a call for a comprehensive EU strategy to phase out fossil fuels in the transport sector, while expanding the use of unconventional fuels. Ensuring fair energy prices in the domestic energy market means completing the single market in a sector often dominated by a few companies, with the unbundling of infrastructure and supply of energy being essential according to MEPs.
Massive investment needed
The Economics Committee is calling for a “massive investment in energy infrastructure and supply over the coming years” alongside an in-depth, Community-wide, debate on different energy sources. It asks the Commission and Council to draw up a detailed plan to reduce EU dependence on oil imports and for a shift toward clean energy. It also urges the adoption of energy efficiency improvements, which, it says, are the cheapest way to cut CO2 emissions and improve energy security. Fiscal policy should be used to encourage these moves, and public procurement selection criteria should include energy efficiency.
The report calls for an integrated EU emergency mechanism for security of supply to increase the minimum oil stock from 90 to 120 consumption days and develop a minimum gas stock of at least 90 days. It suggests following the US model of publishing weekly breakdowns of European oil and oil product stocks.

Improving economy is an opportunity to reform and invest for the future
2007-02-07 - 19:08
Europe should take advantage of the present improvement in economic growth to make the changes and investment needed to enhance its potential growth rates for the longer term, so as to be able to generate more employment. This is the key message of a report on the EU’s Broad Economic Policy Guidelines to be debated in plenary. In their advice to Member States, contained in the report drawn up by Udo BULLMANN (PES, DE), MEPs in the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee call, among other points, for:
• effective coordination of economic policies, including growth-intensive public spending, stimulation of private investment and public-private cooperation, notably on projects for science, research, transport, communication, energy and environmental sustainability;
• improved access to financing for small and medium sized businesses, along with favourable tax and social contribution arrangements;
• the curbing of protectionist tendencies;
• action to make the labour market more inclusive, balancing job security and flexibility, as well as better opportunities to combine professional and family life;
• enhanced and structured economic cooperation in the EU and in particular the euro area.
Institutional action recommended by the report includes:
• a “league table” of the best and worst performers among the Member States in terms of implementing reforms to achieve the jobs and growth goals of the Lisbon Strategy;
• action to make the Lisbon Strategy more visible to all players in Member States’ societies, with broader consultation;
• a joint process of reflection between the EU bodies via an inter-institutional working party following the spring summit, to develop the next set of integrated policy guidelines for the years to come.
The Broad Economic Policy Guidelines, adopted each year by the EU’s Heads of State or Government at their spring summit, are one of the main methods for coordinating economic policy between the EU’s Member States. Together with the Employment Policy Guidelines, they form a package, known as the “integrated policy guidelines.”
The Employment Guidelines are set for three years at a time, so the parallel report from Jan ANDERSSON (PES, SE) for the Employment and Social Affairs Committee limits itself to a call for Parliament to be given adequate time to play a full role in developing the next set of guidelines for 2008.

Fisheries
Redouble the efforts against illegal fishing, says Fisheries Committee
2007-02-07 - 19:08
The Fisheries Committee will be tabling an own-initiative report on the implementation of the EU action plan against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. The report points out that the Green Paper on a new maritime policy could serve as a framework for cooperation on the basis of which the fight against illegal fishing might be more effective. The committee also asks the Commission to publish blacklists of fishing vessels and to consider the idea of establishing an EU coastguard. In its work programme for 2007, the Commission announced that illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU) will become a priority and it will produce a communication on IUU fishing and a proposal for a regulation defining a new strategy to combat IUU fishing. The report by Marie-Hélène AUBERT (Greens/EFA, FR) aims to provide the Commission with concrete ideas and suggestions for action to be taken.
According to MEPs in the committee, the Commission should create a Community register of vessels engaging in IUU fishing, which would include vessels on regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs) blacklists. Such a register would facilitate the swift exchange of information among the Member States and make it possible to monitor vessels taking account of possible re-flagging. Member States should apply common minimum penalties for serious infringements (§ 18) and these penalties must be sufficiently dissuasive.
The committee asks that all blacklists of fishing vessels and fish transport vessels, including their owners or operators, adopted by RFMOs are published and incorporated directly into Community law. Non-EU vessels on those lists must be prohibited from entry into EU ports for any purpose, except in cases of 'force majeure' or for humanitarian reasons. All EU-flagged vessels must be prohibited from providing support (fuel, supplies, transhipment, etc.) to those vessels while at sea.
The legal origin of fish must be demonstrated before it is allowed to be offloaded in EU ports or imported into the EU. The report points out that fish should be fully traceable from the time it is brought aboard a fishing vessel until it reaches its final customer.
MEPs urge the Commission to ensure that any person guilty of IUU fishing do not receive any type of aid or subsidy from Community funds for any branch of their activities, and to ask the Member States to take similar action with regard to their respective national aid.
Helping developing countries in the prevention of illegal fishing
The importance of the EU in the world, as a major fishing power and as the world's largest market for fish, obliges it to be at the forefront of the fight against IUU fishing. MEPs consider that the EU can only act credibly on the world scene if it has already taken effective action to halt its own involvement in IUU fishing, both in EU waters and by EU vessels or interests outside the EU.
According to estimates by the Marine Resources Assessment Group, mentioned in the report, such fishing around the world is worth at least $2.4 billion. Much of this comes from the waters of developing countries, which are too poor to be able to effectively monitor fishing activities in their waters and prevent illegal fishing, resulting in loss and hardship for their coastal populations, who depend on fish for their livelihoods and food security.
The report urges the Commission to help developing countries, especially those with which it has fishing agreements, to comply fully with the commitments of the international plan of action designed to prevent illegal fishing, helping to strengthen the scant means available to them by including specific actions in the new partnership agreements.
Traceability of fish from the net to the plate
MEPs call on the Commission to present its proposal on eco-labelling by June 2007, reiterating its belief that the improvements in the traceability of fish, from the net to the plate, that would be required by eco-labelling schemes would be of considerable help in identifying IUU fish and keeping it off the EU market.
The committee also asks the Commission and the Member States to expand the Community information campaign so as to improve public awareness of the extent and serious nature of IUU fishing.
An EU coastguard
The committee welcomes the establishment of the new Community Fisheries Control Agency, in Vigo (Spain), and is confident that the agency will play an important role in the fight against IUU fishing. MEPs call on the Commission to consider the idea of the establishment of an EU coastguard.
Finally, the committee asks the Commission to carry out and submit a study on compliance with Community labour, health and safety legislation and on respect for the social rights of workers on vessels and on their living and working conditions on board.

Fisheries
A uniform definition of drift nets needed
2007-02-07 - 19:08
The Fisheries Committee will recommend that the plenary approves a Commission proposal aiming to introduce a uniform definition of drift nets across three regulations in order to facilitate the control and enforcement of the restrictions on the use of these nets. The proposed definition does not extend the scope of the restrictions and conditions on the use of drift nets under EU legislation. According to the rapporteur, Rosa MIGUÉLEZ RAMOS (PES, ES), the introduction of a uniform definition will help facilitate the implementation and enforcement of Community legislation in this field and prevent any circumvention of that legislation through varying interpretations at national level.
The proposed definition of drift net is: "any gillnet held on the sea surface or at a certain distance below it by floating devices, drifting with the current either independently or with the boat to which it may be attached. It may be equipped with devices aiming to stabilise the net and/or to limit its drifting".
This proposal forms part of the process of simplifying and improving the common fisheries policy, in particular as regards the clarification and reform of existing legislation on technical measures.
The definition will be introduced in the following regulations:
- Regulation (EC) No 894/97 laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1239/98;
- Regulation (EC) No 812/2004 laying down measures concerning incidental catches of cetaceans in fisheries;
- Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound.
Background: EP position on drift nets
The European Parliament took up a position on the issue of drift gillnets in its resolution of 11 October 1991 on the Commission proposal amending for the 11th time Regulation (EEC) No 3094/86, and in its resolution of 17 December 1993, in which it opposed the use of this gear and called for a total ban, whilst accepting that the Commission, at the request of a Member State, might authorise its use inside the 12-mile zone. This position was reaffirmed by the legislative resolution of 28 September 1994 on the proposal for a regulation amending for the 16th time Regulation (EEC) No 3094/86. In that resolution, the EP called for a ban from 31 December 1994 (rather than 1997) on the keeping on board and the use of this gear intended for the capture of certain highly migratory species, and for compensation and restructuring aid for the fishermen affected.
Regulation (EC) No 812/2004 of 26 April 2004, laying down measures concerning incidental catches of cetaceans in fisheries, extended the ban on the keeping on board or use of drift nets, irrespective of their length and the target species, to the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound. Furthermore, Regulation (EC) No 812/2004 laid down measures aimed at limiting the volume of incidental catches of cetaceans by banning vessels of 12 metres or over in overall length from using certain types of fishing gear, including drift nets, in certain areas and during certain periods, without the simultaneous use of active acoustic deterrent devices. The Member States were obliged to implement programmes to monitor incidental catches of cetaceans.
In its resolution of 10 February 2004, the European Parliament supported this proposal for a regulation (COM(2003)451 of 24 July 2003) whilst tabling a number of amendments chiefly concerning the need to draw up a long-term strategy to combat cetacean by-catches, the need to study and update alternative gear and fishing methods aimed at preventing the incidental killing of these species, and the destruction of banned drift nets to prevent any exporting of such nets to third countries.
The ban which is to apply from 2008, pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 812/2004, along with provisional arrangements for the implementation of this ban, are included in Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 of 21 December 2005 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound.
In its legislative resolution of 13 October 2005, the EP supported the Commission proposal (COM(2005)0086 of 14 March 2005) and tabled a set of amendments aimed in particular at clarifying and completing certain provisions on fishing gear. For example, it proposed introducing a definition of "extension piece", a definition of T90 type trawls and permission to use them, and an assessment of the impact of the use of drift nets and other entangling gear on the sea mammal population by 1 January 2008.

Fisheries Committee asks for a recovery plan for the bluefin tuna
2007-02-07 - 19:08
The European Parliament will debate and vote, under consultation, on a proposal for a regulation laying down technical measures for the conservation of certain stocks of highly migratory species. In a report by the Fisheries Committee, MEPs point to a risk of collapse in the bluefin tuna stocks, asking the EU and the Member States to urgently introduce control measures which will help to resolve the problem of overfishing, accompanied by a recovery plan. The report mentions that, according to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), current catch levels of bluefin tuna are not sustainable in the long term with the present exploitation patterns.
The European Union should propose measures to rebuild the stock to ICCAT "as a matter of urgency", say MEPs, including a recovery plan and control measures which will help to resolve the problems of overfishing and the underreporting of catches.
The report by Rosa MIGUÉLEZ RAMOS (PES, ES) also calls the Commission and the Member States to pursue an active policy to defend these measures in international fora as a matter of urgency, particularly vis-à-vis the regional fisheries organisations (RFOs) responsible for managing this resource and countries which are the main destination for this species, such as Japan.
The growing demand for this species has caused an increase in fishing pressure, both for direct sale and for supplying specimens to tuna farms, which requires, on the part of the EU and the Member States, "strict monitoring and improved information on both fishing and farming activity", since this is vital in order to be able to make a scientific assessment of the state of the resource.
The objective of the Commission proposal is the transposition into EU law of the technical measures adopted by the RFOs responsible for the management of tuna species to which the European Community is a contracting party.
The technical measures concern the minimum size of fish, the ban on the use of certain fishing gears, closed fishing areas and seasons, and capacity restrictions. These measures have been modified at the annual meetings of the RFOs, and the law in force therefore needs to be adapted and updated.

Agriculture
Agriculture Committee recommends cautious approach to reforming the wine sector
2007-02-07 - 19:08
Cautious, carefully-managed reform is needed to restore the vitality of the EU wine sector, says a report put forward by the Agriculture Committee. It recommends retaining distillation measures for now, empowering Member States to restrict grubbing-up of vines, and liberalising planting rights only gradually. It also advocates strict labelling rules and maintaining current regulations on acceptable winemaking practices. Distillation
The own-initiative report by Katerina BATZELI (PES, EL) on the EU's Common Market Organisation (CMO) in wine argues that the "public storage of alcohol should be abolished," but at the same time "rejects the immediate abolition of the distillation mechanism and other market support measures" and suggests that the distillation measures should be converted into two parts:
"compulsory distillation, which will act as a safety net and allow the gradual reorganisation of the market", and
"voluntary distillation, [...] which will allow the adaptation of the sector for wine alcohol used for incorporation into certain wine products", such as liqueurs and brandies.
Furthermore, the Agriculture committee "considers it appropriate to offer incentives for alternative uses of alcohol and the by-products of vinification, via bio-energy policies that may make a valid contribution to combating production surpluses," and argues for a new crisis management mechanism for use in times of emergency.
Grubbing up
The Agriculture committee reiterates its stance that "the issue of permanent abandonment of wine-growing must not be the centrepiece of CMO reform." It considers it essential that each Member State and region be able to set a "flexible upper limit for grubbing-up for each region, and that they should have the opportunity to select which categories of wine will take priority in the grubbing-up programme." To this end, the report suggests that eligibility for grubbing-up aid should be subject to certain Community criteria, to take account of the specific features of, for example:
- vineyards in mountainous, coastal and island regions,
- vineyards with geographical indications or registered designations of origin,
- vineyards where soil erosion or biodiversity loss could be a problem,
- traditional regions of historical importance, or
- vineyards that have received structural aid from the EU.
Liberalisation of new plantings and promotion of consumption
The report maintains that a gradual reallocation of planting rights is necessary, in order to avoid an "uncontrolled expansion of the EU's wine potential from having a negative impact on the market." To this end, the committee favours allocating new rights primarily to young farmers, especially for the production of quality wines. It suggests that regional authorities should take decisions on liberalising planting rights, especially where geographical indications are involved.
"The Commission should lay down some activity guidelines for the promotion of European wines, based on moderate and responsible wine consumption," said the committee. It also suggested promoting specifically labelled European wines to the world market.
Winemaking practices and labelling
The report acknowledges that wine "enrichment has a direct impact on production levels," but it nevertheless suggests that the current legislation be kept unchanged, as "the Commission's proposal on reducing the maximum level of enrichment is not justified." Enrichment of wine with sugar and concentrated must "has to be allowed in every wine growing region where it was traditionally used and where no structural surpluses exist" it adds. The report also strongly supports a ban on the "fermentation of imported musts and the mixing thereof with Community musts." It specifically requests that the power to approve new winemaking practices within the EU should lie with the Council (in consultation with Parliament), and not with the Commission.
With respect to labelling, the report stresses that the use of oenological practices that are not allowed in the EU should be clearly labelled on imported beverages. The committee also stressed the need to better secure protected geographical indications and protected designations of origin in WTO talks. To this end, it expresses support for bilateral negotiations with third countries on mutual recognition of such designations. Finally, the report also calls for harmonisation of Member States' rules on languages to be used on labels within the EU.

Agriculture
Agriculture Committee recommends rejecting voluntary modulation proposal for a second time
2007-02-07 - 19:08
A European Commission proposal that would have allowed Member States to divert some Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) direct farm payments to rural development spending was almost unanimously rejected by the European Parliament's Agriculture Committee. Now the plenary must decide whether to follow the advice of the committee. The Commission proposal for a voluntary modulation scheme would allow 20% of direct payments to be diverted to rural development projects, at the discretion of each Member State. The report, authored by Lutz GOEPEL (EPP-ED, DE), warned that such a transfer could create distortions in competition between farmers from various Member States, and could also lead to a "renationalisation" of the CAP.
Parliament had already overwhelmingly rejected this proposal once, in a plenary vote on 14 November, 2006. But under Rule of Procedure 52, para 3, if the Commission does not withdraw a rejected proposal, the matter is referred back to the relevant committee.

External/international trade
Moldova: Yes to special aid but subject to conditions
2007-02-07 - 19:08
The Trade Committee is backing plans to grant €45 million in macro-financial aid to Moldova, one of Europe's poorest countries. The money will support the balance of trade and payments of this country, which has had a frontier with the EU since the accession of Romania on 1 January 2007. However, while backing this proposal by the Council - on which Parliament is being consulted - MEPs adopted several non-binding amendments laying down conditions for the payment of the funds. The aid, approved in a report drafted by Béla Glattfelder (EPP-ED, HU), is intended to help with the deterioration in Moldova's trade balance following the rise in energy prices and the embargo imposed by Russia in 2006 on imports of Moldovan wine and spirits. The wine sector accounts for around 25% of Moldova's GDP and 80% of its production was exported to Russia. More generally, Moldova's economy remains highly dependent on agriculture (notably fruit, vegetables and tobacco) and is lacking in natural resources.
MEPs want to make the payment of successive tranches of aid subject to progress in the transparency of Moldova's public finances, the application of macroeconomic and budgetary priorities advocated by the International Monetary Fund and respect for human rights, including minorities.
The draft report also underlines the "exceptional" nature of an instrument such as macro-financial aid. The committee believes it is "unjustifiable that such an instrument lacks a regular legal basis and continues to be based on ad hoc Council decisions". It calls for future financial aid to be governed by "a co-decided framework regulation" on macro-financial assistance, i.e. with decisions taken by Parliament and the Member States, which is necessary "to enhance transparency, accountability, monitoring and reporting systems".
This aid should prompt Moldova to implement reforms under the EU-Moldova Action Plan agreed as part of the European Neighbourhood Policy. And MEPs would like the Memorandum of Understanding and the Grant Agreement that the Commission will agree with the Moldovan authorities to be submitted not only to the Council but also to Parliament.
Moldova has not been given EU candidate status but in a speech to Parliament's plenary on 31 January, Romanian President Traian Băsescu spoke of the need to give Moldova a "European perspective".

Development and cooperation
Budget aid for developing countries
2007-02-07 - 19:08
Michael GAHLER (EPP-ED, DE) will be putting forward an own-initiative report on budget aid for developing countries which calls on the Commission and the Member States to use budget support only if the net benefits of such a mechanism can be demonstrated in the light of clearly objectifiable criteria, and only after a full assessment of the risks involved. The Development Committee calls for budget support to focus, as far as possible, on poverty reduction development priorities, for those priorities to be given a central role in the donor-recipient policy dialogue and for parliamentary scrutiny to be ensured in respect of both the donor and the recipient. The committee is concerned about the decision to use budget support in Malawi, where there were considerable known risks, and Kenya, in regard to which all Member States have suspended budget support, thus calling into question the Commission's ability to use this instrument effectively.
The report reaffirms that 20% of total annual commitments should be allocated to activities in the sectors of basic and secondary education and basic health (including sexual and reproductive health) MEPs in the committee call on the Commission to assess at regular intervals the effectiveness of budget aid in combating poverty from the point of view of cost-effectiveness, and to show progress made by the third-country beneficiaries in independently administering the budget aid; in doing so, it should distinguish between general and sector-specific budget aid, so as to achieve greater clarity with regard to the effectiveness of the various aid instruments in reducing poverty; the administrative costs of budget and project aid must also be evaluated; the aim should be to be in a position to give a reasoned account of when each instrument should be used.
Lastly, the committee calls on the Commission to state how budget aid can be limited in time. The committee notes that the ultimate aim of budget support must be to build up the self-sufficiency of the beneficiary country, so the Commission should state over what (reasonable) timescale this can be achieved.

Industry
Allocating radio spectrum
2007-02-07 - 19:08
The Industry Committee is calling for a "sustainable" approach to the use of radio spectrum in Europe so as to promote competition and innovative technologies, inhibit the hoarding of frequency rights and the power of monopolies and benefit consumers. MEPs say this approach should take account of technological change as well as the needs of market players and the public. In its own-initiative report, drafted by Fiona HALL (ALDE, UK), the committee argues that an unlicensed model, tradable rights, service standards and technology neutrality are key principles for a future European policy on radio spectrum.
MEPs say that developing the right mix between the different types of licensing models will be important in achieving EU policy objectives. A very clear legal framework will also be needed. And the introduction of a market-based approach to spectrum will be most effective "if based on a consensual agreement backed by regulators, operators and other actors”.
The principle of service and technology neutrality is crucial to a more efficient use of spectrum, says the report. If there are no restrictions on the service to be offered on a particular bandwidth or the technology to be used for the delivery of that service, spectrum-dependent innovation is able to flourish.
In the EU, the regimes for assigning spectrum differ from Member State to Member State, which can cause delays and costs. The committee argues that "the EU will require efficient and responsive guidelines for common decision-making mechanisms" and that "a European register will be needed with the completion, expansion and accessibility of the EFIS database".
Background
In recent decades a new era has opened up in communication and information, based on powerful electronic superhighways. Major strides have been made in fibre optics, semiconductors, broadband integrated networks, intelligence networks and multimedia broadcasting.
The deployment of many of these technologies depends on the existence of enough spectrum for players wishing to enter the market. Spectrum is a “scarce” resource and at present there does not appear to be enough spectrum width to meet demand.
Until now the system used for spectrum allocation has operated at four levels (international, European, inter-regional and national). The result: six to eight years can elapse between a request for allocation and the assignment of a frequency. But the rapid development of technology has created a dynamic environment for which the traditional approach of spectrum allocation is too slow and inflexible.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Women's rights in Turkey: improvements still needed
2007-02-07 - 19:08
Parliament will be asked to back an own-initiative report, submitted by the Women's Rights Committee, on women's role in social, economic and political life in Turkey. Members of this committee believe that Turkey's legal framework on women's rights "has in general been satisfactory, but its substantive implementation remains flawed". The report, drafted by Emine Bozkurt (PES, NL), is the second one on this topic, following up on the resolution adopted by Parliament in July 2005. It welcomes the start of active EU accession talks with Turkey, but "regrets the slowing down of the reform process in Turkey over the last year and the persistent problem with women's rights". It reiterates Parliament's call for "full and effective implementation of the Community acquis in the field of women's rights, particularly in the poorer regions of the country" and points out that respect for human rights, including women’s rights, is a precondition for Turkey to join the EU.
Implementation of legislation
The committee urges the Turkish Government to speed up implementation of the new legislation on women's rights, to ensure that it complies with the Community acquis. It acknowledges that the new Penal Code (in force since 2005) substantially strengthens the basic rights of women but it also notes that (unsuccessful) attempts have been made to repeal legislation on women's rights. In parts of south-east Turkey, girls are not registered at birth and this hampers the fight against forced marriage and honour crimes, since the victims have no official identity. MEPs urge the Turkish authorities to ensure that all Turkish children are registered at birth.
Tackling violence against women
The report condemns "instances of violence against women, including honour killings, domestic violence, forced marriage and polygamy". It calls on the Turkish Government and the Commission to tackle "violence in general and honour crime in particular" and to set up special high-security shelters. Other needs are training of police and judicial authorities in gender equality issues and the fight against violence, and the need for Turkish institutions to build alliances with all social groupings - civil, social or religious - to raise awareness of violence against women and children.
Women in politics
Very few women take part in politics in Turkey, according to the report, and there is a need for female role models in positions of power. Discrimination against women can sometimes best be remedied by temporary positive discrimination measures, say MEPs, and they suggest the adoption of a mandatory quota system for election lists as the best way to improve female participation in Turkish politics in the short term. MEPs also urge Turkey's political parties to include more female candidates on election lists, starting from the upcoming elections in 2007.
Gender equality in access to education and labour market .
The committee is concerned at the Commission's observation that women remain vulnerable to discrimination in Turkey, due partly to a lack of education and a high illiteracy rate. UNICEF estimates that each year between 600,000 and 800,000 girls are either prevented by their families from going to school or do not attend it because of logistical difficulties. MEPs therefore call on the Turkish government to ensure gender equality in access to education and the labour market, especially in the south-eastern regions. The female employment rate in Turkey is just under 25%, compared to the average women's employment rate in EU-25 of 55%.
Lastly, the MEPs state that they intend to evaluate progress in the field of women's rights in Turkey on a regular basis. This will be in addition to the yearly progress report of the Commission.

Budget
Protection of the Community's financial interests
2007-02-07 - 19:08
Herbert BÖSCH (PES, AT) will be tabling a legislative report for the Budgetary Control Committee (without debate) on the so called Hercule II programe aimed at the protection of the community's interests. The aim of the HERCULES programme is to ensure efficient levels of protection of the Community’s financial interests and the exchange of best practice. To this end, the programme provides grants for individual activities, such as studies, conferences or training, and provides operating grants for organisations active in this field, such as associations established to promote the protection of Community financial interests.
The Budgetary Control Committee says that the objective of the programme should be the following:
The programme shall promote activities according to the general criteria set out in the Decision. It shall focus on the following objectives in particular:
(a) enhancing transnational and multidisciplinary cooperation between Member States' authorities, the Commission and OLAF;
(b) building networks throughout the Member States, acceding countries and candidate countries - in accordance with a memorandum of understanding - facilitating the exchange of information, experience and best practice, while also respecting the distinct traditions of each Member State;
(c) providing technical operational support for national law enforcement authorities of the Member States in their fight against illegal cross border activities, emphasising support for customs authorities;
(d) without undermining the operational effectiveness, striking a geographical balance by including, if possible, all Member States, acceding countries and candidate countries - in accordance with a memorandum of understanding - in the activities financed under the programme;
(e) multiplying and intensifying the measures in the areas identified as the most sensitive, particularly in the field of cigarette smuggling and counterfeiting.”
Hercule II will receive supplementary funds of €6-7 million per year, derived from the Anti-Contraband and Anti-Counterfeit Agreement between the Commission and several Member States with Philip Morris International (PMI). The committee is pleased that the prevention and fight against cigarette smuggling and counterfeiting will become one of the cornerstones of the Hercule II programme.
