A special Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly (EMPA) gathered this week in the Moroccan capital Rabat as part of a series of meetings to mark the 10th Anniversary of the Barcelona Conference. The resulting declaration in 1995 launched the Euromed partnership (more commonly known as the Barcelona process) which covers political, economic and cultural cooperation between the European Union and 10 countries from the Mediterranean.
The opening debates dealt with a variety of issues connected to the Barcelona process. These included EU partnerships with Mediterranean countries, the new European Neighbourhood Policy and prospects for regional integration. Among the issues discussed in the three EMPA committees was the recent Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza strip and the steps required to create a viable Palestinian state. The fight against terrorism and combating bird flu were also discussed.
Economically, liberalisation of services and trade in agriculture were on the agenda as were measures to create a Euro-Mediterranean energy network and to further develop transport infrastructure in the region. Measures to clean up the Mediterranean sea and alleviate the brain drain were also considered. (For a full list of topics please see the link to the press release below). The conclusions were then forwarded to a summit of heads of state and government that will meet in Barcelona at the end of the week on 27-28 November.
These gatherings are particularly crucial as even the most ardent supporters of Euromed admit that it has not completely lived up to expectations. A resolution by the European Parliament in October this year stated that "the result of the review after 10 years is a mixed one, with many positive achievements...and much still to be done to realise the full potential of the Barcelona Declaration."
This is why in his speech to the EMPA in Rabat, the current Chair of the Assembly, European Parliament President Josep Borrell, warned delegates that economically "the gaps which separate countries continue to grow," and that the foreign investment needed to create wealth "pre-supposes the need for good governance."He went on to tell those present that "the best way to combat terrorism is to consolidate democracy."
The agenda of the Barcelona Summit itself is likely to deal with a variety of areas which include: measures to bring about closer political cooperation between the EU and countries on the Mediterranean rim; greater economic cooperation, in particular related to the liberalisation of the trade in agriculture products, and finally enhancing the role of civil society through education and cultural exchanges. The fight against terrorism will also be discussed.
