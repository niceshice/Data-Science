Making sense of the 2010 EU budget
Budget

Right on the money: The EU budget 2009 Last December the European Parliament adopted the final EU budget for 2010, which will be €141.4 billion in commitments and €122.9 billion in payments. In this focus we look at how the EU budget is adopted, how the money is collected and how it is used.
The main challenge for this year's budget was to find the funding for the already agreed but not yet financed economic recovery plan, which will cost the EU €2.4 billion for the year 2010.
The 2010 budget is the last one agreed under the Nice Treaty rules. Under the Lisbon Treaty the Parliament will decide on the entire EU budget together with the Council. Until now the EP has not had the final say on "compulsory expenditure", such as spending relating to agriculture or international agreements. The difference between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure disappears under the Lisbon Treaty.
In addition, the Lisbon Treaty simplifies the decision-taking procedure and makes the long-term budget plan, or "financial perspectives", legally binding.

7 Year itch
Making sure the numbers stack up is vital Budgetary wrangles were long, messy and complicated in the 1980's so the framework for EU financing is now agreed by EU leaders (and Parliament) for 7 year cycles. In December 2005 a late night session of the European Council saw Presidents, Chancellors and Prime Ministers from the Union's then 25 members agree a financial deal for the next 7 years under the following headings:
1. Sustainable economic growth: a total budget of €382 billion for structural funds, research and education.
2. Preservation and management of natural resources: €371 billion for the Common Agricultural Policy and environmental policies.
3. Citizenship, freedom, security and justice: Includes €107.7 billion for "justice and home affairs" initiatives and schemes to foster European citizenship. These include youth exchanges, town-twinning, cooperation between civil society and money to encourage a "European dimension" in the media and culture.
4. EU as a global actor: financing worth €49.5 billion for aid to developing countries, the promotion of human rights, foreign and security policy and supporting development in countries as part of the EU's "neighbourhood policy".
5. Administration (including translation services), accounting for about 5.75% or €49.8 billion.
After the deal agreed by EU leaders, Austria, then the holder of the EU's rotating Presidency, negotiated with the Parliament on the final aspects of the spending. Agreement was reached in April and the Parliament ratified the "Multi-Annual Financial Framework" for 2007-2013 leaving the way clear to start negotiations on the annual budget for 2007.
Under the Lisbon Treaty, the EU's long-term budget plan is legally binding (for "at least 5 years" instead of the current 7 years). Parliament's consent is required for the adoption of the financial perspective. The EP has suggested extending the current financial perspectives to 2015 or 2016, so that the period covered by the next financial perspectives matches the mandates of Parliament and the Commission.

The EU budget under the Lisbon Treaty
EP President Jerzy Buzek signs the approved 2010 budget for the European Union. 17 December 2009 The European Parliament under the Lisbon Treaty will be on an equal footing with the Council in deciding all EU expenditure. In addition, the Lisbon Treaty simplifies the decision-taking procedure and makes the long-term budget plan, or "financial perspectives", legally binding.
Budget under the Lisbon Treaty:
Current distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure disappears
Parliament and Council decide together on whole EU budget (previously Council had last say on compulsory expenditure
Financial perspectives will be legally binding
A single reading followed by work in a conciliation committee replaces two readings in both Council and EP
In 2010, the institutions need to agree on new regulations and a timetable for implementing the general rules of the Lisbon Treaty.
The Commission will present its draft budget for 2011 in April or May. The Council and the Parliament, the latter represented by its Budgets committee, will then consider this proposal and negotiate during the summer and early autumn. The final budget will probably be decided at a conciliation meeting in November and formally adopted in December.

Parliament adopts the EU budget 2010
Focusing on the fine print is key to understanding the budget The European Parliament adopted the 2010 EU budget at second-reading in Strasbourg last December. The level of payments is set €141.4 billion in commitments and €122.9 billion in payments, which is 1.04 percent EU GNI. The 2010 budget confirms the priorities of the EP, notably on energy and entrepreneurship.
The 2010 budget hopes to make the European economy more competitive and to have found the means to finance all the economic recovery plan operations foreseen for 2010. The Council's first proposal was €120.5 billion and Parliament's first reading one was €127.5 billion, both in payments.
EP rapporteur László Surján (EPP, HU) has stated that there would be room to increase payments by €3 billion, if only Member States used the cohesion and structural funds as they should.
EU economic recovery plan
The €5 billion European economic recovery plan covers the years 2009 and 2010 and supports energy projects and broadband development in rural areas. When it was agreed last year, the financing for 2010 (€2.4 billion) was not yet settled. The EU institutions have now agreed on financing it: by using unspent funds and margins (mainly for agriculture and administration) for 2009 and 2010, and by the Member States adding €120 million.
The additional money for the recovery plan, €300 million in emergency support for the dairy industry and €75 million in funding to help decommission the Kozloduy nuclear power plant in Bulgaria were among points in the budget that were significantly influenced by the EP.
The EP budget committee managed to increase the amounts originally proposed by the Commission's preliminary draft budget for EP priority areas such as financial services, intelligent energy, energy research, lifelong learning and entrepreneurship.
2010 budget:
Last budget procedure under the Nice Treaty rules
Most money goes to preservation and management of natural resources and sustainable growth
The payments figure for 2010 represents 1.04% of EU gross national income (GNI)
The contribution per EU citizen is roughly €246 a year (or 67 eurocents a day)
Administrative costs account for 6.4% of the overall budget.

Where does the money come from?
Approval and allocation of the money takes several months For 2010 the budgetary revenue totals approximately €122.9 billion. It is withdrawn from the following sources:
The uniform rate of call for the VAT resource (11.35 % of total)
Traditional own resources (customs duties and sugar levies, collected by Member States on behalf of the EU) of 11.55 % of the financing of the budget for 2010
The GNI resource for 75.94 % (national contributions to the EU budget based on the national income of each Member State)
Other revenues.
The payments figure for 2010 represents 1.04% of EU gross national income (GNI), thus falling below the agreed ceiling of 1,24 % of GNI.
EU's multi-annual budget
During the hearing of the Polish Budgets commissioner-designate Janusz Lewandowski a key area of interest was the upcoming review of the financial perspective 2007-2013. Parliament's suggestion is that this period could be prolonged to 2015 or 2016, so as to make it match the terms of the Commission and the Parliament.
"A prolongation of the current financial perspective is one of many possible solutions to match the financial perspectives with the mandate of the Parliament. But it is not the only one", Lewandowski replied.
Mr Lewandowski reiterated Commission President Barroso's view that it should come after the presentation of EU's new 2020 Strategy, scheduled for June. This would make the earliest possible date for the review July this year.

What about the "Net Contributors”?
Antwerp, Belgium: First port of call for many goods entering the EU For 2010, Germany is expected to contribute most to the financing of the EU general budget with approximately 19.6%, followed by France (18%), Italy (13.9%), the UK (10.4%) and Spain (9.6%).
Budget debates often focus on how much countries give and how much they get back from the EU (their "net contributions"). Inevitably, "discussions" arise where different countries feel they are either paying too much or not receiving as much as they should. The latter can be a particularly vexed point as some EU policies like agriculture and regional policy benefit some countries more than others.
However, contrasting "contributions" with money a country gets back and then presenting a “net balance” is a difficult and controversial exercise. Here's why:
1. Part of the budget is spent on aid (the EU is the world's largest aid donor) or assistance to developing countries and therefore does not "go back" to any EU country. Also, money used to administer the EU through its institutions does not go back to one country but is for all EU members.
2. Many EU-supported projects are international and the funds go to the country where the project is.
3. EU funds may co-finance the construction of new infrastructure like roads, bridges or tourism handled by a company that is not from that region or country - thereby spreading the benefits.
4. The spread of customs duties (which form part of the EU's revenues): These are levied at the place of entry and also arguably paid by the consumer who buys the product. For example, goods coming into the port of Antwerp in Belgium are then distributed all over the EU and so on.
5. Finally, the EU is by its very nature a community which encompasses solidarity among its members. In the preamble of the founding Treaty it commits members to "strengthen the unity of their economies and to ensure their harmonious development by reducing the differences existing between the various regions…" Therefore many would argue that the redistribution of resources is an intrinsic part of the European project.
Responsibility for spending
EU funding covers environmental projects A total of 80% of all EU funds are managed by national and local authorities across the EU. However, the European Commission is politically responsible for the execution of the EU budget. The European Parliament has therefore insisted that the national governments must take over more political responsibility for how EU funds are managed in their respective countries.
The Parliament is the only institution empowered by the treaties to give the budget "discharge" (the purpose is to verify the accuracy of the budgetary management) to the Commission for the execution of the EU budget. The discharge is the decision by which the European Parliament closes the life of a budget exercise. The Parliament bases its discharge decision on recommendations from the Council and the annual report from the European Court of Auditors.
The discharge procedure begins with the Court of Auditors presenting a report to the Budgetary Control Committee. The committee follows up the execution of the budget through meetings with the Commissioners responsible for policy areas with budgetary implications.
