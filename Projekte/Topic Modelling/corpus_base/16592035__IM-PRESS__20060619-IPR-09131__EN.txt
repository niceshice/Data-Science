Although the concept of lifelong learning is gaining ground, too few adults are participating so national strategies should be urgently implemented in all Member States, says the Culture and Education Committee. Early school leavers, the disabled, long-term unemployed people, women, older people and those with low basic skills should have priority in the Commission's proposals regarding key competences for lifelong learning.
In adopting a report by Helga Tr√ºpel (Greens/EFA, DE), MEPs in the committee stressed the importance of creating a European frame of reference for eight key competences, offering EU citizens a tool to adapt to an evolving labour market in a knowledge based society.
The eight proposed competences include communication in the mother tongue, in foreign languages, maths, science and technology, but the Committee also highlighted the importance of civic competence, based on the concepts of democracy, justice, equality, citizenship and civil rights.
Knowledge of the main events, trends and agents of change in national, European and world history and present, including the aspect of European diversity, was essential, said the committee, as was the knowledge of the aims, values and policies of social and political movements. In the light of the Lisbon strategy, the report also stresses the need for the achievement of an average employment rate for the EU of 70% overall and of at least 60% among women.
