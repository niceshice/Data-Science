Postal services: market opening by 2011 still on track
Free movement of services
2007-12-18 - 14:25
The Transport Committee has confirmed that remaining postal service monopolies should expire by 2011 - or 2013 for some Member States. In its second reading vote on Tuesday, the committee decided by an overwhelming majority to stick to the compromise already endorsed by the Council on the opening up of EU postal services to competition. This paves the way for a final vote at the Brussels plenary session on 31 January.
In its common position, the Council had incorporated all major elements of the European Parliament's position at first reading. Rapporteur Markus Ferber (EPP-ED, DE) had therefore recommended that the committee approve the common position without amendments. The committee followed his advice, with all of the 72 amendments tabled being either withdrawn or rejected.
Opening up of the market by 2011 or 2013
Among the key points was the date for market opening: by 2011, two years later than the Commission had proposed, with the possibility for Member States which joined the EU after 2004 or with a difficult topography, such as Greece and Luxembourg, to postpone market opening by a further two years to 2013.
A letter delivered and collected every day
The text makes clear that, in a liberalised market, letters should go on being both delivered and collected at least once a day, at least five days a week, for every EU citizen, in remote areas as well as cities. The funding for these universal services should be guaranteed if market players prove unable to provide such services profitably. In that case, Member States may decide to set up compensation funds.
The principle of reciprocity
MEPs also agreed with Council on the principle of reciprocity: in order to avoid market distortion and unfair competition, those Member States having opened their markets should be able to refuse authorisation to operators still protected by a national monopoly in another Member State.
Safeguards for postal staff
Social considerations should be taken into account in this process of market opening, say MEPs. Member States will be able to reflect working conditions in their authorisation procedures. They will also have the right to impose conditions on the supply of postal services for non-economic reasons, such as compliance with employment conditions and social security schemes, where these are laid down in law or by a collective agreement negotiated between national social partners.
The rapporteur's reaction
Commenting on the committee vote, Mr Ferber said: "This could be a decisive step forward in a procedure which has started in the early ninety's of the last century. I am very happy with the outcome of this vote. The agreement with Council is a realistic package. I am confident that the January plenary session will give the final green light for a new future of the postal services in the EU".
What happens next?
The second reading plenary debate is scheduled for Wednesday 30 January 2008 in Brussels and the vote will be taken on Thursday 31 January 2008. If Mr Ferber's recommendation for second reading will be adopted, this co-decision procedure can be concluded at this stage.
