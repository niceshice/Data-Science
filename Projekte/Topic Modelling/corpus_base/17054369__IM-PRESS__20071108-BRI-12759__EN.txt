Briefing - 28-29 November 2007 - Brussels plenary session
2007-11-22 - 18:09
Selected highlights of the Brussels 28-29 November 2007 plenary session include:
Wednesday 28 November 2007
At 5.00 pm on Wednesday 28 November , Spanish Prime Minister , José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero , will set out his vision to MEPs on the future of Europe. The debate - which follows those already held with the prime ministers of Belgium, Ireland, Italy and the Netherlands - takes place just ahead of the signing of the new EU Treaty of Lisbon on 13 December.
The session starts at 3pm with a debate on the approval by the European Parliament of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union . The UK has a special protocol on its application which makes clear that the Charter will not extend the powers of any court –UK or European – to strike down UK legislation. On Wednesday 12 December in Strasbourg, the European Parliament will hold a ceremony on the proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
MEPs will debate a second-reading agreement on new rules on TV advertising and product placement . New EU rules could be adopted before Christmas, as the Council common position on these rules was already negotiated with Parliament. If Parliament backs the common position, then the new Audiovisual Media Services Directive could be announced in the EU Official Journal before the end of the 2007. One innovation is the rules on "product placement", whereby a specific product is placed in TV-programmes for commercial purposes. This would be allowed only in a limited range of programmes, and then only under strict rules.
Freight trains should soon run from Antwerp to Athens or Lisbon to Liverpool without stopping at borders or changing locomotives or train crews. So say three co-decision reports, being put forward by the Transport Committee, on measures to revitalise the railways by removing obstacles to the free circulation of trains throughout the European network.
The House will also debate the control of the acquisition and possession of weapons. MEPs call for new measures to update a 1991 directive on firearms to bring it into line with a UN Protocol on firearms and to generally update the text. The new directive, which will amend the current text passed in 1991, will tackle the criminal use of firearms without inconveniencing legal users of weapons. The text proposed by the EP is a result of 18 months of work which has led to a first reading compromise with the Council.
Thursday 29 November 2007
Thursday starts with a debate on the Court of Auditors Annual report for 2006 with Mr Hubert Weber , President of the Court of Auditors. For the thirteenth consecutive year, the Court of Auditors has not delivered a positive "declaration of assurance" (DAS) for the EU budget. 2006 was marred by errors in the legality and the regularity of underlying transactions. The progress made remains insufficient to enable the Court to present a satisfactory report. MEPs will also vote on the approval of seven Members of the Court of Auditors including David Bostock from the UK.
The House also votes on a report from the Constitutional Affairs Committee on political parties at the European level and the rules regarding their funding . If approved, the new legislation would improve the financial stability of European parties, and thus facilitate long-term planning. It would also permit the creation of European political foundations . A total of €7 million is foreseen in the EU 2008 budget for the new political foundations. European political parties receive total EU funding of about €10 million per year.
MEPs will vote on a report from the Development Committee on agricultural development in Africa which expresses great regret at the prospect of the attendance of international outcast Robert Mugabe at the Lisbon EU-Africa Summit 8-9 December , whose presence will do much to discredit the good work of the Summit on democratic governance.
The House also votes on two resolutions after debates held in Strasbourg (12-15 November 2007) on the situation in Georgia and the proclamation of consensus on humanitarian aid.
A pre-session briefing will be held in Brussels on Monday, 26 November 2007 at 11.00am. Venue PHS 0A050. 20071108BRI12759

Fundamental rights
Approval by the EP of the Charter of Fundamental Rights
2007-11-22 - 18:09
Jo Leinen, Chair of the Constitutional Affairs Committee will be recommending that the European Parliament give its assent to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The UK has a special protocol on its application which makes clear that the Charter will not extend the powers of any court –UK or European – to strike down UK legislation. On Wednesday 12 December in Strasbourg, the European Parliament will hold a ceremony on the proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The Charter sets out in one place the rights which citizens across the EU already have, for example through the European Convention on Human Rights, or through existing EU law. Its aim is to ensure that EU institutions respect those fundamental rights. The Charter reaffirms existing rights and will apply to all Member States when they implement Union law.
UK and Poland position
There is a UK-specific protocol (see link below) which makes clear that the Charter will:
Not extend the powers of any court –UK or European – to strike down UK legislation; and
Not create any new justiciable rights in the UK. For example, it will not create any greater social or economic rights than are already provided in UK law. (The same applies to Poland) Rapporteur Jo LEINEN PSE DE A6-0445/2007 Approval by Parliament of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union Procedure: Interinstitutional Agreement
Debate: 28.11.2007 See Protocol number 7 on the application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights to the UK and Poland. See point 8 on the application of the Charter having the same legal value as the Treaties. Full text of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (2000)

New TV and product placement advertising rules to be decided
2007-11-22 - 18:09
New EU rules on TV advertising and product placement could be adopted before Christmas, as the Council common position on these rules was already negotiated with Parliament. If Parliament backs the Common position, then the new Audiovisual Media Services Directive could be announced in the EU Official Journal before the end of the 2007. The Council common position was reached after negotiations with the Parliaments' rapporteur Ruth Hieronymi (EPP-ED, DE). Ms Hieronymi is satisfied with the results of the negotiations, which took account most of the concerns raised in Parliament's first reading.
"Audiovisual media services will be cultural and economic goods also in the future due to this directive. Media pluralism and cultural diversity are safeguarded and as well the opportunity to develop new business models", said Ms Hieronymi.
New rules on advertising and product placement
The new rules update the 1997 Television without Frontiers directive, now to be dubbed the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, to keep pace with developments in audiovisual technology and advertising. They will apply to "TV-like services" such as web-streamed TV programmes, but not to private web sites.
One innovation is the rules on "product placement", whereby a specific product is placed in TV-programmes for commercial purposes. This would be allowed only in a limited range of programmes, and then only under strict rules. It would be prohibited in news and current affairs programmes, children's programmes, documentaries and programmes providing advice. Parliament has ensured, that signals must appear when a programme containing product placement starts, when it ends and after commercial breaks.
Commercial breaks every half-hour
Commercial breaks will be permitted every 30 minutes in TV films, cinematographic works and news programmes. In children's programmes, commercial breaks will not be allowed unless the programmes are more than 30 minutes long. There are no insertion rules for other types of programmes, such as serials. The maximum of amount of advertising permitted under the new rules would not exceed be 12 minutes an hour.
Furthermore, Member States and the Commission are required to encourage media service providers to develop codes of conduct towards children, for example to preclude junk food commercials aimed at children.
Parliament also ensured that a provision on access to media services for disabled people was included in the legislation itself, and not just the introductory remarks, and included an the obligation for Member states to ensure that the directive's application is overseen by independent regulatory bodies.
Procedure
The new rules were given their first reading in Parliament in December 2006. Then negotiations between Parliament and the Council took place and a political agreement backed by the Committee on Culture and Education was reached in May 2007. Since May lawyer-linguists have been working on the final version, which was officially adopted in the Council on 15 October and the Culture and Education Committee on 12 November. Rapporteur Ruth HIERONYMI EPP-ED DE A6-0442/2007 Coordination of certain of the Member States' provisions concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities ("Audiovisual media services without frontiers"), (amend.

MEPs to tighten EU rules on gun ownership
2007-11-22 - 18:09
In a co-decision report for the Internal Market Committee, MEPs call for new measures to update a 1991 directive on firearms to bring it into line with a UN Protocol on firearms and to generally update the text. The new directive, which will amend the current text passed in 1991, will tackle the criminal use of firearms without inconveniencing legal users of weapons. The text proposed by the EP is a result of 18 months of work which has led to a first reading compromise with the Council.
The legislation would introduce rules enhancing safety with respect to gun ownership, while not inconveniencing hunters, target shooters and other legitimate owners. The text includes control of the sale of guns over the internet, reinforcement of the marking system, computerisation and extension of the period of the record keeping and an increased exchange of information between Member States.
The report, drafted by Gisela Kallenbach (Greens/EFA, DE), broadly endorses a Commission proposal to update the EU's 1991 directive on the "acquisition and possession of weapons", so as to bring it into line with a UN Protocol against the illicit manufacturing and trafficking of firearms, signed by the EC in 2001. The text proposed by the European Parliament is a result of 18 months of work which has led to a first reading compromise with the Council.
Speaking on the first-reading agreement with the Council, Gisela Kallenbach said: "I am convinced that we finally agreed on a good compromise (with the Council), particularly ensuring the rights of legal users of weapons while also tackling the illegal aspects to improve the safety for European Citizens. The substance of the committee's concerns has been maintained in the final text. This result therefore represents a success for the Parliament's negotiating strategy. Let me thank all participants for the close cooperation as well as the constructive atmosphere during these negotiations."
Arlene McCarthy , Chair of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee (PES, Labour, North West UK) said: "Following the recent tragic school massacre in Finland, the attempted school shooting in Germany and the spread of deadly converted weapons in cities in the UK, MEPs have the opportunity to join the Commission and Council in backing this law to tackle the illegal trade and smuggling of weapons. This law meets Europe's international obligations under the UN Protocol on firearms and puts in place a control system which protects public safety by ensuring guns don't fall in to the hands of criminals and ensuring weapons can be traced to their owners. This is Europe taking pragmatic and practical action for its citizens."
The scope of the directive to be enlarged
The new directive would cover the possession and the acquisition of firearms but also of their parts and ammunition, including these imported from third countries. The Directive would as well apply to illicit manufacturing and trafficking of weapons and their essential components. Additionally, convertible weapons are brought within the new definition of 'firearm'. Such weapons have been identified by the police in many Member States as a growing source of firearms for criminals. The rules on acquisition and possession of weapons by individual collectors or officially recognised bodies concerned with the historical and cultural aspects of firearms remain unchanged. The text also says that the directive should cover "selling by means of distance communications" (e.g. via the internet), which should be "strictly controlled" by those Member States who allow it at all.
Better marking, details on file for 20 years
In order to make weapons traceability more efficient, the text requires the use of alphanumeric symbols. The marking, affixed to an "essential component of the firearm", must include the name of manufacturer, the place and the year of fabrication and the serial number.
MEPs say that Member States should maintain "a computerised data filing system", including the identification information of each firearm subject to the directive. Furthermore, whereas the Commission had proposed that such data be kept in registers for 10 years (the minimum required under the UN Protocol), MEPs feel that it should be "for not less than 20 years", given the very long lifespan of firearms. The MEPs also want to make more detailed the recorded data including type, make, model, calibre, serial number, names and addresses of the supplier and the person acquiring or possessing the weapon.
Data exchange and cooperation between Member States
MEPs also require Member States to exchange information to ensure an efficient application of the directive, with the assistance of a contact group to be set up by the Commission.
Make the live easier for legal users
The directive will not inconvenience legal users of firearms, such as hunters and target shooters. The four category system for classifying firearms is retailed, although several Member States have simplified the system by only using two categories. These Member States, according with the subsidiary principle, can go further than the directive and keep their stricter classification systems in the national gun law. The Commission will evaluate the four category system by 2012, with a view to the possibilities to enhance the functioning of the internal market in this area.
Member States will no longer be allowed to make acceptance of the European firearms pass conditional upon the payment of any fee or charge.
The text also calls Member States to simplify administrative procedure of authorisation to acquire and possess firearms.
Entry into force and implementation
The directive is expected to come into force by January 2008, with a transposition deadline by 2010.
Member States can have stricter rules and criminal sanctions
Member States would remain free to introduce stricter rules in their national legislation implementing the directive.
The UN Protocol, which Member States have undertaken to implement, requires that certain criminal sanctions are introduced into Member State law. The directive will contain a reminder of that.

Sounder funding arrangements for European political parties
2007-11-22 - 18:09
A Commission proposal to allow European political parties to finance campaign activities for the 2009 elections is backed by the Constitutional Affairs Committee. If approved, the new legislation would improve the financial stability of European parties, and thus facilitate long-term planning. It would also permit the creation of European political foundations. The committee will ask the House to vote in favour of the legislation so funding for political foundations can go ahead from 2008 A total of €7 million is foreseen in the EU 2008 budget for the new political foundations. European political parties receive total EU funding of about €10 million per year.
The existing legislation on the financing of European political parties needs to be amended to enhance the European nature of Parliament's elections, and European political parties should enjoy more flexibility in managing their funds and financing their electoral activities, says the committee in a report by Jo Leinen (PES, DE).
No funding of national parties permitted
To enhance political debate at EU level with a view to the European Parliament's 2009 elections, the committee welcomed a Commission proposal to allow European political parties to use their money to finance campaign activities for European elections.
Such use of public funds is currently forbidden under EU law. The report as approved in committee also endorses the general principle that in no circumstances should these funds constitute direct or indirect financing of other parties and particularly of national parties and candidates.
The 2007 budget set out the money allocated to the EU parties. It is the EP who controls and manages the funds. In fact, the budget line for them is in the Parliament's section of the EU budget (line 402, chapter 40, title IV section I (Parliament, see link below) Ten parties were eligible for funds for 2007.
More financial stability
In an effort to strengthen the European dimension of political parties, committee members also supported the aim of improving financial stability of European parties, so as to facilitate long-term planning. This financial stability is currently lacking, said MEPs, because the grants given to European political parties are subject to change every year, discouraging any proper financial self-management.
The Commission proposes to allow political parties to carry over, by way of derogation from the no-profit rule, 25% of annual total income from one year to the first quarter of the following year. Moreover, the new legislation would introduce the possibility of accumulating reserves, over several years as own resources, of up to 100% of parties' average annual income. These resources would consist of donations, contributions from member parties and individual members.
It is also proposed that the EU general budget may finance up to 85% of the expenditure of a European political party or foundation, compared with 75% now.
Foundations
If approved, the Commission proposal for amending the 2003 Regulation on the statute and financing of European political parties would also introduce a new legal basis for establishing European political foundations.
According to the proposal, endorsed by the committee, foundations would have to be formally associated with an already established European party in order to access funding - a foundation may receive funds only by applying through the political party with which is affiliated.
Finally, the proposed regulation leaves to European political parties the task of defining their relations with associated foundations, including an "appropriate degree of separation".

2006 Court of Auditors annual report and verdict on seven candidate members
2007-11-22 - 18:09
On Thursday morning, Mr Hubert Weber, President of the Court of Auditors will present its annual report for 2006 to the European Parliament. For the thirteenth consecutive year, the Court of Auditors has not delivered a positive "declaration of assurance" (DAS) for the EU budget. 2006 was marred by errors in the legality and the regularity of underlying transactions. The progress made remains insufficient to enable the Court to present a satisfactory report. However, "errors" should not be confused with "fraud", as the Court states in its report: errors affect the final beneficiary and concern either amounts or procedures. Every case of fraud discovered is in any case notified to the EU Anti-Fraud Office.
Catastrophic deficiencies
The monitoring system in place in the Member States for the structural funds still has "catastrophic deficiencies" said Budgetary Control Committee Chairman Herbert Bösch (PES, AT). "It is imperative that the situation should improve, and we are counting on firm support from the European Commission to achieve significant results", he said.
Dan Jørgensen (PES, DK), for his part, called for the implementation of "national declarations", requested by the European Parliament in the three previous discharge exercises, which would ensure that Member States assume their responsibilities for co-managing the EU budget. "The European Parliament will play its role as EU spending watchdog. The Court of Auditors conclusions show that worrying weaknesses remain, especially for the structural funds. We expect clear responses from the Commission to enable us to take the right decision on the 2006 discharge".
Next steps
In April 2008, Parliament must give its opinion on the discharge to be given to all European institutions and agencies, for the 2006 accounts. MEPs have three options: grant a discharge, postpone it, or refuse it (follow "press kit" link below).
Vote on seven Members of the Court of Auditors
The House will also vote (by secret ballot) on seven candidate Members of the Court of Auditors. MEPs in the Budgetary Control Committee have already given a favourable opinion of all the candidates but called for the appointment procedure to be reviewed, as Parliament is at present only consulted on the names put forward by the Council.
With the mandate of seven Members of the Court expiring on 31 December 2007, the Budgetary Control Committee interviewed David Bostock (United Kingdom), Michel Cretin (France), Maarten Engwirda (Netherlands), Henri Grethen (Luxembourg), Harald Noack (Germany), Ioannis Sarmas (Greece) and Hubert Weber (Austria).
In the reports by Ines Ayala-Sender (PES, ES) which will be forwarded to the plenary so that the consultation procedure can be completed, MEPs stress their wish for the criteria for these appointments to be revised, partly because of difficulties encountered in past procedures.
"Closer cooperation is needed between Parliament and Council on the appointment procedure", said the rapporteur and Herbert Bösch (PES, AT), chair of the committee. "A more efficient and coherent procedure is needed in Parliament's view and the EP would also like to receive the information on the candidates sufficiently far in advance".

Transport
Non-stop trains from Lisbon to Liverpool
2007-11-22 - 18:09
Freight trains should soon run from Antwerp to Athens or Lisbon to Liverpool without stopping at borders or changing locomotives or train crews. So say three co-decision reports, being put forward by the Transport Committee, on measures to revitalise the railways by removing obstacles to the free circulation of trains throughout the European network. But MEPs in the committee stress that much still needs to be done to improve the interoperability of the European railways. National procedures for the approval of locomotives are seen as the main barrier to creating an EU-wide railway system. So mutual acceptance of both existing and new railway stock specifications needs to be facilitated, says rapporteur José Ortuondo Larrea (ALDE, ES).
Authorisation and technical specifications
In addition to the Commission proposals, the committee proposes a range of technical compromise amendments that restructure a proposed procedure for authorising the placing in service of railway vehicles that comply with Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSIs) based on European standards and national rules.
Maintenance and safety
The committee is proposing a compromise text drafted by Rapporteur Paolo COSTA (ALDE, IT), which makes it clear that someone must be designated as responsible for checking that each vehicle is well maintained. But it also says that responsibility for operating safety must in any event rest with the railway operator, as this is vital to assigning responsibility in the event of accidents. This compromise takes account of the existing interoperability provisions of the EU Regulation on the European Railway Agency and the Railway Safety Directive (RSD).

MEPs in the committee also favour granting more powers to the European Railway Agency, and said that from 2015, this agency, rather than its national counterparts, should grant authorisations for railway vehicles to operate Community-wide.

Flexicurity: the way forward?
2007-11-22 - 18:09
Parliament will vote on a report by the Employment and Social Affairs Committee on "flexicurity", an approach which seeks to meet the needs of a dynamic economy by combining labour market flexibility with security for workers. The own-initiative report, drafted by Ole Christensen (PES, DK), is a response to a Commission communication (see link below). It recognises that "to succeed in the 21st century, Europe needs a well educated workforce and companies that are quick to seize opportunities that arise in a fast-moving world to increase productivity and enhance innovation". Indeed, "the biggest problems in the EU concern the supply of a skilled and adaptable workforce in competitive and innovative companies".
It also "strongly endorses the conclusion that flexibility can be in the interests of the employee as well as the employer". At the same time, "flexicurity can be a policy strategy for the reform of the labour market and as such must be comprehensive by including all the existing facets of employment and social policy at both national and EU levels".
Far from entailing an abandonment of the European Social Model, the reports argues that "all models of flexicurity should be based on common values that underpin" this model and that "flexibility and security requirements reinforce one another" in the modern world, though this does require "a climate of trust and dialogue" between all stakeholders. According to the rapporteur, "people will accept recurring change if they have guarantees and compensating mechanisms". In this connection the report calls for a crackdown on undeclared work and the black economy as well as ambitious educational and training measures, including life-long learning.
The report emphasises that "there is no one-size-fits-all approach to flexicurity and that each Member State should compose the elements of their flexicurity concept on the basis of its own situation and national traditions, within the framework of the common principles".
The EU's role is precisely to ensure that there is such a framework. However, the report criticises the Commission's paper on a number of points, and calls on the European Council of December 2007 to "adopt a balanced set of common principles of flexicurity", which would include "core rights for all workers regardless of their employment status", adaptable but reliable contracts coupled with action against abusive labour practices, measures to reconcile work and private life, gender equality and equal opportunities.

Economic Partnership Agreements - new WTO waiver or not?
2007-11-22 - 18:09
The Commission will make a statement on Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) currently being negotiated between the EU and the 78 ACP states. EPAs are scheduled to enter into force by 1 January 2008 at the latest. The current EU trading agreements runs out at the end of 2007 with the end of the WTO waiver making a new agreement paramount. Formal negotiation of EPAs at the level of all ACP countries started in September 2002. Since October 2003 regional negotiations with the six regions (West Africa, Central Africa, Eastern and Southern Africa, the Southern African Development Community, Caribbean, Pacific) have been launched.
Kigali declaration
African, Caribbean and Pacific countries need more time to negotiate a deal on the ACP-EU economic partnership agreements says a “Kigali Declaration” adopted by the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in Kigali, Rwanda, on 22 November. The World Trade Organisation waiver for existing trade agreements expires at the end of 2007.
The Kigali Declaration on Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), “urges the European Commission to acknowledge that more time is needed for ACP states to assess the implications of the agreements proposed, given that negotiations have only taken place in earnest for the past two years”. This declaration follows up the Cape Town Declaration of 2002, at the start of the EPA negotiating process. The declaration notes that ACP states declare that they “have been put under pressure by the European Commission to sign an EPA and that this is against the spirit of the ACP-EU partnership.” It also states that all agreements reached, whether interim arrangements or full EPAs, must ensure that no country is left worse off after the expiry of the negotiation deadline.
Commenting on the need for a new deal, ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly Co-President Glenys Kinnock (PES, UK) said: “Attempts to frame such agreements have proven difficult, largely because the Commission negotiators have approached the talks on EPAs as if they were conventional free trade negotiations focused on market opening, rather than as tools for development. The ACP regions, on the other hand, have been concerned that the measures proposed by the Commission will not have their intended outcomes and could well jeopardise their development efforts, and hamper efforts to eradicate poverty.” Pressure for a new waiver to the WTO and review clause refused by the Commission "A further waiver to the WTO will not be granted simply by showing that progress has been made", said the Commissioner, referring to the negotiations that are advancing at different speeds with different regions. While the Caribbean and the Pacific are on course to sign the accords by the end of 2007, the central African region does not seem "in the slightest hurry" to sign an EPA, said Mr Mandelson.

Climate change: the role of trade policy
2007-11-22 - 18:09
As the scientific and political consensus on the seriousness of climate change grows, all policy areas of the industrialised nations are coming under scrutiny, including the EU's own trade policy. An own-initiative report of Parliament's International Trade Committee takes a close look at this issue. The report, drafted by Alain Lipietz (Greens/EFA, FR), argues that "the current economic model, which entails constant maximisation of consumption, production and trade, is unsustainable as this results in ever-increasing demand for resources and transport and a growing quantity of waste and emissions".
Environmental cost of transporting goods is often overlooked
For two decades, international trade has been growing at a rate of two to two and a half times the rate of global production, as a result of the search for an international division of labour that optimises salary and tax costs - but in a context where greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are not properly internalised into transport costs. More specifically, the volume of sea transport is 40 times that of air transport (in tonnes/km) and yet produces only twice its greenhouse gas (GHG) contamination, whilst lorries produce 4 times more GHG emissions than trains per tonne/km.
How much carbon to transport a lamb chop?
The International Trade Committee therefore stresses the need "to raise public awareness of consumer products' total environmental costs" and "calls on the Commission and the Council to propose measures for the provision of information on the energy consumed, and greenhouse gases emitted, during the manufacture and transport of products placed on sale within the EU". A good example is the UK Government's proposal to introduce carbon footprint product labels displaying the level of CO2 emissions caused by the production, transport and eventual disposal of a product.
The rapporteur stresses that the means of transport is just as important as the distance a product has travelled: for a British consumer, a New Zealand lamb chop has a higher GHG cost than an English chop if it arrives by plane, but not if it arrives by boat. Therefore it is the GHG content that must be assessed.
International cooperation
Among its proposals the report argues for strong cooperation between the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the Climate Change Convention and the WTO, and asks the Commission to develop an initiative to support this aim.
Environmental protection clauses in trade agreements?
The report also urges the Commission "to systematically include environmental protection clauses, with special reference to reducing carbon dioxide emissions, in its trade agreements with third countries". It adds that "the transfer of energy efficient and other environmentally friendly technologies from the EU to developing countries has a crucial role to play in decoupling economic development from greenhouse gas emissions". And among other things, the report urges industrialised countries to take responsibility for the widespread deforestation caused by international trade.

Macro-financial aid to Lebanon
2007-11-22 - 18:09
The International Trade Committee will ask the House to approve with amendments a draft Council decision to provide Lebanon with macro-financial assistance totalling €80 million. Lebanon remains one of the world’s most deeply indebted countries. The impact of the 1975-90 civil war, the 2006 summer conflict with Israel and the effects of past economic policies have led to a severe economic crisis. The aim of this proposal is to help the Lebanese state carry out post-war reconstruction and pursue economic recovery by providing macro-financial assistance in the form of a grant of €30 million and a loan of €50 million.
The International Trade Committee's report, drafted by Kader Arif (PES, FR), agrees with the need to assist Lebanon but proposes several amendments aimed at improving the clarity, transparency and accountability of the arrangements, including better reporting to Parliament by the Commission.

Tourism
Transport Committee favours single EC quality mark for tourist accommodation
2007-11-22 - 18:09
A three-star label does not always guarantee the same hotel quality standards in Amsterdam as in Athens. Plans for an EU-wide classification of tourist accommodation, an EC quality mark, and visa, labelling, health tourism, accessibility and promotion measures to boost the European tourism market, are set out in an own-initiative report adopted by the EP Transport Committee on Tuesday 9 October. The difficulty of developing a consistent cross-policy approach to tourism at EU level has resulted in various drawbacks that have hampered growth in tourism and increase the risk that Europe could lose market share. To remedy these drawbacks, measures are needed in the following fields, says the report, which was drafted by committee chair Paolo Costa (ALDE, IT)
Visa policy
MEPs in the committee call on the Schengen Member States to establish common consular desks for granting visas to non-EU applicants, and highlighted the need to simplify and reduce the cost of visa application procedures. These desks should apply the same visa criteria and improve the welcome offered to visa applicants. Procedures should also be simplified for tourists issued with visas for non-Schengen EU countries, within the limits of security rules required to combat illegal immigration, terrorism and cross-border crime, they added.
Labels
Members in the committee take the view that the EU's multiplicity of local labels needs to be consolidated, for better international recognition. They therefore called on the Commission, in co-operation with the European catering trade organisation, HOTREC to promote common tourist accommodation labelling processes in the different Member States and to promote quality models that had proved effective elsewhere (for example the Qualmark in New Zealand), in order to improve visibility.
Health tourism
The committee also says that to combat a decline in health tourism, there was a need for a specific Community directive to define the recognition and use of hydro-thermal resorts and the role of health tourism and thermal cures in connection with tourist facilities. This is a sector in which additional resources could help to create a significant amount of new direct and indirect employment, it added.
Accessible tourism
Member States and the Commission were called on to initialize an "Access for all" EC label that would guarantee the accessibility of facilities to people with reduced mobility. This label would cover facilities such as accommodation, restaurants, leisure and natural sites, monuments and museums.
Promoting EU destinations
MEPs in the committee welcome the implementation of a selection process for a yearly "European destination of excellence" as Parliament had proposed in September 2005.
Cyclists and the Iron Curtain
Finally, the committee urges the Commission to promote the cross-border memorial cycle route along the former Iron Curtain, as an example of "gentle mobility in tourism" and as a symbol of the reunification of Europe.

Judicial cooperation
Civil and commercial court judgments to be recognised EU-wide
2007-11-22 - 18:09
The Legal Affairs Committee is recommending approving, at first reading, the Rome I regulation, which is designed to improve the recognition and enforcement in all EU Member States of court judgments on civil and commercial disputes. Members of the committee give the go-ahead to the Commission proposal on the Rome I regulation in a report by Cristian Dumitrescu (PES, RO). If adopted, this legislation will provide common EU rules on the choice of the law to apply in case of cross-border disputes.
In order to improve the mutual enforcement of court judgments among Member States, EU-wide rules are needed governing the choice of the applicable law. It is important that, if citizens are free to choose the court where they can make their claim, they cannot simply choose the courts of one Member State rather than another just because the law is more favourable to their cause there (a practice known as "forum-shopping").
Conflict-of-laws rules where court is not laid down in contract
As a basic rule, two persons who stipulate a contract are free to choose the law applicable in the event of a dispute. If no choice is made, to avoid forum-shopping, the regulation would introduce common EU rules on the choice of the applicable law.
MEPs in the committee argue that, in the case of a contract between a professional and a consumer, the latter should be advantaged by the choice of the court. One amendment adopted by the committee states that, in the event of a dispute, the applicable law should in general be the most familiar one, i.e. the law of the country where the consumer has his habitual residence.
However, in the case of a contract for the sale of goods, the committee decided that the applicable law should be that of the seller's habitual residence.
As far as individual contracts of employment are concerned, where the law applicable has not been chosen by the parties, the contract would be governed by the law of the country in which the employee habitually carries out his work.
Family matters excluded from the legislation
Obligations arising out of family relationships, from matrimonial property regimes, wills and succession are excluded from the scope of the regulation.
The committee finally calls on the Commission to present, no later than two years after the date of application, a report on the implementation of this regulation.
Together with the recently approved Rome II regulation on non-contractual matters, this regulation provides a complete set of Community rules of private international law relating to contractual and non-contractual obligations.

MEPs will vote on a report by Luisa MORGANTINI (GUE/NGL, IT) for the Development Committee on "Advancing African Agriculture - Proposal for agricultural development and food security in Africa" which expresses great regret at the prospect of the attendance of international outcast Robert Mugabe at the Lisbon EU-Africa Summit 8-9 December, whose presence will do much to discredit the good work of the Summit on democratic governance. The report emphasises the important role the EU should play, in international institutions such as the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, defending vigorously the right of African states to protect national and regional markets on the African continent against imports threatening the survival of local producers of essential agricultural products.

Situation in Georgia - MEPs to vote on a resolution
2007-11-22 - 18:09
The European Parliament will vote on a resolution on the situation in Georgia following the debate that was held in Strasbourg on Wednesday 14 November 2007 (see link below). European Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner speaking in the debate in Strasbourg said: "We all know that, on the one hand, there are great tensions between the opposition and the government, but, on the other hand, there might be also other tendencies there. I therefore think it is highly important that President Saakashvili has called for presidential elections. He has said that he will consult the population on the date for parliamentary elections. And I do hope that the reform aspect that we have really tried to promote will go on in the future, otherwise confidence in the Georgian Government will be very much damaged if the current crisis cannot be solved in a democratic way. But, of course, we will try to do everything to support Georgia." Motion for a resolution

Proclamation of consensus on humanitarian aid - vote on a resolution
2007-11-22 - 18:09
The House will vote on a resolution on the proclamation of consensus on humanitarian aid. MEPs debate the topic on Tuesday 13 November in Strasbourg, (see link). Gay Mitchell (EEP-ED, IE) said in the debate: " There are increasing numbers of vulnerable people in crisis situations and in natural disasters. In 2003 there were 200 million people affected, with 45 million people in need of life-saving assistance. Since then we have had the Asian tsunami, numerous earthquakes, floods and hurricanes affecting Central America and the horrific situation in Darfur.
The Consensus will underline the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence.
Development assistance is a crucial link to preventing humanitarian emergencies. Disaster risk reduction and a clear commitment to link relief, rehabilitation and development are essential."
More than half of official international humanitarian aid comes from the EU - either through the Commission or through bilateral Member State programmes. The Commission is seeking a consensus affirming that EU aid:
is founded unequivocally on the humanitarian principles of neutrality, independence and impartiality, and
must be delivered rapidly and efficiently to crisis victims on the basis of assessed needs.
This would be the first time that:
The European Union issues a joint document on its humanitarian aid policy (since the adoption of the Humanitarian Aid regulation in 1996)
The EU as a whole, both the Commission and all Member States, has a comprehensive policy statement on humanitarian aid that underlines our commitment to the fundamental humanitarian principles
The principles and guidance of the Good Humanitarian Donorship Initiative of 2003 would be discussed in detail and formally adopted at EU level
The EU would commit itself to diversity of implementing partners
Member States and the Commission would discuss concrete steps to improve coordination of humanitarian aid activities
The Community's added value in humanitarian aid would be formally recognized and steps for further improvement endorsed by Member States and the European Parliament Motion for a resolution
