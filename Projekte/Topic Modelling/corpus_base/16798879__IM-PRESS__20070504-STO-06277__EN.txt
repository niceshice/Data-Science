Intellectual property: MEPs back criminal sanctions against counterfeiters

Any private copying of music for instance is excluded from the Directive
In the April Strasbourg session MEPs took a landmark decision in the fight against commercial counterfeiters by supporting the first ever directive that would involve the use of criminal law. If adopted, any infringement of intellectual property rights would be treated as a criminal office and could lead to a €300,000 fine and/or 4 years in jail. It was in part the possible use of criminal law that led to a close vote with 374 MEPs supporting it and 278 voting against with 17 abstaining.
The vote was at the first reading stage and based on a report by Italian Socialist Nicola Zingaretti. The text will now be discussed by ministers from the 27 EU states.
Will aid fight against organised crime
There's no question that intellectual copyright theft is a serious and widespread phenomenon - estimates put the cost at €8 billion a year of the EU's gross domestic product. It is estimated that 37% of all software used in the EU is copied or pirated in some form or another. Music is another area where the forgers are very active - worldwide it is believed that 36% of all CDs and cassettes are pirated. Many of the beneficiaries of this type of piracy are organised criminal gangs and Mr Zingaretti specifically alluded to this saying that "this directive is to fight organised crime".
At present the system across the EU is widely diverse with penalties for infringing intellectual copyright differing widely. In Greece you can be fined €859 whereas in the Netherlands the penalty is €98,000.
As well as fines and possible criminal sentence some of the sanctions envisaged in the legislation include the destruction of property, confiscation of pirated goods, possible closure of the company involved and a temporary or permanent ban on commercial trading.
Private and non-profit users excluded
An important aspect of the report is that sanctions should only apply to those who want to obtain commercial profit - and not to private home users. This means that piracy of music or software by private individuals for non-profit purposes is excluded - although this does mean it becomes legal! National governments have measures in place to deal with this type of activity.
The rapporteur strongly favoured excluding private users as infringement of copyright by many individuals may be involuntary - i.e. they do not know they are actually doing it. As Hans-Peter Mayer of the European People's Party said "criminalisation is not aimed at citizens but at professional counterfeiters".
