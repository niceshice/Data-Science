Protests continue in Egypt Â©Belga/Xinhua/Nasser Nouri In the wake of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's resignation on Friday night, Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek said, "the decision taken by President Mubarak should facilitate democratic transition without further violence."
In a statement on Friday evening, Mr Buzek said, "We in Europe will measure the next steps in the fulfilment of the people's demand by repealing the emergency laws and by ending all intimidation of journalists, human rights defenders or political dissidents. A new government including all democratic forces is crucial for the transition."
MEPs will discuss the situation in Egypt during the plenary session in Strasbourg next week and will vote a resolution on the issue.
