The Transport Committee unanimously approved on Tuesday an agreement between the EU and the USA on cooperation in the regulation of civil aviation safety. By streamlining various certification procedures, it should contribute to greater efficiency in airline operations.
Negotiations, which started in 2004, have recently been concluded by an agreement which settles the reciprocal acceptance of certifications in the field of civil aviation safety and environmental compatibility. Committee members believe that this agreement will facilitate operations at airports on both sides of the ocean. In a consultation procedure report drafted by Transport Committee Chair Paolo Costa (ALDE, IT), they therefore voted to approve the agreement as its stands.
The agreement focuses mainly on two aspects:
airline products designed, manufactured, modified or repaired under the regulatory control of the EU or US can be easily issued the necessary approvals to be registered or operated under the regularly control of the other side;
aircraft registered or operated under the regulatory control of the EU or US can be maintained by organisations under the regulatory control of the other side.
The agreement is based on mutual trust of each other's safety system and on the comparison of regulatory differences and is designed to work smoothly on a daily basis so as to solve technical issues.
It is also stipulated that each party shall respect the otherâ€™s findings on compliance with the rules. MEPs think that its implementation will improve the high degree of confidence in the airworthiness system on both sides.
Procedure: Consultation -- Committee vote: 26 in favour, none against, no abstentions -- Plenary vote: January, Strasbourg 2008-12-01 Committee on Transport and Tourism In the chair Paolo COSTA ALDE IT
