Parliament and the financial crisis
Economic and monetary affairs
2009-01-04 - 07:35
The economic crisis was frequently discussed by MEPs It's been a year of upheaval in the finance sector. There was an unprecedented slide in world economies and terms such as "credit crunch" and "global recession" became more and more commonplace in our daily lives. Read our articles where MEPs consider just how serious things are, what to do next and more importantly, how much safety the EU can offer?
Ahead of the G20 meeting in Washington, we asked MEPs on the Economic and Monetary affairs Committee to share their views on the European Commission's bailout package, which would inject €200 billion into European economies.
In another article, we look at ways to avert another crisis. Bulgarian Socialist Iliana Iotova talked about better financial education for tomorrow's generation, and called for "financial education to begin at primary school."

MEP on ways to avert future credit crunch
Iliana Iotova: Advocates education and frugailty Teaching children about basic finance so they avoid getting into bad debts at a later age is the aim of a leading MEP. Bulgarian Socialist Iliana Iotova has also raised concern about children taking loans their parents are unaware of and mortgages where people don't understand the small print.
The 44-year old former journalist believes that "financial education has to begin already in the primary school" and that the European Union should set aside a specific budget for financial education. She proposes €1.5 million. This would have common principles and be similar right across Europe. Easy credit and child loans worrying We put it to Ms Iotova whether more awareness could actually help people avoid such crises? She was emphatic: "I am convinced. One of the main causes of the crisis is the over-indebtedness of the population and this came from the United States. Our studies show that Europe is heading the same way as the U.S. - more credit is being taken and less is being repaid." She went on to say: "Another worrying phenomenon is that children take loans (like for shopping on the Internet) that parents cannot control. Another problem is the fashion in Europe for mortgaging of housing. Many people are not sufficiently financially literate and do not understand the small print in the contract for a home mortgage or loan and subsequently it appears that people can not repay these credits. " Watch the household budget As well as drawing on the lessons of the crash of 1929, Ms Iotova also says: "What I recommend to each household is to pay attention to the household budget: how much do we spend on electricity, food, heating - do we really need the things we are buying? I recommended being more cautious about our money and educating the children on the merits of saving." However, she ends on a positive note: "I am sure that this crisis will be overcome - we see the results of the meeting of the eurozone members and their will for solidarity. And those sceptical of the European Union and the Reform treaty can now see why it is worthwhile to have the EU." In early October fellow Members of the cross party Internal Market Committee backed her proposals. The full parliament will vote on them in November.

MEPs' diagnosis on economy ahead of Washington G20
Is capitalism dead, dying, or just in the operation theatre? The financial crisis has become a major threat to the economies, jobs and lives of millions worldwide. This weekend in Washington arguably the 20 most important countries in the world will meet to try and come up with a response. We asked leading MEPs on the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee what the world should do.
What reforms are needed?
The head of the committee Pervenche Berès wants the dealings of tax havens addressed. The French Socialist also wants a radical re-think of incentives that encourage short term investment and risk taking.
The Vice-chair of the committee, British Conservative John Purvis, would like to see the International Monetary Fund "revitalised" so it could be a last resort for countries.
Banning hedge funds, closure of tax havens and reversing the privatisation of pensions are 3 steps advocated by German MEP Sahra Wagenknecht of the left GUE/NGL group. She also wants the public ownership of shares if governments recapitalise banks. Bulgarian Liberal Mariela Baeva would like to see government-enforced transparency of financial markets.
For the Greens Heide Rühle said that "as long as a non-regulated market can co-exist with a regulated one, the objective of financial stability can't be effectively achieved!"
"An accountable, democratic, multilateral framework" is what is needed according to Dutch Socialist Ieke Van den Burg.
"Is capitalism dead, dying, or just in the operation theatre?"
We asked MEPs whether "capitalism is dead, dying, or just in the operation theatre?"
For Ms Berès "what we are witnessing now is the end of capitalism in the Reagan-Thatcher model. Capitalism which is purely financial, speculative and disconnected from the real economy and the producer has shown that it was not viable."
"It is not dead and must be revitalised. It is the only way to restore the level of economic growth which is necessary to avoid devastating conflict in the World," said Mr Purvis.
For one MEP, capitalism is undergoing surgery - but it could survive. Zsolt Becsey of the EPP-ED group said capitalism "is in the operating theatre. The most important thing is to block those tendencies where extraordinary profit hunger can destroy whole economic sectors."
According the Ms Wagenknecht the whole system is in the terminal ward. "The debate about a political and economic alternative to capitalism therefore needs to be put squarely on the European agenda."
A medical analogy for capitalism was also taken up by Ms Van den Burg. "It needs to live much more healthily and prevent the disease before it breaks out: with continuous exercise, healthy food, and so on."
Danger of "business as usual"
For Ms Rühle, "the financial crisis is the outcome of an excess of deregulation. It remains to be seen now if there is enough political willingness to draw the lessons of the crisis. The danger is of course to go back to 'business as usual'."
Ms Baeva made a historical observation that "the system, to be operative, has been changing and adjusting concepts, rules, and social relationships to try and survive in rough waters. In disturbing times, when the failures of the system are obvious - they must be remedied".

Financial crisis: MEPs assess EU action and impact
A South Korean trader; MEPs debate more financial regulation Thursday As banks tumble like bowling pins and confidence plummets, Thursday sees MEPs consider whether to back wider financial regulation. Ahead of this debate we spoke to leading Members about the state of Europe's financial sector. We asked what will be the impact of the crisis and what the EU should do about it.
After the $700 billion bailout in the US, Germany, Greece and Ireland moved quickly to guarantee the value of all the deposits in their banks and shore up confidence. Critics of this action have pointed out that such responses undermine a pan-European response. What should the EU do? The Chair of Parliament's Economics and Monetary Affairs Committee is French Socialist MEP Pervenche Berès : "There is real need for an EU initiative. We will face a lack of investment in the EU. The Parliament is the right place to discuss the EU proposal". Greek MEP Margaritis Schinas (EPP-ED) feels opinion is divided on the state of the economy: "We need new rules for the new economy. There is one school of thought that says this is the end of the free market, the end of capitalism. I don't agree. There is a second school of thought that says this is an opportunity to set up new rules for the new economy. The party is over, but not for the private economies". German Green MEP Heide Rühle feels a mere quick fix is not the answer: "A financial system bail-out is far from enough. We need structural policy changes, among which tighter financial regulation. So much risk is hidden in the market by complex financial systems that it becomes increasingly hard for national market supervisors to really assess the situation". Bulgarian Liberal MEP Mariela Velichkova Baeva said "we cannot expect that EU will influence the trend of economic events. When the decisions of business are so laden with social consequences, intervention is called for". How will it impact on us? Pervenche Berès said that "we see some EU economies entering recession. Ordinary citizens will certainly be affected by that regarding their purchasing power, their jobs, and so on". Margaritis Schinas (EPP-ED) believes the impact will be considerable as it "affects the global economic climate and the global economic psychology. Europeans have been used to the relative stability of the eurozone with its low interest rates, so all this comes as a surprise after 5 to 6 years of calm". Heide Rühle told us "the financial crisis will impede the fulfilment of the objectives of the Lisbon growth and jobs strategy, since this financial turmoil will hit the "real economy". Mariela Velichkova Baeva was worried that "when the outlook for the future is blurred by the circumstances we have, investment plans can drop dramatically - slowing - down consumer spending". Who is to blame for the current mess? Pervenche Berès told us that "the situation in Europe is coupled with the U.S. The measures taken so far only really tackle the problem of liquidity. The situation now goes beyond that to the financial markets and the real underlying economies". Margaritis Schinas is a firm believer that the position in America is worse than that of Europe. "In the States, for every dollar of real investment banks lend something like 32 dollars, whereas in Europe for one dollar of real deposit we lend 12", he told us. Heide Rühle boiled down the problem to one of "the emergence of innovative financial products, which boil down to variants of debt secured on real assets has played a key role in the contagion of the risk". Mariela Velichkova Baeva the cause is "the quest for profits; the lack of knowledge for the real state of the market and its potential to face a cataclysm".
