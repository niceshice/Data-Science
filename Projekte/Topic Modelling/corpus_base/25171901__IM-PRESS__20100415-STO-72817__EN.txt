Two MEPs lead the EU's monitoring of the first Sudanese multi-party general elections in nearly 25 years. The 6-MEP strong EP delegation met candidates, observers, officials and voters. Belgian Socialist MEP Veronique De Keyser led the overall 130-strong EU election observation mission and said "I hope these elections will turn a new page and bring a peaceful future to the Sudanese people. It is important that citizens can exercise their right to vote."
The Portuguese Socialist MEP Ana Gomes who headed the Parliament's team told us: "It is too early yet to make a final evaluation of the elections, but this can already be said: the political debate enabled by the elections is very welcome in this country. All parties, observers and voters, both in the North and the South, have emphasised how important it is that we are present here following the whole electoral procedure."
The elections have been much criticized, so a final assessment by the international community is very much awaited. The dates were originally set for 11-13 April but were extended to 15 April due to slow process.
A complicated election
The elections are taking place at all levels of government; Presidential, legislative and regional. There are 16 million registered voters with most people voting for the first time. The process is a complicated process. In North Sudan voters cast 8 ballots, in the South 12 ballots. Almost half of voters cannot read or write and there is a multitude of languages.
Several opposition parties pulled out of some of the elections saying that they will not be free and fair. There are also allegations of widespread meddling with the election process by incumbents (voter registration, access to media, funding for parties...).
The elections are a necessary step before a referendum vote on independence in South Sudan scheduled for January 2011. This was fixed in the peace agreement of 2005 following decades of civil war
MEPs met with local party representatives such as Sadiq al-Mahdi, Head of a major opposition party (UMMA), Fatima Abdel Mahmoud (SSDU), the first and only female presidential candidate. They also held talks with Salva Kiir, current President of South Sudan and Vice-President for the whole of Sudan.
Talks with Salih Mahmoud Osman
They also met Sudan specialists, election experts, civil society and other international observers.
During their visit they had a very warm meeting in Khartoum with the human rights lawyer and Sakharov Prize Winner from 2007 Salih Mahmoud Osman. He commented that "It is good, and we are grateful, that the EU has been here. It is better that you can watch and have the whole picture in front of you. Your role is very much respected even by the opposition groups."
Once polling started on Sunday, MEPs moved to the "field" visiting tens of polling stations. The Members monitored all aspects of voting: opening hours, availability of ballots, sealing of ballot boxes, treatment of domestic observers, possible complaints and the behavior of officials.
