MEPs adopted a report urging the Commission to launch an impact assessment on the added value and feasibility of a Community instrument on chain liability as a way of increasing transparency in subcontracting processes An alternative resolution put forward by the PES, ALDE and Greens/EFA replacing the committee report was adopted by MEPs with 321 votes in favour, 235 against and 11 abstentions.
The rise of subcontracting has had far-reaching consequences for labour relations and sometimes this makes it difficult clearly to determine the branch of law applicable to the relationships between the various elements of a production chain, according to the report.
The European Parliament welcomes the fact that eight Member States (Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain) have already responded in their national law to problems connected with the duties of subcontractors as employers. It urges other Member States to consider similar schemes. However, implementing the rules in cross-border subcontracting processes is especially difficult when Member States have different systems in place.
MEPs want the Commission to launch an impact assessment on the added value and feasibility of a Community instrument on chain liability as a way of increasing transparency in subcontracting processes. MEPs believe that the scope of liability in such an instrument should cover at least wages, social security contributions, taxes and damages in relation to work-related accidents.
Incentives
The House stresses the need to promote incentives for companies to make every reasonable effort in good faith to eliminate labour law infringements by subcontractors, such as systems of certification and codes of conduct, including reporting to the authorities and terminating a contract with a subcontractor which engages in illegal practice in order to avoid the possibility of being held jointly and severally liable for that infringement.
