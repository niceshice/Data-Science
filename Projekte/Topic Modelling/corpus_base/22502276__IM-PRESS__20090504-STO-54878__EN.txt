In German: In an interview Pöttering reflects on his presidency In a calm voice that perhaps belied his emotions, Hans-Gert Pöttering gave his farewell speech after two and a half years as Parliament's President on Wednesday. He noted that since the last elections the House had adapted to MEPs from 12 new countries, adopted scores of pieces of legislation and had undertaken internal reform. He also spoke of the support it had given to the Middle East peace process and cultural exchange. He finished by urging people to vote in the June elections.
On the admission of 12 new countries and their MEPs, he said the process had been "unquestionably a success." He said Parliament "has gained in experience, strength and also cultural richness."
Services, Reach chemicals package
In terms of measures passed by MEPs in the last 5 years he spoke of the Services directive, the REACH package on chemical labelling, the EU's funding from 2007-2013, steps to tackle climate change and Parliament's work on the Lisbon Treaty.
However, he said that action on banking and financial services and more to deal with the economic crisis were required.
Hails a stronger, reformed Parliament with international role
Mr Pöttering - who was first elected in 1979 and has been a life-long German Christian Democrat - said the Parliament is now a stronger EU institution with better cooperation with national parliaments and parliaments of countries outside the EU. He said it had also put itself at the centre of decision making by having a presence at summits.
Speaking about the new statute for MEPs and their assistants, which will from 2009 create a level playing field in MEPs' pay and reform expenses, he said that it had made "an important contribution to the regulation of our financing as Members and to transparency and openness".
He also noted that Parliament had successfully undertaken many internal reforms such as revamping plenary debates, reforming legislative procedures, improving work in committees and in the administration and new methods of communication such as Europarltv. He also welcomed prizes for youth, citizens and journalists.
Mr Pöttering recalled events to support Intercultural dialogue - dialogue with the Euro-Med Parliamentary Assembly and with young people as well as Arabic and African weeks held in Brussels.
On the Middle East peace process he said: "It is important that we have resolutely supported a two-State solution - Israel within secure borders and a Palestinian State within secure borders. We must not allow these principles to be called into question."
On coming elections : the campaign is the chance to "speak with citizens about why the EU is necessary. I should like to call upon all citizens to vote in the elections."
What the political group leaders said
Joseph Daul the leader of the Christian democrat EPP-ED group paid tribute to Mr Pöttering saying: "You have not simply been the citizens' spokesman; you have actually been the embodiment of the heart and the generosity and solidarity of Europe."
Socialist leader Martin Schulz , said Mr Pöttering "has given the European Parliament dignity." He applauded the president's action in raising his voice "against the scandal in Guantanamo at a time when it was not easy to do so."
Leader of the Liberal ALDE group Graham Watson told him that "our groups may not always agree but during your mandate you have proven an honest, fair and unifying figure."
For the Union of Europe for the Nations Cristiana Muscardini said, "under your presidency we have increased our ability to impact upon the future of Europe." Monica Frassoni for the Greens praised activities in the Middle East, the peace process, climate change and cultural events.
Francis Wurtz for the leftist GUE-NGL highlighted Mr Pöttering's ability to "manage the confrontation of ideas in a way that shows respect to all."
A less positive note came from Nigel Farage for the Independence and Democracy group, who criticised the fact that the EP has continued with constitution and Lisbon treaty despite its rejection in some countries.
