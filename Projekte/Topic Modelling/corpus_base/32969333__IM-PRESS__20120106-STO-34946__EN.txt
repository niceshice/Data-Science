Logo for EU Year of Active Ageing Europeans are living longer but are having fewer children and by 2060 there will be only two working adults for every person over 65, compared with four now. The 2012 European year of active ageing and solidarity between generations aims to raise awareness about the rapidly ageing EU population, promote an age-friendly environment and find new solutions to turn ageing into an opportunity.
Old age is often associated with illness, dependency and exclusion from employment, family and society, but with the number of over-60s rising by 2 million a year in the EU and an increasingly healthy older generation, the European year aims to change this mentality and help develop an active ageing culture.
"Active ageing can be successful only in a society built on solidarity and cooperation between generations," said German Christian Democrat Martin Kastler , who drafted a report on the year. "Maintaining vitality, respecting dignity, enhancing involvement in society as well as volunteering...and removing barriers between generations are the main aims of the European Year."
A raft of different activities are being organised from age-friendly sports clubs to projects bringing young children and seniors together. Click below to find out what events are being organised near you.
