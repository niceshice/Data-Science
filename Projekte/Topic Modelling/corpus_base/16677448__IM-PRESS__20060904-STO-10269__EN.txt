How to follow the European Parliament on the web The Parliament's website offers a number of ways to follow MEPs' speeches and debates live from its Plenary session in Strasbourg. As the legitimacy of Parliament is based on the values of accountability, accessibility and transparency - giving the public easy access to its proceedings using the latest technology is a priority.
MEPs meet 12 times a year in Strasbourg, the seat of the European Parliament, for monthly Plenary sessions over four days. They also meet for two day "mini-sessions" in Brussels. Other weeks of the year are devoted to meetings of Parliament's specialist Committees, political group meetings and constituency business.
How to follow what's on
On the tool bar at the top of this website there are five different areas - "News" - "Parliament" - "Your MEPs" - "Activities" and "EP Live".
To follow the Plenary sitting live, "News" "Activities" and "EP Live" are the most useful.
"News" - offers written reports for the general public and the press on debates, resolutions and votes in Parliament's Hemicycle chamber.
"Activities" - provides you with access to the full agenda of the Plenary sitting and background documents relating to the subjects that being discussed.
"EP Live" - lets you watch the whole sitting, as it happens, live in 22 languages from Strasbourg through your computer. You can listen to proposed pieces of EU legislation being debated as well as many other political issues. Just click on the link at the foot of this article.
"EuroparlTV" - the launch of the Parliament's online broadcasting service offers people full coverage of all the big issues of the day as well as interviews and features with some of the Parliament's leading personalities.
On the front page of the website the icon "Séance en Direct" provides a very detailed view of the plenary session. Speaking times, texts, amendments and votes are just three things to be found here.
And if you don't want to watch it live?
There is also a video replay service which records the sessions thus allowing you to watch them later at your own convenience.
Or, if you want a summary of the session? "EP Live" also features an audio summary of the whole four days in Strasbourg. There are also a host of other audio kits on a variety of subjects. There are also several short video films to watch on what is going on in the Parliament.
Finally, for all the EU Institutions there is the "EBS" (Europe By Satellite) TV service you can access online.
So, if it's happening in the Parliament you can find it here on the Parliament's website. "If it's on - it's online!"
