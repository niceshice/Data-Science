Briefing - 24-27 October 2005 (Strasbourg plenary session)
2005-10-20 - 13:43
At 3pm (Strasbourg time) on Wednesday 26 October, Prime Minister Tony BLAIR, President-in-office of the European Council , will open the debate on the informal summit of Heads of State or Government taking place the next day at Hampton Court. With the EU still officially in its "period of reflection" following the "no" votes on the Constitutional Treaty, as well as the lack of a deal on the financial perspective, MEPs are likely to have a lot to debate. The official purpose of the informal Council is " to discuss how to maintain and strengthen social justice and competitiveness in the context of globalisation; Europe's place in the world; and the security of citizens." This is the second time that Tony Blair has addressed the European Parliament this year; he launched the UK Presidency on 23 June in a speech to the House in Brussels.
Also on 26 October, before the Prime Minister is due to speak in plenary, from 12.45pm - 1.45pm Mr Blair will participate in an extraordinary meeting of the Conference of Presidents (Parliament's President and political group leaders). The meeting is closed.
Monday starts with a series of four first-reading reports on education, youth and media programmes. For the Erasmus programme, MEPs are calling for an increase in the monthly standard grant from €210 in 2007 to €300 in 2013. Monday evening is also dedicated to the environment, with a report on the shipment of waste, and two reports by Avril DOYLE (EPP-ED, IE) on fluorinated greenhouse gases and emissions from motor vehicle air conditioning services.
On Tuesday 25 October at 9am, Commission President BARROSO and Internal Market Commissioner Charlie McCREEVY will appear before the House in the context of apparent comments made by Mr McCreevy on the compatibility of the Swedish social model with the internal market. This follows the vote during the Brussels mini-plenary session to invite the two Commissioners to Parliament. Following this, there will be a debate on Avian flu based on oral questions to the Commission and the Council on the strategy against an influenza pandemic.
On Tuesday at midday, President Ricardo LAGOS of Chile will address the House in a formal sitting. Tuesday afternoon is dedicated to debating the progress made by Romania and Bulgaria towards accession scheduled for 1 January 2007. Just hours earlier, the Commission will have adopted its latest progress report on the two countries. Bill NEWTON DUNN (ALDE, UK) will lead the debate on his report into the fight against organised crime, with the Civil Liberties Committee calling for, inter-alia, a strengthening of Europol. On Tuesday evening, an own-initiative report by Ewa KLAMT (EPP-ED, DE) on economic migration is added to the agenda. The debate and vote on the Services Directive is postponed as the vote in the Internal Market Committee has been delayed. Finally, on Tuesday, MEPs will debate the issue of food additives when they consider a directive which includes a list of exceptions for traditional national products, such as Wiltshire cured ham.
Wednesday starts off with the first reading debate on the EU budget 2006, with the Budgets Committee calling for increased funding for research and youth programmes. On Wednesday (9pm), MEPs will debate the situation in Afghanistan following the elections on 18 September.
Thursday sees the annual debate on the activities (for 2004) of the European Ombudsman Nikiforos DIAMANDOUROS. The session will end with three debates and resolutions on human rights in Western Sahara, Uzbekistan and the case of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche.
Changes to the Agenda
The following changes to the agenda were approved by Parliament's Conference of Presidents on Thursday 20 October:
The Commission statement on Afghanistan originally scheduled for Monday 24 October will now take place on Wednesday evening with the vote taking place during the November sessions. The report by Johan VAN HECKE (ALDE, BE) on compulsory licensing for pharmaceutical products is postponed until the November session. The two reports by Avril DOYLE (EPP-ED, IE) on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases and emissions from motor vehicle air-conditioning systems originally scheduled for Wednesday will now also take place on Monday evening.
On Tuesday 25 October at 9am, Commission President BARROSO and Internal Market Commissioner Charlie McCREEVY will appear before the House in the context of apparent comments made by Mr McCreevy on the compatibility of the Swedish social model with the internal market (Vaxholm case) . This follows the vote during the Brussels mini-plenary session to invite the two Commissioners to Parliament.
Also, on Tuesday 25 October in the morning, there will be a debate on Avian Flu based on oral questions to the Commission and the Council on the strategy against an influenza pandemic. On Tuesday evening, an own-initiative report by Ewa KLAMT (EPP-ED, DE) on economic migration is added to the agenda. The debate and vote on the Services Directive is postponed as the vote in the Internal Market Committee has been delayed.. The report by Arlene McCARTHY (PES, UK) on the European payment order is postponed. The report by Mojca DRCAR MURKO (ALDE, SI) on food additives originally scheduled for Thursday morning will now take place on Tuesday evening.

Social policy
Barroso and McCreevy called to account over intervention in Sweden-Latvia labour dispute
2005-10-20 - 13:43
At the plenary session in Brussels on 12 October, MEPs voted to call Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Internal Market Commissioner Charlie McCreevy before the plenary to explain Mr McCreevy's comments on an ongoing dispute between a Latvian firm and Swedish trade unions - along with the Swedish government.
Mr McCreevy's apparent support for the Latvian company was seen by some as an attack on the whole Swedish approach of collective labour regulation by agreement between unions and employers. This led to a sharp reaction from Swedish industry minister Thomas Ostros - and to a call from the Socialist group for the two commissioners to come before Parliament. This was supported by the Greens/EFA and GUE/NGL groups and opposed by the ALDE and UEN groups. The EPP-ED's preference was for Mr McCreevy alone to explain his statements. In the end, MEPs voted by 189 votes in favour, 157 against with 10 abstentions to call both Commissioners to the plenary. They subsequently informed Parliament that they were unable to attend during the Brussels mini-session, but would instead come before the October II Strasbourg session. Debate : 9am, 25.10.2005

Education
Lifelong learning - Erasmus monthly grant should be increased
2005-10-20 - 13:43
For Erasmus, Leonardo, Comenius and other sub-programmes that make up the EU Lifelong learning programme for 2007-13, the committee follows the suggestions of rapporteur Doris PACK (EPP-ED, DE), who describes the European Commission proposal as "well-designed" while nevertheless calling for more money to cover proposed improvements.
To increase student mobility grants, secondary school mobility, school exchanges and cross-border teacher mobility, the committee backed Ms Pack's call for an additional €980 million for the whole package over and above the multi-annual budget of €13.62 billion proposed by the Commission.
For the Erasmus sub-programme, which promotes student mobility, the committee is proposing to increase the monthly standard grant from €210 in 2007 to €300 in 2013, topping the Commission's figures of €200 and €250. Ms Pack called it " particularly worrying " that this, the most popular European grant, has remained at €150 per month since 1993 despite rising costs for students living abroad.
The committee also agrees with its rapporteur's proposal to cut back slightly the share of the budget for the Leonardo da Vinci sub-programme, which supports vocational training. Ms Pack regards the Commission target of 150,000 trainee placements in 2013 as " over-ambitious " and stressed the much higher monthly costs of a Leonardo placement (€3,644) compared to Erasmus (€1,775).
The committee also wants to increase the participation of pupils and teachers in the Comenius sub-programme, which is designed for schools, and to create a new programme (Comenius-Regio) within Comenius to promote cross-border teacher mobility, especially between adjacent regions. Other amendments focus on simplifying application and grant award procedures, the teaching and learning of official, regional and minority languages as well as two foreign languages, higher grants for disabled participants and support for sign languages and Braille.

Culture
Culture 2007 - call to increase budget
2005-10-20 - 13:43
Turning to the Culture 2007 programme, the committee supports the proposal by rapporteur Vasco GRAÇA MOURA (EPP-ED, PT) that EU funding should be increased from the figure of €236.5 million for the period 2000-2006 to €600 million for 2007-13. The Commission had suggested €408 million. And while the Commission's figure assumes 8% would be used for administration the Culture Committee wants this cut down to 6%.
Alongside the objectives set out by the Commission (trans-national mobility of cultural players, trans-national circulation of art and intercultural dialogue), MEPs in the committee emphasise the importance of support for " cultural heritage of European significance ".
The committee wants to move the funding for " sites of memory " from Culture 2007 to the forthcoming Citizens for Europe programme. " The memory of the victims of Nazi and Stalinist totalitarian regimes should be kept alive as well as preservation of relevant historical sites, museums and archives ", says the committee.
Other proposed amendments focus on simplifying the selection criteria and rules governing grants so as to foster participation by smaller and medium-sized projects. For instance, each multi-annual cooperation network eligible for funding should consist of at least six operators from four countries (instead of six as the Commission proposed) participating in the programme. And for shorter projects three operators from three countries are enough, say MEPs in the committee. Lastly, the committee proposes that the name of the programme be changed from Culture 2007 to Culture.

Culture
Media 2007
2005-10-20 - 13:43
The Media 2007 programme seeks to support the fragmented and under-capitalised European film industry. Its aims include preserving and enhancing Europe's cultural diversity and its cinematographic heritage, better distribution of European films both within and outside the EU and boosting the competitiveness of Europe's film industry. Rapporteur Ruth HIERONYMI (EPP-ED, DE) points out that American movies account for 71% of the film market in Europe.
The committee first stresses that the budget of €1.055 billion for 2007-2013 proposed by the Commission is the minimum necessary to achieve the programme's goals. Amendments are proposed to streamline grant award procedures and facilitate access to loans for SMEs in the film industry, notably for independent productions. MEPs in the committee deplore the " almost complete lack of companies specialising in providing loan financing in the audiovisual sector ".
" In a Europe of 25 Member States cooperation is increasingly becoming a strategic response to strengthen the competitiveness of the European film industry ", says the Culture Committee, pointing to the increasing importance of co-productions and cross-border projects.
The committee also describes digitisation as " a decisive contribution to strengthening the audiovisual sector " and "a central feature of Media 2007 ". Lastly, MEPs in the committee want to see innovative distribution platforms, more European film festivals and the establishment of a Pier Paolo Pasolini mobility scholarship for young filmmakers.

Youth
Youth in Action - increase in budget
2005-10-20 - 13:43
Another programme MEPs in the Culture Committee are keen to support is Youth in Action, designed to promote active citizenship and mutual understanding among young people across Europe. Instead of the €915 million budget proposed by the Commission, the Culture Committee is proposing the figure of €1.128 billion suggested by rapporteur Lissy GRÖNER (PES, DE) on the basis of Parliament's position on the Financial Perspective for 2007-13.
MEPs in the committee back the rapporteur's repeated calls for young people with disabilities to be included on equal terms " so as to prevent any form of discrimination ". In view of the success of European Youth Week, the committee says this event should become an established part of EU youth policy.
Ms Gröner welcomes the overall thrust of the Commission proposal, saying " It is likely to deliver substantial European added value " and describing the new programme as " significantly simplified and more flexible ".

EU budget 2006 - call for more money for research and youth programmes
2005-10-20 - 13:43
Parliament's ambitions for the EU will be translated into figures as the Plenary votes at first reading to restore much of the 2006 budget cut by the Council. Areas set to benefit include research, education and youth programmes, which were reduced by the Council in July, as well as external policy.
The general rapporteur on the budget, Gianni PITTELLA (PES, IT) believes the Budgets Committee had done its duty to the public. " We have upped the funding for policies related to the Lisbon strategy, with the emphasis on research and education. This reflects the public's wishes as we think that these headings, which were cut by the Council, should receive more generous funding ". With this vote in the Budgets Committee, he went on to say, " we have sent a firm signal to the Council about the policies for which extra funding must be found at the conciliation in November if we are to wind up the 2006 budget procedure successfully and coherently ".
Heading 1: agriculture and rural development
The Budgets Committee is proposing a ground-breaking budgetary amendment which aims to scrap the one billion euro subsidy for tobacco growers; a part of the money saved should be used for EU anti-smoking campaigns. Council has the last say on this as well as the rest of most of Heading 1 though, as they are regarded as " compulsory expenditure ". Otherwise MEPs in the committee welcome the " modulation " transfer of 650m to the rural development sub-heading, which continues the process of reforming the Common Agricultural Policy.
Heading 2: structural actions
The Budgets Committee is keen to raise payments for structural measures (the financial basis of regional policy). This increase partly takes account of the forecasts of the Member States who have already announced that the funding levels proposed for 2006 will be inadequate. This proposed increase amounts to €3.7bn roughly and covers all the main structural instruments (namely Objectives 1, 2 and 3, the Cohesion Fund and Leader).
Heading 3: internal policies
MEPs in the committee want to add no less than €200 million in payment appropriations to a range of budget headings for the Lisbon strategy which the Council reduced at first reading. The main areas which would boost EU competitiveness include increases for programmes to support small and medium-sized companies, but above all for the 6th framework research programme. The payments for education programmes are also increased, by €35 million for Socrates, €20 million for Leonardo da Vinci and €3 million for e-learning.
Another key feature of the vote is the funding allocated to the European Commission's information policy. MEPs in the committee voted for more resources for the debate on the future of Europe, public information via the media and the euro. They tied this funding to one condition: the Commission must first publish its White Paper on information and communication policy. Parliament also wants an explanation for the Commission's under-spending of its information budget in 2005.
Heading 4: EU external policy
A heading which causes problems year after year is " external action " (support for projects outside the EU's borders). Here the Budgets Committee wants to exceed the available funding ceiling, partly to boost its traditional priorities such as regional programmes and promoting human rights around the world.
To finance more recent priorities - such as the reconstruction of Iraq (€200 million for 2006) and tsunami-hit regions (€180 million) plus expenditure linked to the EU's international commitments - the committee proposes exploring all "options available" under the inter-institutional agreement linked to the financial perspective. Any agreement on extra expenditure must be reached at the negotiations with the Council ahead of the second reading of the 2006 budget.
As for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the committee proposes to deny Council its proposed increase for two special envoys; the committee feels that Parliament should be consulted for CFSP expenditure coming from the EU budget, on the basis of an agreement struck in 2002 with Council to exchange information in this area.
Other headings
For Heading 5, the Budgets Committee is keen to re-establish the 46 posts requested by the Commission which had been cut by the Council in July but attached conditions to its support. As for the pre-accession strategy, MEPs in the committee suggest no changes in the funding for Turkey (€470 million in commitments, €155 in payments).

EU Institutions Budget 2006
2005-10-20 - 13:43
With its report on the budgets of the "other institutions" (all of them except the Commission), the Budgets Committee mostly focuses on Parliament and its targets for the coming year. 20% of the European institutions' administrative resources are dedicated to the European Parliament. With an estimated maximum of €1,341 million at its disposal, the Parliament decided to further limit its spending with a proposed cut of €20m to €1,321m.
As 2006 marks a pause in Parliament's successful buildings policy (i.e. the early repayment of interests taken on its purchases of buildings), MEPs in the committee look for ways to use the available appropriations to fulfil the needs of the institution.
€20 million will be put in an " information and communication reserve ". This amount is available for new projects currently examined by Parliament, MEPs regard improving communication between the EP and the citizens as a priority. Finally, the committee wants, in addition to the amount of €13,8 million entered in its estimates, to make available further appropriations totalling €9,726 million in connection with preparations for Romanian and Bulgarian accession Rapporteur Valdis Dombrovskis EPP-ED LV A6-/2005 Report on draft general budget of the European Union for the 2006 financial year Procedure : Budgetary

Greater EU participation in transport and energy network projects
2005-10-20 - 13:43
MEPs are to debate the Commission's plans to speed up progress on key Trans European Network (TENs) projects in energy and transport. A first reading co-decision report from Mario MAURO (EPP-ED, IT) for the Budgets Committee supports the idea of raising the ceiling for the proportion on EU funding for key cross-border sections of transport networks to 50 per cent from the current 20 per cent limit.
MEPs in the committee want to apply this upper limit to projects aiming to overcome " natural obstacles ." Other projects would be eligible for up to 30 per cent EU funding. As far as energy projects are concerned, there would now be EU funding available for up to 20 per cent of the cost - previously only studies could be co-financed from the EU budget.
The committee is also proposing changes to the way in which the programme and its priorities would be set up, ensuring that Parliament is not excluded from decision making by excessive use of the "comitology" procedure, whereby the Commission implements EU laws with the help of committees of Member State officials but without participation of MEPs.
Finally, MEPs disagree with the Commission on excluding projects already receiving EU funding from another source, such as the Structural Funds.
As a reminder, the financial framework for TENs depends on the outcome of the negotiations on the next Financial Perspective. Parliament, in its June 2005 resolution, estimated that the total amount for 2007-13 should be set at €20.490bn with €140m earmarked for Energy TENs.

Cross-border shipments of waste under surveillance
2005-10-20 - 13:43
Europe's prosperity has a downside: the amount of waste that sometimes fills its dustbins to overflowing. Despite efforts made over the years to cut waste generation at source, rubbish continues to pile up. There is now a large crossborder trade in waste - not to speak of illegal trafficking - and controls are often light or non-existent. MEPs will debate a report into new legislation designed to deal with this problem.
The committee's recommendation for second reading is drafted by Johannes BLOKLAND (IND/DEM, NL) for the Environment Committee. This legislation is in fact not particularly new. It is intended to replace an EU regulation of 1993 which has proved ineffective. Since that date the European market in waste has grown and flourished. Hence the need for the new regulation, to clarify the rules and procedures and also incorporate more recent standards issued by the OECD in 2001 and the Basle Convention as amended in 1998.
What should be allowed and what banned? On three key points, the committee did not back Mr Blokland's suggestions. Hoping to reduce movements of waste, he said that waste transfers should not be authorised if the waste can be processed in the country which produces it. He also believed that authorisation to export waste for purposes of recovery should be granted only if the recovery will be "final" (as opposed to " interim "), the aim being to prevent a build-up of stocks of hazardous substances or shipments of waste for " sham recovery ". Lastly, Mr Blokland argued that animal by-products should be covered by the regulation. But on all three points, MEPs in the committee who prefer to allow the free movement of waste within the EU in line with the rules of the single market won the day, thus agreeing with the Council's common position.
Hunting down the ghost ships
However, the Environment Committee takes a tougher line than the Council on a number of points. It says ships and aircraft should be included in the list of potentially dangerous waste and it wants a ban on exporting ships due for scrapping to non-EU countries, unless they are completely stripped of all dangerous substances. MEPs in the committee want to tighten up the rules requiring Member States to inspect waste cargoes and provide information to the public. They also propose amending the Council's text so as to discourage exports of household rubbish.
Criticism of the Commission
Although MEPs in the committee were divided in their votes, during the debate in committee they voiced unanimous surprise at the stance of the European Commission, which unilaterally published a list of legislation it plans to drop or - as in the case of the regulation on waste - on which it says further impact studies are needed. The Commission representative at the committee's meeting simply referred MEPs to the note published by his institution, even though this contains no specific discussion of the issue of waste. It was left to Mr Blokland to explain that, as far as he knew, the assessments would be internal and additional, and would not challenge the legislation already in the pipeline. All these issues are sure to emerge again during the plenary debate.

Environment
Ban on fluorinated gases in fridges and cars
2005-10-20 - 13:43
MEPs in the Environment Committee want to see a crackdown on fluorinated greenhouse gases. This is the significance of two reports, one on a general regulation on fluorinated gases and the other on car air conditioning systems. The two reports were drafted by Avril DOYLE (EPP-ED, IE).
We now know that fluorinated gases can have a far more harmful and lasting impact on the atmosphere even than carbon dioxide. The global warming potential (GWP) of some fluorinated gases, can be several thousand times greater than that of CO2 (where CO2 has a GWP of 1, HFC-152a has a GWP of 120, etc., with sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) reaching a peak GWP of 22,200). It is estimated that some fluorinated gases could remain in the atmosphere for up to 50,000 years. Signatories to the Kyoto Protocol have undertaken to cut back these gases. It is against this background that the two draft EU laws examined must be considered (co-decision, second reading).
A speedier timetable
In their recommendation on the general regulation, MEPs in the committee seek to tighten up the substitution principle. They say " fluorinated greenhouse gases shall only be used where other safe, technically feasible and environmentally acceptable alternatives do not exist ". They urge the EU Member States to promote alternatives through fiscal and other measures. They call for products with a GWP of less than 50 to be used for phones, refrigeration products and equipments and air conditioning products other than those contained in motor vehicles (the latter being dealt with in the accompanying directive).
The regulation also gives a list of fluorinated gases whose sale should be banned in accordance with a detailed timetable. MEPs in the committee wish to add to this, on dates which would be binding, a ban on hydrofluorocarbons in certain aerosols (in 2006), in certain types of foam (in 2009), in domestic refrigeration systems with less than 150g of refrigerant charge (four years after the entry into force of the regulation), and in stationary air conditioning and commercial and industrial refrigeration systems (2010). SF6 should be banned from any form of use by 2008.
The other amendments proposed by the Environment Committee are chiefly aimed at tightening up the requirements regarding professional training and the certification of companies which handle these gases. They include provisions to protect against the risk of fire and tighten up the labelling requirements for apparatus containing fluorinated gases. Lastly, MEPs in the committee call on the European Commission to propose further legislation on air conditioning systems (other than those in motor vehicles) by the end of 2008.
Cleaner cars from 2011
Turning to the directive on car air conditioning systems, MEPs in the committee recommend approving the Council's common position with two minor amendments. . There is thus no further obstacle to the aims of this directive: the elimination of fluorinated gases with a GWP (Global Warming Potential) greater than 150 in new models from 2011 and in all types of vehicle from 2017. Rapporteur Avril Doyle EPP-ED IE 6-0301/2005 Report on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases A6-0294/2005 Report on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to emissions from air conditioning systems in motor vehicles and amending Council Directive 70/156/EEC Procedure : Codecision (2nd reading)

Food safety
Food additives and sweeteners under review
2005-10-20 - 13:43
MEPs are to debate a move to update the rules on food additives and sweeteners in the light of scientific and technical developments. They will be considering a first reading co-decision report from Mojca DRČAR MURKO (ALDE, SI) which deals with interim updates to two directives in this area, pending a general revision of the legislation which the Commission has promised to undertake.
The changes deal mainly with the authorisation of new substances and changes to the positive list of approved additives, based on scientific advice from the European Food Safety Agency. An example is the level of nitrates and nitrites in hams, bacon and cheeses. The directive would include a list of exceptions for traditional national products, such as Wiltshire cured ham. The rapporteur has been involved in informal negotiations with the Council and Commission on the directive, with the aim being to complete the legislative process at this, first reading, stage. This has led to a number of compromise proposals, which, among other things, considerably lengthen the list of such national exceptions.
A few substances are to be banned altogether in some products, such as jelly mini-cups, which had already been suspended because they were judged a choking hazard. On the other hand, the rapporteur is proposing a new additive, pullulan, a polysaccharide which has been approved by the EFSA, should be added to the positive list. Rapporteur Mojca Drčar Murko ALDE SI Procedure : Codecision (1st reading)
Debate : 25.10.2005 Report on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 95/2/EC on food additives other than colours and sweeteners and Directive 94/35/EC on sweeteners for use in foodstuffs

External relations
Improving the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership
2005-10-20 - 13:43
The Euro-Mediterranean Partnership for closer cooperation between the EU and the countries around the Mediterranean basin has not brought the results which were expected at its launch ten years ago, says the Foreign Affairs Committee in an own-initiative report by Anneli Jäätteenmäki (ALDE, FI) which is now to be debated by Parliament as a whole. The report does say, however, that the partnership remains the appropriate framework for the EU's policy towards the Mediterranean region.
MEPs in the committee are concerned that the partnership has not helped solve conflicts in the Mediterranean region. They also note that " no substantial progress has been achieved in the field of democracy and human rights " and that more progress needs to be made in reducing poverty and bridging the North-South gap. MEPs stress that " political will and a pragmatic vision " are needed more than ever - but the budget should be on a par with the ambitions. Of crucial importance is greater participation of all Mediterranean partner countries in the decision-making process.
A main priority, says the report, is the development of education and vocational training, with specific attention to women and underprivileged groups such as illiterate populations, female students and populations in rural and suburban areas. In order to increase prosperity, the European Investment Bank Facility for Euro-Mediterranean investments should be further developed, with an emphasis on micro-credit facilities. Cooperation should be encouraged in the fight against organised crime and terrorism, while ensuring the respect for human rights. The EU and its Mediterranean partners should also increase their cooperation in the management of migration flows, while maintaining the principle of "non-refoulement" as laid down in the Geneva Convention and addressing root causes as well as negative effects of illegal immigration. On the issue of human rights, the Foreign Affairs Committee said that the clauses suspending Euromed Association Agreements should be invoked in the case of violations of human rights and democratic freedoms.
The EU partner countries in Euromed are Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, Syria, Tunisia and Turkey.

The fight against organised crime - strengthen Europol?
2005-10-20 - 13:43
The Civil Liberties Committee calls on Member States to ensure that Europol’s role as a criminal intelligence body is strengthened to allow it to fulfil its task of providing Member States with information and intelligence leading to more effective results in preventing and combating organised crime. Bill Newton Dunn (ALDE, GB), on behalf of the Committee, will be tabling a non-binding report on the fight against organised crime.
The committee also wants each Member State to establish a Serious and Organised Crime Unit and an Asset Recovery Unit, to ensure coordination at national level and to act as a single contact point and to be based on recent and successful introduction of such units in the UK and Ireland.
MEPs in the committee call on the Member States to collect statistics on relevant offences and forward those statistics to the Commission, which should draw up harmonised and comparable statistics as from 2006. Each Member State should, says the committee, adopt the necessary measures to ensure that persons who supply information useful for the prevention, uncovering and/or punishment of crimes committed by criminal organisations, whether they are witnesses or perpetrators of crimes, are adequately protected against the risks of retaliation, threats or direct intimidation targeting themselves or their relatives.
The EU has taken a lead in the fight against organised crime since the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Amsterdam European Council of 16 and 17 June 1997, which adopted the first action plan to combat organised crime. In 1998, the Council adopted a Joint Action on participation in a criminal organisation. However, it is now seen as necessary to provide the Union with a more powerful and ambitious instrument to approximate more closely Member States' criminal legislation and improve cooperation in order to combat organised crime more effectively, inter alia by harmonizing the minimum thresholds of criminal penalties.
This particular proposal for a Council Framework Decision aims at harmonising the definition of what constitutes a criminal organisation. Such an organisation is understood to be a structured association of at least two persons who, for material gain, commit serious crimes punishable with at least four years of imprisonment, such as trafficking in weapons, drugs or human beings, economic crimes or money laundering.
It also proposes to punish leaders of such organisations with an imprisonment of at least ten years and participation, including supportive activities for the organisation, with five years of imprisonment. The proposal also envisages lowering of the sentence of those members of criminal organisation who cooperate with the authorities with a view to avoiding criminal activities to assist in identifying and bringing to justice other offenders. The proposal also stipulates that Member States must cooperate and consult each other to coordinate their action and decide which Member State will prosecute the alleged offenders.

Immigration
An EU approach to economic immigration?
2005-10-20 - 13:43
Immigrants contribute to the prosperity of Member States, they have a beneficial effect on the EU labour market and they should be granted similar rights to EU citizens, according to an own-initiative report from the Civil Liberties Committee aimed at defining for the first time an EU strategy on economic migration.
At committee stage consensus could not be found and the original text by Ewa Klamt (EPP-ED, DE) was heavily amended in an effort to place more emphasis on the integration of legal immigrants. The report as adopted by the Committee differed so much from her draft that her group voted against, so a renewed and vigorous debate on the substance of the report can be expected as it now goes to the full Parliament for a final decision.
Should the EU adopt a Green Card system to regulate the flow of immigrants from outside Europe? Would this help to solve the economic problems caused by Europe's ageing population? Answering these and other questions was the purpose of Ms Klamt's report, which was drafted in response to a Commission green paper on economic migration. In its report as adopted, the committee highlighted " the need to adopt a common immigration policy in order to end the exploitation of (illegal) workers " and said that " economic migration is a positive human phenomenon ". Yet MEPs emphasised that this was only " part of the solution " to Europe's demographic problems and economic difficulties. Problems within the EU labour market should also be tackled by stimulating innovation and encouraging the employment of older workers.
Integration of migrants
MEPs in the committee called on Member States to promote the integration of economic migrants residing legally in Europe by granting them the same rights as EU citizens, including the right to vote in local and European Parliament elections for those who have been resident in the EU for at least five years.
In a controversial amendment supported by Socialist, Liberal and Green members, the Civil Liberties Committee voted for a European Green Card system as being a good solution to manage legal economic migration. This would create a single administrative procedure for issuing an employment and residence permit for an economic migrant. However, the admission of a third country national for economic reasons should in principle be linked to the existence of a specific job, the committee added.
Unable to reach a consensus, MEPs in the committee decided not to comment on the Commission's suggestion that priority be given to citizens from all Member States before looking for non-EU nationals to fill any job vacancy (the principle of "Community preference"). Rapporteur Ewa Klamt had backed this idea in her draft report. The paragraph in her report stipulating that economic migration measures should not be used until EU citizens from new Member States are guaranteed the right to freedom of movement was deleted from the final text.
Security issues
Any common policy to manage legal migration in Europe is inevitably linked to security issues and to the need to effectively fight illegal immigration. All members of the committee agreed that it must be up to each Member State to decide how many immigrants it can accept on its territory and on what conditions. However, the system chosen to manage legal and illegal migration in an EU country has a clear effect on other Member States. In that connection, MEPs in the committee pointed out that the mass regularisation of illegal immigrants carried out by countries such as Spain " is no substitute for substantial policies for dealing with illegal immigration or an effective means of recruiting economic migrants ".
On the question of the return of illegal immigrants, the committee called for clauses on compulsory readmission to be included in all association and cooperation agreements signed with non-EU countries. It also urged the Commission " to define a return policy, based on the promotion of voluntary return, including possibly supportive measures in the country of origin ".
The Commission's Green Paper could pave the way for legislative proposals on legal migration measures. The Parliament has only a consultative role in this field, which is regarded as sensitive for national sovereignty. The Council would need unanimity to adopt any specific rule in this legislative area. So far each Member State has had its own national policy on legal migration and the integration of migrants.

Ombudsman
MEPs call for common code of good administrative behaviour for all EU institutions
2005-10-20 - 13:43
Through the European Ombudsman, EU citizens can obtain redress for cases of maladministration by Community institutions and bodies. The Ombudsman is elected by the European Parliament in a procedure in which the Petitions Committee plays a central role. The Petitions Committee is recommending that Parliament's plenary approve the European Ombudsman's report on his activities in 2004. In a draft resolution by Manolis MAVROMMATIS (EPP-ED, EL), MEPs in the committee also call on the EU institutions to adopt a harmonised code of good administrative behaviour.
This draft resolution welcomes the efforts to give the Ombudsman's work a higher media profile, believing this could help reduce the number of complaints received which fall outside his remit. In 2004, almost 75% of complaints lodged fell outside the Ombudsman's remit as they did not concern a Community institution or body. The current Ombudsman, Nikiforos DIAMANDOUROS, is thus urged to continue his efforts to raise public awareness of his functions and responsibilities.
This year, which marks the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the Ombudsman's office, 3726 complaints were received. This represents a sharp increase on the previous year (+53%), half of the extra cases being accounted for by complaints from citizens of the ten new Member States. The cases of maladministration meriting investigation by the Ombudsman can be categorised as follows: lack of transparency or refusal to provide information (22%), discrimination (19%), avoidable delays (12%), procedural errors (9%), injustice or abuse of power (7%), failure to fulfil obligations (7%), negligence (6%) and errors in law (5%).
The Petitions Committee wants all the EU institutions to interpret as broadly as possible the provisions of Regulation No 1049/2001 governing public access to documents. It also approves of the efforts by the Ombudsman to persuade the institutions to meet shorter deadlines for dealing with this type of complaint.
A common code of conduct for all European institutions
MEPs in the committee particularly support the Ombudsman's efforts to provide all Community institutions and bodies with a harmonised "code of good administrative behaviour" and urge the Commission to end the current situation.
In addition, the Petitions Committee calls on the Ombudsman to define more precisely the concept of " maladministration ", drawing up a strict and exhaustive list of institutions and bodies covered and categorically excluding all complaints which fall under the responsibility of the Member States’ authorities.
The resolution also backs a review of the Ombudsman's statute and the extension and strengthening of the system of non-judicial appeal which it says " provides citizens with an alternative to legal action whose decisions and recommendations are not legally binding and do not constitute coercive measures ". The Ombudsman is also called on to seek amicable solutions wherever possible in the cases he deals with.
Finally, MEPs in the committee commend the good working relationship developed between the Ombudsman's Office and the Petitions Committee, including the process for the mutual transfer of cases, and they stress that they value the close cooperation established by the European Ombudsman with his national, regional and local counterparts, although they would like to see greater cooperation with the petitions committees of the national parliaments.
Analysis of complaints examined in 2004
The statistics for the year 2004 show that the institution has already reached maturity: 3726 complaints were received in 2004 (an increase of 53% over 2003), of which 3536 were from individual citizens and 190 from companies and associations. The sharp rise in the number of complaints is not just a result of enlargement: 657 complaints came from the new Member States, equivalent to 51% of the rate of increase for 2004, while the remaining 49% were accounted for by complaints from the 15 old Member States and from third countries.
The most numerous complaints came from citizens of the following countries: 482 from Spain (12.9%), 464 from Germany (12.4%), 303 from France (8.1%), 285 from Poland (7.6%), 269 from Italy (7.2%), 268 from Belgium (7.2%) and 195 from the United Kingdom (5.2%). In terms of the EU’s population, however, the geographical distribution of complaints is slightly different: Germany (18%), France (13.5%), United Kingdom (13%), Italy (12.6%), Spain (9.2%), Poland (8.3%) and the Netherlands (3.5%).

External/international trade
MEPs set to back moves to simplify exports of generic drugs to poorer countries
2005-10-20 - 13:43
The European Union must do everything it can to enable the world's poorest people to have access to medicines. This is the main thrust of a report by Johan VAN HECKE (ALDE, BE) for the International Trade Committee on a draft regulation on compulsory licensing for the export of generic medicines to developing countries. This is now due to be debated by the plenary.
What problem is this legislation trying to tackle? Under the World Trade Organisation's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), countries with major public health problems can issue "compulsory licences" for the manufacture of patent-protected drugs. But most developing countries do not have a pharmaceuticals industry to produce the generic drugs. On 14 November 2001, a declaration was adopted at Doha, during the WTO ministerial conference, to make the application of TRIPS more flexible not only for developing countries without the manufacturing capability but also for exporting countries. A decision of the WTO General Council of 30 August 2003 lays down the conditions under which countries without manufacturing capabilities can import generics that are still patent-protected. It also allows manufacturing countries to export drugs under a compulsory licence even where these drugs are patent-protected on their territory.
The European Commission's draft regulation is intended to transpose the decision of 30 August 2003 into Community law. It lays down conditions for the granting of compulsory licences for the manufacture in Europe of generic drugs intended for export to developing countries. The text is based on a multilateral decision, so the EU institutions have only limited freedom for manoeuvre as it was not easy to agree a compromise within the WTO and, in Mr Van Hecke's words, " we must not open a Pandora's box ". Nevertheless MEPs adopted amendments to the Commission's proposal to bring it more into line with the development goals it is seeking to achieve.
MEPs propose final touches to the legislation
The EP Trade Committee firstly wants to broaden the scope of the regulation so that all developing countries can benefit from exports under compulsory licences. Under the Commission proposal, only WTO members can apply. MEPs believe the WTO decision does not exclude a widening of the regulation's scope and they cite examples of similar legislation adopted in Norway, Canada and the Netherlands.
To be effective, the machinery for issuing licences must not be too complicated or cumbersome. MEPs in the committee therefore wish to simplify the legislation as much as possible. The Commission lays down numerous administrative requirements to ensure that compulsory licences are not misused. The Trade Committee thinks these are unnecessary as they are not stipulated in the WTO decision and would simply deter potential applicants from using the system. It also wants to tighten up some provisions of the regulation. Before applying for a compulsory licence, an applicant must ask the patent holder to sell him the products at a reasonable price. MEPs in the committee say the patent holder should have 30 days to reply and not " a reasonable period of time ", as proposed by the Commission. Once this period has elapsed, the compulsory licence application should be granted. This waiting period would not apply in the event of " situations of national emergency....or cases of public non-commercial use ".
However, the licence holder must pay " adequate remuneration " to the patent holder. Trade committee MEPs insist that " humanitarian and non-commercial reasons underlying the issue of the licence " must be taken into account. To remove any uncertainty as to the amount of the remuneration, the Trade Committee calls on the Commission to lay down guidelines.
It is often NGOs and United Nations bodies in the field that distribute the drugs. The committee therefore wants to add them to the list of those who can request imports of pharmaceutical products, on the same footing as representatives of the countries concerned.
The Trade Committee wants it to be possible for the regulation to be brought into line with changes to TRIPS that are already in the pipeline or for it to be changed to take account of failings in its application. It thus proposes that the Commission present a report every three years to Parliament and the Council on the application of the regulation.
Note: discussions with the Commission and Council aimed at agreeing a compromise which would see the legislation adopted at this first reading stage are continuing. This could lead either to last-minute changes being proposed at the plenary session, or to the item being postponed to a later session if more time is needed to reach an agreement between the institutions.
