This is one of the Halogen bulbs set to be more popular in the future 75 W follows 100 W bulb into oblivion Energy efficiency behind change The humble light bulb is undergoing a quiet revolution. Last year 100 W bulbs were phased out whilst from tomorrow (1 September) will see the end of 75 W bulb. Sales will continue until stocks run out and new alternatives will be on the shelves. The motive behind the change is the energy inefficiency of the old bulbs (which generate a great deal of heat) compared to newer models. In addition newer bulbs can save money as they can last 6 to 10 times longer than the old ones.
This time next year sees the end of the 60 W bulbs whilst the year after the 40 and 25 W bulbs will also cease to be sold. In their place come LEDs (light emitting diodes), compact fluorescent bulbs and improved incandescent bulbs or halogen bulbs. Their improvement is mainly in the fact that incandescent light bulb converts only 5 % of energy it uses into light.
The Parliament's cross party Environment Committee has always supported the move towards more efficient bulbs and it decided not to use its powers under EU rules to block the phasing out of the older bulbs.
Supporters of the move claim that by ditching the older bulbs the European Union could save as much electricity per year as the total amount needed to power Romania. The estimated saving in CO2 emissions per year is around 15 million tonnes.
