Plenary Session - Strasbourg
Current economic crisis/Eurobonds. MEPs will take stock of the current economic crisis ahead of the 1 and 2 March EU summit. They will also vote a resolution on Eurobonds, which says these could become a source of stability for the Eurozone in the medium term, but other instruments are needed to meet short-term needs (Wednesday).
Mario Monti. Economic developments in Italy and Europe will be debated with Italy's Prime Minister Mario Monti. A press conference by President Schulz and Mr Monti is scheduled for 16.30 (Wednesday).
Jobs for young people. MEPs will quiz the Commission on its plan to use up to €82 billion in unallocated EU structural funds to help small firms and combat youth unemployment (Monday).
Food for the needy. Parliament is set to save the food aid programme for needy EU citizens. If MEPs endorse a compromise reached with the Council, the programme will continue until the end of 2013, with an annual budget ceiling of €500 million (debate Tuesday, vote Wednesday).
Homeless people. As more than 3 million people in the EU are homeless and suffer out in the cold, MEPs will press the European Commission to act on their September 2011 request for a strategy for the homeless (Monday).
Syria. Parliament will debate the deteriorating security and human rights situation in Syria with Denmark's Foreign Minister Villy Søvndal. A resolution will also be put to the vote (debate Wednesday, vote Thursday).
Russia. Parliament will take a stand on the situation in Russia, in a resolution focusing on the December 2011 legislative elections, the recent demonstrations and upcoming presidential elections in March (Thursday).
Hungary. MEPs will vote on a resolution on recent political developments in Hungary, further to a heated plenary discussion with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán on 18 January (Thursday).
Presidents' Diary. On Wednesday, President Schulz will meet France's Foreign Affairs Minister Alain Juppé and on Thursday Vassilios Skouris, President of the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
