HQ of the European Commission in Brussels This afternoon you can watch live the parliamentary hearings of three new Commissioners designate. They are: Karel de Gucht, proposed for Development and Humanitarian Aid; Algirdas Šemeta for Financial Programming and Budget, and Paweł Samecki for Regional Policy. All need the EP's approval and face questions from MEPs on their suitability for their new jobs.
The appointments are needed to replace three outgoing members of the current Commission: two elected as MEPs and one elected President of Lithuania.
Karel de Gucht, Algirdas Šemeta and Paweł Samecki were nominated by their national capitals as European Commissioners for the remaining months of the mandate of the current Commission, prior to an all-new Commission being appointed later in the year for a new five-year term.
If one or all of the candidates is deemed not to pass muster then MEPs can refuse to vote for them to be officially appointed when a vote of all 736 Members of the European Parliament is held on 16 September.
The three Commissioners designate will reply to questions relating to their personal qualifications and professional experience, their vision of their role as European Commissioners and their allotted policy areas.
