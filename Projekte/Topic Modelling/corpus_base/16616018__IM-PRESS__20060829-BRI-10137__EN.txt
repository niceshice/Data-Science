However, the committee is also urging greater flexibility in the legislation to enable Member States to adapt to the stricter standards.
As to education, Christopher BEAZLEY 's (EPP-ED, UK) report focuses on appropriate teaching materials including the European dimension in the national school curricula . MEPs in the Culture and Education Committee acknowledge that it is difficult, in particular for those whose mother tongue is English, to maintain sufficient interest and motivation in becoming proficient in other European languages.
Monday also sees MEPs debating the discharge of the EP budget for 2004 where MEPs are likely to closely scrutinise the purchase of the Winston Churchill and Salvador de Madariaga buildings in Strasbourg.
Tuesday 26 September 2006
Tuesday starts off with a debate on services of general interest . Commission President José Manuel BARROSO will take part in the debate . Parliament will discuss to what extent EU rules should affect the way in which public services are provided in the Member States when it considers a report calling for greater legal certainty on the issue.

Immediately after, Parliament turns its attention to Turkey . The Foreign Affairs Committee will be tabling a report welcoming the start of the EU's accession talks with Turkey and stating that Parliament remains firmly committed to accession as the goal of the negotiations.

Wednesday afternoon kicks off with a debate on the deepening crisis in Darfur . MEPs will also vote on a resolution on the subject on Thursday.
Also in the afternoon, Saijad KARIM (ALDE, UK) will lead the debate on his wide-ranging report on EU-India relations .

Parliament will then turn its attention to the removal of shark fins on board vessels . MEPs congratulate the Commission on its report and encourage it to continue monitoring the application of the regulation. However, they regret that not all Member States are monitoring their vessels as required or forwarding the mandatory reports.
The House will also debate the exploitation of plaice and sole stocks in the North Sea . The Fisheries Committee says that the Council should decide, by qualified majority on the basis of a proposal from the Commission, on the Total Allowable Catches (TACs) for a period of three years (as opposed to the following year) for the stocks of plaice and sole in the North Sea.
Thursday 28 September 2006

Turkey urged to step up reforms and admit Cypriot planes and vessels
2006-09-21 - 16:42
The Foreign Affairs Committee will be tabling a report welcoming the start of the EU's accession talks with Turkey and stating that Parliament remains firmly committed to accession as the goal of the negotiations. However, it adds that major reforms are still needed and expresses regret that Turkey's reform process has slowed down. Democracy, rule of law, minority rights
The report, drafted by Camiel EURLINGS (EPP-ED, NL) notes "persistent shortcomings" in areas such as freedom of expression, religious and minority rights, the role of the military, policing, women's rights, trade union rights and cultural rights. It urges Turkey to "reinvigorate" the reform process and also calls for a lowering of the threshold of ten per cent of the votes below which political parties cannot enter the Turkish parliament.
Regional issues and external relations
In external affairs, MEPs urge Turkey "to take concrete steps for the normalisation of bilateral relations" with Cyprus "as soon as possible". They refer to the Council declaration of 21 September 2005, which said that continuing negotiations would depend on Turkey opening its borders to Cypriot vessels and airplanes and that the situation would be reviewed in 2006. Regarding Cyprus itself, MEPs welcome the meeting between Mr Papadopoulos and Mr Talat, which led to the agreement of 8 July.
As it did last year, the committee calls on Turkey, as a precondition for accession, to recognise the Armenian genocide.
MEPs repeat that negotiations do not lead automatically to accession but say that whether or not negotiations are successfully concluded, Turkey must remain "fully anchored in European structures." They describe Turkey as "a bridge-builder between Europe and the Islamic world".
Before the vote in committee, Mr Eurlings said: "Unfortunately, reforms have clearly slowed down." He hoped that the Turkish government would regard his report "as a signal and an incentive to reintroduce the vigorous speed of reform it had shown in the year before accession negotiations started."

Accession of Bulgaria and Romania - MEPs to react to the latest Commission report
2006-09-21 - 16:42
MEPs will debate the accession of Bulgaria and Romania. Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn for the Commission will formally announce on the same day (26 September 2006) its latest position on the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the EU with the release of its latest monitoring reports on the two countries. During the October mini-session in Brussels, MEPs are scheduled to vote on own-initiative reports on the accession of the two countries. They are currently being prepared in the Foreign Affairs Committee. Pierre MOSCOVICI (PES, FR) is preparing the report on Romania, and Geoffrey VAN ORDEN (EPP-ED, UK) is the rapporteur for Bulgaria.
On 14 June 2006, MEPs adopted a resolution (see link) noting with satisfaction that the Commission maintains the deadline for both countries to enter the European Union by 1 January 2007 on condition that the necessary measures are taken to resolve the outstanding problems, and accepts the recommendations made by the Commission with regard to the further procedure for taking a final decision on the date of accession of Bulgaria and Romania.
In the June resolution, MEPs also emphasised the need for both countries to continue to consolidate the ongoing reform of their justice systems, by further enhancing the transparency, efficiency and impartiality of the judiciary, and to demonstrate substantive further results in the fight against corruption, with special emphasis on the fight against organised crime. Parliament stressed the utmost importance of taking all the measures required to combat the trafficking of human beings and to substantially enhance the degree of social inclusion of Roma communities, especially with regard to housing, health care, education and unemployment.
Currently, the European Parliament welcomes Observers from Romania and Bulgaria. The number of Observers (Bulgaria 18; Romania 35) is the same as the number of Members of the European Parliament each country will have after accession.

President of Liberia to address the House
2006-09-21 - 16:42
At midday on Tuesday 26 September, Liberian President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf will address the House.Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf (born October 29, 1938) is the current president of Liberia. Her election victory was formally announced by the Liberian elections commission on November 23, 2005 following the 2005 election. She is the world's first elected black female president and likewise Africa's first elected female head of state. Her vice president is Joseph Boakai . She is often referred to as the "Iron Lady". In 2006, Forbes magazine named her 51st in the list of the 100 most powerful women in the world.
Biography
Three of Johnson-Sirleaf's grandparents were indigenous Liberians; the fourth was a German who married a rural market woman. That grandfather was forced to leave the country when Liberia — in loyalty to the United States — declared war on Germany in 1917.
Johnson-Sirleaf graduated from the College of West Africa (Monrovia), a United Methodist high school. She received a B.B.A. in Accounting at Madison Business College in Madison, Wisconsin, USA in 1964, an economics diploma from the University of Colorado in 1970, and a Master of Public Administration from Harvard University in 1971.
Returning to Liberia after Harvard, Johnson-Sirleaf became Assistant Minister of Finance in President William Tolbert's administration. In 1980, Tolbert was overthrown and killed by army sergeant Samuel Doe, ending decades of relative stability. Doe represented the Krahn ethnic group and was the first Liberian president not to be descended from the elite ex-American slave community. For the next ten years, Doe allowed the Krahn people to dominate public life.
After the overthrow of Tolbert, Johnson-Sirleaf went into exile in Nairobi, Kenya, where she worked for Citibank. She returned to run for Senate in 1985, but when she spoke out against Doe's military regime, she was sentenced to ten years in prison. Released after a short period, she moved to Washington, D.C.. She returned to Liberia again in 1997 in the capacity of an economist, working for the World Bank, and Citibank in Africa.
Initially supporting Charles Taylor's bloody rebellion against President Samuel Doe in 1990, she later went on to oppose him, and ran against him in the 1997 presidential elections. She managed only 10% of the votes, as opposed to Taylor's 75%. Taylor charged her with treason. She campaigned for the removal of President Taylor from office, playing an active and supportive role in the transitional government, as the country prepared itself for the 2005 elections. With Taylor's departure, she returned to take over the leadership of the Unity Party.

Darfur - MEPs react to deepening crisis
2006-09-21 - 16:42
MEPs will debate and vote on a resolution on the deepening crisis in Darfur. More than 200,000 people have died since a revolt began in 2003. As many as two million people have been displaced following the violence which has seen the Arab-led Khartoum government in a military campaign against black African groups. The aim of much of the international community is to get Sudan to agree to let UN peacekeepers in to replace African Union (AU) soldiers, no options had been ruled out. On 17 September, the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, said: " I am increasingly concerned at the growing instability in Darfur and risk of another humanitarian tragedy ." He has, therefore, decided on 17 September that he and the Commissioner for Development, Louis Michel, should visit Sudan soon. He said: " The EU is already heavily engaged both in providing humanitarian relief in Darfur and support for the Africa Union troops there. But we must step up our political engagement, to do what we can to avert a humanitarian crisis and to support the Africa Union's work. That is why I intend to visit Sudan shortly ." As part of the same trip President Barroso will lead, for the first time ever, a visit by the Commission to its sister organisation, the Africa Union Commission, in Addis Ababa, to take forward the deepening of relations between these two organisations. Darfur and immigration will be two of the subjects at the top of the agenda. The EU has provided €340 million of humanitarian and food aid in Darfur, as well as €242 million of support for the African Union troops there."
The African Caribbean Pacific - European Union Joint Parliamentary Assembly will debate and vote on a resolution on the situation in Sudan / Darfur during its next meeting from 17-23 November 2006. Procedure: Debate with resolution
Debate: 27.09.2006 ACP-EU joint resolution on the situation in Darfur adopted on 22 June 2006 in Vienna ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly.

EU's economic and trade relations with India
2006-09-21 - 16:42
Sajjad KARIM (ALDE, UK) for the International Trade Committee will be putting forward an own-initiative report on EU's economic and trade relations with India. The report calls on the EU to support India's international trade potential as well as efforts to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) in particular by stepping up trade-related aid to address infrastructure and administrative bottlenecks. The committee welcomes both India and the EU's commitment to a successful and ambitious outcome of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA). The committee calls to this end on India to use its position as leader of the G20 to reach, by the end of 2006, a balanced agreement favourable to development between the developed countries, the emerging economies and the developing countries. The report also notes that negotiations on the DDA are not incompatible with bilateral WTO+ negotiations. The report notes that an outcome of a concluded Doha Development Round will reduce the value of schemes such as the GSP to developing countries like India, by further reducing the margin of preference they enjoy at present. MEPs in the committee call on the EU to offer to enter into a free trade agreement with India, along the lines of its agreement with Chile, which provides for duty-free entry for the exports of both parties on a reciprocal basis, and calls on the High Level Trade Group to explore mutual opportunities in this regard.
The committee calls on the EU and India to lead the way in finding an expeditious and permanent solution on TRIPS and public health to facilitate access to essential medicines, within the Doha Development Round. MEPs in the committee welcome the steps taken by the Indian government regarding IP rules for medicines. The report encourages the Indian government to implement the law faster especially as regards exports of generic medicines.
EU-India co-operation
The committee welcomes the fact that the EU and India committed themselves to strengthening dialogue and engagement, including on human rights, as strategic partners at the sixth India-EU Summit on 7 September 2005, as reflected in the Joint Action Plan, which also includes development cooperation, giving importance to environmental sustainability and to social and economic cohesion. MEPs in the committee ask that an ongoing dialogue be maintained in the field of human rights within the strategic partnership. The report in this context, congratulates India's National Human Rights Commission on its independent and rigorous work on these matters.
The report stresses that meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and combating poverty should remain a central element of the EU-India Strategic Partnership. MEPs in the committee welcome the fact that the next EU-India summit on 13 October 2006 will address the issue of the MDGs. The committee calls urgently for specific measures to be taken to ensure that minorities such as Dalits and Adivasis and other marginalised communities, tribes and castes, are able to close the wide gap with the rest of the population regarding the attainment of the MDGs.
India's economic and social situation
The committee notes that international trade can be a powerful driver of economic growth and poverty reduction, but it is not a magic bullet, and trade reforms are complementary to development policies. The committee considers that to lift people out of pockets of poverty, and continue to climb the ladder of economic development, India needs to focus critically on building a business environment that deepens integration with the world economy in a widening range of manufactures and services.
Development and Environment
The committee acknowledges the important successes of the Government of India in the eradication of poverty, but notes that despite sustained economic growth, vast inequalities still persist, with about 30% of the Indian population still living below the poverty line. MEPs are particularly concerned about the situation of underprivileged sections of the population, in particular women, children, the disadvantaged and the rural population, e.g. Dalits and Adivasis (indigenous tribes and peoples). The committee calls on the Commission and the Council to work together with the Indian government to improve the situation of those groups and to examine future cooperation as to their contribution towards ending gender and caste discrimination.
MEPs in the committee emphasise that successive Indian governments have made considerable efforts to tackle the issue of caste discrimination. MEPs believe however that much more has to be done.
The committee urges the EU to promote and implement measures to ensure the socio-economic development of minorities, who have largely been excluded from the new economy in India and are discriminated against in development programmes and disaster recovery through, inter alia, the promotion of equal opportunities in employment in private EU-based companies and investors, the encouragement of Dalit-inclusive development programmes and the use of indicators to measure Dalit inclusion in the new economy.
The committee notes that India's current administration has more openly acknowledged the problems posed by HIV/AIDS. MEPs in the committee consider that the spread of HIV/AIDS has the potential to disrupt India's progress. MEPs in the committee also note that limited access to health-care and low levels of awareness are responsible for its growing incidence. The report welcomes the fact that it has increased its funding and programmes to address the problems posed by HIV/AIDS and calls on the EU to assist India to scale-up programmes for individuals and communities at high risk. The committee accordingly welcomes the work of the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) in its activities for raising awareness among the rural and urban populations.
MEPs in the committee call for a parliamentary summit to be held annually to coincide with or immediately precede the annual EU-India summit, which usually takes place without the official participation of the European Parliament. Finally, the report considers that such summits would make it possible to develop the links between parliamentary bodies, improve understanding of our differences and bring the democratic systems of both sides closer together.

Anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard actions against the EU
2006-09-21 - 16:42
Cristiana MUSCARDINI (UEN, IT) will be putting forward an own-initiative report on the anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard actions against the EU for the International Trade Committee. The committee is concerned at the abnormal increase in the number of trade defence cases involving both 'traditional' users of trade defence instruments and other, more recently-developed WTO members. MEPs in the committee consider that, in many of these cases, the WTO's rules and case law have been partially or completely disregarded, thus causing unjustified damage to the Community's industry. Nevertheless, the committee welcomes the help provided by the Commission to Member States and European industry in trade defence cases brought by third countries. The report urges the Commission to constantly monitor the action taken by third countries to ensure that it is appropriate and fair.
The committee calls on the Commission to campaign at the WTO for a radical revision of the rules governing the imposition of safeguard measures to avoid the excessive and unjustified use of such measures. The report urges the Member States to maintain a 'communal' approach to these issues which would enable the measures in question to be applied more harmoniously in the Community context and reduce the number of actions taken against the Community by bringing sustained pressure to bear at political and technical level on WTO members which intend to apply trade defence measures, while constantly endeavouring to raise awareness of the issues involved. MEP in the committee say, however, that 'communal' action must not be used as an excuse to support unfair trading practices by individual Member States.
The committee recommends that the Community refrain from granting preferential treatment to trade partners which are not acting in accordance with WTO rules and case-law, if such action is damaging Community industry. MEPs in the committee also urge the Commission to take the principle of reciprocity into account when dealing with trade defence cases involving those trade partners.
Finally, the International Trade Committee stresses that, if the new rules on international trade are to win public support, they must be applied transparently and consistently, in compliance with the principle of the rule of law, both within and outside the Community.

The Helsinki Summit marked the tenth anniversary of the ASEM process. The overarching theme of the Summit was "10 Years of ASEM: Global Challenges - Joint Responses”. The Summit had a particular focus on globalisation. Other topics included strengthening multilateralism and addressing security threats, sustainable development and intercultural dialogue. Leaders also discussed topical regional and international developments.
ASEM (the Asia-Europe Meeting) is an informal process of dialogue and cooperation initiated in 1996 to reflect the new political climate of the 90’s. Now, the twenty five EU Member States, the European Commission and thirteen Asian countries (Brunei, Burma/Myanmar, China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Laos, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) participate in the process.

Removal of shark fins on board fishing vessels
2006-09-21 - 16:42
In a consultation report by the Fisheries Committee, Parliament is responding to a Commission report on the application of the 2003 regulation on the removal of shark fins on board fishing vessels. MEPs congratulate the Commission on its report and encourage it to continue monitoring the application of the regulation. However, they regret that not all Member States are monitoring their vessels as required or forwarding the mandatory reports.
The Commission is asked to report no later than 1 January 2009 on the continued operation of the regulation, taking into account international developments, and to present by 30 June 2007 a Community Action Plan for the conservation of sharks and seabirds, as proposed in its communication " Halting the Loss of Biodiversity by 2010 - and Beyond ".
Ratio of fin to body weight
Under the existing regulation, fishermen must prove they have not simply dumped de-finned shark bodies at sea, by producing a sufficient ratio of shark body weight to fin weight when they return to port.
The Fisheries Committee believes the current ratio (5% maximum of fin to body weight) is set too low in the case of the blue shark (Prionacea glauca) and hence imposes too great a burden on fishermen. More than 80% of sharks captured belong to this species, which, according to some experts, has a ratio of fins/live weight of 6.5% - the figure the committee would like to incorporate into the new rules.
The committee therefore asks the Commission to propose within 6 months an amendment to the regulation, revising "the theoretical ratios of fin weight to live weight", especially for Prionacea glauca.
Environmentalist groups, quoting different sources, argue that the ratio is 2% and that the EU rules are too lax as they are. Rapporteur Rosa MIGUÉLEZ RAMOS PES ES A6-0263/2006 Removal of fins of sharks on board vessels Procedure ; own-initiative

Fisheries
Exploiting stocks of plaice and sole in the North Sea
2006-09-21 - 16:42
Albert Jan MAAT (EPP-ED, NL), for the Fisheries Committee, will be tabling a non-binding report on exploiting stocks of plaice and sole in the North Sea. The committee says that the Council should decide, by qualified majority on the basis of a proposal from the Commission, on the Total Allowable Catches (TACs) for a period of three years (as opposed to the following year) for the stocks of plaice and sole in the North Sea. A multi-annual quota will, say MEPs in the committee, more clearly hold out the prospect of a structural recovery of stocks and will give the fishing industry more reliable information as a basis for planning its operations. Any intermediate problems can be solved by means of measures to reduce fishing effort (e.g. rules on numbers of days at sea).
The aim of the proposed regulation is to establish a management plan for the fishing of plaice and sole in the North Sea in order to rebuild safe biological limits and to guarantee future sustainable fishing.
This proposal is being presented on the basis that currently there is no established management plan for the fishing of sole and plaice in the North Sea. This, in spite of the fact, that the fishing mortality rate of both plaice and sole is of serious concern. The proposal is broadly similar to management plans proposed for sole stocks in the Bay of Biscay and the Western Channels. The proposal has been designed according to the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy, the biodiversity Action Plan and the Implementation Plan agreed at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development.

Fisheries
Improving the economic situation in the fishing industry
2006-09-21 - 16:42
Pedro GUERREIRO (GUE/NGL, PT) for the Fisheries Committee will be tabling an own-initiative report on improving the economic situation in the fishing industry in response to a Commission communication on that subject. The committee deplores a policy which, taking advantage of the socio-economic deterioration in the industry owing to the steep rise in fuel prices, seeks to promote the scrapping of vessels and the permanent cessation of activities. The Fisheries committee regrets that the measures proposed do not have a genuine socio-economic dimension and that, instead, they are measures that take no account of the consequences of their implementation for vessel crews.
As to intermediate measures to be taken, the committee regrets that, as regards rescue and restructuring aid, the Commission continues to block the possibility of granting compensatory payments and operating aid, and therefore stresses the need to adopt immediate concrete measures to reduce the high instability of fuel prices for the industry, in particular by creating support measures related to their costs. The committee requests, in this context, the creation of a guarantee fund with Community participation which will safeguard the stability of fuel prices and the granting of a transitional compensatory payment for fishing enterprises affected.
In the medium to long-term, the committee also regrets the lack of vision in the new EFF's approach to aid for engine replacement. MEPs in the committee take the view that measures such as linking aid for engine replacement for vessels longer than 12 metres to a 20% reduction in power will make some fishing practices virtually unviable and may affect safety, whilst they may also encourage increased fraud in the form of underdeclaring of engine power. The committee stresses the need for the EFF to continue to grant aid for the renewal and modernisation of the fishing fleet - in particular for the replacement of engines, for reasons of safety, environmental protection or fuel efficiency - above all for small-scale inshore and artisanal fishing, and for the replacement of vessels over 20 years old, which are no longer operating safely
Inshore fishing
As to inshore fishing, the committee asks the Commission to recognise the specific nature of small-scale inshore fishing and artisanal fishing in the CFP and to analyse the extent to which the current instruments are suitable for responding to the sector’s needs, adapting them accordingly. The committee also asks the Commission to submit a proposal for the creation of a Community support programme for small-scale inshore fishing and artisanal fishing, which would help to coordinate actions and channel funding from other existing instruments to deal with the specific problems facing this segment of the industry.
Illegal fishing
The committee considers it vital that measures be taken to strengthen the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. The report urges the Member States to strengthen their control mechanisms. The committee considers that improved controls at the EU borders are necessary in order to prevent the entry into the EU of fish that has been caught illegally. MEPs in the committee call on the Commission to review the current common fisheries policy provisions on illegal, unreported and unregulated catches. The report considers that there is a particularly pressing need for regulations to prevent a significant percentage of catches from being discarded.
Sustainability of resources
MEPs in the committee reiterate their request to the Commission that it should take a more wide-ranging view of measures to protect the marine environment and rebuild depleted fish stocks, in particular by considering and studying other factors which have a considerable impact on the marine environment and the state of fishery resources, such as coastal and offshore pollution, industrial and agricultural effluents, deep-sea dredging and maritime transport, to complement current management methods. The report asks the Commission for a Community initiative in this area.
Finally, the report points out that it is essential to achieve a balance between the socio-economic situation and environmental sustainability, whilst at the same time underlining the need to implement a mechanism for subsidising or compensating fishermen who are affected by the economic and social effects of stock recovery plans or other measures to provide increased protection for ecosystems, especially in less favoured regions.

Progress in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ)
2006-09-21 - 16:42
The centrepiece of this week's plenary session is the annual debate on progress in the AFSJ. The debate is based on an oral question to the Council and Commission. The vote on the resolution is due to take place in October. The oral question stresses that the Amsterdam Treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights must become the core of an AFSJ in the European Union. MEPs therefore ask the Council, when updating the Hague programme, to ensure that the principles in the Charter are "properly and effectively upheld".
In this connection, the question asks the Council to ensure that the Fundamental Rights Agency, scheduled to start work in January 2007, covers not just first pillar but also third pillar issues (judicial and police cooperation). MEPs also want the Council to adopt without delay the pending decisions on procedural rights, the European Evidence Warrant and the fight against racism and xenophobia.
The question calls for border controls between old and new Member States to be abolished as early as next year. It adds that, as a fundamental rights protection policy is not credible without the possibility of referral to a court, the Council should agree to lift the current restrictions on access to the Court of Justice for national judges and evaluate with the Court the steps still required to reduce the duration of proceedings relating to fundamental rights.
According to the question, since the attacks of 11 September there has been a discrepancy between the strategies the European Council agrees and their implementation: the Council has failed to safeguard fundamental rights and civil liberties while at the same time increasing public security. MEPs ask whether the Council plans to activate the 'bridging clauses' provided for in Articles 42 TEU and 67 TEC and ensure that measures adopted are fully implemented at national level.
The Council is also asked to negotiate with Parliament the integration of Europol into the EU Treaties. In addition, believe MEPs, it should engage in open debate on the implications of the Treaty of Prüm and seek to integrate it into the EU framework. This treaty was signed in May 2005 by the Benelux countries, Austria, France, Germany and Spain, effectively seeking to form an intergovernmental avant-garde on criminal justice and police issues.
MEPs also want to know what progress the Council intends to make on immigration and asylum policies. They refer to the negotiations with Parliament on adopting the directive on the return of illegally staying third-country nationals. And they ask if the Council will agree to the introduction of a common policy on legal immigration.
Lastly, against the backcloth of President Bush's admission that the US has secret prisons abroad, MEPs will be asking the Council to ensure that EU fundamental rights principles are properly upheld during the fight against terrorism.
The traditional plenary vote on a draft resolution, which normally follows the AFSJ debate, will this year take place at the October II session, to allow any further conclusions arising from the meeting on the AFSJ with national parliaments on 2 and 3 October to be included.
Immigration
The second topic in this joint debate will be EU immigration policy, a subject very much in the news given the influxes of illegal immigrants at the EU's border regions, particularly the Canary Islands but also Malta, Italy (notably the island of Lampedusa), Greece and Cyprus.
During a debate in the Civil Liberties Committee last week, most MEPs criticised the Council and Commission for failing to respond to the emergency in the Canary Islands. The Council was taken to task for its decision to cut funding for migration policy.
In his speech at the opening of the last Strasbourg session, Parliament's President Josep Borrell singled out this issue, saying the recent influxes were not a one-off event but "a permanent, structural problem" which meant that " Europe must formulate a common policy for managing migration" and "commit itself to the development of Africa ".

Privacy rights need to be respected - even in police cooperation (final vote)
2006-09-21 - 16:42
The European Parliament will vote on a report endorsing a Commission proposal to extend data protection rules to the transfer of information in police and judicial cooperation. This is the competence of Member States and falls out of the scope of existing community laws to protect data so far. MEPs are proposing more than 60 non-binding amendments to limit the use and access to personal data to the essential cases and when there is a real threat to public security. Although the vote on the consultation report drafted by Martine ROURE (PES, FR) was scheduled for the plenary session in June -under the British presidency- MEPs decided to postpone it, hoping the current Finnish presidency will be more willing to take into account Parliament's demands.
The Commission proposal responds to a longstanding claim from Parliament, who since the creation of the third pillar has been calling for standards on data protection in the context of judicial and police cooperation which are comparable to the standards in force in Community law. The issue is particularly relevant now that the European Court of Justice has decided to annul existing agreements between the EU and US government on the transfer of Passenger Name Records. MEPs want to push for a quick adoption of this draft decision by the Council, which would affect future agreements with the United States.
Strict criteria to collect and access data
Data collection and access to national governments or competent authorities must be limited "to specific purposes", only "if strictly necessary", and carried out with the "principles of proportionality and necessity" and for the purpose of "preventing a threat to public security or to a person", say MEPs. This personal data made available to a given Member State might be further processed by another only with the consent of the authority which made available the information in the first place.
Sensitive data such us biometrics or DNA information will follow additional specific safeguards to ensure they are accurate and that they can be challenged by the subject of such data. MEPs also demand a different treatment for personal data depending on the status of the person concerned: information related to "non-suspects" will be treated "only for the specific purpose they were collected, for a limited period of time and with adequate limitations on access to them and on their transmission".
Transfers to third countries
One of the main concerns for MEPs is the potential access to personal data that authorities from third countries could ask in the name of fight against terror and organised crime. In this sense, Parliament adopted an amendment forbidding such transfer to competent authorities outside the EU except if the transfer "is provided by a law clearly obliging or authorising it" and if the Member States can ensure that the level of protection afforded by the third country is adequate. This assessment would be based on concrete criteria listed in the text. Only exceptionally, this adequacy decision can be omitted if it is to prevent an imminent serious danger threatening public security.
Finally, the committee is proposing other amendments to give the citizen the right to deny the accuracy of some personal information and mark it on the database, as well as to impose criminal sanctions to authorities in case of intentional offence or gross negligence.

Taking account of convictions in the Member States of the European Union in the course of new criminal proceedings
2006-09-21 - 16:42
Parliament is being consulted on a Council framework decision laying down the basis for any conviction handed down in a given Member States to be taken into account by another Member State, i.e. the principle of mutual recognition. The aim is that the courts of one Member State, when conducting a criminal case against a person, should take account of previous convictions handed down in another Member State against the same person for different facts. The Civil Liberties Committee supports the content of the proposal but suggests deleting all provisions on how to exchange the information of the national criminal records, since MEPs feel this matter should be treated separately by another framework decision.
The rapportuer, Panayiotis DEMETRIOU (EPP-ED, CY) said: "Recognition of judgements between Member States is the cornerstone of judicial cooperation. The proposal for a Council Framework Decision on taking account by one Member State of convictions in another Member State is a necessary step to the direction of judicial cooperation."

Education
A very early start for foreign language learning?
2006-09-21 - 16:42
Member States should include at least two foreign languages from a very early age in their school programmes, says the Culture and Education Committee. MEPs in the committee acknowledge that it is difficult, in particular for those whose mother tongue is English, to maintain sufficient interest and motivation in becoming proficient in other European languages, which would underpin mutual understanding and empathy across Europe. In a non-binding report originally drawn up by Christopher BEAZLEY (EPP-ED, UK), the committee also stresses the importance of school curricula providing support measures for the European dimension. All education systems in the EU should ensure that, by the end of their secondary education, their pupils have the knowledge and competences they need to prepare them for their role as future EU citizens. The "European dimension" has two aspects: firstly, access to information about the EU, its institutions, methods and practices, and, secondly, the development of linguistic skills, with learning the languages of neighbouring peoples being especially important.
The committee is also recommending an exchange of best practice between all Member States with regard to language teaching and the inclusion of European content in education. Members suggest the promotion of teacher training courses to provide the necessary understanding of European issues so teachers can may complement their teaching of national and local issues with European ones.

Education
More lifelong learning for adults
2006-09-21 - 16:42
Although the concept of lifelong learning is gaining ground, too few adults are participating so national strategies should be urgently implemented in all Member States, says the Culture and Education Committee. Early school leavers, the disabled, long-term unemployed people, women, older people and those with low basic skills should have priority in the Commission's proposals regarding key competences for lifelong learning. In a report by Helga TRÜPEL (Greens/EFA, DE), MEPs in the committee stress the importance of creating a European frame of reference for eight key competences, offering EU citizens a tool to adapt to an evolving labour market in a knowledge based society.
The eight proposed competences include communication in the mother tongue, in foreign languages, maths, science and technology, but the Committee also highlighted the importance of civic competence, based on the concepts of democracy, justice, equality, citizenship and civil rights.
Knowledge of the main events, trends and agents of change in national, European and world history and present, including the aspect of European diversity, was essential, said the committee, as was the knowledge of the aims, values and policies of social and political movements. In the light of the Lisbon strategy, the report also stresses the need for the achievement of an average employment rate for the EU of 70% overall and of at least 60% among women.

Quality charter for student mobility approved by Culture and Education Committee
2006-09-21 - 16:42
The Culture and Education Committee agrees with the Commission that, with more than a million young students having lived so far in another Member State as part of their studies, it is time to introduce a European Quality Charter for Mobility in education. In a legislative report, the committee is proposing amendments including a call to meet the specific needs of disabled people and disadvantaged groups. MEPs in the committee say that programmes such as Erasmus are one of the few EU actions to have an identity recognisable to a very large number of citizens. They believe these programmes, which cover schools and universities, as well as vocational and adult education, have contributed to the development of a sense of European citizenship. The report by Christa PRETS (PES, DE) warmly welcomes the Commission proposals for a Quality Charter on Mobility which would lead to greater efficiency in all types of organised mobility for learning purposes.
The proposed charter consists of ten practical guidelines covering the period from departure to the stay and the return. The ten guidelines refer to information and guidance, learning plans, general preparation, personalisation, linguistic aspects, logistical support and monitoring.
MEPs in the committee propose amendments demanding that the specific needs of people with disabilities and disadvantaged groups had to be taken into account. Another proposed amendment says that, under the charter, a learning plan should be drawn up in advance with particular emphasis on linguistic preparation. MEPs in the committee are also recommending that, in order to encourage mobility, it should be possible to transfer government loans and/or grants to the host country.

Towards a European Qualification Framework
2006-09-21 - 16:42
How to compare a qualification achieved in one Member State to one of another Member State? For professional qualifications a European directive exists since last year. Concerning any other qualification - for example after a vocational training - the Commission launched a consultation with the aim to create a European Qualifications Framework (EQF). The Employment committee has given its input into the ongoing discussions before the Commission adopts a formal proposal by the end of 2006. The Parliament will be dealing with this proposal in future in the framework of the co-decision procedure.
The aim of the EQF is to create a European framework which will enable qualifications systems at the national and sectoral levels to relate to each other. This reference structure will be used on a voluntary basis and will facilitate the transfer and recognition of qualifications held by individual citizens. The core would be a set of common reference points referring to learning outcomes located in a structure of 8 levels.
In general Members of the Committee of Employment and Social Affairs welcome the Commission Initiative to modernise and improve the European education and training systems with a view to laying down a common reference framework for European certification systems. In the own initiative report by Thomas MANN (EPP-ED, DE), MEPs in the committee, are nevertheless proposing a couple of non-binding amendments.
They point out that the EQF must serve primarily to classify certification procedures based on the outcome of vocational training. Therefore they call for simple, workable descriptors to be used (taking greater account of vocational training and further training systems) and the number of levels reduced.
The EQF should be closely linked to labour market and greater emphasis should be placed on improving the ability of the individual to find employment and achieving greater security for workers at the workplace. Members take the view that particular attention should be paid to methods and systems of evaluating learning outcomes achieved by non-formal or informal methods, as the development of skills in the context of lifelong learning takes pace in a wide range of everyday work situations.
Every country should have its own national or regional qualifications framework ensuring compatibility with the EQF.
MEPs in the committee agree that the EQF should initially be implemented on a voluntary basis and not involve legal obligations. Nevertheless they think it must serve to promote transparency and equivalence as regard certificates issued at national and sectoral level.

Environment
Cleaner air in Europe: more ambitious targets but greater flexibility
2006-09-21 - 16:42
MEPs will vote on two reports by the Environment Committee calling for more ambitious targets for air quality and atmospheric pollution in Europe. However, the committee is also urging greater flexibility in the legislation to enable Member States to adapt to the stricter standards. Every year over 360,000 people die prematurely of ailments linked to air pollution in the EU, especially in big cities and industrial areas. Germany, the Netherlands, northern and central Europe and Italy are among the regions most affected.
In September 2005 the European Commission unveiled a strategy to reduce the number of deaths by around 40% by 2020 as compared to 2000. It also put forward a new directive on air quality with new technical rules which reflect scientific developments and with maximum concentrations of the microparticles or atmospheric dust most dangerous to human health - PM25 - which are currently not regulated. This directive will replace the existing framework directive and its daughter directives, thereby simplifying the legislation. These directives also fall within the sixth action programme for the environment adopted by Parliament and Council in 2002.
Air quality directive
A codecision report by Holger Krahmer (ALDE, DE) on the directive on the quality of ambient air, adopted in committee by 39 votes to 11 following a compromise between the political groups, calls for more ambitious targets than those set out by the Commission for cutting maximum concentrations of pollutants, in particular PM2.5.
At the same time the committee calls for more flexibility in achieving the targets, to allow Member States, areas and cities which have problems meeting the criteria more time to adjust. However, there will be safeguards to ensure that Member States take the measures needed to reduce pollution. According to Mr Krahmer, the Environment Committee's position is a "balanced compromise between strict health protection and the flexibility needed" at national level, notably for regions suffering from pollution coming from neighbouring countries.
Technical details
• The Environment Committee wants to reduce maximum concentration levels of the largest particles - known as PM10 - to 30µg/m3 on average per year from 2010, as compared to the Commission's proposal to keep the limit at 40µg/m3. However, for the daily limits for these same particles - where the Commission says a figure of 50µg/m3 should not be exceeded more than 35 times per year - MEPs want greater flexibility (a maximum of 55 days per year) for Member States unable to meet the standards because of special geographical or climatic conditions.
• For fine particles ( PM2.5 ), which do the most damage to human lungs, MEPs believe it is too soon to set limit values, given the current state of scientific knowledge. Instead they suggest initially setting a target figure, which is less binding. However, it is lower than that proposed by the Commission (20µg/m3 from 2010 instead of 25µg/m3) and would become binding when the directive is revised in 2015 (and would still be 20µg/m3, whereas the Commission would not lower the 25µg/m3 at that stage).
• The report also calls for more flexibility over allowing five-year extensions to the deadline in areas or cities which fail to meet the criteria. And the Member States in question would be able to prolong the derogation for a further five-year period, for PM25 and PM10 only, provided they submit a plan showing why they cannot meet the ceilings despite measures taken nationally and locally and how they plan to resolve the problem in future.
• The Environment Committee also wants greater flexibility over the goal of reducing the population's exposure to this type of pollution by 20% by 2020, by setting differing percentage reductions in the Member States depending on the recorded concentration levels.
Strategy on air pollution
The own-initiative report by Dorette Corbey (PES, NL) on the Community thematic strategy for air pollution was adopted unanimously in committee. It calls for more ambitious targets for reducing concentration levels of nitrogen oxides (Nox), volatile organic compounds and fine particles (PM2.5).
MEPs also want to see more focus on the sources of pollution, including agriculture and shipping. As with the directive, this report calls for stricter limit values while envisaging longer deadlines for Member States which have taken all possible steps but still have difficulty meeting the limits.
The goal of the thematic strategy unveiled by the Commission in September 2005 is to reduce by around 40% by 2020 - compared to 2000 - the number of premature deaths caused by ailments linked to air pollution. According to rapporteur Dorette Corbey, some 48,000 premature deaths are attributable to fine particles in the EU and 20,000 to ozone pollution. A total of 30 million Europeans suffer from asthma.

Environment
Thematic strategy on the Urban Environment
2006-09-21 - 16:42
Around 80% of the European Union's population live in cities but their needs and interests are often neglected in the EU's funds, projects and strategies. In an own-initiative report by Gyula HEGYI (PES, HU) the Environment Committee welcomes a Commission paper on a Thematic Strategy on the Urban Environment (TSUE) but argues that it does not go far enough. The TSUE would boost the overall environmental performance of cities in Europe by cutting bureaucracy, improving the implementation of environmental policy and encouraging long-term environmental planning at local level.
The Environment Committee strongly believes that a Sustainable Urban Management Plan (SUMP) and a Sustainable Urban Transport Plan (SUTP) should be required by Community law for all urban areas with over 100,000 inhabitants. Clear deadlines and binding targets at local and European level would be needed, as voluntary measures have so far proven ineffective.
The committee says SUMPs should include waste management plans, noise maps and action plans, local air pollution plans and local environmental plans. SUTPs should promote non-motorised transport modes such as cycling and walking, promote public transport and tackle growing individual car use, through parking restrictions and congestion charges.
The report urges more use of environment-friendly modes of transport and technologies, such as bio-fuels and hybrid car technologies. It also proposes a 5% shift in passenger kilometres from individual transport/cars to sustainable means such as public transport and cycling, within the period 2002-2012.
Congestion charge
MEPs in the committee recall that air pollution is a major cause of health problems in the EU. The committee stresses, therefore, that cities with high air pollution should consider introducing congestion charges and establishing low emission zones.

Budgetary control
2004 discharge; sharp criticism but support for purchase of Strasbourg buildings
2006-09-21 - 16:42
The Budgetary Control Committee is recommending that the President of Parliament be granted discharge for the EP's 2004 budget. MEPs in the committee closely scrutinised the issue of the Winston Churchill and Salvador de Madariaga buildings in Strasbourg and concluded it "could be" reasonable to seek to purchase them.
This second draft report by Markus FERBER (EPP-ED, DE) on the 2004 discharge, "Section I", devotes several paragraphs to Parliament's property policy, in particular the case of the Winston Churchill (WIC) and Salvador de Madariaga (SDM) buildings. These two properties which are let to the EP by Strasbourg city council, became the focus of a controversy last March when it emerged that Strasbourg council was to receive payment by the owner, SCI Erasme, under the terms of the sale of the premises agreed with the EP.
The purchase of the WIC and SDM was suspended by the EP and the Budgetary Control Committee set up an informal working party to advise the rapporteur on the allegations concerning the existing rental agreements and the possible purchase by Parliament of the two buildings.
No irregularities found
The draft report's very lengthy paragraph 11 constitutes a " list of grievances " against those responsible for this matter.
The report says "there are no clear indications that there have been unlawful actions or irregularities in the process of concluding and applying the leases and additional agreements, although there are nevertheless doubts on whether the principle of 'sound financial management' enshrined in the Financial Regulation has been fully respected".
The draft report also stresses that " Parliament was neither informed that its lease payments were not being passed on in full to SCI Erasme, nor was it ever informed about this matter by the City of Strasbourg itself ". In addition, " only the City of Strasbourg knew of the existence of two different contractual relationships between the three parties involved and only the City of Strasbourg had been aware of the difference between the two amounts since 1981 ".
"Discourteous" behaviour but no illegal profit
As to whether the profit made by Strasbourg city council in this affair was "illegal", the report states "there are no legal provisions prohibiting a state or local or regional authority from making a profit". However, it adds that the City of Strasbourg's approach was "discourteous", to say the very least, "since it is contrary to rules on hospitality towards international institutions". The Budgetary Control Committee says it "deeply regrets the lack of good faith demonstrated by both the City of Strasbourg and the private investor, SCI Erasme in their relationship with Parliament". And, according to the draft report, Parliament " strongly regrets that its requests for all relevant documentation from SCI Erasme, the private investor and owner of the buildings, were not acceded to ".
Rents to be reviewed
Lastly, the committee's report points out that there is no absolutely reliable basis for setting an appropriate rent for the WIC and SDM buildings, that it is difficult to establish a " fair price " for the rent and hence to assess whether Parliament paid a truly fair rent over the years.
The Budgetary Control Committee says it plans to continue examining Parliament's property policy during the next discharge procedure. The EP administration is asked to " take the necessary measures for a regular review of long-standing contractual obligations towards third parties, e.g. leases or service contracts ".
This second report on the 2004 discharge will be put to the vote in Strasbourg on 26 September, following which the Budgets Committee will deliver its opinion on the purchase of the WIC, SDM - and now the IPE3 - buildings.
Voluntary pension scheme
MEPs takes the view that the relationship between Parliament and the pension fund should be placed on a contractual footing by the end of this year. The committee calls on the Secretary-General to forward to the Committee on Budgetary Control, in December 2006, a report on the progress achieved.
The Budgetary Control Committee believes, furthermore, that Members' contributions to the voluntary pension scheme should be paid directly from personal income rather than through the parliamentary allowance system.
The committee notes, however, that in respect of the current contribution system in its Opinion No 5/99, the Court of Auditors concluded that " from the Fund's and the members' point of view, the system has worked effectively. Additionally it has enabled Parliament to calculate its own payment obligations correctly since, according to the rules, Parliament has to pay the double of the amount effectively paid by the members ". MEPs note that the Court saw no problems in maintaining the system provided that it was better defined and its operation set down in a formal document.
MEPs in the committee also note with concern that the deduction of contributions to the pension scheme from the general expenditure allowance leaves Members exposed to allegations that public funds may be put towards the cost of private pension contributions, and therefore call on the Parliament's Bureau to propose before 31 March 2007 measures to ensure that such payments are made directly by pension scheme members through direct debit orders.

Economic and monetary affairs
MEPs want legal certainty on public services
2006-09-21 - 16:42
Parliament will debate to what extent EU rules should affect the way in which public services are provided in the Member States when it considers a report calling for greater legal certainty on the issue. The report, drawn up by Bernhard RAPKAY (PES, DE) for the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, sets out a consensus position reached between the different political groups. Commission President Barroso will take part in the debate. MEPs in the committee are concerned that individual rulings of the Court of Justice and existing guidelines from the Commission leave uncertainty for all those involved in providing public services on the extent to which EU competition and internal market law applies to different sectors and they want the Commission to clarify this. They also want a clearer distinction to be made between the concepts of ‘services of general interest’ and ‘services of general economic interest’, though they point out that too tight a definition at EU level would conflict with Member States freedom to decide what to define as a public service.
The report opposes the idea of using this exercise to withdraw wholesale broad areas of services of general interest from competition and internal market rules. It emphasises the success of sector-specific EU regulations enacted so far, calling notably for a directive on social and health care services.
MEPs in the committee emphasise that it should be for the competent authority to decide whether to supply services ‘in house’ or contract them out, via a tendering process. They note that local authorities, under certain conditions, should be able to provide services via joint inter-communal organisations without necessarily going through a tendering process.
More legal clarification is needed when it comes to procedures for accessing existing networks needed for provision of services, defining the price for supply of services, securing competition and opportunities for new entrepreneurs, out-of-court settlements between service providers and users and referral to competition authorities.
The committee invites the Commission to propose appropriate legal initiatives to deal with all these issues. Rapporteur Bernhard RAPKAY PES DE A6-/2006 Commission White Paper on services of general interest Procedure : own-initiative

Updating economic statistical classifications

Parliament will vote on a first reading report by Guntars KRASTS (UEN, LV) for the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee broadly approving a proposed regulation on the statistical classification of economic activities (NACE Revision 2), subject to a number of mainly technical and drafting amendments. One proposed amendment stipulates that consideration should be given to the principle that the benefits of updating must outweigh its costs and that additional costs and burden on businesses of collecting data should remain within a reasonable limit. The report proposes a whole series of technical clarifications to the Annexes and also deals with issues of ‘comitology’ – i.e. how powers are granted to the Commission to implement the measures.

Green light for PROGRESS programme
2006-09-21 - 16:42
The Employment and Social Affairs Committee will recommend that Parliament give the green light to the Council's common position on the PROGRESS programme. PROGRESS is a new Community programme for employment and social cohesion. It simplifies and fuses together several action programmes which are due to expire (on combating discrimination, gender equality, cooperation to combat social exclusion and incentives to boost employment). It also merges various budget lines on working conditions into one common programme. The programme will be divided into five sections: employment, social protection and inclusion, working conditions, anti-discrimination and diversity, and gender equality.
The common position incorporates nearly all Parliament's amendments, either verbatim or nearly so. If approved, the programme will enter into force on 1 January 2007, run for seven years (until 2013) and have a budget of €743.25 million for 2007-2013. The funding was agreed by the three institutions as part of the inter-institutional agreement on the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013.

Protection of the euro against counterfeiting (Pericles programme)
2006-09-21 - 16:42
The Civil Liberties Committee recommends that Parliament approve unamended two draft Council decisions on Pericles, the programme to protect the euro against counterfeiting. The decision would prolong Pericles to 2013 and bring the non-euro zone Member States into the programme. Pericles was set up on 17 December 2001. Its aim is to support measures by Member States as well as existing programmes to combat counterfeiting of the euro. These include seminars, meetings, workshops and conferences as well as exchanges of technical, scientific and operational expertise.
Pericles has fully achieved its goals: the counterfeiting rate has been minimal. It has even been possible to pinpoint key non-EU countries where counterfeit notes have been produced, such as Colombia. This international projection of the programme has led to the creation in various countries of national anti-counterfeiting offices.
The two Council decisions will allow Pericles to be extended to the EU Member States which have not adopted the euro and also prolong its life to 31 December 2013, thus aligning it with the period of the financial perspective. The annual budget of €1m remains unchanged. Thus total funding to the end of 2013 will be €7m.

Support for nanosciences if managed ethically
2006-09-21 - 16:42
The Industry Committee welcomes an action plan by the European Commission for a safe, integrated and responsible strategy for nanosciences and nanotechnologies for the period 2005-2009. MEPs believe nanotechnologies can help address needs such as public health, energy and transport, and contribute to the EU's competitiveness and sustainable development goals. In an own-initiative report by Miloslav RANSDORF (GUE/NGL, CZ), they therefore stress the need to increase publicly funded investment in R&D, saying that world-class R&D infrastructure is needed for the EU to remain competitive in nanosciences. The EU must also clarify the legal and business environment for these technologies and create a nanoscience patent monitoring system governed by the European Patent Office.
In addition, say MEPs, an ethical approach is essential to win public trust. They therefore welcome planned reviews of issues such as non-therapeutic human enhancement and the links between nanosciences and nanotechnologies and individual privacy, but they urge that these reviews be made public. They also call for ethical committees to be set up to help ensure the public is properly informed and to create a climate of trust based on awareness of the risks and the benefits of nanotechnologies.
Nanotechnology is the manipulation or self-assembly of individual atoms, molecules, or molecular clusters into structures to create materials and devices with new or vastly different properties. Materials from carbon nanotubes are 100 time stronger than steel, but 6 times lighter; silver nanoparticles on the surfaces of refrigerators, air conditioners and laundry machines act as antibacterial and antifungal agents. Other nanoscience-based products are anti-graffiti paints, long lasting batteries and self-cleaning textiles. Nanotechnologists are also investigating ways of discovering and administering new medicines and devising new security techniques for crime prevention.

Galileo programme
2006-09-21 - 16:42
MEPs will debate and vote on a resolution on Galileo. The debate is based on the following oral question to the Commission: Subject: Taking stock of the Galileo programme
Galileo is the first European infrastructure to be owned by the European Union, an entirely Community project realised through a public-private partnership, which is new for the Community. The European Parliament has given its full support to the Galileo Programme, through its legislative and budgetary responsibilities(1), recognising that Galileo is a strategic project, one of the most important pillars of the Lisbon strategy, and offers great opportunities to SMEs. European engineers and developers working within the European Space Agency and in the space industry have done a great job. The first experimental satellite GIOVE-A has already fulfilled its main mission, the technical aspects are in place, and now the most important element for bringing the project forward is good governance.
Timing is crucial for the commercial viability and success of the programme. The three phases are well behind the original plan of 2005. The tendering procedure is being prolonged, thus jeopardising the overall timing of the project. How does the Commission intend to avoid further delay?
For Parliament as a budgetary authority, the necessary steps to ensure repayments are important. The planned proposal concerning the implementation of the Public Regulated Service access policy by the end of 2006 and the Green Paper on Galileo Applications, which the Commission will present at the end of 2006, are noted. After the approval of the whole project budget (including liability commitments) by the budgetary authorities, a stronger supervisory position for the Galileo Supervisory Authority will be indispensable. Does the Commission intend to amend the current draft regulation in order to ensure this?
Cooperation with third countries in the future phases of Galileo is important. How will the Commission involve Parliament in the preparation of the international negotiations, with particular reference to institutional questions? Oral question to the Commission

Outlook for women in international trade
2006-09-21 - 16:42
The impact of trade and globalisation on women is the focus of an own-initiative report by the Committee on Women's Rights. It says trade has the potential to improve gender equality and to empower women economically, socially and politically. However, trade globalisation has in practice contributed to the increase in insecure work and growing female unemployment in many economic sectors. Seventy per cent of the 1.3 billion people living in poverty are women. They generally have greater difficulty gaining access to education, property credit and other resources as well as to political decision-making and are restricted by gender roles. This hampers their ability to take advantage of trade liberalisation.
The report, drafted by Hiltrud BREYER (Greens/EFA, DE) urges the Commission to try to introduce an action plan for gender mainstreaming in international trade policies and create a special fund in development cooperation policy to support women's access to credit, education and vocational training.
Finally, to raise the profile of gender issues in world trade negotiations the report calls for there to be more women in trade ministries and international organisations. Rapporteur Hiltrud BREYER Verts/ALE DE A6-0254/2006 Perspectives of women in international trade Procedure : own-initiative

Regional policy
Strategic guidelines on cohesion
2006-09-21 - 16:42
Constanze Angela KREHL (PES, DE) for the Regional Development Committee will be recommending that Parliament grant its assent to the strategic guidelines on cohesion. On 18 May 2006, the Parliament adopted an own-initiative report (see link) on the strategic guidelines calling that future cohesion policy must help to meet the challenges posed by the most recent enlargement of the EU by helping to reduce regional disparities and fostering a society based on full employment, equal opportunities, inclusion, and social cohesion.
The Community Strategic Guidelines contain the principles and priorities of cohesion policy and suggest ways the European regions can take full advantage of the € 308 billion that has been made available for national and regional aid programmes over the next seven years. National authorities will use the guidelines as the basis for drafting their national strategic priorities and planning for 2007-2013, the so called National Strategic Reference Frameworks (NSRFs). According to the guidelines and in line with the renewed Lisbon strategy, programmes co-financed through the cohesion policy should seek to target resources on the following three priorities:
improving the attractiveness of Member States, regions and cities by improving accessibility, ensuring adequate quality and level of services, and preserving their environmental potential;
encouraging innovation, entrepreneurship and the growth of the knowledge economy by research and innovation capacities, including new information and communication technologies; and
creating more and better jobs by attracting more people into employment entrepreneurial activity, improving adaptability of workers and enterprises and increasing investment in human capital.
The Guidelines seek to provide a balance between the twin objectives of the growth and jobs agenda and territorial cohesion. Thus, it is recognised that there can be no question of a “one size fits all” approach to the new programmes.

Agriculture
Quality and certification of organic farming
2006-09-21 - 16:42
Parliament is being consulted on a draft Council regulation on the quality and certification of imported organic farm products. This is only an interim step before a completely new regulation is introduced. The Agriculture Committee sees the Commission proposal as a step in the right direction. It would tighten up procedures for the recognition of imported organic products so as to introduce standard inspections and certification EU-wide. However, the committee puts forward a number of non-binding amendments designed to promote organic farming in non-EU countries and preserve standards for imports in the intervening period before a new regulation.
MEPs believe that at present national procedures for import licences vary too much, making life difficult for non-EU exporters, and that there are too many cases of fraud. They call for clearer rules and a Community databank on imports, names of importers, producers and control bodies. They would also like to see better targeted inspection procedures, with an analysis of risk points in the production-export-import chain and random checks by the Commission on control bodies at such risk points.

Development and cooperation
The media and development
2006-09-21 - 16:42
Manolis MAVROMMATIS (EPP-ED, GR) for the Development Committee will be tabling an own-initiative report on the media and development. The committee calls on the European Union, Member States, acceding countries and the ACP countries to involve civil society organisations, including private enterprises, and particularly the media, in attaining their objectives for development. The committee recognises the important role of the media on government transparency, accountability and the public scrutiny of decision-makers in power, by highlighting policy failures, maladministration by public officials, corruption in the judiciary and scandals in the corporate sector. MEPs in the committee consider it important to further improve the dialogue and consultation between local non-State players and national authorities in developing countries in crucial areas, such as the media, in order to strengthen the abilities, accountability and transparency of public institutions and to increase public sector effectiveness in applying the principles of respect for human rights and good governance and in fighting corruption.
The committee considers that funding programmes with a mandate on and for development should include a more systematic integration of State-independent media. The report calls for women’s effective access to the media in order to achieve an increase in their participation in production and to contribute to economic development.
MEPs in the committee underline the role of the media in the education of people in developing countries, especially in terms of health care (sexual and reproductive health, malaria, etc.), employment, agriculture, trade, and environmental sustainability, such as the BBC World Service Trust for the use of communications for development.
The committee understands the problem of the “ personalisation ” of news, which can manipulate both the audience of developing countries and the western public, and encourages the organisations that provide training to journalists to give particular importance to the achievement of a minimum salary for people working in the media, which will make them less vulnerable to corruption.
MEPs in the committee stress the decisive role of the media in promoting the protection of human rights in developing countries and in raising public awareness in countries in the West and, by extension, increasing their contribution to humanitarian aid.
Finally, the committee calls on governments and public authorities throughout the world to end in particular the culture of impunity regarding violence against journalists by investigating and punishing those responsible for attacks on media professionals, and by taking the necessary precautions that make it possible for journalists to continue to provide citizens with the essential knowledge and objective information that flow from a free and independent press.
