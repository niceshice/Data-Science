Election of the President of the European Parliament
Institutions
2007-02-21 - 17:01
On Tuesday 16 January 2007, MEPs elected Hans-Gert Poettering President of the European Parliament. He was elected after the first round of voting, with 450 votes in favour (or 65.31 per cent of the valid votes). The 61-year-old German Christian-Democrat will lead Parliament until the next European elections in June 2009. This background note covers the electoral procedure and the outcome of past elections.
Mr Poettering took over from Josep Borrell (PES, ES), who completed his term as President on Monday 15 January.
Following on from Mr Poettering's election, Parliament's 14 Vice-Presidents and 6 Quaestors were also elected on 16 January, by acclamation (same number of candidates as posts), at the first plenary session of 2007.
The Vice-Presidents are Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou (EPP-ED, GR), Alejo Vidal-Quadras (EPP-ED, ES), Gérard Onesta (Greens/EFA, FR), Edward McMillan-Scott (EPP-ED, UK), Mario Mauro (EPP-ED, IT), Miguel Angel Martinez Martinez (PES, ES), Luigi Cocilovo (ALDE, IT), Mechtild Rothe (PES, DE), L uisa MorgantiniI (EUL/NGL, IT), Pierre Moscovici (PES, FR), Manuel António Dos Santos (PES, PT), Diana Wallis (ALDE, UK ), Marek Siwiec (PES, PL), and Adam Bielan (UEN, PL). The order of precedence shown here was established by a secret ballot.
The Quaestors (who deal with administrative and financial matters directly affecting Members), are J ames NICHOLSON (EPP-ED, UK), Astrid LULLING, (EPP-ED, LU), Mia DE VITS (PES, BE), Ingo FRIEDRICH (EPP-ED, DE), Szabolcs FAZAKAS (PES, HU), and Jan MULDER (ALDE, NL).
Formal details of the election procedures can be found in the Parliament's Rules of Procedure - there is a link to these rules at the end of each of the following sections.

Nomination of candidates for the presidency and election procedure
Candidates for the presidency may be proposed either by a political group or by a minimum of forty MEPs (Rule 12). All the duly nominated candidates will address MEPs before voting begins. The election is held by secret ballot. Unusually for a vote in the European Parliament, MEPs take part by marking their preferred candidate on a paper ballot and placing it in a ballot box. The process is overseen by eight tellers, chosen by lot from among the MEPs.
To be elected, a candidate must win an absolute majority of the valid votes cast, i.e. 50 per cent plus one (Rule 13). Blank or spoiled ballots do not count in calculating the majority required.
If no candidate is elected at the first ballot, the same or other candidates can be nominated for a second round of voting under the same conditions. This can be repeated at a third round if necessary, again with the same rules.
If no-one is elected at the third ballot, the two highest scoring candidates in that round proceed to a fourth ballot, where the one receiving the greater number of votes wins. (Should there be a tie at this stage, the older candidate is declared the winner).
The newly elected President then takes the chair and is entitled to make an opening address (though he or she can also choose to make just a few short remarks, with a more formal speech at a later date), before presiding over the election of the Vice-Presidents and Quaestors. European Parliament Rules of Procedure
Duties of the President
The President chairs the plenary sittings of Parliament, the Conference of the Presidents of Political Groups and the Bureau of Parliament (made up of the President and the 14 Vice-Presidents, plus the Quaestors in an advisory capacity).
The President is responsible for the application of the Rules of Procedure of Parliament, and, to this end, oversees all the activities of Parliament and its bodies.
The President represents Parliament in all legal matters.
The President addresses the European Council prior to each of its meetings, stating Parliament's viewpoint on the subjects on the agenda in the framework of a debate with the heads of state and government.
The President represents Parliament in its international relations, and, in this connection, undertakes official visits within and outside the EU.
The President signs the EU budget into being following Parliament's vote on it at second reading. During the procedure, the President chairs the EP/Council conciliation delegations.
The President may, under the codecision procedure, chair the EP/Council conciliation committee. Jointly with the President-in-Office of the Council, the President signs all legislative acts adopted by codecision.
When an Intergovernmental Conference is held for the reform of the Treaties, the President takes part in the meetings of the government representatives where these are organised at ministerial level. European Parliament Rules of Procedure
Vice-Presidents and Quaestors
Candidates for the posts of Vice-President and Quaestor can also be made either by a political group or by at least 40 Members. The Vice-Presidential election is also held using a paper-based secret ballot, with a single ballot paper. Candidates must obtain the support of an absolute majority of those casting valid ballots, with a second round held under the same conditions if all 14 posts are not filled on the first round. A third round can then be held if there are still vacancies, at which point a relative majority is enough for election to one of the remaining positions. The order in which candidates are elected determines the order of precedence (Rule 14). If the number of candidates proposed is the same as the number of positions to be filled - fourteen - then they will be elected by acclamation, with a vote held simply to determine the order of precedence. A similar procedure is followed for the election of the Quaestors (Rule 15).
Vice-Presidents can replace the President in performing his duties when necessary, including chairing plenary sittings. (Rule 20) They are also members of the Bureau, the body responsible for all administrative, staff and organisational matters of the Parliament. The Quaestors deal with administrative matters directly affecting MEPs themselves. (Rule 25). For the two and a half years to come, Parliament will have six Quaestors, as opposed to the normal five, reflecting the temporarily larger number of MEPs following the accession of Romania and Bulgaria.
