Monday opening: Sorrow for Haiti and executed Briton in China
Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek opens the session. Strasbourg, 18 January. At the start of this week's Strasbourg session of the European Parliament, EP President Jerzy Buzek expressed sorrow at the situation in Haiti and at the execution of a British citizen in China.
"Today my thoughts are with the people of Haiti affected by the great tragedy of the earthquake" Mr Buzek told the House. Individual countries of Europe and the whole Union have pledged substantial financial assistance and 150 EU police officers are being sent. The President also said "It is with great sadness that I must inform you that Ms Pilar Juarez Boal, deputy director of the EU Delegation in Haiti, is still believed to be missing". Ms Juarez Boal previously worked at Parliament.
Mr Buzek voiced regret at the execution in China of Akmal'a Shaikh'a, a British citizen. He added "The European Parliament has always condemned and condemns the death penalty and will continue its efforts to achieve a moratorium on executions".
With the EP having received no official information yet about the result of the first round of presidential elections in Ukraine, Mr Buzek said he hoped they had been conducted fairly and that the same would apply to the second round.
From 1 January, Spain took over the Presidency of the EU Council. Mr Buzek looked forward to seeing the new Presidency achieve its objectives under the Lisbon Treaty.
Agenda changes
The House decided on the following agenda changes:
The debate on Haiti will now be the first item on Tuesday afternoon, instead of Thursday, and will include a statement by the High Representative for Foreign Affairs. The debate on Tunisia is moved from Tuesday to Thursday morning and will open with a statement by the Commission. Parliament will vote on a resolution on this topic at its February Strasbourg session.
Tuesday's oral question on the EU-South Korea free trade agreement is moved to the February Strasbourg session. The debate on the Joly report on the second revision of the ACP-EU partnership will be held as the first item on Tuesday evening of this week, at 9pm, to enable Commissioner Karel de Gucht to take part.

The House rejected a request by the EFD group to add to the agenda a vote on the issue of subsidiarity, relating notably to the question of crucifixes in Italian schools. Parliament had held a debate on this subject in December but the EP political group leaders subsequently decided not to have a vote on a resolution.

Haiti: fast aid delivery and long-term reconstruction needed
EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton pledged to coordinate help for Haiti with the UN and Washington.
MEPs underlined the necessity that the aid the EU pledged should be delivered as soon as possible and that there is a solid commitment towards reconstruction. In her first statement to Parliament, Lady Ashton, the EU's High Representative, said "our goal is to ease suffering and our commitment to rebuild is long-term".
"I asked for this debate to update you on this massive political and humanitarian disaster", Catherine Ashton said to Parliament. Foreign Affairs Ministers agreed yesterday to commit 122 million Euros in humanitarian assistance and 100 million Euros for non-humanitarian aid in an extraordinary session. The financial contribution from the EU instruments to finance the long-term response will amount to 200 million Euros.
"It is a big response in a short time. Finding money will be less difficult than to get it there", said Catherine Ashton who also indicated that the Council will again look at Haiti Monday 25 January and is likely to decide to deploy a contingent of the European Gendarmerie Force to Port-au-Prince.
"The EU has responded quickly but we have resisted the urge to travel there", she told MEPs in line with the advice of the UN Secretary General. She added that she herself will travel to the US this week to coordinate efforts with the UN and the US administration.
Commissioner de Gucht: "Rescuing a country"
"It is not only about rescuing human lives, but rescuing a country as a whole", said Karel De Gucht, Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid. He pointed out, members of international organizations had also fell victim to the catastrophe, which made it more difficult to organize aid on the spot. Mr De Gucht added that urgent medical, technical and logistic help were needed to avoid further risks such as the outbreak of cholera.
The Commission allocates €130 Million humanitarian aid out of which €77 Million is "fresh money", he said. For long-term reconstruction aid, €200 Million is foreseen, and it has to be seen with the member states, whether this amount could be increased, stressed Mr De Gucht. He announced the next day he would travel to the region and visit Haiti and the neighbouring Dominican Republic.
Group speakers
Gay Mitchell, an Irish MEP for the centre right European People's Party, welcomed the fact that after Commissioner's de Gucht visit to Haiti and the Dominican Republic, the latter will brief next week (Monday, 25 January) the European Parliament's Development Committee. As the EU as a whole is the biggest humanitarian aid donor "the EU has to be more visible on the ground", suggesting the possible presence of EU battle groups for example. He also drew attention to the underlying problem of Haiti, namely poverty and called for tackling poverty in the long-term in this country.
British MEP Linda McAvan for the Socialists and Democrats group, referring to money-raising initiatives, said, the "public have been responding magnificently", and EU should also increase its support. She underlined that an international conference on Haiti should address the debt problem. She asked, whether the €100 Million IMF loan to Haiti could be converted in grant.
Irish Liberal (ALDE) group member Liam Aylward said that "the situation in Haiti is the worst humanitarian disaster in decades". "Bureaucratic problems are clearly hampering aid distribution, which has serious consequences on the ground. Clear leadership and coordinated assistance on the ground are needed. Long term development of Haiti must become a priority. When the cameras have gone the EU will have to continue with the work of developing and re-building the country".
French MEP Eva Joly for the Greens/EFA, Chair of the Committee on Development, underlined the unprecedented scale of the tragedy which "exceeds other disasters". "International institutions have imposed wrong policies on Haiti and we have weakened the social fabric in the country". "What we need to do is to provide as much support as we can but we have to call into question our own development methods". She concluded by comparing the 150 billion dollars US Banks got to the volume of aid planned for now.
British MEP Nirj Deva (European Conservatives and Reformists) did not question that funds will be arriving to Haiti. He recalled that during each natural disaster "we are caught short with infrastructure". "We need to be able to supply infrastructure", he added, calling for the establishment of a global rescue operation that can provide except the immediate relief needs the restoration of the destroyed infrastructure on the ground.
For the leftist (GUE/NGL) French MEP Patrick Le Hyaric said EU assistance had to be increased and the world banking system should also contribute to helping Haiti. According to Mr Le Hyaric, EP should announce its support for the unconditional cancellation of Haiti's debt. He added, US should not be allowed "to occupy Haiti", under the pretext of aid.
Fiorello Provera, an Italian for the European Freedom and Democracy group expressed his "profound solidarity with the victims of this terrible earthquake. In situations like this, where buildings and infrastructure have been destroyed on a large scale and thousands of deaths, aid is essential. However it is hard to bring aid without minimum requirements of public safety being in place for aid workers. Collecting necessary funds and distributing them properly is essential. All too often both private and public donors have seen their generosity betrayed. A proper system of control must be in place to prevent a scattergun approach to distributing aid and possible theft of funds in country with high levels of corruption and a weak government".
British non-attached MEP Nick Griffin said that "the horror of Haiti is shocking, and it is only human to feel compassion for the innocent victims of this natural disaster. All here are well paid - and can afford to give. I will give my attendance allowance for today, if every other British MEPs will do the same. The death toll in Haiti is shocking, but this winter more than 50,000 pensioners in Britain alone will die premature deaths because of the cold and the cost of heating".
Concluding statement by Catherine Ashton
"The fact that we work closely and collaboratively with the US authorities is also an important part of what we do now and in the future", said Ms Ashton in reply to questions about aid visibility and co-ordination under the auspices of the United States.
"Let us not forget that for the very first time, Council and Commission mobilized to respond to the present crisis", she underlined, welcoming the fact that 21 Member States had responded with concrete commitments on search and rescue teams, mobile hospitals and water purification units.
To MEPS who criticised her for not visiting Haiti, she said: "I had nothing to contribute on the ground other than taking up valuable space when planes were unable to land because of the state of the airfield (...) I am not a doctor, nor a fire fighter. My place was to bring together co-ordination at EU level and with the UN".
Acknowledging the difficulty of getting the aid through to the people who need it she said "did it work well? Yes. Am I satisfied? No".
Iran debate: MEPs condemn regime's nuclear programme & dissent crackdown
MEPs condemned the crackdown on protestors and called for human rights to be respected In a charged and emotive debate on Iran the regime's nuclear programme and the crackdown on political dissent drew criticism from all sides. Opening the debate the EU's new foreign affairs chief, Catherine Ashton, told the House in Strasbourg that Iran's nuclear programme was in breach of its international obligations. Many Members made the crucial distinction between the regime of President Ahmedinejad and the people of Iran.
Tehran's continued defiance of the world community over its nuclear programme was a major topic in the debate on Tuesday 19 January in Strasbourg.
Iran "still producing enriched uranium"
"Iran does not respect its international obligations" was the clear statement to the House on the regime's nuclear ambitions by EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Catherine Ashton . She told the House that she regretted Iran had not agreed to engage in meaningful talks to broker a settlement either with the European Union or the wider international community.
For the Parliament's largest bloc, the centre right European People's Party MEP José Ignacio Salafranca told the House that Iran "was still producing enriched uranium". He asked how long Europe "could keep patience with such behaviour?" and whether the time had come for extra punitive measures against the Iranian regime.
"Ruthless nuclear ambitions of Ahmedinejad"
Socialist MEP Roberto Gualtieri , speaking for the second largest group, said that he believed Tehran had the right to a peaceful civilian nuclear programme but that enriching uranium (with thus the possibility of weaponisation), demanded a response from the international community. The Italian favoured sanctions alongside dialogue with the regime.
British MEP, Charles Tannock , of the European Conservatives and Reformists group launched a scathing attacking on what he called "the ruthless nuclear ambitions of Ahmedinejad". This was backed up by Dutchman Bas Belder of the European Freedom and Democracy bloc who warned: "Iran's nuclear programme poses very serious security threats and the international community should act accordingly".
"Arbitrary arrests not acceptable"
Turning to the turmoil and political protest in Iran since last year's disputed elections, MEPs from all sides paid tribute to the courage and vibrancy of the protestors and condemned the regime's repression of protest and dissent.
For the Liberal group, the third largest group, Dutch MEP Marietje Schaake said that "I won my elections by criticising the government of my country" but that "young women doing the same in Iran would be arrested, beaten and raped". She called on Europe to take a tougher leading role.
Catherine Ashton paid tribute to the "vibrant and active" youth of Iran and said its women were highly educated and there was a "capacity for public debate".
However, she said that many viewed the Presidential election last year as fraudulent and that the regime must respect civil and political rights. She went on to say that "the use of violence against demonstrators exercising their right of expression and arbitrary arrests are not acceptable".
"Regime and people not the same thing"
For the Greens/EFA Barbara Lochbihler, the head of Parliament's delegation to Iran (which was recently blocked from visiting), pointed out that many European countries were supplying technology that allowed the censorship of protests in Tehran. She also said that the question had to be asked "whether sanctions will lead to a change in government or only harm society?"
Charles Tannock called on the House to support "the brave young opposition" and said that "Iran's regime and the Iranian people are not the same thing".
The European Parliament will vote a resolution on Iran in February.

EU's Spanish Presidency kicks off: Recovery from crisis is the primary aim
Reducing EU energy dependency, promoting e-commerce among Member States, developing an electric car industry and improving university quality were the four priorities stressed by Spain's Prime Minister Zapatero in a debate on policy priorities for Spain's EU presidency. Political group leaders welcomed the plan to prioritise recovery from the economic crisis, but not all agreed on the specific measures proposed.
"The EU needs to bet on itself", said Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, adding that the right response to the economic crisis must be the first goal. The President of the Council listed four priorities for his mandate. These were building "an energy common market", to help reduce EU energy dependence, creating a "digital internal market, to boost productivity and e-commerce, making industry more sustainable (including the electric car project) to combat climate change and investing in research and education, to enable Europe to become "a leading player".
Other priorities listed by Mr Zapatero included implementing new instruments under the Lisbon Treaty to make "citizens feel closer to EU institutions", such as the new citizens' right of initiative to propose legislation, and the need to fight domestic violence in Europe with a new legal measures to protect women and victims of gender violence. On the Haiti earthquake tragedy, he said "we are going to show what we can do as Europeans (...) in those parts of the world which are suffering the most (...). We are going to deliver a strong response to their needs for international aid".
Commission President José Manuel Barroso praised Spain's "long tradition of commitment to Europe" and advocated a "fundamental reworking of the EU economy" to achieve a "competitive, innovative and socially inclusive market economy". On Haiti, Mr Barroso stressed his "complete solidarity and desire to help the victims". The EU and its Member States have already committed €222 million to humanitarian aid and the Commission could mobilise a further €200 million in the long term to assist reconstruction, he said.
Joseph Daul (EPP, FR) welcomed Mr Zapatero's proposal for a new European economic governance structure, but added that his group could not agree with his apparent readiness to increase public deficits. "We need to support small and medium enterprises instead" and "I am not too sure whether you and your political family have realized whether your proposals are realistic", he added Mr Zapatero replied that "I strongly support the Stability Pact and promotion of fiscal balance". He promised that by 2013, Spain would get back on the 3% track by reducing its public deficit. . Mr Daul also took the opportunity to ask Mr Zapatero to engage in a spontaneous questions and answers session with MEPs during his six-month presidency.
Martin Schulz (S&D, DE) congratulated Mr Zapatero on Spain's "promising" agenda. "Mr Zapatero has set out an ambitious programme. You have named the four essential priorities", he said, adding that Mr Zapatero's proposed model of economic governance was the "right approach", which would "take Europe into a new phase". Europe's challenges "cannot be solved by one summit after another. We need Member States to actually implement the proposals made", he stressed, calling for more control and supervision of the financial industry.
Also on economic governance, Guy Verhofstadt (ALDE, BE) stressed that "the fundamental question is whether the Council and the Member States are willing to change the failed method of "open co-ordination", which, he said, had simply led to the publication of ever more documents. On climate change, Mr Verhostadt advocated "a different strategy, post-Copenhagen.. Our approach there failed. We must have a plan based on three elements: A Mr or Mrs Climate Change, a trilateral agreement with the US and China, and a shared common interest with the US such as the emissions trading scheme".
In reply, Mr Zapatero stressed the need to have in place a sanctions system if the EU really means to implement a new economic development strategy. "Everything we've done together works: Euro, Stability Pact, Internal Market", he said.
Daniel Cohn-Bendit (Greens/EFA, FR) asked Mr Zapatero to take up Commissioner Michel Barnier's idea of a Europe Aid civil protection force. With such a force, "Europeans would have been better deployed in Haïti", he added.. On the economic situation, Cohn-Bendit warned that economic growth can also be very destructive for climate: "if we don't discuss the kind of growth we want at EU level, we will make the same mistakes", he said. He recommended "energy efficiency and saving" to reduce energy dependency. He urged the EU to increase its energy savings goal to 30% forthwith and set up a major European Tram project to create jobs and promote green mobility. "Yes, electric cars should only be one more element of a sustainable growth based on the green economy", Mr Zapatero agreed.
Timothy Kirkhope (ECR, UK) praised Spain's contribution to the EU. But "establishing compulsory economic policies with sanctions", instead of co-ordinating them, "is not relevant to the current situation", he argued. Mr Zapatero replied that the intention was not to increase control over Member States but rather "to have more competitiveness". He explained that 27 separate national systems would not work on the world stage, and attempts to make them do so risked undermining the EU's global competitiveness.
Mr Kirkhope also urged Mr Zapatero to devote more energy to fighting climate change and "the illegitimate and brutal government of Iran".
Willy Meyer (GUE/NGL, ES) said "your programme does not sort out the fundamental problems of the economy. More intervention is needed", especially in the financial sector. "Everything you offer is old-hat. You're basically dismantling the European social model", he said. Mr Meyer objected to Mr Zapatera's plan to hold a summit with Morocco under the Spanish presidency because Morocco does not recognise Western Sahara's right to self-determination. He also said that Israel should respect the human rights provisions of the Association agreement. In his replies, Mr Zapatera reiterated his intention to hold the meeting with Morocco.
Marta Andreasen (EFD, UK) raised the complaints of British citizens who had lost their homes in Spain due to alleged abuses of planning regulations. "Three reports have been approved by Parliament but no specific action has been taken", she said.

Nikiforos Diamandouros re-elected as European Ombudsman
Nikiforos Diamandouros was elected in January 2003 Nikiforos Diamandouros (Greece) was re-elected European Ombudsman on Wednesday. Mr Diamandouros, who has held the position since 2003, was backed by 340 MEPs in a secret plenary vote. The European Ombudsman investigates citizens' complaints of maladministration by EU institutions. The other candidates, Pierre-Yves Monette (Belgium) and Vittorio Bottoli (Italy), received 289 and 19 votes respectively.
Mr Diamandouros' priorities for his mandate, which runs until 2014, are to ensure that EU delivers the benefits for citizens promised by the Lisbon Treaty, strengthen constructive dialogue with EU institutions and bodies and improve service to citizens, by using resources more efficiently. He also plans to step up co-operation with national and regional ombudsmen and communicate more effectively with citizens.
The Ombudsman election procedure is supervised by the Petitions Committee, which checks that applications are admissible and that candidates fulfil all the conditions required for the post. EU rules establish, inter alia, that the Ombudsman must "offer every guarantee of independence". The Ombudsman is elected by Parliament in a secret vote at the start of each parliamentary term.
The role of the Ombudsman, established in 1995, is to investigate cases of maladministration by the EU institutions, including lack of transparency and refusal to provide information or documents.
Nikiforos Diamandouros was elected in January 2003 for the remainder of the 1999-2004 legislative term, following the retirement of the first European Ombudsman, Jacob Söderman. He was re-elected in January 2005.

A (Copenhagen) Climate of disappointment
A snow-covered "Cool Globe" in Copenhagen, 19 December 19, 2009 © Belga/Afp/A.Dennis A gloomy inquest rather than angry recriminations marked the mood when the European Parliament debated the Copenhagen climate conference Wednesday (20 January). There were a few rays of optimism with Jo Leinen MEP, the head of the EP delegation to Copenhagen saying the EU needed to find "strategic partners" in the run up to the next climate conference in November. Others welcomed progress on financing as developed countries committed $30 billion to help developing states adapt.
The word "disappointing" cropped up repeatedly during the afternoon's debate although many said the EU should continue to move forward and not become dependent on the commitments of others. Dutch EPP Member Corien Wortmann-Kool, who attended the conference, said that the EU's "30% must still stand". She went on to appeal for people not to lose hope: "We have to review our strategy but we still have to cling to our ambition."
French ALDE Member Corinne Lepage said, Europe had "to maintain our position as world leaders". She called for "a robust and ambitious strategy to move the economy in a more energy efficient direction."
At the conference there was movement on climate as all developed countries (including the US) agreed to work within the same international framework. The Copenhagen Accord, which is not legally binding, also includes a " method for verifying " developing nations' emission reductions. In addition developed countries committed themselves to pay $30 billion between 2010 and 2012 in climate support to developing countries.
However, the conference failed to come up with any legally binding targets.
Speaking in the plenary Finnish Green Satu Hassi ( Greens/EFA ) said for the first time in a UN document there is a reference to 2 degree limit. However, she also said "it is quite clear that there are some who wanted to sabotage the agreement" and called for a reform to the UN decision making system.
The EP is voting on the resolution of the results on COP15 in February's plenary. The next UN summit on climate change takes place in Mexico 29 November - 10 December 2010. The end of 2012 is the deadline for the ratification of a new global climate deal.

Strasbourg Parliamentary Session: 10 things you may have missed
Former Polish Premier Jerzy Buzek became Parliament's first President from Central and Eastern Europe in July 2009. Buzek greets people behind the dais in the Hemicycle Chamber as he opens the session. Monday, 18 January. The President chairs the 12 Parliamentary sessions in Strasbourg each year and those in Brussels. Ushering in a new political era: Buzek welcomes Spanish PM José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero as Spain's EU presidency begins. If MEPs speak over their allotted time his job is to bring down the gavel. Spanish PM Zapatero, President Buzek and EC President Barroso share a joke in Strasbourg on Wednesday. Press room #1: The President arrives for a press conference on the forced departure of the Bulgarian Commissioner. Press room #2: Interpretation for the press is available so nothing is "lost in translation". The last of the first round of hearings of Commissioners-designate and the withdrawal of Bulgaria's candidate provided a buzz at the start of the first plenary session of 2010 in Strasbourg. Other debates included the earthquake in Haiti, Spain's EU Presidency priorities, Iran and re-election of Greek Nikiforos Diamandouros as EU Ombudsman. Here is the Strasbourg week in 10 points.
Earthquake in Haiti: President Buzek opened the January session by expressing sorrow and sympathy for the people of Haiti. EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Commissioner-designate Catherine Ashton briefed MEPs on the situation in Haiti and EU commitments for aid. MEPs pleaded for fast aid delivery and long-term reconstruction in one of the world's poorest countries.
Commissioner hearings : Four hearings of commissioners-designate took place in Strasbourg. News of Bulgarian candidate, Rumiana Jeleva's decision to drop out of the running came on Tuesday. "The democratic process is working," Jerzy Buzek said. An hearing for the new Bulgarian candidate is scheduled for 3 February.
Spanish Presidency : "The EU needs to bet on itself," Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero told MEPs. The economic crisis, energy common market and combating climate change were among the main priorities he mentioned for the Spanish presidency of the Council during the first half of 2010.
Situation in Iran: On Tuesday MEPs discussed the situation in Iran. The EU's new foreign affairs chief Lady Ashton said Iran's nuclear programme is in breach of its international obligations. MEPs were concerned about the effect of sanctions for its people and their discontentment about Iran's "use of violence against demonstrators and arbitrary arrests". MEPs also discussed Iraq ahead of parliamentary elections in March, the worrying news on Yemen being a potential training centre for Al-Qaida militants and the human rights situation in Tunisia following the landslide victory of President Ben Ali for a fifth consecutive term.
Copenhagen climate summit: MEPs expressed huge disappointment about the failure of the December Copenhagen climate change summit to reach an ambitious binding deal.
Human trafficking: "Slavery was abolished over 200 years ago in Europe but thousands of people are being sold today," Anna Hedh told us. She said the Swedish model of criminalising the purchase of sexual services could be an EU-wide solution. It's a sensitive issue, but Sweden has fewer problems with trafficking than the rest of the EU, the MEP added.
Ombudsman re-election : Parliament re-elected Greece's Nikiforos Diamandouros as the EU Ombudsman until 2014.
SWIFT: "Irritation," "a kamikaze action," "unacceptable" - how MEPs described the secretive process leading to an interim EU-US agreement on the transfer of SWIFT banking data to combat terrorism.
President Jerzy Buzek: To give you a peep behind the scenes in the EP, our photographer focused on the work of Mr Buzek this week, from the opening of the session with a speech on the dramatic situation Haiti and a meeting with Spanish PM Zapatero.
Twitter-Parliament: 140 characters are more than enough to get a feel for the hearings as political groups and MEPs tweeted their reactions. Also getting in on the action is Mr Buzek who launches his own twitter feed Thursday afternoon.

MEPs raise spectre of people trafficking: Europe's modern slavery
Anna Hedh MEP on people trafficking: "More than 80% of the victims are women". In modern Europe there exists a new type of slavery that involves the trafficking of people for sexual and labour slavery. Europol have said the problem did not decrease last year and that 80% of its victims are women. This Tuesday (19 January), Swedish Socialist MEP Anna Hedh and Conservative MEP Edit Bauer from Slovakia will raise the issue in Parliament. They will ask questions to the Council of Ministers and the European Commission to try and get anti-trafficking high on Europe's agenda.
Why are you raising this issue now?
Trafficking is constantly increasing. Slavery was abolished over 200 years ago in Europe but thousands of people are being sold today. Trafficking includes sexual and labour exploitation, forced labour, domestic servitude and other forms of exploitation including the removal of organs. It is considered to be one of the most serious crimes worldwide. More than 80% of the victims are women.
Last year the Commission suggested a framework for legislation against trafficking in human beings. But since the Lisbon Treaty was ratified, Parliament now has an equal say with ministers over this issue and we want the Commission to use a different legal framework. And this is why we are asking a question and handing in a resolution.
What has to be done to deal with the problem?
The Commission likes to talk about a different penalty rate but we also need a holistic approach in all policy making. For example, it involves migration. There must be harsh penalties. But we also need prevention and to get all EU members to deal with the question of demand. If there was no demand there would be no problem.
I would like to sell the Swedish model on the purchase of sexual services (under which the purchaser gets punished). It is sensitive but Sweden has fewer problems with trafficking than the rest of the EU.
What sanctions do you want for those involved in human trafficking?
There must be harsh penalties in order for it to work. The Commission has suggested three different levels and I think that the highest level they propose (12 years) should be the lowest. I think there must be a penalty of at least 10 years in prison. We are talking about a person who has bought and sold a human being.
Trafficking is one of the priorities of the EU Spanish presidency…
Yes, and this makes me happy. I hope that they will succeed with the discussions in the council because previously there have been different views, amongst other things about the levels of penalties. I hope the Spanish presidency will unite the council so that we get good legislation.
While we are talking people are being exploited and people are exploiting. Is there a risk that this will be only another directive and that nothing will change?
Yes. This is a big problem and it is very important to make sure that this is legislation that will allow us to put pressure on the member states.
We also need to educate the police and court personnel across the EU. In addition, victims must know that they are entitled to support when they have been exploited, so that they ask for help from the national authorities. Legal texts are often difficult to read and therefore it is important that the member states produce information campaigns to disseminate information for all citizens and victims.
