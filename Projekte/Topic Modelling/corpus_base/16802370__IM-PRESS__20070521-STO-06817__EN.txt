Guido Sacconi - chair of temporary climate change committee
Tuesday 22 May saw the first meeting of the Parliament's new temporary committee on climate change (CLIM). With cross-party membership of 60 MEPs one of its key roles will be to make proposals about the EU's policy on climate change. It will also coordinate the EP's position ahead of negotiations on a post-2012 climate policy framework and examine ways the EU can respond to climate change. The Committee will be chaired by Italian Socialist Guido Sacconi who spoke to us about his new role.
What do you expect to achieve as president of the committee during your one-year mandate?
Well, first of all, to strike a balance in an integrated and multidisciplinary way in a very complex matter with multi-implications...but most of all to promote both an active role for the EP, as a protagonist, supporting EU negotiators - Council and Commission - in the coming negotiation for Kyoto II/after 2012, and to work more closely with national Parliaments in mobilising Europe.
How will the EP ensure climate change remains at the core of the political agenda in coming years?
Since the situation is catastrophic, as clearly demonstrated, and also because we realise that the damage is starting to have a high social and economic cost, I think the subject will stay at the top of the political agenda...but it is important that we take action.
How much time do you think we have to act in order to achieve results?
As UN experts demonstrated in their last three preliminary reports, we are already late but we know that it is possible, even if it is very difficult, to invert the tendency. The next two years, 2007-2008, are politically decisive. If we do not reach an effective global agreement within this period, the situation will be really tragic. But I am confident, basically for two reasons: firstly, it has already been demonstrated how damaging it is at an economic level; and secondly, because new political room for manoeuvre has opened up, especially in the US with the new Democratic majority in Congress.
Every citizen can do something to contribute to reversing the trend, what can the EP do to reduce greenhouse gas emissions?
I will propose, among other things, organising a sort of inventory of best scientific practises and disseminate them, to demonstrate that even a small gesture can have an influence...everyone has to play his role...including the EP, for example by improving the heating system in the new buildings, using bio-construction material, creating a bi-fuel carpool (a "flexifuel" car fleet where vehicles can use several fuels), using less paper...we have to be a sort of a model, an example for all.
The committee will hold its next meeting on 7 June.
On 14 June we will publish an interview with the rapporteur for the temporary climate change committee - Karl Heinz Florenz of the EPP-ED Group.
