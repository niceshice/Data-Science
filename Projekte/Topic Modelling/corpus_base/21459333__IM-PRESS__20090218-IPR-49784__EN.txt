The European Parliament adopted a non-binding report giving green light to the amendment of the Convention on future multilateral co-operation in the North-East Atlantic Fisheries (NEAFC). The report was adopted with 615 votes in favour, 15 against and 11 abstentions.
The proposal aims to transpose into Community law the amendments to the Convention adopted by the NEAFC at its 23rd annual meeting in November 2004, allowing it to adopt recommendations establishing procedures for the settlement of disputes arising from the Convention. Given that the amendments made to the Convention "are likely to facilitate its application, in particular as regards the settlement of disputes, and that they also improve the sustainable management of fisheries resources", the rapporteur is in favour of the proposal for a decision.
