Parts of the intended Nord Stream pipeline Plans for a gas pipeline to link Russia and Germany passing through the Baltic Sea are the subject of a petition signed by almost 30,000 EU citizens. They were voicing concern about the threat this project could pose to the environment and about its compliance with EU law. MEPs on the Petitions Committee have drafted a report on thee issue and of their opinion of the petition. This will be sent to the plenary on Tuesday, 8 July.
The Nord Stream project comprises two parallel pipelines of 1200 km in length and an offshore service station. Petitioners point to a serious threat to biodiversity, habitats (pipeline traversing areas which are included in the Natura 2000 programme) and to the safety of shipping in the region. Another significant environmental risk factor indicated is the existence of approximately 80 000 tonnes of munitions and unexploded bombs dumped on the Baltic seabed which could be disturbed by the construction of the pipeline.
The report drawn up by the Petitions Committee makes a number of recommendations. Notably it calls for an independent environmental impact assessment to be commissioned and for the environmental impact of the construction process to be analysed.
It also calls on the Commission and the Council to assess whether the implementation of the project complies with Community and international law.
Finally, MEPs want an evaluation of the likely impact of the market caused by the possible completion of the Nord Stream pipeline, and if necessary to take measures to prevent Russian energy giant Gazprom from assuming a dominant role on the EU gas markets.
You can watch the debate live online on Tuesday morning.
