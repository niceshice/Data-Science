Europol reforms: MEPs criticize Council and demand democratic scrutiny
Police cooperation
2009-11-24 - 13:10
On Tuesday Parliament rejected four proposals, on Europol's analysis work files, the confidentiality of its information, its exchange of personal data with partners and its agreements with third countries, arguing that Europol rules should not be amended until the EP becomes a co-legislator in this area.
MEPs asked the Council to withdraw the proposals and to table new ones within six months, as the Lisbon Treaty, which gives the EP decision-taking powers in the area of police co-operation, enters into force on 1 December. The Justice and Home Affairs Council, which meets on 30 November, should decide whether or not to adopt the proposals.
"The rush of the Council is embarrassing" said Sophie in't Veld (ALDE, NL), rapporteur on the implementing rules governing Europol's relations with partners. On the proposal concerning Europol's analysis work files, Agustín Díaz De Mera García Consuegra (EPP, ES), said that the EP should be fully involved in decision making. James Nicholson (ECR, UK), on behalf of Timothy Kirkhope (ECR, UK), rapporteur on the rules on the confidentiality of Europol's information, asked the Council to withdraw the proposals and to table new ones within six months, after the Lisbon Treaty comes into force, with a new legal basis.
The proposals were rejected as follows on Tuesday:
Kirkhope (Rules on the confidentiality of Europol information): 605 votes against, 31 in favour and 7 abstentions.
In't Veld (Implementing rules governing Europol's relations with partners, including the exchange of personal data and classified information): 628 votes against, 13 in favour and 9 abstentions.
Agustín Díaz De Mera García Consuegra: (Implementing measures for Europol analysis work files): 640 votes against, 12 in favour and 10 abstentions.
Albrecht (List of third States and organisations for Europol agreements): 633 against, 17 in favour and 7 abstentions.
