Observers from Bulgaria and Romania
Enlargement
2005-11-24 - 17:26
Following the signature of the accession treaty with Bulgaria and Romania in Luxembourg on 25 April 2005, European Parliament President Josep Borrell welcomed 18 Observers from Bulgaria and 35 from Romania (53 in total) on 26 September 2005 in Strasbourg. It is conventional for countries acceding to the European Union to send Observers to the European Parliament in advance. The ten new Member States had Observers in the European Parliament before their enlargement on 1 May 2004.
During their first week in Strasbourg, the Observers took part in the discussions of the political groups, had meetings with European Parliament President Josep Borrell, Enlargement Commissioner, Olli Rehn, and European Parliament rapporteur for Romania - Pierre Moscovici (PSE, FR) and the European Parliament rapporteur for Bulgaria - Geoffrey Van Orden (EPP-ED, GB). The Romanian and Bulgarian observers said that their goal was to support and promote their countries' interests in the European Parliament and their main priority is to keep the target date for the EU membership of Bulgaria and Romania as 1st January of 2007.
European Parliament President Josep Borrell, during his address to MEPs on 26 September in Strasbourg said, "On behalf of us all, I am pleased to extend our most cordial welcome to the observers from Bulgaria and Romania who have already taken their seats here in the European Parliament. Their presence reminds us that the fifth enlargement of the European Union, which took place in May of last year, has remained incomplete, it will be only be complete with the conclusion of Romania's and Bulgaria's accession process.
In April 2005, the European Parliament gave its assent to the Accession Treaty with Bulgaria and Romania, which is now being ratified by the Member States.
We now hope that the target date for actual accession on 1 January 2007 will prevail. Dear Romanian and Bulgarian colleagues, we await your contributions to all our debates with interest and wish you all success in your parliamentary activity."

Why are the Observers in the European Parliament?
Welcoming ceremony for Observers The observers are here to make sure that the new MEPs who enter the European Parliament after the accession of the two countries can integrate as smoothly as possible. They come from the government and opposition parties and are selected within their national parliaments. As they do not have as many rights as the current MEPs, their main task is to get acquainted with the procedures and the working methods in the European Parliament and establish the necessary contacts within the political groups and committees. They will be able to play an important role in building relations at a parliamentary and political level between the European Union and their respective countries.
The number of observers is the same as the number of Members of the European Parliament each country will have after accession. While in the European Parliament, the Observers remain full Members of their own national Parliaments.
They have the right to attend plenary sittings, with access to the Chamber, but without the right to speak, vote or stand for election. The Observers are also able to participate in the work of the parliamentary committees and inter-parliamentary delegations to which they have been appointed by their political group, but without the right to vote or stand for election. The chairman of the body concerned may grant them the right to speak. Save if a committee decides otherwise, Observers may also attend, but not take part in, meetings of committees of which they are not members. The right to table texts for consideration by parliamentary bodies is reserved for Members of the European Parliament. Observers who wish to submit a text to a parliamentary body in whose work they are taking part must do so through the chairman of the body concerned. The Observers take part in the work of the political groups, in accordance with arrangements laid down by each group.
The term of office of an Observer will end when his/her country becomes a member of the European Union. When Bulgaria and Romania join the Union these Observers become full MPs for the interim period between the accession and the next European elections.
Bulgaria and Romania are expected to join the EU in 2007
The Romanian government submitted its application for EU membership on 22 June 1995. The Bulgarian government adopted a decision to apply for EU membership in December 1995. The Bulgarian National Assembly adopted a resolution for official application on 14 December 1995 and on 16 December 1995 during the European Council in Madrid Javier Solana received the application of the Republic of Bulgaria for official membership.
On 10 December 1995, the European Council in Helsinki decided to start negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania along with Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Malta.
The Commission published its first Regular Report on Romania's Progress towards Accession in October 1999. Regarding Bulgaria's progress towards accession, the Commission published its first Report in November 1998.
The European Council in Brussels in December 2003 stated: “Welcoming Bulgaria and Romania in January 2007 as members of the Union, if they are ready, is the common objective of the Union of 25... Bulgaria and Romania should continue energetically their preparations and make further progress on the ground, so that the accession negotiations can be brought to a successful conclusion in 2004 on the basis of own merits, and the Accession Treaty can be signed as soon as possible in 2005."
Bulgaria completed accession negotiations on all 31 chapters on June 15 2004 and Romania in December 2004.
After closure of the accession negotiations in December 2004 and signing of the Accession Treaty in April 2005, Romania and Bulgaria must live up to its accession commitments. This is an ambitious political and managerial challenge in the next months leading up to accession. Until accession, Romania and Bulgaria will be under the close scrutiny of the Commission, the Member States and the European Parliament. The agreement between Bulgaria, Romania and the EU includes the possibility of postponing Bulgaria's and Romania's accession by one year if the EU sees a "serious risk" of the countries being unable to implement the required reforms.
The European Parliament supported Bulgaria's and Romania's EU membership on 13 April 2005. The vote for Bulgaria was 522 in favour and 70 against, Romania ’s margin was a little less favourable, with 497 for and 93 against .
On 25 October this year, the European Commission adopted the 2005 Comprehensive Monitoring Report on Bulgaria's and Romania's preparations for EU accession. The Report shows that both countries have made good progress in their preparations and should be able to meet the requirements for EU membership on the envisaged date of accession which is 1 January 2007 provided they concentrate all efforts on reforms, with particular attention to their actual implementation. The Commission will continue to closely monitor their preparations. It will review the situation in April/May 2006 when it may recommend, if needed, the postponement of accession until 2008 should one or both countries be manifestly unprepared.
Presenting the report to MEPs Commissioner Rehn responsible for enlargement said: “Bulgaria and Romania have achieved significant progress so far in the preparations for accession. But, the jury is still out. In the months to come particular attention must be paid to actual implementation and enforcement of the reforms. The issues presented in our reports should be taken very seriously and used as an incentive for speeding up the reforms, if Bulgaria and Romania want to be ready for accession on 1 January 2007.”
Next spring, the Commission will review the situation of the two countries. It may then recommend, if needed, to postpone the accession of Bulgaria or Romania until 1 January 2008 if there is a serious risk of any of those states being manifestly unprepared to meet the requirements of membership by January 2007 in a number of important areas.

Ratification of the Accession Treaty
The Accession treaty, further to the assent of the European Parliament on 13 April, was signed in Luxembourg on 25 April 2005 by Bulgaria and Romania. From now on, Romania and Bulgaria are considered as “acceding States”, and as such are able to participate as an active observer in virtually all the committees and bodies of the EU. Depending on further progress in complying with the membership criteria, the objective is EU membership from 1 January 2007.
During the solemn signing ceremony at the Neuemuenster Abbey in Luxembourg Bulgaria was represented by President Georgi Parvanov, Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg, Foreign Minister Solomon Passy and Minister of European Affairs Meglena Kuneva.
Romania was represented by President Traian Basescu, Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu, Foreign Minister Mihai-Razvan Ungureanu and the Chief-negotiator Leonard Orban from the Ministry of European Integration.
The signature of the Treaty of Accession by Bulgaria and Romania has paved the way for the ratification procedures that will formalise their membership of the Union on 1 January 2007. This Treaty will enter into force on 1 January 2007, provided that all the instruments of ratification have been deposited before that date.
The Treaty is now being ratified by the Member States.
So far, the Treaty has been ratified by the Slovak Parliament (22 April 2005), the Czech Senate (16 September 2005), the Hungarian Parliament (26 September 2005), the Slovenian Parliament (30 September 2005), the Greek Parliament (2 November 2005) and the Estonian Parliament (16 November 2005).
