Alexander Milinkevich meets MEPs, Jan 2006
Alexander Milinkevich, 59 year old physicist and leader of Belarus's political opposition has been shortlisted as one of 3 finalists for the European Parliament's 2006 Sakharov prize for freedom of thought. The others are those who campaign for freedom of hostages in Colombia and Ghassan Tueni, who represents assassinated figures in Lebanon. In March Mr Milinkevich stood in Presidential elections against Alexander Lukashenko - the results of which were condemned by the EU and the US.
Mr Milinkevich was later jailed for 15 days protesting the result. President Lukashenko's supporters say the election this year gave him 82% of the vote with Mr Milinkevich getting just 6%. However, in the wake of the March poll monitors Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) condemned it as "severely flawed", whilst a delegation of MEPs were barred from entering Belarus prior to the poll.
After the election Parliament's President Josep Borrell said that persistent violations of the fundamental rights of the Belarusian people would not be without consequences. Following the elections, Mr Lukashenko and several leading ministers were banned from entering the EU.
Belarusian journalist honoured
In February this year Alexander Milinkevich came to meet MEPs and ask for their support - although he stressed that it was up to the Belarus people to change things themselves.
In September 2005 a resolution by the Parliament condemned the Belarus government for the closure in recent years of "several political parties, 22 newspapers and more than 50 pro-democracy NGOs...for criticising the President and his policies". This was the background to the awarding of the 2004 Sakharov prize to the Belarus Association of journalists.
