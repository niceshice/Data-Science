Nearly two thirds of the EU population favoured coordinated action by the EU countries to fight the economic crisis, but only 39% believed that, so far, this has happened sufficiently. In a poll taken from mid January to mid February, 81% of respondents said the financial crisis has important consequences for the European economy, while 58% said they already felt these consequences in their personal lives.
Over two thirds of EU citizens think that measures currently discussed at EU level such as stronger coordination of economic and financial policies and greater EU financial supervision are effective.
The EU was seen overall as more capable of dealing with the crisis than national governments; choosing between five options, 17% of respondents preferred the EU to deal with the crisis against 14% who preferred their national government to do so. But even more felt that the G8 was the most effective forum (25%). National variations were wide on this issue, however, with the EU considered least capable by respondents in the United Kingdom (6%), Sweden (8%) and Denmark (9%), while people in Greece, Cyprus and Poland had most confidence in the EU (28, 27 and 26% respectively). The G8 was considered most capable by respondents in the Netherlands, Germany and Sweden (36, 35 and 34% respectively) and least capable by people in Malta, Romania and Ireland (10, 11 and 12%).
Feelings on the benefits of the euro were mixed. Overall, 44% of respondents felt that the euro had mitigated negative effects whereas 39% felt it had not. But again national variations were wide: in Slovakia 66% felt that the euro had helped soften the blows, while in the UK, which is not part of the euro zone, only 27% felt so. Asked if their national currency would have provided better protection, views were evenly split in countries with the euro: 45% agreed and 45% did not. Here as well results varied widely from Portugal with 62% saying that the escudo would have helped better, to Slovakia with 72% feeling safer with the euro. In countries outside the eurozone, Hungarians would have preferred to have had the euro (61%), while only 17% of Bulgarians thought so.
