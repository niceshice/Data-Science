Children's rights are not a game!

The need to properly safeguard the rights of children was discussed at a hearing in Parliament on 17 April. MEPs, international organisations and NGO's came together to consider responses to a Communication from the Commission on a long term strategy on the rights of children. The hearing was told that poverty and violence are problems children face in the EU at present. Worldwide, 10 million children a year die from preventable diseases.
Although all EU member states have ratified a UN Convention on the rights of a child and explicitly recognise their rights they are not mentioned in the EU Treaties. UK Socialist Glenys Kinnock noted that "children are no additions, have their own rights but are often powerless, voiceless, seldom consulted". The point made by several speakers was that children have rights that need to be addressed now rather than always seeing them as "the future".
Worldwide, a staggering 126 million children under the age of 17 are believed to be engaged in hazardous work with 250,000 serving as child soldiers. However, the most depressing statistic was given by Marta Santos Pais from UNICEF who said that 40% of all births are not even registered. She said that "a child who isn't registered is a non person, not a member of society. That person cannot vote, not inherit, not get married, and not get a driving licence". She also said that 40,000 child deaths a day could be prevented by low cost immunisation against disease. Violence and sexual exploitation are two other dangers that children world wide are exposed to.
In the EU children face, poverty, social exclusion violence and racism. Children currently account for a fifth of the population. The hearing was told that they have needs which are not identical to adults.
In 2006 the European Commission launched a Communication which aimed to look at the whole issue of children's rights in the EU. Franco Frattini, the Commissioner in charge of the dossier said that "children should no longer be addressees of policies but protagonists".
Some of the objectives it proposes are as follows:
creating a European Forum for children (a first meeting is scheduled for June)
a single hotline for lost or kidnapped children
support the banking sector and credit cards companies to combat the use of credit cards for sites dedicated to child pornography,
involve children in the decision-making process,
information on children’s rights in a child-friendly manner,
continue and further enhance EU´s active role in international forums to promote the rights of the child.
Among the participants were two girls from Denmark and Romania. Roberta Angelilli, from the Union of Europe for the Nations Group, is preparing a report that will reflect Parliament's opinion on the issue.
