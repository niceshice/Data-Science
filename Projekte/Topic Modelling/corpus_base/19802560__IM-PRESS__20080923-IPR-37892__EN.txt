Parliament rejected a proposed joint resolution (from the EPP-ED, ALDE and UEN groups) on the European Parliament priorities for the European Commission Work and Legislative Programme 2009 with 102 votes in favour, 306 against and 207 abstentions. All individual group resolutions were also rejected by the House.
Among the more controversial issues were the votes on a proposed amendment calling on the Commission to bring forward a raft of proposals for new social legislation as well as an amendment underlining the importance of continuing the accession process with Croatia and Turkey in the expectation that both countries will in due course meet all the criteria for membership.
