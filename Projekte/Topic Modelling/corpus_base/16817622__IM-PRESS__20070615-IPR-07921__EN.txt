In adopting a joint resolution on the establishment of common international standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional weapons, MEPs calls on all 153 States which voted for the UN resolution, which included all the EU Member States, to send their submissions supporting an Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) to the UN Secretary General without further delay.
MEPs urge the Council to devise a programme of activities using various international fora, including NATO, the OSCE and the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, to encourage States to send in their submissions.
The House urges all States to emphasise in their submissions that the ATT should codify existing obligations under international law with respect to arms transfers, and especially those covering human rights and humanitarian law.
MEPs call upon all States, pending the adoption of an ATT, to take efficient measures to stop the irresponsible brokering and transportation of arms, ammunition and associated military and security equipment of all types, including components and dual-use items, as well as the transfer and licensing of foreign production of such equipment to parties subject to international arms embargoes or who persistently commit serious violations of international human rights law or international humanitarian law.
The House calls in this context on all Member States to transpose the provisions of the EU Common Position on Arms Brokering into national law in order to maximise the efficiency of efforts to halt irresponsible arms brokering.
MEPs categorically denounce trade in arms and ammunition in violation of United Nations Security Council arms embargoes and recognises that the transport of such goods primarily takes place by air.
Finally, the European Parliament calls upon EU Member States to enhance their cooperation with other States in this area. The House calls upon the competent international organisations and the appropriate regional organisations to recommend, in coordination with the air transport industry, appropriate preventive measures.
