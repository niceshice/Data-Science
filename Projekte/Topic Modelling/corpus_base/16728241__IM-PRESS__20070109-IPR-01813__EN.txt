At the midway point of a parliamentary term, MEPs can change committee
At the midway point of each parliamentary term, the composition of the twenty Parliamentary Committees and two sub-Committees can change. Parliament adopted the new composition which was based on a proposal from the Conference of Presidents. The new chairs and four vice-chairs of each committee were also elected. Below is a table highlighting the UK MEPs elected Chairs and Vice-Chairs to various committees and all UK MEPs by committee.
The constitutive meetings of the Parliamentary Committees took place on the evening of 31 January and the morning of 1 February when the new Chairs and four Vice-Chairs of each committee were elected.
