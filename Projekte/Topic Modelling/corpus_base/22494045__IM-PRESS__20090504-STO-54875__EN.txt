More about the globalisation fund MEPs debated an overhaul of Europe's communications network Tuesday morning. Measures such as making it easier to change phone companies and the right to access the internet are part of the plans being put to the vote Wednesday from noon. MEPs also debated a forthcoming employment summit in Prague aimed at tackling the growing the growing problem of Europe's jobless. MEPs also approved an almost total ban on the trade in seal products.
British Conservative Malcolm Harbour has steered one of the reports on the telecoms package through parliament. Speaking in the debate he commended it to the House saying the reforms would mean "an enabling and empowering of consumers." He dismissed fears that the reform can prevent access to the internet by telling fellow Members that "this reform is not restrictive in any way."
His counterpart, Socialist MEP Catherine Trautmann, who dealt with Electronic communications networks and services, said that "this is about giving consumers better services at better prices" and "this is a regulatory framework which will benefit everyone."
Ms Pilar del Castillo for the EPP-ED drafted the report on the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications: She told the House that "if there is one industry which can help us out of this economic crisis, than it's the one of information and communication technologies."
Socialist MEP Francisca Pleguezuelos who wrote Parliament's report on Frequency bands for mobile communications said: "We shouldn't forget in the EU electronic communications produce a turnover of EUR300 billion."
Rising unemployment in Europe
MEPs also debated the rising unemployment levels in Europe ahead of an intended employment summit in Prague next week. There was great concern for the rising levels.
Gabriele Stauner of the EPP-ED group - who drafted a report on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund explained that until 2012 the Fund will be reoriented to help address the problems of jobless workers hit by the economic crisis.
José Albino Silva Peneda - also for the EPP-ED group said that "unemployment is the most visible face of the crisis." He went on to tell the House that "the crisis cannot be an excuse to reduce our social protection levels."
Rosé wine saved
Late on Tuesday night the House debated controversial steps to overhaul the parts of the common agriculture policy relating to wine. In particular they were worried that at the end of April the ban on mixing white and red wine. It was deemed that this could destroy the rosé wine market and MEPs therefore asked the Commission to "postpone the contested decision."
