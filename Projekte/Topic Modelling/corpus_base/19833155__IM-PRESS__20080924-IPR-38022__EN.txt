In adopting a resolution on the annual debate on the progress made in 2007 in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ), the House calls on the European Council, the Council and the Commission to initiate the process of determining priorities for the forthcoming AFSJ multiannual programme for the period 2010-2014, on the basis of an ambitious and coherent approach and join the European Parliament in its dialogue with the national parliaments on the priorities for the period 2010-2014.
MEPs calls on the other EU institutions to agree with Parliament a list of texts/proposals that could or should be adopted as a matter of priority before the Treaty’s entry into force and, at any rate, before the end of the present term.
MEPs stress that the new Treaty, once ratified, will recognise Parliament’s role in the conclusion of international agreements concerning AFSJ policies. Parliament asks, in this context:
– to be consulted in good time on all agreements with third countries that will not have been concluded by 31 December 2008,
– to receive regular updates on the negotiations under way,
MEPs welcome the proposal for the completion of the anti-discrimination package and urges Council to act in the spirit of the Lisbon Treaty and incorporate Parliament's recommendations;
The House considers that, from now on, the national parliaments and civil society should be involved in a structured manner in drafting these legislative measures and in evaluating these policies in the Member States.
MEPs ask the Commission and the Council, with this aim in mind, to re-examine with Parliament the networks, agencies and instruments that would assess the impact of AFSJ policies and to aid closer interaction with European civil society.
The resolution was adopted with 488 votes in favour, 88 against and 19 abstentions.
