EP shows the way forward after the no votes in France and the Netherlands
Andrew Duff (Lib Dem) one of the MEPs representing the East of England in the European Parliament saw his report on the 'period of reflection' with his joint author Johannes Voggenhuber (a Green MEP from Austria) adopted on 19 January 2006 in Strasbourg. But questions remain, will there be a referendum in the UK, and what will it be on?
Following last year's No votes in the French and Dutch referendums on the EU Constitution, the June 2005 European Council decided to adopt a "period of reflection" so as to enable a broad public debate to take place in all Member States.
The debate in the UK
How far has the debate reached in the UK and who is contributing to it? Various think tanks and leading sectoral organisations have made statements or tried to assess how their memberships feel towards the Constitutional Treaty. It is not an easy issue to know how to approach. The following links to various organisations present a sample of varying views (in alphabetical order):

Vote in the European Parliament on the way forward
The report argues that no further enlargement, after Romania and Bulgaria, is possible on the basis of the Treaty of Nice and calls for a Constitution for 2009, to ensure a democratic and effective EU. MEP also stress the need of a broad public debate on the future of European integration guided by common topics and with clear political goals.
After four months of impassioned debate following the French and Dutch no votes, the EP launched a Europe-wide debate to find a solution to the deadlock. Responding to the decision by the European Council in June 2005 to set in train a period of dialogue or reflection, MEPs stressed the need to involve all European citizens in the process of building Europe's future. Members also criticised the Council and Commission for failing to ensure that the reflection period has a clear focus. By approving, by 385 in favour, 125 against and 51 abstentions , the report, MEPs want to ensure that the new debate delivers tangible results.
Different outcomes of the debate are envisaged in the report, from abandoning the constitutional project to continuing with ratification, from seeking to clarify the present text to complete re-drafting. Although Members agree that it is important not to pre-empt the outcome of such a debate, there were differences of views among the groups that supported the report. Richard Corbett (PES, UK), and Alexander STUBB (EPP-ED, FI), shadow rapporteurs for their groups, considered that a positive outcome of the debate would be to keep the current text, although only if accompanied by significant measures. Eventually, these measures could be declarations or extra protocols to be added to the constitutional Treaty. On the contrary, the two co-rapporteurs support the idea of keeping only the constitutional core of the current text and use it as a basis to substantially improve the Treaty. Finally, Members opted for the first alternative.
Format for the new public debate Members agree that, to increase public participation, the proposed European debate should be guided by common topics and have clear political goals. The Parliament wants to play a leading role in the debate. As part of the process, MEPs are calling for a number of conferences and meetings to be held as a way of advancing the debate on the future of the EU. These would be known as Parliamentary Forums and Citizens' Forums. Moreover, the EP Constitutional Affairs committee will prepare a series of 'European Papers' to be used as basis for discussion. Under the proposed schedule, the Parliamentary Forums, a number of conferences between national parliaments and the EP, would be held in Spring this year. The first forum is scheduled for 9 May 2006. These events would also provide an opportunity to hear reports from the French and Dutch parliaments about their suggestions for a way forward. At the same time, to ensure public participation, the EP asks to Member States to hold a large number of Citizens Forums, i.e. public meetings and media debates at national and local level. The two co-rapporteurs stressed that all these debates should be structured around specific topics to deliver clear results. They should involve political parties, employers' and employees' representatives, civil society, the academic community and the media. According to the approved report, the public is concerned more about the context, i.e. the EU's political role and policies, than the constitutional text itself. MEPs believe the main issues on which the debate should focus are: the integration process, the EU's global role, the European social and economic model, security and justice and the financing of the Union. Therefore the EP asks for the prolongation of the period of reflection. In fact, after taking into account the results of the debate, a clear decision on the way forward should be taken by second half of 2007. The European Parliament will monitor the whole process and summarise the proposals put forward during the debates.
But how will the questions on Europe's future be discussed and who will discuss them? The report suggested one way via a series of joint Parliamentary Forums (National and EP) during 2006-7. The Parliament will commission and publish 'European Papers' which will be used as the basis for the deliberations in the Fora.
The first Parliamentary Forum will be held on Europe Day - 9 May 2006, organised by the European Parliament and the Austrian and Finnish Parliaments in Brussels with the participation of all 25 National Parliaments, the European Parliament, the President of the Commission and Chancellor Sch√ºssel of Austria in order to make comprehensive recommendations to the June European Council on how to end the current impasse.
