EP takes strong line on long-term budget
The European Parliament took a firm grip of the EU's long-term budget on Wednesday, overwhelmingly rejecting the agreement reached by the heads of government in December and calling for negotiations over the level of the provisions for 2007-2013 as well as spending plans. MEPs were particularly critical of the €862 billion in funding agreed by leaders, which compares unfavourably with the €975 billion proposed by the Parliament in June.
MEPs reject the European Council’s common position in its current form, because it does not guarantee an EU budget enhancing prosperity, competitiveness, solidarity, cohesion and security in future, in compliance with policies already decided by the Council itself.
The agreement fails to fulfil commitments made towards the new Member States and does not provide for a sufficient and detailed flexibility mechanism, a firm commitment to undertake the review with a clear role for the European Parliament or sufficient accompanying measures for example to ensure better implementation and control of expenditure of funds in Member States.
The resolution was adopted with 541 in favour, 56 against and 76 abstentions.
Nevertheless, Parliament welcomes the fact that Council managed to come up with a position, which allow the opening of negotiations. The European Parliament wants a firm commitment that it will be involved in talks on the revision of the EU budget as well as an improved mechanism to come up with supplementary funds should the need arise, i.e. a new, better version of the so-called " flexibility instrument "
Talks will continue on Monday 23 January in a trialogue to be held in camera after the first meeting on 18 January between President Borrell, President Barroso and Chancellor Schüssel . The Commission is expected to hand in its draft inter-institutional agreement on the financial perspective in early February upon which parties will then negotiate. While there is no deadline as such for the completion of the negotiations, there is a shared willingness to wrap it up by this spring.
