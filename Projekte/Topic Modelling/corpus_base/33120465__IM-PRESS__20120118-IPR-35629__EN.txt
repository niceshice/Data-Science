The Charlemagne Youth Prize, which is jointly organised by the European Parliament and the International Charlemagne Prize Foundation in Aachen, is awarded to projects undertaken by people between 16 and 30 years old. The winning projects should serve as role models for young people living in Europe and offer practical examples of Europeans living together as one community. Youth exchange programmes, artistic and Internet projects with a European dimension are amongst the projects selected.
Total prize money of €10,000
The three winning projects will be awarded funding of €5,000, €3,000, and €2,000 respectively. They will also be invited to visit the European Parliament in the autumn.
The representatives of the national winning projects will not only be invited to partake at the Charlemagne Youth Prize award ceremony, they also will attend two days later the International Charlemagne Prize of the City of Aachen award ceremony during their four-day trip to Aachen.
2011 winners
In 2011, the UK online lifestyle magazine "Europe & Me" created by young Europeans for young Europeans in 2007 was awarded the first prize in the European Charlemagne Youth Prize competition. The second and third prize went to "Balkans Beyond Borders", a short-film project from Greece, and to the "Escena Erasmus Project" (Spain), a project addressed mainly to Erasmus students, encouraging cultural and linguistic exchanges, respectively.
