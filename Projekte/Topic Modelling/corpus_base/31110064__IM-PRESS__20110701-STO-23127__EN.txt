"Boneless with bones" - photo sent by Eduarda Vaz-Mourao "Very long life yogurt" sent by Mark Bishop "Diet water" Boneless meat "with bone", nuts that "may contain nuts" or, conversely, garlic sauce with no garlic…In the July plenary, Parliament voted to reign in the more "creative" kind of food labelling making it all clearer and easier to read. Sooner or later it would have happened, but in the meantime we asked our fans on Facebook to share with us the strangest, zaniest labels they have come across. Here is what they sent us (with some slight editing for language).
Strange labels…
"Once I bought 'Garlic Sauce', and tried it at home, it wasn't even garlic in taste" Mariusz wrote: He checked the label on the jar, and, "discovered by comparing ingredients, it was exact the composition of mayonnaise, but with many chemicals from group E. There wasn't even extract of natural garlic. It was all artificial". Naturally, "I felt cheated".
Sharon bought chicken only to read on the label that it was a "reformed chicken", although she isn’t sure what kind of reformation the poor bird had gone through…
Some of you uploaded pictures of your favourite labels, and we are grateful. Check out Eduarda's "boneless" steak "with bone".
Mark bought a pot of yoghurt that he might consider keeping for his grandchildren. It's probably a typo, or maybe some really good preservative has been discovered, but printed clearly on the side is the expiry date: "21 DEC 34".
…and hard questions
On a more serious note, Maruška , complained that sometimes "the labels say 100% 'something' and then you read the label and it actually has several ingredients". As she puts it, quite diplomatically: "I don't like it".
Some of you agreed with Geraldine that "the most important information is country of origin. All citizens have a RIGHT to know exactly where our food comes from and which farmers we are supporting each time we buy a product."
GMOs are, of course, a perennial worry and Wojtek asked, "Will consumers have the chance to know if the food they are eating contains GMOs"? In Europe, the answer is yes...Check the link below.
Indeed, after intense negotiations with EU governments Parliament overwhelmingly approved a series of rules concerning the information provided on food labels in its July plenary session, adding to an already long list of requirements that include clear labelling of GMOs. They include more precise and more legible data on specific substances like fats, salt and allergens and a clear indication of substitutes like vegetable "cheese". Read all about it by following the link below.
So, if everybody agrees with Mak that " food labels need to be written in clear, readable sized text, and all ingredients should be listed whether natural or artificial", it is now up to you....Read your labels!
