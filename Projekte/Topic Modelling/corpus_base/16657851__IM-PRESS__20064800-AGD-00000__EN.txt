The European Parliament will conduct a hearing with each of the Commissioners-designate on Monday 27 November.
On 1 January 2007 the Accession Treaty with Bulgaria and Romania will enter into force and they will join the European Union, bringing the number of Member States up to 27. The appointment of two nationals from Bulgaria and Romania to the European Commission will be an important sign of their integration into the European Union and – along with Bulgarian and Romanian members joining the European Parliament – will mark the beginning of the full participation of these two new Member States in the decision making process at European level. Before they are appointed, the European Parliament will conduct a hearing with each Commissioner designate followed by a formal vote of approval. The hearings will take place on 27 November 2006. The current 732 Members of European Parliament and the 53 national parliamentarians from Romania and Bulgaria who are currently observers at the EP, will have the chance to test the candidates’ qualifications. To prepare for the hearings, each candidate has been asked to reply to a written questionnaire. Based on the outcome of the hearings the European Parliament will proceed to a vote of approval at the December plenary session in Strasbourg. Only after Parliament's vote will the Council formally appoint the new Commissioners.
