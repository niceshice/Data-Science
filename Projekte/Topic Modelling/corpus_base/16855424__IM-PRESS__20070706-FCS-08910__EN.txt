During the first half of 2007, the Parliament has seen a multitude of issues raised both inside the Plenary and outside. Here we select a number of stories that have made headlines in the first part of the year. They range from the pressing issue of climate change to debates over civil liberties in the "war on terror" and women's rights. We have also followed the debates over the proposed draft Constitution for the European Union.
They form part of the 200 articles that have been published on the Parliament's website over the last six months. The aim of these is to explain the news and happenings at the European Parliament in the 22 official languages of the EU.

Climate: "if we continue... in 50 years we will need a 2nd planet"
The last few weeks have been crucial in the debate over climate change. On 10 January the European Commission outlined plans for a 20% cut in greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 compared to 1990 levels. Last week an international panel on climate change forecast global temperature rises between 1.8C and 4C by 2100. Two days earlier MEPs - who want a 30% cut in emissions - debated the issue in Brussels.
Growing energy consumption threatens environment It is clear that the carbon-hungry economies of the industrialised world must find alterative forms of energy if they wish to reduce CO2 emissions. How to achieve this was a crucial part of the debate. One option is the use of nuclear fuel. Herbert Reul of the European People's Party said this "would give us 70% of electrical production but in a CO2 free manner". For the Liberal ALDE group Anne Laperrouze called for fiscal measures to promote energy effiency and the use of biofuels and renewable energy. One thing that all MEPs agreed on was the urgency of the problem. Socialist MEP Matthias Groote told the House that "in the politics of climate change the expression 'time is money' has another meaning". This point was reiterated by German Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel - speaking for the current holders of the EU presidency - who said that "if we continue to consume as much energy, in 50 years we will need a 2nd planet". Car usage fuels climate change A key aspect of the debate was the extent to which transport - and in particular cars - were making climate change worse. In the debate German Green Rebecca Harms launched a scathing attack on the Berlin government saying "Germany torpedoed the goals of CO2 reduction for the automobile industry, because it protects the small segment of the big luxurious limousines, which are produced in Germany. Suddenly we don't talk about climate protection anymore but about Porsches!" Mr Gabriel said this was not the case and that the "objective of 120g of CO2/km can be achieved by combining improved vehicle technology and the use of bio fuels". This theme of the type of cars being produced was taken up by Graham Watson for the Liberals. He asked fellow MEPs "do we really need cars that go from 0 to 100 km per hour in less than six seconds if it will destroy our planet in less than six decades?" For many MEPs increasing the emphasis on public transport was vital. For the Socialist Group Gyula Hegyi said that "road transport uses five times more energy than train transport for the same number of passengers. That is why public transport should be a priority for us". "Why not partnership with China and India?" To what extent the EU should project its power on to the international stage was a vital part of the debate. Francis Wurtz of the European United Left pointed out that the EU has made a bad start in meeting its Kyoto commitments and that if this continues it will "lead the planet to unsustainable upheaval". As to what the EU should do to influence countries like China and India that are experiencing rapid economic growth with increasing carbon usage, Anders Wijkman of the European People's Party asked "why not establish partnership with China and India?" He warned that failure to do so would make "what we are doing... marginal". Calls for 25% increases in renewable energy Last April Parliament adopted a regulation to reduce and prohibit the use of fluorinated gases used in the production of air conditioning units, refrigerators and insulating foam. In January 2006 MEPs passed a resolution on climate change, restating the commitment to "undertake strong emissions reductions for developed countries of 30% by 2020". It calls for better technology cooperation to combat climate change. A further resolution on climate change next week calls for renewable energy to make up 25% of the EU total by 2020.

"A different kind of war" - US Homeland Security chief to Civil Liberty MEPs
US Homeland Security Chief Michael Chertoff The US Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff met MEPs on Parliament's Civil Liberties Committee on Monday to discuss civil liberties and the war on terror. In particular the contentious Passenger Name Record (PNR) agreement on the transfer of data on airline passengers who fly from Europe to the US. The accord has been central to the security vs privacy debate. Mr Chertoff said PNR "would have identified 11 of the 19 9/11 hijackers" and told MEPs that we face "a different kind of war".
Mr Chertoff had been invited following a recent visit by MEPs to the US Congress to discuss the fight against terrorism. In 2004 the EU concluded the "Passenger Name Record Data Transfer" agreement with the US whereby airplanes flying from Europe to the US would supply a range of data about each passenger. In particular the US is interested in up to 34 pieces of information on each and every passenger provided in ticket reservation databases. Depending on how you book your ticket this can be information such as your credit card number, email address and your home address. It can even apply to you if you ask for a special meal although data which may reveal the race or religion of passengers is not supposed to show up. Chertoff: "life is the liberty on which all others depend" The move to collect this kind of data was a direct response to the September 2001 attacks on the US. The US has always maintained that they are vital tools in the war against terrorism. Indeed, speaking to MEPs on Monday Mr Chertoff said that such data would have identified 11 of the 19 9/11 hijackers. He said this would have come at "a minimal cost to civil liberties". Mr Chertoff was asked specifically by Greek PSE member Stavros Lambrinidis what kind of data the US collects. The Homeland Security chief replied that it included the name, surname and passport number of people but also frequent flyer number, phone number, e-mail address and credit card number. Mr Lambrinidis later spoke of the differing perceptions across the Atlantic saying that there is a mistaken belief in US that Europe doesn’t care so much about security, and in Europe that the US doesn’t care so much about fundamental rights. However, the need for strong measures to deal with terrorism was implicit in Mr Chertoff's remarks. He said terrorism was an "ideological threat, a totalitarian vision imposed through violence". As to the civil liberties questions that have arisen in the fight against this he told those present that "life is the liberty on which all others depend". Effectives of data challenged Dutch Liberal ALDE member Sophia in ´t Veld challenged the effectiveness of the data saying that before 9/11 massive amounts of information was available but it was insufficiently used and shared. She later said that protection of EU citizens' data is not guaranteed by US law, but just by an administrative rule. To this Chertoff answered that "each civilized country should respect others' privacy laws". Herbert Reul of the European People's Party and European Democrats praised PNR as a very precise project, said that time was running out to solve the problem. The European Parliament's Civil Liberties Committee has long held misgivings about the privacy and confidentiality issues raised by Passenger Name Record agreement. European Court rules against PNR in 2006 The European Parliament took the case to the European Court of Justice who in May 2006 invalidated the agreement saying it lacked an "appropriate legal basis". In particular they ruled that the EU Data Protection Directive, which the Council and the Commission had used as a reference point, did not apply to data collected for security. When negotiating the agreement, the Commission had based it on the body of EU law which deals with the internal market (as it had commercial implications). The Court believed that it should lie within the sphere of cooperation between member states (with the "third pillar" of responsibilities). To keep the planes flying a short term international agreement was put in place from October 2006 to July 2007 while a new agreement is negotiated. In July last year MEPs on the Civil Liberties Committee called for the Council to give the Parliament full co-decision rights on PNR issues so they can ensure future agreements respect data safeguards. Such a move would require the use of the "passerelle" clause of the EU Treaty whereby the Council would in future share decision making in this area between it and the Parliament Press info Transfer of passenger data illegal says Court SWIFT CIA rendition flights controversy
Intergroups: MEPs unite on single issues across party lines
It will astonish no-one that the European Parliament contains political groups like the European People's Party, Socialists, and Liberals - to name just three. However, people may be surprised to learn that it also has 20 cross-party "intergroups" united on issues such as animal welfare, disabilities and anti-racism. That number jumps to 40 if we take in the non-registered ones such as the Kangaroo group that promotes freedom of movement.
Animal rights to bioethics One of the largest intergroups in the Parliament is on animal welfare, with around 70 MEPs from all shades of the political spectrum. In the past it has campaigned successfully on baby seals and the EU directive on zoos. Neil Parish, the UK Conservative who Chairs the intergroup, said that "animal welfare is the issue raised most frequently in my mailbag....the intergroup is a powerful tool with which to fight the corner for animals..." With 177 political parties from 27 countries represented in the European Parliament, it is perhaps inevitable that semi-formal groupings emerge around issues that cut across the party lines of Parliament's 8 political groups. Intergroups also exist for bioethics, health and consumer protection and Gay and Lesbian rights to name just three more. Most of their meetings take place in Strasbourg Plenary week and are open to the public. They usually invite high level speakers, produce policy documents, prepare Parliamentary reports and resolutions and organise events. Given their size, some intergroups are either assisted by the secretariat of a political group or have their own administration. Status clarified in 1999 Amid concerns at the mushrooming of intergroups (in 1980 there was just 1) and concerns about their links with lobbyists, Parliament introduced new rules governing their status in 1999. The rules require at least three political groups to support the founding of any new group. In addition, they must declare any support they received from whatever quarter. The status of the intergroups was also clarified. They may not describe themselves as organs of the Parliament (as its committees and delegations are), and are not allowed to officially express the view of the Parliament. In addition, they cannot use the EP logo and "cannot undertake activities which might result in confusion with official EP activities". Nevertheless, it is clear that the role and number of intergroups will continue to grow in the Parliament if MEPs interests continue to expand to new fields. Animal welfare intergroup
"We, the citizens of the European Union …"
Berlin Declaration Meeting in Berlin over the weekend, EU leaders adopted a Declaration to mark 50 years of the Rome Treaty. It spells out what the Union has achieved, what it is for and the challenges ahead. The Declaration reaffirms that "the European Union is founded on equal rights and mutually supportive cooperation" and that "the unnatural division of Europe is now consigned to the past". On the Constitution it calls for it to be put on a "renewed common basis before EP elections in 2009".
Berlin was an apt place for the Declaration. In addition to being the capital of Germany, the current holder of the EU Presidency, the dismantled Berlin Wall symbolises the divisions that Europe has overcome. The Declaration was signed by the "3 Presidents": - for the Parliament Hans-Gert Pöttering, for the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the President of the Council, German Chancellor Angela Merkel. "Major challenges which do not stop at national borders" The Declaration says that Europe is "facing major challenges which do not stop at national borders". It mentions terrorism, organised crime, illegal immigration, climate change, energy policy and the fight against poverty. In terms of international relations it says that "the European Union will continue to promote democracy, stability and prosperity beyond its borders". Pöttering: "we are Europeans... of equal value" In a speech at the signing ceremony, Parliament's President Hans Gert Pöttering said, "we are Europeans, Europeans of equal value, wherever in the European Union we may live". He went on to say that "we are linked through our shared values - human dignity, human rights, democracy, the rule of law and the social market economy". Constitution needed for a "more democratic" EU President Pöttering also said the draft European Constitution is needed "to make the European Union more democratic, more open and closer to the citizens...we wish the substance of the Constitutional Treaty, including the expression of our common values, to become legally binding before the European elections of June 2009". Finally he quoted former Chancellor of Germany, Konrad Adenauer, saying, "there was a time when a few people dreamed of European unity. It has since become the hope of many, and today it is a necessity for all". Chancellor Merkel - from Berlin to Brussels On Wednesday 28 March Chancellor Angela Merkel will address MEPs in Brussels and give her account of the summit and the Declaration. Also speaking to the House will be Commission President Barroso. Their speeches will be followed by a debate with MEPs. You can watch the debate live on this website from 1500 CET. Berlin declaration
50 years of equal rights in the EU
International Women's Day - 50 years building Europe It is 50 years since equal rights for women was put firmly on the European agenda with the Rome Treaty, setting up the European Economic Community, laying down the right of women to get "equal pay for equal work". Women's rights have come a long way since the 1950s as companies and institutions have incorporated them into daily life. And the Parliament has long been a guardian of equality, inaugurating the Women's Rights Committee in 1984.
The principle of equal treatment for men and women was first adopted in the Rome Treaty. The scope of the original provision was limited but evolved over a number of years to become a basic tenet of EU law, with the EP and the European Court of Justice playing an important role in the elaboration and implementation of legislation to make it a reality. Since 2007 is the year of equal opportunities and today is Women's Day, it's a good opportunity to look at some of the work that the European Parliament has done in the field of women's rights. The EP set up a Committee on Women's Rights in July 1984. (It is now known as the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.) The Committee checks whether upcoming legislation affects the rights of women and it gives an opinion on most proposals for legislation on healthy, industry and the internal market. Levelling the playing field The Parliament contributes to policy development on equality through involvement in EU strategy making and programmes on gender equality, but is also involved in more specific areas with, for example, a May 2000 Resolution on the fight against trafficking in women and a January 2001 Resolution on the participation of women in the decision-making process. It has also come up with a number of own-initiative reports which have led to concrete action. The EP pushed for 1999 to be the "European Year of action to combat violence against women", following which the EU came up with the Daphne programme to fight violence against women and children. It also contributed to the inclusion of the principles of equal opportunities and treatment in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The Parliament has participated in the Network of Parliamentary Committees for Equal Opportunities for Women and Men in the EU, since it was set up in 1997 Promoting EU values worldwide The situation of women in the EU has radically improved in the last 50 years, but there are still places in the world where women suffer discrimination, pain and where their lives are threatened. In granting the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought, the EP has honoured those fighting for women's rights. In 1994 it was awarded to Taslima Nasreen, a Bangladeshi feminist doctor fighting for woman's equality in Islamic countries and in 2005, Nigerian lawyer Hauwa Ibrahim was one of the laureates for her work defending women condemned to death by stoning for adultery. The work goes on The Parliament continues to focus on this issue. Last week the Women's Rights Committee organised a hearing on reconciling family life and study. Highly educated women tend to have fewer children later in life because of the cost of studying, the difficulty of caring for a child and attending school and because fertility drops over the age of 30. Given the EU's demographic problems this is an issue that needs to be addressed. A number of solutions were proposed, including financial support, affordable childcare, more involvement by fathers and more flexibility over time and distance learning. .
Cartoonists sketch out their peace ideas in Parliament
Plantu, famous cartoonist of Le Monde As well as making people laugh, cartoons have the power to deliver powerful, uncomfortable and shocking messages. The furore over the cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed printed in a Danish newspaper in 2005 was a stark reminder of the impact a cartoon can have. In a hearing organised by Parliament's Human rights committee and the UN their role in promoting peace was debated. Present was cartoonist "Plantu" of "Le Monde" who founded "cartooning for peace" in the wake of the Danish controversy.
The hearing was an unusual mix of debate and drawing with Plantu treating those present to a live drawing of one of his creations on an overhead projector. He was one of 8 cartoonists present who brought their experiences from Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the US. The hearing was timed to coincide with World Press Freedom Day - 3 May. Cartoonists have "no weapon other than a pen and paper" Plantu spoke for them all when he said "we, as cartoonists, are very different, but we all agree we are cartoonists for peace, against intolerance". Dilem from Algeria - who has been arrested 5 times, told the hearing that "we just like to speak out things what we find unacceptable or untrue". He added that we have "no weapons other than a pen and paper whereas others kill thousands of young people". On the controversy over the cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, Spanish Green MEP Raül Romeva i Rueda asked if there were limits to the freedom of expression and if the cartoonists had any taboos. Plantu responded saying that he hopes "politically incorrect" cartooning would continue but "without transmitting hatred". He noted what he thought was a mutual lack of comprehension between cultures, East and West. Speaking later exclusively to the Parliament's website he commented specifically on the Danish controversy saying: "it's useless to pour oil into fire. That's why the "Jyllands Posten" (the Danish newspaper at the heart of the controversy) decided not to publish more cartoons of Mohammed to avoid killings in Pakistan or elsewhere. But, of course, it is a must to keep publishing cartoons against Hamas or Al Qaida." "Laughter has the power to defeat totalitarianism" The importance of cartoons as an avenue of freedom of expression was widely spoke of in the hearing. French Green MEP Hélène Flautre who chairs the Human Rights committee said that "without freedom of expression neither democracy nor full human rights are possible". Recalling his experience in Communist Poland, Liberal ALDE member Bronislaw Geremek told the MEPs and cartoonists that "when there are authoritarian regimes, it is important for there to be laughter...laughter has the power to defeat totalitarianism". Alojz Peterle, a Slovenian member of the European People's Party thanked the cartoonists as "what you do speaks louder than the words of politicians". "Cartooning for peace" was established in the wake of the Danish cartoon controversy and a controversial exhibition on the Holocaust in Iran in 2006. Press info Cartooning for peace
