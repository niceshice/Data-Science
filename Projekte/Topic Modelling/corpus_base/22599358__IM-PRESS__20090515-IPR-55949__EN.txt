Following the imprisonment on Thursday in Burma of the 1990 Sakharov Prize winner, Aun San Suu Kyi, the President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering, called for her to be released immediately and unconditionally.
He made the following statement:
"After hearing the news that Nobel Peace Prize winner and European Parliament Sakharov Prize Aun San Suu Kyi has been accused of breaching the conditions of her detention under house arrest and taken to prison, I strongly call on the Burmese authorities to immediately release her without further delay or conditions."
Now that her six-year illegal house arrest is due to expire on 27 May, this imprisonment appears to be another pretext to keep her detained as the country approaches new elections in 2010.
The European Parliament reaffirms its complete solidarity with Aun San Suu Kyi and calls on the Burmese authorities to release her immediately and unconditionally."
