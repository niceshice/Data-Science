When MEPs declared the Ukrainian general elections of last weekend to have been "free and fair" it was a far cry from the scorching criticism they voiced over a year ago. Blatant vote-rigging made the Ukrainian people to take to the streets. The "Orange Revolution" was staunchly supported by the European Parliament and culminated in a rerun of the presidential elections. This time, MEPs were happy to see democracy win at the ballot box.
"These elections clearly show how far Ukraine has come in scarcely a year and a half, to meeting the democratic standards that the people of Ukraine stood up for during the Orange Revolution," Marek Siwiec (PES, PL) declared in Kiev. Siwiec headed the EP delegation which monitored the elections, just as in late 2004. Although the elections were considered to have been free and fair, MEPs did signal some improvements to be made, such as the compilation of electoral rolls and respect for the rules on campaign funding.
On the outcome of the elections, Siwiec said that "the European Union can find valid interlocutors in all the Ukrainian political parties which will sit in the Assembly. This capital must be used in cooperation between the Ukrainian and European parliaments."
MEPs who had gone to Ukraine in October and November 2004 to monitor presidential elections were shocked by the vote-rigging they witnessed and called for a re-run. After the Orange Revolution, MEPs continued to take an active interest in the situation in Ukraine. The European Parliament actively promoted the implementation of EU action plans to stimulate economic development and further democratisation in Ukraine. In the run-up to last weekend's parliamentary elections MEPs met in Brussels with the Ukraine foreign minister and with opposition leader Tymoshenko, who has broken with her former Orange Revolution ally Yushchenko.
The EP delegation which monitored last weekend's elections also included Charles Tannock (EPP-ED, UK), Thijs Berman (PES, NL), Šarūnas Birutis (ALDE, LT), Rebecca Harms (Greens/EFA, DE), Zbigniew Kuzmiuk (UEN, PL) and Patrick Louis (IND/DEM, FR). The delegation was part of a joint mission with the OSCE, NATO and the Council of Europe.
The European Parliament attaches great importance to the observation of elections as a means to strengthen the legitimacy of national electoral processes, increase public confidence in elections, avoid electoral fraud, better to protect human rights and to contribute to conflict solution. MEPs provide a particular political perspective, expertise and experience in election observation.
