The pretty town of L’Aquila and the surrounding area was worst hit with the cost of rebuilding estimated at € 4 billion. One source of funding could be the EU solidarity fund set up to deal with disasters in the wake of flooding in the Czech Republic and Germany in 2002. Last year it was used to pay for flood damage in Britain and Romania.
The EU solidarity fund makes available about €1 billion a year for the repair of infrastructure, temporary accommodation and emergency services to meet immediate needs if disaster strikes. Money is also used to clear up a stricken area.
The Italian government has already said it is going to apply for the funds when they have assessed the scale and cost of the damage.
In the wake of the disaster on 6 April, Parliament's President Hans - Gert Pöttering spoke of his "deep sympathy with all victims". Speaking on behalf of the Chamber he said: "Our thoughts are with the injured, the homeless and all those affected by this disaster. Our sympathy and solidarity are with them."
The solidarity fund can be released if governments apply for it at least 10 weeks after it occurs. It is fellow EU States and Members of the European Parliament who then decide whether to release the money.
