Briefing - 21-24 May 2007 - Strasbourg
2007-05-15 - 18:05
European elections take place in Bulgaria on Sunday 20 May - 18 Bulgarian MEPs are to be elected.
Both Italian Prime Minister Romano PRODI and Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter BALKENENDE will be in Strasbourg to debate with MEPs the latest developments on the "future of Europe". Mobile phone roaming charges is the key legislative topic of the May Strasbourg plenary, at the time of publication, a tentative first-reading agreement had been reached with Council which would result in a reduction in roaming prices across the EU. Other key legislative topics include a report on improving water quality, a report on combating violence and a conciliation agreement on the financial instrument for the environment. Parliament will also debate and vote on a report on the situation in Kashmir.
Selected highlights include:
Monday 21 May 2007
The session opens with a debate on the impact and consequences of the exclusion of health services from the Services Directive. In committee, a narrow majority of MEPs voted to urge the Commission to propose a codification of the Court of Justice’s case law in this area, although they opted not to call for separate legislation on health services. A highly controversial amendment calling for healthcare to be reinstated in the Services Directive was approved in the Internal Market Committee.
The House will debate a conciliation agreement on the financial instrument for the environment (LIFE+) . This new general framework is intended to ensure more efficient, flexible and less bureaucratic management. Life+ is intended to fund environmental programmes for the period 2007-2013.
MEPs will later debate the environmental quality standards in the field of water policy . Parliament will vote at first reading on a report by the Environment Committee which seeks to toughen up proposed rules on improving the quality of surface water.
Parliament will also debate the Daphne III programme on combating violence . Agreement has been reached with Council and the third phase of Daphne covers the period 2007-2013 and has a budget of €116.85m.
Tuesday 22 May 2007
Tuesday morning starts off with a series of reports on international trade . David MARTIN (PES, UK) will present his report on the EU's Aid for Trade which will focus upon "harnessing trade for development and reducing poverty", and promote "a climate favourable to entrepreneurship and growth", according to a report by the Committee on International Trade.
Robert STURDY (EPP-ED, UK) will lead the debate on a report on the Economic Partnership Agreements being negotiated between the EU and African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. These would replace the current system of generalised preferences, which is incompatible with WTO rules. Given the delay in the talks and the lack of readiness on the part of the ACP countries, MEPs in the Trade Committee call in a report for the Commission to make the conditions for the agreements less onerous.
At 3pm, MEPs will debate the "future of Europe" with Italian Prime Minister Romano PRODI.
At 4.30pm, Parliament will debate the situation in Palestine following statements from Council and Commission. The House will vote on a resolution on Wednesday.
The evening session on Tuesday starts with a statement by the Council and the Commission on E stoni a , with the vote on a resolution taking place on Wednesday.
Later on Tuesday evening, the House will debate a report calling for minimum levels of duty for alcoholic drinks should be scrapped. Instead, says the Economic Committee, Member States should adopt a code of conduct that encourages them to move towards the EU average level of duty.
Wednesday 23 May 2007
The key legislative topic of the week is the hard-negotiated mobile phone roaming charges package . After four arduous rounds of negotiations with the Council Presidency, MEPs negotiating for the Parliament, finally reached a proposed tentative agreement with the Council on the “Roaming on public mobile networks” regulation which will lead to a reduction in prices for millions of roaming customers. The text is likely to pave the way for a first-reading adoption of the dossier. At the time of publication of the Briefing, the EPP-ED had signed up to the proposed agreement, whilst the PES still had some reservations. The Industry Committee will meet in Strasbourg on 21 May to vote on the proposed package before it goes to the full plenary on 23 May for debate and vote.
At 3pm , and following on from the previous day's debate with Prime Minister Prodi, MEPs will debate the "future of Europe" with Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende.
On Wednesday evening, Bill NEWTON DUNN (ALDE, UK) will present his report on tackling organised crime.
Thursday 24 May 2007
MEPs will debate a report by Baroness (Emma) NICHOLSON of Winterbourne (ALDE, UK) on the situation in Kashmir . MEPs in the Foreign Affairs Committee welcome and encourage bilateral talks between India and Pakistan to find a solution to the Kashmir conflict, while criticising Pakistan for a lack of progress on democracy and human rights.
The House will also debate the controversial " Via Baltica " the motorway running from Prague in the Czech Republic to Helsinki in Finland by way of Poland where there are environmental challenges, Kaunas (Lithuania), Riga (Latvia), and Tallinn (Estonia).
The session ends as is customary with three debates and votes on resolutions on human rights issues in the world. On this occasion the topics are: The "Radio Caracas Television RCTV" case in Venezuela, human rights in Syria and human rights in Sudan . A fourth topic has been added on the President of the World Bank affair .
A last minute pre-session press briefing will be held in Strasbourg on Monday 21 May at 4.00pm - Room LOW N-1/201.

Future of Europe/European integration
Romano Prodi and Jan Peter Balkenenede to set out their views on the future of Europe in debate with MEPs
2007-05-15 - 18:05
MEPs will hear from the Italian Prime Minister and former European Commission President Romano Prodi on Tuesday 22 May at 3pm. MEPs will have the opportunity to debate the progress surrounding the Constitutional Treaty. On Wednesday 23 May at 3pm, MEPs will hear from Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende on the same topic. Situation of the Member States
As of March 2007 16 Member States have completed ratification, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, two of which (Spain and Luxembourg) voted by referendum. A further two (Germany and Slovakia) have almost finished ratification; and two have rejected it (France and the Netherlands). That leaves seven countries where the constitution is still on ice (UK, Ireland, Denmark, Poland, Czech Republic, Portugal and Sweden)
European Parliament position
On 12 January 2005, the European Parliament adopted a report by a large majority, endorsing the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe and says it "wholeheartedly supports its ratification." The report by Richard CORBETT (PES, UK) and Íñigo MÉNDEZ DE VIGO (EPP-ED, ES) was adopted by 500 votes in favour to 137 votes against, with 40 abstentions.
Italian position on the Constitutional Treaty
Italy ratified the constitution on 6 April 2005 with an overwhelming majority in the upper house of parliament - 217 votes to 16. The text, which was signed by EU leaders in Rome in 2004, was approved by the Italian lower house (the Chamber of Deputies) in January 2005. Centrist parties backed the constitution, however, the Northern League and the Communist Party, argued that it eroded regional and national sovereignty.
The Italian Prime Minister has recently said that reviving the European constitution is fundamental to Europe's future survival. Romano Prodi, who was also president of the European Commission from 1999 to 2004, said that Britain had to decide whether to stay in or not. A divided Europe will not survive, Mr Prodi says. Mr Prodi, who was speaking ahead of celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, which established the Common Market, said he was for the constitution.
"We have to have it before the European Parliament elections of 2009 because we are 27 countries and we need the rules," he said. "Like it or not, if we have a united Europe we survive. If not, we are dead. I am absolutely convinced that process is irreversible. We need time. We needed 45 years to have the euro; I don't know how long before we have the constitution but we need it," he added.
Dutch position on Constitutional Treaty
The Dutch, who rejected the constitution in a referendum in 2005, want amendments to be made to existing treaties to improve the running of the EU, not a renewed attempt to introduce a constitution. They also want a clear separation between European and national roles.
In a letter from the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister for European Affairs to the Dutch House of Representatives on the status of discussion on a new European treaty, dated 19 March 2007, the Dutch set out their latest position on their aims for discussions on amending European treaties:
"[...] Whether or not the Member States have ratified the Treaty, they seem to agree on a number of points. Many of them see 2009 as a good target date for a new treaty, due to the European Parliament elections in June 2009 and the installation of a new Commission in November 2009. There is also a broad consensus that the treaties must be amended to prevent future stagnation brought on by eroding public support or an inadequate capacity for action. It is becoming increasingly clear that the Constitutional Treaty will not enter into force, and that the reasons for its rejection or non-approval in nine member states must be taken into account in any new attempt to amend the treaties. From the Dutch point of view this is a positive outcome of the period of reflection which offers good prospects for a new treaty. Of course, while the Netherlands is ready to do its part to conclude a new treaty in a timely manner, the treaty’s substance will ultimately be the deciding factor. Debate on the future of Europe
3-4.0pm, 22.05.2007 - with participation of the Prime Minister of Italy

All roads lead to Roam: MEPs reach tentative breakthrough on roaming in negotiations with Council
2007-05-15 - 18:05
After four tough rounds of negotiations with the Council, MEPs negotiating for the EP, finally reached a proposed tentative agreement with the Council on the “Roaming on public mobile networks” regulation which will lead to a reduction in prices for millions of roaming customers. The text is likely to pave the way for a first-reading adoption of the dossier. At the time of publication of the Briefing, the EPP-ED had signed up to the proposed agreement, whilst the PES still had some reservations. The Industry Committee will meet in Strasbourg on 21 May to vote on the proposed package before it goes to the full plenary on 23 May for debate and vote.
The crux of the package reflects the very same issues, which held the key to the roaming dossier from the outset: caps on wholesale and retail charges, the choice between ‘opt-in’ and ‘opt-out’ models, transparency requirements, entry into force and future review of the legislation. However, inasmuch as the issues are the same, the solutions – in the spirit of compromise – are slightly different.
Prices
According to the compromise, the average wholesale charge (excluding. VAT) that a "visited" operator can levy on a roaming customer’s "home" operator for the provision of roaming calls will be capped at €0.30 per minute. ( The Council, at the outset of negotiations, had proposed placing a cap of € 0.36 on the average wholesale price ).
The cap, in line with MEPs’ proposals, will decrease automatically by 2 eurocents per year over a 3-year period after the regulation's entry into force. The maximum retail charge (excluding VAT) for regulated roaming calls, meanwhile, will be capped at € 0.49 per minute for calls made and €0.24 per minute for calls received. ( The Industry Committee had voted, in its original report, for caps of € 0.40 for calls made and € 0.15 for calls received. The Council, meanwhile -- having initially called for caps of € 0.50 for calls made and € 0.25 for calls received -- entered negotiations with the EP by proposing caps of € 0.60 and € 0.30, respectively ).
The cap for outgoing calls will decrease automatically by 3 eurocents per year; the cap for incoming calls will decrease by 2 eurocents after the first year and 3 eurocents after the second year.

As MEPs insisted, home providers will have to offer these regulated tariffs to all their customers – and to do so actively, clearly and transparently.
Opting
One of the greatest bones of contention in the Parliament's negotiations with the Council was the issue of whether to make the regulated tariffs subject to an "opt-out" or an "opt-in" model. The latter leaves customers with their old roaming tariffs, unless they deliberately choose to "opt into" the new EU system of price caps; the former ensures that the EU tariff would apply by default (unless the customer chooses otherwise). The majority of the Industry Committee having voted in favour of the "opt-out", the EP's delegation to the trialogue defended this model vigorously throughout the negotiations with the Presidency.
According to the compromise package forged today, all customers will be free to switch to or from the EU tariff plan at any time, free of charge, within one month after the regulation's entry into force. After another 2 months, all customers who have neither opted for the EU tariff nor switched to a different one will see the EU tariff apply automatically.
To put it differently: customers will have three months after entry into force to make a choice; if they make none they will be accorded the EU tariff. [In addition to the regulated tariffs, reads the compromise text, every home provider could also offer "a fair use, all-inclusive monthly flat-rate to which no charge limits apply". Such a flat rate would include both voice and data roaming services (including SMS and MMS).] At the same time, customers already benefiting from specific roaming tariffs or packages (and having been reminded of their contract by their operator) will not be switched automatically into the EU tariff.
The cap on the average wholesale price, meanwhile, will take effect two months after the entry into force.
Customers who have existing lower tariffs than the EU tariff will be able to keep them.
Information requirements and future regulation
As to ensure that customers are fully aware of what they pay for roaming services under the different tariff plans, MEPs included in the compromise package a series of transparency provisions. Home providers, they decided, will provide their customers with "personalised pricing information on the retail charges" to outgoing and incoming roaming calls.
The Commission, according to the compromise text, will review the impact of the roaming dossier and report to the European Parliament and the Council "no later than eighteen months" after the regulation's entry into force. It will also keep track of developments in wholesale and retail charges for data communication services – including SMS and MMS – and, if necessary, make recommendations regarding the need to regulate in this area. Despite the fact that the compromise foresees the expiration of the roaming regulation after three years, it will also be up to the Commission to assess – in light of market developments and consumer protection concerns – whether there is need to propose a legislative act extending this period.
The countdown to cheaper roaming
The compromise package, still subject to the endorsement of the EP political groups and the formal approval of the Council, should now serve as the basis for the vote by the full Parliament. As a first step, the Industry Committee – the EP's lead committee on roaming – will vote on the compromise text during its meeting in Strasbourg on 21 May; this, in turn, will set the stage for a plenary vote three days later.
Assuming the Council has already endorsed the compromise package this week, a June 7 meeting of the Member States’ ministers of telecommunication would then formally ratify the first-reading agreement. Publication in the Official Journal (and thus entry into force) should follow a few weeks later.

Kashmir: backing for bilateral talks - and for action on human rights and democracy
2007-05-15 - 18:05
In an own-initiative report for the Foreign Affairs Committee, MEPs in the committee welcome and encourage bilateral talks between India and Pakistan to find a solution to the Kashmir conflict, while criticising Pakistan for a lack of progress on democracy and human rights. The report, drawn up by Baroness (Emma) NICHOLSON of Winterbourne (ALDE, UK), emphasises that the recent "earthquake has had an immense impact on the lives of the Kashmiris on both sides of the Line of Control (LoC)," although "the size and impact of the earthquake had a much greater effect on the Pakistani side." It recommends that the EU consider favourably any further requests for assistance for reconstruction in the area.
The committee welcomes the increase in the number of visas issued for travel between India and Pakistan, as well as the re-opening of truck and bus services, for example on the Srinigar-Muzzafarabad route. It also argued for setting up exchange programmes, including a common University.
Political settlement
The committee says that the "resolution of the continuing conflict along the LoC can best be achieved jointly by a constant engagement between the governments of India and Pakistan, involving the peoples of all parts of the former princely state." It also commends both countries on the peace moves underway, and welcomes the restoration of bilateral talks. The report reaffirms that "all peoples have the inalienable right of self-determination," while pointing to the fact that "the pre-conditions for using the plebiscite have not been met at present."
Human rights and democracy
Stressing that India and Pakistan (along with China) are both important EU partners, MEPs in the committee also noted that "India is the world's largest secular democracy and has devolved democratic structures at all levels," while "Pakistan still lacks full implementation of democracy in Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK), [...] has yet to take steps towards democracy in Gilgit and Baltistan," and that "President Musharraf has not been able to implement his undertaking made in 1999 that 'the armed forces have no intention of staying in charge any longer than is absolutely necessary to pave the way for true democracy to flourish in Pakistan.'" The report calls on Pakistan to ensure free and fair elections in the AJK, Gilgit and Baltistan.
The report also expresses concern at "documented human rights violations by Pakistan" in Gilgit and Baltistan, and at reports of torture and mistreatment, discrimination, and corruption in AJK. It calls on the Indian government to "put an end to all practices of extrajudicial killings, 'disappearances', torture and arbitrary detention in Jammu and Kashmir," and to establish an independent commission of inquiry into serious violations of human rights by Indian security forces. MEPs in the committee call on both governments to allow international human rights groups access to the region for investigations.
The report deplores the continuing political and humanitarian situation in all four parts of Jammu and Kashmir. The committee welcomes, however, the role of the composite peace process in moving towards a durable settlement for the Kashmiris based on democracy, the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights; supports the "second track" approach as well as wider dialogue involving eminent persons, academics and other relevant experts from all sides of Kashmir and from India and Pakistan, who are putting forward practical suggestions for closer cooperation.
The report calls on India and the State Government of Jammu and Kashmir to repeal all legal provisions providing effective immunity to members of the armed forces and to establish an independent and impartial commission of inquiry into serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law by Indian security forces since the beginning of the conflict.
Combating terrorism
The report recognises that, without an end to terrorism, there can be no real progress towards a political solution or in improving the economic situation of the population throughout Jammu and Kashmir. The committee notes that, while there has been a steady decline in the number of victims of terrorist attacks over the past five years, the activities of constantly mutating AJK-based terrorist groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Harakat ul-Mujahedeen have caused hundreds of deaths in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir and beyond.
MEPs in the committee deplore documented human rights violations by Pakistan including in Gilgit and Baltistan, where allegedly violent riots took place in 2004, and the all too frequent incidents of terror and violence perpetrated by armed militant groups.
The committee urges Pakistan to revisit its concepts of the fundamental rights of freedom of expression, freedom of association and freedom of religious practice in AJK and Gilgit and Baltistan, and notes with concern allegations by human rights associations such as Amnesty International of torture and detention without due process.
The report strongly urges all parties involved to do all they can to address these violations. MEPs in the committee, furthermore, call on the Government of Pakistan and EU Member States to intensify their efforts to identify and apprehend potential terrorist recruits coming to Pakistan from EU Member States. The report welcomes the recent establishment of a joint panel, the India-Pakistan Joint Mechanism on Terrorism, by the two governments to combat terrorism and share intelligence, and takes note that the first meeting of the panel took place in Islamabad on 6 March 2007;
Finally, MEPs in the committee strongly support the International Crisis Group’s recommendations of 11 December 2006 for Pakistan to disarm militants, shut down terrorist training camps, stop terrorist recruitment and training on its territory and end the flow of money and weapons to the Taliban and other foreign or local militants on Pakistani territory.

Situation in Nigeria - after "disappointing" elections
2007-05-15 - 18:05
MEPs will debate the situation in Nigeria after hearing statements from the Council and the Commission following the recent elections in that country. The 2007 State and Federal elections in Nigeria have fallen far short of basic international and regional standards for democratic elections. This is the conclusion of the 150 strong European Union Election Observation Mission (EU EOM). “I am very disappointed”, said Max VAN DEN BERG (PES, NL) Chief Observer of the EU EOM. “These elections have not lived up to the hopes and expectations of the Nigerian people and the process cannot be considered to have been credible. This is all the more regrettable since they were held in an improved atmosphere in which freedoms of expression and assembly were broadly respected during campaigning, the courts played a generally positive and independent role and the people showed remarkable commitment to democracy, eagerly engaging in the electoral process and waiting patiently to vote in often very difficult circumstances."

MEPs to call to bring Europe's foreign policy in line with citizen's wishes
2007-05-15 - 18:05
The European Union must bring its foreign policy goals in line with its citizens' wishes, says a report being put forward by the Foreign Affairs Committee. It emphasises the need for internal steps, such as implementing certain measures proposed in the Constitutional Treaty, and external priorities, for example the fight against poverty, in order to have a common European voice in international affairs. The own-initiative report by Elmar BROK (EPP-ED, DE) on the annual report from the Council on the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) in 2005, suggests that the EU's foreign policy "should target a limited number of areas which better connect with the wishes and concerns of European citizens and their expectations of the role to be played by the Union in international affairs." It particularly emphasises that "much more should be done from an external action perspective to halt the spread of poverty in the world," while also naming energy security, democracy promotion and the fight against terrorism as important goals. On non-proliferation issues, the report specifically expresses its concern "regarding the first test of an anti-satellite weapon carried out by China in January 2007."
The Constitutional Treaty and CFSP financing
"Without the Constitutional Treaty, [...] the European Union cannot shape a foreign policy that can at least partially meet the most important challenges," says the committee. Members argue in favour of a mutual assistance clause, an office of Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the establishment of an EU Diplomatic Academy.
On the issue of the CFSP budget, MEPs in the committee regret that "that the specific article within the CFSP budget chapter devoted to European Union Special Representatives does not avoid the proliferation of envoys of that kind," which the committee thinks undermines the role of the Commission's delegations on the ground. Furthermore, the committee is unsatisfied with the fact that "the new Interinstitutional Agreement does not change the existing rules on ESDP operations, such as the principle that 'costs lie where they fall'," which in effect places the financial cost of any military operation on the Member State who provides the troops to accomplish it. This is a disincentive for governments to pledge troops, and could be avoided if such operations were financed directly from the EU's budget, the report argues.
Improving European Parliament oversight
The committee also stresses the need to involve the EP more closely in the elaboration and oversight of CFSP goals. "The Council's practice of merely informing Parliament and submitting a descriptive list of CFSP activities carried out in the previous year, instead of really consulting Parliament at the beginning of each year [...] constitutes a de facto infringement of the very substance of Article 21" of the EU treaties, says the report. It therefore calls for more active consultation of the Parliament on the CFSP in general, while also calling for additional powers, for instance "by conferring on Parliament the authority to appoint, and dismiss, the Counter-Terrorism Coordinator and the Directors of SitCen, the EU Satellite Centre (EUSC) and Eurojust." rapporteur Elmar BROK EPP-ED DE A6-0130/2007 Annual report 2005 on CFSP Procedure : own-initiative

EU action needed on health services?
2007-05-15 - 18:05
Parliament will vote on a draft own-initiative report by the Internal Market Committee on the consequences of excluding health services from the Services Directive. In committee, a narrow majority of MEPs voted to urge the Commission to propose a codification of the Court of Justice’s case law in this area, although they opted not to call for separate legislation on health services. A highly controversial amendment calling for healthcare to be reinstated in the Services Directive was approved. The draft report, as amended, was adopted in committee by 20 votes to 18 with 2 abstentions, support coming broadly from the EPP-ED, ALDE and UEN groups, with Socialist Members and others voting mainly against.
The report’s aim was to put forward a series of recommendations on EU action in the health sector in anticipation of possible legislation on patients' mobility in the EU and in reaction to a Commission consultation document on "Community action in the field of health care services".
Bearing in mind the steady increase in cross-border mobility of patients and health professionals, members of the committee agreed that - with regard to access to health services - Member States should treat all EU residents on an equal basis, "regardless of whether they are private or public patients". That said, while patients should be free to choose health care in another country, "medical tourism should not be actively encouraged". Moreover, the committee argued, "patient mobility cannot be allowed to grow unchecked without concurrent and clear rules governing liability for the provision of cross-border health services".
Noting how difficult it is to obtain clear and precise information on health care, the committee called for the creation of "single points of contact" for patients, health professionals and healthcare institutions.
A place in the Services Directive for health?
Since "Treaty rules [...], as well as the jurisprudence of the ECJ, apply to health services, health service providers are fully entitled to establish and provide services in any Member State, following national and EU rules" says the report. However, in adopting a paragraph drafted by Toine MANDERS (ALDE, NL), Members went one step further. The Commission, they suggested, should issue "a proposal to reintroduce health services into Directive 2006/123/EC" - i.e. the Services Directive.
In the same vein, the committee turned down the rapporteur's call for a separate directive on health services, choosing instead to ask the Commission to propose "an appropriate instrument with a view, in particular, to codifying the [pertinent] case law of the ECJ".
It was because of the adoption of Mr Manders' amendment, according to Evelyne GEBHARDT (PES, DE), that the rapporteur, Bernadette VERGNAUD (PES, FR), and the other Socialist MEPs voted against the final report. "We had a majority in the Parliament in favour of excluding health services from the services directive" said Ms Gebhardt, who was the rapporteur for the Services Directive itself.

Chemical pollution: clean surface water by 2015
2007-05-15 - 18:05
In another step on the road to cleaning up Europe's water, Parliament will vote at first reading on a report by the Environment Committee which seeks to toughen up proposed rules on improving the quality of surface water, just as Parliament did in the cases of directives on bathing water in 2005 and groundwater in 2006. The report by Anne LAPERROUZE (ALDE, FR) on the quality of surface water (rivers, lakes and coastal waters) was approved by the Environment Committee with 50 votes in favour, none against and one abstention. The framework water directive of 2000 was intended to generate a number of daughter directives, of which this is one. In the two previous cases - bathing water and groundwater - MEPs were obliged to go all the way to conciliation in order to amend the legislation in ways they believed were important.
It is too soon to say whether this will happen again with surface water but a broad consensus has emerged among members of the Environment Committee on the key points of the report, which substantially strengthens the measures proposed by the European Commission.
Almost 70 controlled substances
The Commission would like to fix environmental quality standards (EQS) for 41 pollutants likely to be found in surface water: pesticides, heavy metals and others. These substances may endanger the survival of ecosystems, and via the food chain, human health itself.
The Environment Committee has added 28 substances to the proposed list of priority substances. It asks the Commission to ascertain whether these additional substances should not also be classified as "priority hazardous substances" and to make a proposal to Parliament for their final classification not later than 12 months after the directive enters into force.
The Commission had highlighted the co-existence of other legal provisions, in order to avoid getting into too much methodological detail. The Environment Committee wants it specifically to carry out a formal assessment of the consistency and effectiveness of all Community legislative acts with a direct or indirect impact on water quality. And whereas the Commission suggested leaving national authorities more latitude with regard to control methods, MEPs ask it to propose techniques to be used by Member States.
In the vicinity of pollution sources it will not be possible to comply quickly with environmental quality standards. So the proposed directive provides for "transitional areas of exceedance" close to pollution sources and advocates their progressive reduction, without going into further detail. MEPs demand more, saying that Member States must reduce these areas progressively in order to reach the quality standards by 2018 at the latest.
In its initial proposal, the Commission had suggested limiting checks to surface water, i.e. not biotas (living organisms) and sediments, except for three substances that are more hazardous than others when they accumulate in the food chain: mercury, hexachlorobenzene, and hexachlorobutadien. Here MEPs would instead like the Commission to make a new legislative proposal on the standards applicable to biotas and sediments once Member States have listed the emissions and pollutants in their water.
Under the directive, the environmental quality standards are to be met by 2015 and direct discharges of pollutants into surface water must cease by 2025.

Biodiversity: will our grandchildren still eat fish?
2007-05-15 - 18:05
In Europe today, 52% of freshwater fish species, 45% of reptiles and butterflies, 42% of indigenous mammals, 30% of amphibians and 800 plant species, inter alia, are threatened with extinction. On the high seas, stocks of cod, haddock and halibut are dying out. Much remains to be done if the Union is to achieve its aim of stemming the decline in biodiversity by 2010. In 2001 the EU Heads of State or Government decided "to halt the decline of biodiversity by 2010" and "to restore habitats and natural systems". With three years to go to the target date, members of the Environment Committee voiced their "profound concern at the continuing loss of biodiversity" and stressed "the urgent need for an effort to meet commitments". Because according to an own-initiative report drafted by Adamos ADAMOU (GUE/NGL, CY) for the Environment Committee biodiversity loss is as important a threat as climate change.
Member States short of political will
Mr Adamou says that "If we do not move towards sustainable use, there will be no fish left for our grandchildren". Plenty of initiatives have been taken, "but they are not getting adequate results", according to the rapporteur and to other MEPs speaking before the vote in the committee: "there is too little funding and too little political will among the Member States". A view that is shared by the European Commission itself.
Among the existing initiatives, the Natura 2000 network, which protects natural habitats, today protects 18% of the territory of the EU-15. For over ten years now, the common agricultural policy (CAP) has included environmental measures. But MEPs consider that CAP-driven specialisation and intensification have eroded biodiversity in recent decades.
The current reform of the fisheries policy also seeks to reduce pressure on the marine environment, but fishing still too often uses destructive and non-selective technologies. Many pieces of legislation are in the pipeline to safeguard air, water and soil quality and to cut pollution. And in 2006 the Commission proposed a broader action plan on biodiversity.
Maintaining biodiversity demands unprecedented efforts
MEPs in the committee welcome this plan but consider that it "will be insufficient to conserve biodiversity and sustain ecosystem services in the longer term." "Ecosystem services" include the production of food, fuel, fibre and medicines, regulation of water, air and climate, maintenance of soil fertility and cycling of nutrients. These services provided by nature are the basis of sustainable development and of many economic activities.
According to the report, Natura 2000 must be strengthened not only to safeguard species but also to restore them. Biodiversity considerations must be further integrated into agriculture and fisheries policies and into spatial planning at national, regional and local levels.
MEPs in the committee also urge a Community response to the threat posed by the introduction - whether voluntary or accidental - of "invasive alien species and alien genotypes" (this is the second threat, after the destruction of habitats). The Commission acknowledges that at present it does not have information on actions taken by the Member States to combat alien species and MEPs underline the decisive role that immuno contraception could play against these species. They ask the Commission to ban the introduction of these species and to evaluate the potential risks that genetically-modified organisms could pose to biodiversity.
They call for measures to regulate deep sea bottom trawling, and to ensure adherence to scientific recommendations when setting catch quotas.
MEPs in the committee stress the need to reduce imports of tropical woods and the adverse impact that biofuel production could have on tropical forests. They also advocate stepping up the biodiversity research effort, which they say is currently "far too low."
However clever humans are, they can never make up through artificial means for the natural resources they are destroying. Hence, halting the decline in biodiversity will require "unprecedented efforts in adapting our activities to the needs of natural systems" says Mr Adamou. And not the opposite.

EU environment policy stays “European”
2007-05-15 - 18:05
The House will be asked to approve a conciliation agreement reached with the Council on 27 March 2007 on the funding arrangements for the EU's environmental policy. MEPs managed to ensure in the negotiations with Council that the new financial instrument (known as Life+ ) will continue to provide "EU added value." Life+ will group together environmental programmes which until now came under different procedures and funding arrangements: the former Life programme, Forest Focus, the programme for sustainable urban development and the support programme for environmental NGOs. This new general framework is intended to ensure more efficient, flexible and less bureaucratic management. Life+ is intended to fund environmental programmes for the period 2007-2013.
European dimension safeguarded
In its draft legislation, the Commission proposed that 80% of the funding be delegated to the Member States, without sufficiently emphasising European added value, according to MEPs. The Member States (the Council) wanted a form of indirect management in which the Commission's role would have been limited to approving projects submitted by governments.
MEPs have successfully pushed for a number of guarantees to ensure that this delegated management does not turn into a "re-nationalisation" of environmental policy:
• projects will be selected by the Commission in line with a list of common criteria and priorities;
• lists of projects submitted to the Commission by the Member States will be "indicative" only, even though the Commission is supposed to "take them into account";
• Member States must try to ensure that at least 15 percent of the budget dedicated to project action grants is allocated to transnational projects;
• the share of the budget delegated to Member States will be 78%, with 2% for the Commission to cover administrative costs relating to the central role that MEPs want it to play.
Support for Natura 2000
MEPs also successfully demanded a reorganisation of the way the funds will be spent. The draft legislation had envisaged only two sections: one for implementation of policies and governance, the other for information and communication. The EP has added a third part - "nature and biodiversity" - which should account for at least 50% of the operational budget.
For MEPs, this was a way to increase the funding for Natura 2000, a network of areas where biodiversity is protected, which today covers 18% of the surface area of the EU-15. The annual cost of this network was estimated in 2004 to be €6100 million. Given the reduced budget for Life+, most of the EU funding for Natura 2000 will continue to come from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).
Projects can now go ahead, even if budget is seen as too modest
The conciliation agreement was approved unanimously on the EP side. Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou (EPP-ED, EL), who led the EP delegation, said " This deal will enable us to breathe life into Life+ as soon as possible. Interested parties will be able to apply for EU funds very quickly ."
"This funding is only a drop in the ocean compared with the Union's annual budget", pointed out rapporteur Marie-Anne Isler Béguin (Greens/EFA, FR), who conducted the negotiations for Parliament and managed to squeeze out a slight increase of €40 million, bringing the total amount for Life+ to some €1.951 billion for the period 2007-2013 (the total EU budget is over €125 billion per year). In the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013, environmental expenditure was cut sharply.
Accordinb to Ms Isler Béguin, " It was important for us to preserve the principle of Community management, with common criteria for project selection, a central role for the Commission and with a large proportion of the funds being earmarked for transnational projects - at least 15% - and for biodiversity - at least 50% ".

Greater trade opportunities are "indispensable for reducing poverty"
2007-05-15 - 18:05
The EU's aid for trade (AfT) initiative will focus upon "harnessing trade for development and reducing poverty" and promote "a climate favourable to entrepreneurship and growth" according to a report by the Committee on International Trade. The author of the report, David MARTIN (PES, UK), states that "the integration of developing countries into the global economy is a major condition for fulfilling the aim of eradicating poverty" which is a "complex and multidimensional problem without simple solutions." Taking advantage of greater trade opportunities, however, must involve "the necessary flanking domestic policies, including redistribution and social policies and a real improvement in the capacity for good governance."
Defining aid for trade
The report states that "one of the most contentious issues surrounding AfT" is the very definition of AfT itself, since it "is used to describe an extremely wide range of trade-related assistance measures provided to developing countries."
The report states that AfT currently incorporates trade policy and regulation, trade development, trade-related adjustment, trade-related infrastructure, and productive capacity. These categories, are, the report says, "valuable in that they reflect well the wide-ranging trade-related needs of developing countries" but overlap when used to define the different components of AfT. Before being used together with specific targets, and in order to avoid "unclear reporting and double counting" the report therefore states that it is necessary to reach "international consensus on their definition."
The scope of development
The report adds that development "is not simply economic development but also development in areas such as health, education, human rights, environmental protection and political freedom." The Aft agenda will therefore incorporate "specific assistance for putting in place legislation for the effective compliance with the core labour standards set out in the ILO conventions, and also appropriate and effective environmental legislation."
The report points out, however, that development in these areas "cannot be sustainably ensured in the absence of economic development, which generates the necessary resources."
National strategies
Creating the conditions necessary to promote increased trade and growth must be "first and foremost the responsibility of the country concerned" says the report. The role of AfT will be to support "comprehensive national strategies for capacity building" and through "strengthening institutions that improve transparency and accountability."
The report stresses that "country ownership is crucial" and in this respect, AfT must be "designed and implemented as an integral part of developing countries' own economic and developmental strategies." Consequently, Aft will provide "specific, tailor-made assistance" to developing countries "based on their own needs, strategies, priorities and assets."
Implementing AfT
In addition to providing aid that is "closely aligned with country priorities, procedures and systems", the reports adds that AfT should provide "substantial multi-annual, predictable aid" which is "delivered in time to address both short- and long-term priorities." In order to help achieve these objectives, the committee asks the Commission to set out "a specific work programme how it is going to implement its pledge to increase current and planned Community funding to support AfT from the current average of approximately EUR 850 million per year to EUR 1 billion per year."
There is also a need for "better coordination and coherence among various aid donors that reflects the proven competence of the agencies involved in delivering effective high-quality assistance in various AfT area." The report emphasises that "transparency in the delivery of aid and effective monitoring and evaluation are essential for building confidence in developing countries and for the continuous improvement of the quality of assistance."

EU can do more to reap from the "concrete benefits" of global trade
2007-05-15 - 18:05
The EU should strive to "promote increased global liberalisation and free and fair trade", which will "enable the EU to take advantage of globalisation, thereby boosting production and employment" according to a report drafted by the Committee on International Trade. Daniel CASPARY (EPP-ED, DE), author of the report, says that the EU has managed to achieve "a high degree of global competitiveness vis-à-vis its main competitors" but that there is still the need to maintain "a sufficiently wide and diversified industrial base."
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)
The report states that "the backbone of the EU's economic success is the activity of its SMEs which, through improved access to research and development opportunities, must be endowed with the ability to guarantee the production of high quality goods at the higher end of the value chain."
Furthermore, the report highlights the need to pursue a monetary policy which will to enable SMEs to "enter markets outside the Euro-zone" and "to establish business-friendly taxation systems that are likely to increase the number of start-ups and, to that end, to cut taxes that undermine efficiency and impede job creation, especially for particular social groups such as women, the long-term unemployed, and the elderly [.]"
Competition
In addition to its ability "to finance technological progress" this monetary policy should, the report says, "increase competition on the internal market, bearing in mind that the fiercer competition is within the EU, the more able EU-based companies will be to compete outside the EU."
Fair economic development
The EU's external policies should, however, also "promote compliance with social legislation and provisions on decent employment standards which, as proposed by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), guarantee a decent income for workers and their families, the right to safety and health at work and the right to social security and trade union freedoms [.]"
Regulation
The EU is "very attractive in the eyes of exporters the world over", states the report, and this allows for "considerable leverage...both in the multilateral framework and in the bilateral and regional framework." The EU therefore has a responsibility to "ensure that the EU's trading partners fully comply with rules and obligations" in order to enhance "the credibility and effectiveness of the multilateral trading system."

Economic partnership agreements: call for less onerous conditions for ACP countries
2007-05-15 - 18:05
The EU needs to reach new trade agreements with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries - known as Economic Partnership Agreements - by 1 January 2008. These would replace the current system of generalised preferences, which is incompatible with WTO rules. Given the delay in the talks and the lack of readiness on the part of the ACP countries, MEPs in the Trade Committee call in a report for the Commission to make the conditions for the agreements less onerous. The three objectives of these agreements - to facilitate access for ACP products to the European market via a free-trade area, to develop South-South trade and to support the process of regional integration - are causing concern in ACP countries, so the own-initiative report, drawn up by Robert STURDY (EPP-ED, UK) calls for the "pacing, timing and scope of liberalisation to be gradual and flexible in order to improve ACP regional integration and competitiveness."
MEPs in the committee ask for "duty-free, quota-free market access for the ACP as well as simplified, liberalised and more flexible rules of origin in EPAs that is the case under EBA [the 'Everything but Arms' initiative]".
Safeguard mechanism and parliamentary oversight
If agreements are not reached by 1 January 2008, when the derogation granted by the WTO comes to an end, the committee asks the Commission "not to exert undue pressure and […] to make efforts at WTO level to seek to ensure that disruption of existing ACP exports to the EU is avoided pending a final settlement." The state of advancement of the negotiations differs substantially between the various regions concerned. Talks with Central Africa, West Africa, East Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific countries are making slow progress, while the group of southern African countries has moved ahead more quickly.
To counter the effects of ending the system of non-reciprocal preferential tariffs, MEPs in the committee are calling for safeguard mechanisms to permit ACP regions to react to surges in imports from the EU, particularly of agricultural products. On the liberalisation of key services such as water, transport and energy, the report asks that this should respect the right of each country freely to regulate its public services.
The committee calls for "the ACP to bring forwards, with appropriate EU-assistance where required, detailed, costed proposals of how and for what additional EPA-related funds are needed, particularly with regard to: regulatory frameworks, safeguard measures, trade facilitation, support in meeting international SPS (Sanitary and Phytosanitary) and IP (Intellectual Property) standards, the composition of the EPA monitoring mechanism."
Finally, the report calls for the creation of a Parliamentary Oversight Committee on EPAs, to be made up of EU and ACP parliamentarians, which would meet alongside the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, rather than as a separate institution.

Call to scrap mandatory minimum excise duties on alcohol
2007-05-15 - 18:05
MEPs will debate a report calling for minimum levels of duty for alcoholic drinks should be scrapped. Instead, says the Economic Committee, Member States should adopt a code of conduct that encourages them to move towards the EU average level of duty. In 1992, the then 12 EU Member States unanimously agreed to set minimum levels for excise duties on beer, spirits and other alcoholic drinks apart from wine. The aim was to reduce the market distortions caused by widely differing excise levels. The Commission is now proposing that these minimum levels (which were set as absolute amounts, not as a percentage) should be increased in line with inflation since 1992.
The Committee, however, in a report by Astrid LULLING (EPP-ED, LU), argues that the minimum levels have failed to achieve the desired convergence in excise duties, and that they should therefore be scrapped. Instead, MEPs in the committee are proposing a code of conduct which would encourage Member States with duties above the EU average to freeze and gradually lower them, and those with duties below the average to consider raising them by an appropriate amount. In both cases, Member States could take into account their general economic situation - which would enable, for example, those countries hoping to meet the Maastricht criteria for joining the euro not to increase their inflation rates by quickly raising excise duties on alcohol.
The report was adopted in committee with 19 vote in favour, 15 against and 2 abstentions and will now be debated and put to the vote by the full Parliament.
As is usually the case for taxation policy, Parliament's view is consultative and any decision on whether to increase, reduce or scrap the minimum levels of duty will require unanimous agreement between the Member States in the Council.

CAP: yes to simplification, no to policy changes by the back door
2007-05-15 - 18:05
The Agriculture Committee is recommending that Parliament endorse the European Commission's proposal to simplify the EU's common agricultural policy by merging the 21 existing sector-specific market organisations (CMOs) into a single regulation. However, the committee says this decision should be solely "an act of technical simplification" and must not introduce reforms through the back door. In a consultation report by Niels BUSK (ALDE, DK) which was adopted by a large majority, members of the committee agreed that the new regulation should give the Commission powers to adopt market management decisions of a technical nature, i.e. secondary acts previously adopted by the EU Council of ministers. "It is reasonable to transfer regulatory competence to the Commission which can take decisions swiftly and effectively", argues the rapporteur.
Keep pig market intervention, include wines and fruit and vegetables later
All political provisions, however, should continue to be adopted by the Council after consulting the European Parliament, the committee insists. For this reason, members reject the scrapping of the intervention scheme for pig meat as a result of this simplification.
Moreover, MEPs argue that CMOs currently under revision, namely the fruit and vegetable and the wine sectors, should not be incorporated into the new regulation until ongoing policy reforms have been completed as this would anticipate the outcomes of these reform processes.
Four management committees to ensure sectoral expertise
According to the committee, establishing a single Management Committee for all agricultural sectors as suggested by the Commission would raise doubts as to how to ensure that the necessary sectoral expertise is available. MEPs therefore call for the setting up of four management committees, one for meat, one for dairy products, one for vegetables and one for perennial crops.
Keep carcasses classification system and import licences
The committee recommends that Community scales for the classification of beef, veal, pig and sheep carcases should still be established by the Council and not solely by the Commission.
When importing cereals, sugar, rice, flax and hemp, products from the milk, beef and veal sectors and the olive sector, mandatory import licenses should be maintained, with derogations only for cereal products, sugar or rice under certain conditions.
Contracts for sugar beet, interbranch organisations
MEPs also say that framework rules governing contractual relations between buyers and sellers of sugar beet should only define the minimum guarantees required by the growers and the sugar industry as the diversity of natural, economic and technical situations makes it difficult to provide for uniform purchase terms throughout the Community.
Lastly, they suggest that the new regulation refers to "organisations of an interbranch nature" rather than "interbranch organisations" to ensure that all sectoral bodies are targeted, whatever their designation or status.
Currently, there are 21 regulations on sector-specific CMOs in place including separate regulations on eggs, beef and veal, cereals and many more. The reform is intended to combine them into a single basic regulation so as to streamline and simplify the legal framework without changing the underlying agricultural policies of the EU. According to the Commission, this is possible because most of the existing regulations follow the same structure and have numerous provisions in common, such as rules concerning trade with third countries and general provisions.

Maize: Agriculture Committee against abolition of intervention system
2007-05-15 - 18:05
The Agriculture Committee will urge the plenary to oppose plans for scrapping the Community intervention system for the maize market from this year. The committee wants the European Commission to withdraw its draft legislation, arguing that it has not been properly evaluated and that the principles on which it is based do not take account of the sector's future prospects. The committee voted to reject the Commission proposal when it adopted a consultation report by Béla GLATTFELDER (EPP-ED, HU) by 24 votes to 10. Under the proposal, the intervention system for maize would be abolished, starting from the marketing year 2007/2008.
Other amendments proposing a gradual reduction in public purchases of maize, down to zero tonnes by 2009/2010 plus a review of the situation by the end of 2008, were therefore withdrawn. Even if the plenary endorses the committee's view, Parliament's position is not binding on the Council of Ministers, which has to take a decision on the Commission's proposal. However, it does send another strong political signal just a few weeks after MEPs reached a compromise with the Member States on another controversial issue, voluntary modulation.
Differences with the Commission over the market situation
The EU intervention system for cereals (maize, wheat, barley and sorghum) consists of a single price of €101.31 per tonne paid to farmers who sell their crops into public storage if they cannot sell them on the market. According to the Commission, Community stocks were 5.6 million tonnes in 2005/2006 and could reach 15.6 million tonnes by 2013. It stresses that growers in regions where production costs are lower and who are further from the main areas of consumption (essentially Hungary) have an interest in selling into intervention rather than trying to export.
Parliament's rapporteur argues, on the basis of professional forecasts, that the Commission's analysis assumes a linear increase in stocks which does not reflect market trends: a currently high market price of around €120/tonne, a lower than average crop yield in 2006 and a fall in intervention stocks to 4.28 million tonnes at the end of 2006, together with the expected increase in world consumption and the growth in the biofuels market, which is set to be an important market for maize.

MEPs to take final vote on organic production and labelling of organic products
2007-05-15 - 18:05
Following the vote of 29 March on organic production and labelling of organic products, the House is scheduled to take the final vote on this non-binding report. On 29 March, Parliament adopted several amendments to the proposed regulation in a report drafted by Marie-Hélène AUBERT (Greens/EFA, FR). However, Parliament did not vote to adopt the report, which has been referred back to the Agriculture Committee. MEPs want the right of co-decision in this area, which notably covers the production and distribution of transformed commodities in the internal market.

Research and innovation
A new innovation strategy for Europe
2007-05-15 - 18:05
Europe needs a broad-based innovation strategy to boost its competitiveness, says the Committee for Industry, Research and Energy in an own-initiative report which is to be put for approval to Parliament's plenary. To facilitate the transfer of knowledge between research centres and businesses, the committee suggests the creation of 'knowledge regions', a reform of European patent law and tax breaks for companies that invest in research and innovation. "The paradox of the situation in Europe is that we have highly developed centres for the development of knowledge - centres of excellence, but with little economic impetus to use that knowledge as a basis for developing innovative activities", states the author of the report, Adam GIEREK (PES, PL). To improve "knowledge transfer" between research centres and industry, the committee urges Member States to promote "knowledge regions" or "clusters" - i.e. regional networks of businesses, suppliers, and research centres, such as Silicon Valley in the USA. These clusters should build on the experience of Euroregions, which already possess established cross-border structures and social networks.
Furthermore, members of the committee stress that a future European Institute of Technology (EIT), which the Commission is proposing should be set up, should invest in the relationship between knowledge institutions and businesses by focusing on innovation. The institute should help "to boost competition in innovation fields" and could make "a significant contribution to translating Europe’s potential for innovation into practice."
Risk capital funds and tax breaks to stimulate innovation
According to the Industry Committee, the current venture capital system does not meet the funding needs of SMEs, microenterprises and entrepreneurs. Member States should therefore use public funds to establish risk capital funds in the form of public-private partnerships in regions and fields "having innovative potential and a sound knowledge base." MEPs are disappointed that so far "systematic public support with transparent conditions is missing." Member States should also introduce tax incentives to encourage companies to invest more in research, development and innovation.
Reform of European patent policy
MEPs stress the need to reform patent policy in Europe. "Reasonable and reliable copyright protection and patent systems are crucial elements in building an innovative knowledge-based economy and society" states the report. The Commission and Member States should therefore - in the context of the new Community patent - work on "a procedure for eliminating trivial patents and sleeping patents filed for the sole purpose of obstruction." The committee also calls for alternative legal measures to defend inventors and emerging models of creation against blackmail and abuse of the law, such as FLOSS (free/libre/open source software) licensing systems.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
EP set to adopt Daphne III programme on combating violence
2007-05-15 - 18:05
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality is proposing at the second reading report to adopt the Council common position on Daphne III, the EU's specific programme to prevent and combat violence against children, young people and women. After informal negotiations with the EP and the Commission, the Council incorporated many of Parliament's first reading amendments in its common position. The third phase of Daphne covers the period 2007-2013 and has a budget of €116.85 million. Daphne is a Community's programme, the aim of which is to prevent and combat all forms of violence against children, young people and women and to protect victims and groups at risk. The programme also regards as victims of violence children, young people or women who witness a near relative being assaulted.
Initially the Commission proposed a single programme covering both "Daphne" and "Drugs and Prevention and information" but on the Parliament's request it was split into the two programmes. Rapporteur Lissy GRÖNER 's (PES, DE) also believed that was the only way to ensure enough visibility for Daphne programme.
Many other amendments from the first reading were also taken on board by the Council, in particular the amendments aiming at improving the transparency of the programme, reducing the bureaucracy, and thus alleviating access to the programme for NGOs, and providing services to assist them in the preparation of the project proposals. Also the Women's Rights Committee has ensured that the highly successful helpdesk service will continue, and that a think-tank providing expert advice is to be set up. As part of the compromise, the EP and Council call on the Commission to consider a possible initiative for a European Year against violence against children, adolescents and women.
Daphne III is the third phase of Daphne and will build on the policies and objectives laid down in the Daphne I (2000-2003; €20 million) and Daphne II (2004-2007; €50 million) programmes. The programme is open to all the Member States as well as candidate countries, EFTA States and the countries of the western Balkans.
The decision enters into force one day after its publication in the Official Journal. Rapporteur Lissy GRÖNER PES DE A6-0147/2007 General programme "Fundamental Rights and Justice": specific programme "Fight against violence (Daphne III)", 2007-2013 Procedure : Codecision (2nd reading)

Employment policy
Greater efforts for promoting decent work in the EU and worldwide
2007-05-15 - 18:05
In order to better promote decent work for all, the Employment and Social Affairs Committee urges the Member States and the candidate countries to ratify and fully implement all relevant conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). MEPs in the committee also speak up for a decent work development programme, minimum wages and a label for products that are produced in conformity with core labour standards. Rapporteur Marie PANAYOTOPOULOS-CASSIOTOU (EPP-ED, EL) regrets that most countries did not ratify the ILO Conventions on health and safety at work, on maternity protection and on migrant workers. According to the committee the implementation of ILO conventions should also be part of the EU's neighbourhood and external policies. MEPs in the committee call for a decent work development programme that is funded by the EU in cooperation with the ILO. The EU should consider setting up mechanisms to monitor the parallel evolution of trade and decent work both at European and international level.
In order to improve the working conditions within the EU, MEPs in the committee plead for minimum wages "as a safety-net to prevent people from being exploited" and for broader access to lifelong learning opportunities and for greater harmonisation of pension schemes. The committee also recommends establishing a list of companies "which continuously and persistently permit the violation of core labour standards in any part of the production and supply chain." This list should be made available to EU-based importers. MEPs urge the Commission to develop a label for products that are produced under conditions that respect the principles of decent work and exclude any child labour input.
According to the committee, trade preferences with countries "which seriously and systematically breach fundamental social rights" should be temporarily suspended, says the text. The committee also proposes that the ILO be authorised to submit expert reports to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in cases where the violation of international conventions is disputed and in which the ILO's decisions have to be taken into account. Moreover, compliance with international work standards should be part of the negotiations for the accession of new member states to the WTO.

Justice and home affairs
MEPs to call for "significant legislative progress" in the fight against organised crime
2007-05-15 - 18:05
Existing legislation needs to be adapted in order to "bolster investigatory strategies" in the fight against organised crime, according to a report by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. The author of the report, Bill NEWTON DUNN (ALDE, UK), says that changes need to be made in areas such as "the obtaining of evidence and its admissibility, or financial information for the purpose of identifying and then neutralising the proceeds of crime." The report states that the relevant authorities must "urgently adapt the means and methods available" to them.
Action needed to "catch up with the reality"
The report urges that Council "call on the Member States to extend, as soon as possible, the use of special investigation techniques and promote the creation of joint investigation teams" as part of a drive to catch up with the "ultra sophisticated cooperation between the various criminal groups." To improve understanding of these criminal phenomena, the report calls for more effective "information channels between actors" which, together with "focusing and networking statistical tools" will ensure that "the intelligence disseminated not only provides an accurate assessment of organised crime but is comparable and proposes intelligible strategies and recommendations for action which the agencies active on the ground can apply."
Europol and Eurojust
The report also calls for "the necessary autonomy" to be given to the European Police Office (Europol) and the European Union's Judicial Co-operation Unit (Eurojust), by granting them "full powers of initiative within their respective fields of responsibility", thus enabling them to become "leaders in the fight against organised crime on a Europe-wide scale." The report cautions however that the extension of such powers must not undermine the activities of national authorities or lead to "imbalances or duplication", and thus any such expansion must be carried out with "genuine Parliamentary oversight."
Terrorism
Member States should continue to maintain "the utmost vigilance with regard to possible links between terrorist organisations and organised criminal groups, particularly in connection with money laundering and the funding of terrorism", the report says. In addition, the report urges to Council to "continue and intensify the [efforts] to [develop] a genuine ‘Internal Security Architecture’."
The Council is also asked to adopt "a strict framework including binding guarantees as regards fundamental rights" when drawing up EU policy on tackling organised crime.
Public support
The support of the general public towards such measures is "one of the conditions for success in the fight against organised crime" and the report calls for a "significant effort to inform the general public of the successes achieved through good cooperation between the various law enforcement agencies and legal bodies" highlighting the need to raise awareness of "the value added by EU initiatives in this area of vital importance for citizens."

Budget
Community Financial Aid in the field of trans European transport and energy networks
2007-05-15 - 18:05
Mario MAURO (EPP-ED, IT) for the Budgets Committee will be recommending that Parliament approve a Council common position on Community Financial Aid in the field of trans European transport and energy networks. This will end the process at second reading and the Regulation will enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. This Regulation aims to strengthen and adapt existing financial instruments through an increase in the level of Community co-financing by providing for the possibility of applying a higher Community co-financing rate, in particular for projects characterised by cross-border nature, their transit function, or by the crossing of natural barriers. The regulation should allow a better use of the existing networks, a removal of bottlenecks and the completion of missing links that will make possible to increase effectiveness and competitiveness and to guarantee an appropriate level of quality and reduction of saturation points and, therefore, better long-term viability.
Key points of the compromise agreed between EP and Council and successes for the European Parliament include:
- Community co-financing levels are set at
* a maximum of 20% for TEN-T of the eligible cost
* 30% for cross-border projects and 30 priority projects
* 10% in the field of energy
- Delayed projects can now be cancelled after four years instead of the two years Council wanted. The European Investment Bank will, in addition to the public-private partnership system, offer new instruments in the form of loan guarantees for a maximum of €500m until 2013.

EC-Russia agreement on cooperation in fisheries in the Baltic Sea
2007-05-15 - 18:05
The Fisheries Committee is proposing a non-binding report recommending the EP approve the conclusion of an Agreement between the European Community and Russia on cooperation in fisheries and the conservation of the living marine resources in the Baltic Sea. The Agreement has been concluded for an initial period of six years and will not entail any changes to the current structure of the Community fleet in the Baltic Sea nor on the way shared stocks are managed. The EP Fisheries Committee introduces a new article to the Commission proposal, stating that prior to the opening of negotiations on its possible renewal the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council general assessment reports analysing the impact of the agreement on the conservation of resources and the protection of the environment and the economic and social repercussions of its application. The report is drafted by the Chair of the Fisheries Committee - Philippe MORILLON (ALDE, FR)
The objective of the new Agreement is to ensure close co-operation between the EC and Russia on the basis of the principle of equitable and mutual benefit for the purpose of conservation, sustainable exploitation and management of all straddling, associated and dependent stocks in the Baltic Sea. It sets out provisions on joint management measures, licensing, compliance with conservation and management measures and other fisheries regulations, control and enforcement co-operation, inspections, arrest and detention of vessels, scientific co-operation and anadromous and catadromous species.
This new Agreement will replace the Gdansk Convention, which ceased to apply on 1 January 2007, and the existing bilateral fisheries Agreements between the Member States and the Russian Federation. Following the accession of Sweden and Finland to the Community in 1995 and Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland in 2004, elements of the fisheries agreements pertaining to maritime fisheries in the Baltic Sea concluded between these countries and Russia are now managed by the EC.
To achieve the objectives of this Agreement, a Joint Baltic Sea Fisheries Committee will be established, which will act as an important forum for scientific advice on the status of fish stocks in the Baltic Sea and on fisheries management.
Background
With the Russian Federation being responsible for only about 5% of the fishery resources of the Baltic Sea in very limited areas around Kaliningrad and St Petersburg, and with all waters in the Baltic Sea now under national jurisdiction, the Community’s view was that an international Convention between the two Parties was an inappropriate and disproportionate mechanism for discharging the Parties’ obligations to co-operate on fisheries management.
Instead it was considered that the fishery resources in the Baltic Sea should better be managed within the framework of a bilateral fisheries agreement between the European Community and the Russian Federation, which for the time-being should be limited to the Baltic Sea. In accordance with the Treaties of Accession, such an agreement should also integrate the existing bilateral Agreements between Russia and Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden respectively within a single bilateral agreement.
The Russian Federation at this stage has preferred not to extend the geographical scope of the Agreement beyond the Baltic. There are nevertheless provisions in the Agreement that would allow for a possible extension in the future if this is felt to be desirable by both Parties. It would, however, require a new or amended mandate to start negotiations which could entail fishing rights for Russian vessels in Community waters outside the Baltic Sea.

Fisheries
Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the EC, Denmark and Greenland
2007-05-15 - 18:05
With a view to replacing the Fisheries Agreement of 1985, the European Community, Denmark and Greenland have negotiated a new Fisheries Partnership Agreement which provides EC fishermen with fishing opportunities in waters in the exclusive economic zone of Greenland for a period of six years. The Fisheries Committee recommends the EP approve the conclusion of this Agreement with some amendments. In a report by Joop POST (EPP-ED, NL), MEPs in the committee propose some amendments to the Commission proposal concerning the compensation involving fishing opportunities and the right to adjust the quotas after 2010 in case they are found not to be in line with the EU’s own policy on sustainability.
In order to evaluate whether the compensation paid by the EU is properly accounted for and does in fact promote the sustainable use of fishery resources in Greenland, the Commission should report annually to the Parliament. MEPs also add that vessels that do not comply with the most basic requirement, reporting what they catch, should not benefit from financial support from the EU.
The proposed new Fisheries Partnership Agreement, which will be valid for a period of six years, beginning on 1 January 2007, differs from the previous agreement in a number of ways. The changes can be summarised as:
– reduction of the redfish, Greenland halibut East and snow crab quota in accordance with the scientific advice;
– increase in the quotas of Greenland halibut West of 1.000 tonnes and the shrimp East by 1.325 tonnes;
– removal of the direct fishery for roundnose grenadier in accordance with scientific advice as well as underutilisation by only allowing by-catches of this species;
– introduction of a cod quota of 1,000 tonnes in 2007 to be increased to 3,500 tonnes from 2008 and onwards.
The Agreement’s main objectives are to set out the principles and rules governing EC - Greenlandic fishery issues by encouraging economic, financial, technical and scientific co-operation in the fisheries sectors, promoting responsible fishing in Greenlandic waters, developing the fishing sector in Greenland, allowing Community fishing vessels access to the Greenlandic exclusive economic zone (EEZ), setting out the arrangements for regulating Community vessels operating in the EEZ, regulating measures aimed at conserving and managing fish stocks, preventing illegal, undeclared and unregulated fishing and encouraging partnerships between companies the purpose of which is to encourage fishing activities of common interest.
As far as the financial contribution is concerned, the EC proposes €15,847,244 per year. This includes a financial reserve of €1,540,000 to be paid in case the Community receives fishing opportunities for cod and/or capelin in addition to the quotas already set out in the Annex of the Agreement. An annual financial support of €3,261,449 will be earmarked for defining and implementing a sectoral fisheries policy in Greenland. On top of the financial contribution from the Community budget, the ship owners’ fees, fixed for each species as 5% of the average reference prices paid to Greenland, could amount to around €2m.
The minimum quantities for maintaining Greenlandic fishing activities are set, per year, as:
- Snowcrab: Western stock: 4,000;
- Cod: Western stock and Eastern stock: 30,000;
- Redfish: Western stock: 2.500; Eastern stock: 5,000;
- Greenland halibut: Western stock: 4.700; Eastern stock: 4,000; and
- Shrimp: Western stock: 25,000; Eastern stock: 1,500.
Background
The EC-Greenland Fisheries Agreement has acted as the main conduit for European financing programmes, be they fisheries related or not. Recognising the indistinct nature of such an arrangement the Council, acting upon advice from the Court of Auditors and the European Parliament, has urged the Commission to propose a new comprehensive partnership with Greenland upon the expiry of the Fisheries Agreement on 31 December 2006. The future comprehensive strategy will be based on a two pillar system:
- a Fisheries Agreement, entailing a clear identification of the payment corresponding to effective fishing possibilities – the purpose of the present proposal; and
- a specific Decision governing co-operation between the EU and Greenland which is not related to fisheries. Rapporteur Joop POST EPP-ED NL A6-0161/2007 EC/Denmark/Greenland fisheries agreement: fisheries partnership agreement 2006-2012 Procedure : Consultation

Regional policy
Maximising the impact of structural policies on cohesion
2007-05-15 - 18:05
Recommendations for maximising the economic and social impact of regional policy across the EU are set out in this own-initiative report by Francisca Pleguezuelos Aguilar (PES, ES). Regional policy is set to become the EU's largest budget item, and this report has one eye on the EU budget review agreed for 2008/2009. The Community strategic guidelines on cohesion say cohesion policy programmes co-funded by the EU and Member States (€308bn for national and regional aid programmes in 2007-2013) should aim to:
• improve the attractiveness of Member States, regions and cities by enhancing accessibility, ensuring adequate quality and level of services, and preserving their environmental potential;
• encourage innovation, entrepreneurship and the growth of the knowledge economy by building research and innovation capacities, including new information and communication technologies; and
• create more and better jobs, by attracting more people into employment and entrepreneurial activity, improving adaptability of workers and enterprises and increasing investment in human capital.
As approved in committee, this report, inter alia:
• stresses the need to develop an integrated structural policy, i.e. one that consistently combines support from the structural and cohesion funds with other Community policies (Para 2). It also urges the Commission to explore new ways of combining structural policies with other Community policies, so as to build synergies that can boost competitiveness, research and innovation (Para 6),
• calls on Commission and Council to assess whether earmarking at least 20% of structural funds for R&D and innovation for the next programming period is viable, not forgetting the small projects that drive sustainable development in less-favoured regions (Para 8),
• proposes using local and regional "technology facilitators" (financed by the structural funds and using existing resources such as Euro Info Centres and Innovation Relay Centres), to foster innovation by firms (Para 9),
• encourages the Commission to analyse the structural funds' leverage effect in attracting private investment, and underlines the need for public/private co-operation (Para 22),
• urges all stakeholders to seek to secure a territorial balance between urban and rural areas, encourage an integrated strategic approach to the development of urban, suburban and rural areas, and exchange good practice, especially within networks for improving the management of funds (Para 15),
• proposes using "relevant indicators" to measure the impact of structural policies on cohesion, and enabling the European Spatial Planning Observatory Network to do this (Para 12). Suggested territorial cohesion indicators include employment rate and quality, GDP disparities among neighbouring regions, decentralisation and accessibility, infrastructure and transport provision, product diversity and the level of research/innovation, education and training activity (Para 20), and
