Sweden's nomination of H.G. Wessberg to join the European Court of Auditors was endorsed by Parliament on Tuesday. Mr Wessberg will replace Lars Heikensten, who left to become Executive Director of the Nobel Foundation. Mr Wessberg will take up his duties once he has been formally appointed by the Council of Ministers, expected Friday 10 June.
When the Budgetary Control Committee interviewed Mr Wessberg on 24 May, MEPs praised his past performance in both the private and public sectors but were also worried by his lack of experience in auditing and claims that he had been involved in alleged manipulations of votes within his party.
MEPs voted for Mr Wessberg's appointment with 391 in favour, 91 against and 65 abstentions.
Although it is the Council of Ministers that formally decides on the appointments, it has become standard practice for the Council to consult Parliament on appointments to the Court. In√©s Ayala Sender (S&D, ES) is the MEP responsible for preparing the hearings with candidates to the Court of Auditors.
Sweden's resigning Court Member, had Lars Heikensten, has served on the Court since 2006. Once appointed, H.G. Wessberg will serve until the end of Sweden's mandate, that is until March 2012, and could then be re-elected for another mandate of six years.
