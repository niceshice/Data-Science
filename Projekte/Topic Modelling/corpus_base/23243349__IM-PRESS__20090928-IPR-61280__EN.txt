The President of the European Parliament, Jerzy Buzek, welcomed on Friday the final steps in the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty in Germany.
German Federal President Horst Köhler signed the accompanying laws to the Lisbon Treaty earlier in the week and the final ratification act on Friday. The ratification instruments are now on their way to Rome to be official deposited.
EP President Jerzy Buzek said: "I strongly welcome President Köhler's signature as the final step in Germany's ratification of the Lisbon Treaty. Germany’s ratification of the Lisbon Treaty is another significant move towards ensuring that the Treaty of Lisbon, which will make the EU more democratic and effective, enters into force soon as soon as possible."
"Germany’s ratification sends a strong message ahead of the referendum in Ireland on 2 October," EP President Buzek said.
