Two-day Brussels Plenary. Wednesday from 3pm
The October Brussels plenary session begins at 3pm with a one-hour debate on the recent nuclear tests carried out by North Korea. Prior to the debate MEPs will hear from Javier Solana - the EU's foreign policy chief, the European Commission and Council. The debate on preparations for the forthcoming informal meeting of Heads of State and government (to be held on 20 October in Lahti, Finland) will start at 4pm. Energy, illegal immigration and innovation policy will be discussed.
At 5.30pm, the House will debate the PNR (Passenger Name Records) Agreement with the US. Commissioner Franco Frattini will open the debate. The interim Agreement, which will be submitted for approval by the EU Council as soon as possible, provides legal certainty by replacing the Agreement of May 2004 between the European Community and the US, following the Court of Justice of the European Communities judgment of 30 May 2006. This debate is followed by Commission and Council statements on South Ossetia and Transnistria, with MEPs voting on resolutions on Thursday. Relations between Georgia and Russia have deteriorated over recent weeks over allegations of spying. MEPs then turn their attention to the issue of footwear imports from China. On the basis of oral questions to the Council and Commission, MEPs will have the opportunity to debate the merits of this week's Council decision to levy import duties on shoes from China and Vietnam. An own-initiative report on the protection and welfare of animals 2006-2010 will also be introduced. The Agriculture Committee believes that "consumers should be informed and prepared to pay higher prices for products originating from farms with higher animal welfare standards and that these products should be appropriately labelled".
On Thursday the session starts with a joint debate on the EU Fundamental Rights Agency. The Civil Liberties Committee is insisting that the remit of the future EU Agency for Fundamental Rights be extended to third pillar issues such as policing, justice, immigration and counter-terrorism. It also wants not only EU Member States and candidate countries but also those with association agreements to come within the agency's scope. The European Parliament will also vote on a resolution on the future of EU patents following the debate held in Strasbourg on 28 September.
