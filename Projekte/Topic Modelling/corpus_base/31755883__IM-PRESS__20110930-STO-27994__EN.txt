Vote in committee The EU has had legislation in place to prevent and control major accidents in the chemical industry since 1976, following an accident at a pesticides and herbicides plant in Seveso, Italy. Now, a year after the red sludge disaster at an alumina plant in Hungary, the Environment Committee is voting on revisions to the Seveso II rules. Hungarian Christian Demcrat János Áder, who is steering the legislation through parliament told us more.
What are the main changes that you propose or support for the revision of the Seveso directive?
The main changes proposed are the introduction of a highly-sophisticated classification system based on international standards, designed to understand hazards to human health and the environment with a higher degree of precision; an improvement of the regulation on inspections; better understanding of the possible domino effect between industrial establishments; reinforced exchange of information and cooperation between member states; and improved competitiveness for smaller companies through a lower level of obligations.
A year after the red sludge catastrophe in Hungary, what lessons has the EU learnt?
We realise with regret that the EU currently has no financial instruments at its disposal to provide effective and immediate damage control when industrial catastrophes occur. I believe that the EU needs a safety network , an effective insurance framework and we have to open discussions on this issue as soon as possible.
How will public access to information improve the prevention of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances?
The major change proposed is the alignment of new obligations in international agreements concluded by the EU over the last decade. The public will be provided with better quality and up-to-date information about operations mostly through the Internet. The publication of adequate information on how the population concerned will be warned and kept informed in the event of a major accident, as well as what action they should take is, a major step forward. The aim is to provide essential information in an easily understandable form to interested citizens, while respecting national security concerns and the legitimate confidentiality of businesses.
