"Deep despair" was how one MEP described people's feelings after meeting just some of the 1.5 million Iraqi refugees who have fled to Syria. Driven by continued violence in their homeland and by close geographical and cultural links, almost 2.5 million Iraqis are believed to have fled to Syria and Jordan. A cross-party delegation of MEPs visited Damascus from 10-15 September to assess for themselves the refugee crises there and how the Syrian authorities are coping.
The visit came amid a recent imposition of visas on Iraqi refugees by Damascus. Prior to the 10 September visa deadline it was estimated that 30,000 people were arriving every month. The influx has put immeasurable strain on the Syrian health, housing and school system as the population has jumped 7% due to the influx.
Syrian schools and hospitals struggle to cope
The MEPs found that in particular the health system was under enormous strain. In July the country's Health Minister Maher Hosami told a World Health Organisation conference that the health care cost for Iraqi refugees in Syria has reached $60 million (€43.3 million). In addition the Syrian school system has had to raise the number of Iraqi students who are enrolled to 100,000 students. The current number of Iraqi children at school is some 32,000.
The refugees also suffer from poverty and unemployment as the arrivals struggle to find work once they arrive in Syria. This can lead to desperate measures as people try to feed themselves.
The nine MEPs who made up the delegation met with senior Syrian officials and religious leaders. Among the topics they discussed were the Association Agreement with the EU, political and economic reforms and the Middle East peace process. The delegation also visited hospitals where Iraqi refugees are being treated. What they saw and heard made a profound impression on them.
Health situation "desperate"
Béatrice Patrie - the French Socialist who headed the delegation - said that "the feeling that one could perceive in them was one of deep despair, especially since as their return to their homes is not going to happen tomorrow". UK MEP John Purvis (EPP-ED) described the situation as "desperate and rather pathetic" after visiting a hospital. He said "it was more a dispensary and consulting facility than a hospital" - despite the fact that serious illnesses were being treated there.
In terms of financial assistance the EU has allocated €4 million through ECHO - its Humanitarian Aid Office. A further €11 million has been pledged for specific health and education programmes. Ms Patrie called for international financial assistance to be increased and said that the European Parliament would try and raise international awareness of the problems the refugees face. Speaking of where moral blame for the crises lies, Mr Purvis said "it is rather hypocritical of us to expect Syria and Jordan to take the burden of the refugees".
Given the current situation, a return to Iraq for the refugees is not likely in the near future. One of the MEPs who was on the visit - Italian Socialist Pasqualina Napoletano - called for a "local solution" as the refugees are fleeing to Arabic countries and not trying to reach Europe. However, she warned that "the situation could become still more dramatic if we do not act immediately - because Syria has started to close the borders".
Internal refugees
The 2.5 million people who have fled Iraq is almost matched by the 2.2 million who are displaced internally - where they have fled violence for "safer" areas. This flight - often along religious and ethnic grounds has accelerated the increasing fragmentation of Iraq.
