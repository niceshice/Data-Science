Parliament is calling for clarification and consolidation of the EUâ€™s legislative framework for the asset management industry. This comes in an own-initiative report drawn up by Wolf Klinz (ALDE, DE) and adopted by a large majority.
The report says the interaction between the UCITS (undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities) directive, the MiFID (markets in financial instruments directive) and its level 2 measures and the E-commerce directive leaves undesirable scope for interpretation. It calls on the Commission and the other EU bodies involved (CESR and CEIOPS) to ensure a high level of transparency and management of conflicts of interests, notification requirements and thus equal treatment between UCITS and competing products.
The report makes recommendations on a range of issues: investor information and protection, risk management, European passports, management company and depository passports, fund processing standardisation, cross-border consolidation, distribution structures, investment policy, non-UCITS investments, supervision issues and the Lamfalussy process.
