Briefing - 3-6 September 2007 - Strasbourg
2007-08-30 - 09:05
Selected highlights include:
Following the summer recess, MEPs return to Strasbourg for the first of two plenary sessions in September. The Portuguese President Aníbal Cavaco Silva will formally address the European Parliament. Parliament will give its views on the summer's "natural" disasters, counter-terrorism measures, the recent instability in the financial markets, combating alcohol related harm and the restrictions imposed on liquids that passengers can take on board aeroplanes. The House will also debate and vote on a first-reading legislative report on the inland transport of dangerous goods.
Monday 3 September
The session starts with a MEPs giving their reaction to the tragic fires in Greece . The Commission will make statement entitled "forest fires in Greece, their consequences and conclusions to be drawn for prevention and alert measures." MEPs will vote on a resolution on Tuesday on "natural disasters". A debate on this subject was also held in Strasbourg on 11 July 2007.
Following this, the House turns its attention to a joint debate on better regulation in the EU . The House will debate four own-initiative reports on better regulation, subsidiarity and proportionality, the simplification of the regulatory environment and on so called "soft law" instruments. On the latter, the Legal Affairs Committee says soft law all too often constitutes an ambiguous and ineffective instrument which is liable to have a detrimental effect on Community legislation and institutional balance and should be used with caution, even where it is provided for in the Treaty.
Tuesday 4 September
Tuesday starts with MEPs debating an own-initiative report on the review of the single market . As MEPs in the committee underline, an improvement in the functioning of the Single Market is still necessary. "There is a need", reads the report, "to complete the opening of network industries, such as transport, telecommunications, postal services and energy transport."
MEPs will debate the risk of closure of the Gdansk shipyard . The shipyard is the birth place of the celebrated Solidarity trade union. Under EU rules, state aid for struggling shipyards can only be granted if it is accompanied by extensive cost-cutting aimed at restoring long-term viability
The House will then turn its attention to a first-reading report on the inland transport of dangerous goods . The Transport Committee recommends endorsing a Commission proposal to harmonise the rules for the transport of dangerous goods by making them as user-friendly as possible. Committee rapporteur Boguslaw Liberadzki (PES, PL) says that the new proposal integrates the existing rules into one piece of EU law which will cover the land transport modes - road and rail - and include inland waterway transport as well.
A report on the EU strategy to aid Member States in the their efforts to reduce alcohol related harm will also be debated and voted on by the European Parliament. The own-initiative report raises several issues including: labelling and health warnings, binge-drinking, "alcopops" and reducing accidents caused by drinking and driving.
The European Parliament will deal with three reports on the milk sector . School milk aid needs to be raised, and the necessary adjustments to Europe's dairy market should not jeopardise the existing private storage scheme. This is the thrust of a series of reports being proposed.
At midday on Tuesday, the President of Portugal Aníbal Cavaco Silva will address the House in a formal sitting.
Tuesday afternoon is dedicated to the EU 2008 budget with its presentation by the Council . Parliament's first reading of the 2008 Budget in committee is expected to take place on the first week of October, with the view to a plenary vote on 25 October. The 2008 draft budget at first reading amounts to: €128.4bn in commitment appropriations and €119.4bn in payment appropriations.
Wednesday 5 September
The House will debate the fight against terrorism on Wednesday morning. The House will also vote on a resolution in October on this topic. The European Union is committed to jointly combating terrorism and to providing for the best possible protection for its citizens. Through good co-operation, several terrorist attacks in Europe have been prevented, and arrests and convictions obtained.
MEPs will vote on a resolution on restrictions imposed by the EU on liquids that passengers can take on board aeroplanes . The Transport Committee calls upon the Commission to review "urgently and on an ongoing basis" the EU-regulation regarding the introduction of liquids onto aircraft. In a draft resolution, MEPs express their concern that the costs engendered by the regulation may not be proportionate to the added value achieved by additional security provisions.
On Wednesday afternoon, MEPs will debate the recent instability in the world's financial markets with the Council and Commission, the day before the European Central Bank (ECB) makes its latest decision on interest rates. Increasing numbers of people defaulting on their loans in the so-called "sub-prime" mortgage market in the United States (where banks lent at higher interest rates to customers with poor or non-existent credit histories) have left a number of lenders in the sector in difficulties.
Also on Wednesday afternoon, the House will debate a report on human rights dialogue . Parliament will debate and vote on an own-initiative report by the Foreign Affairs Committee which calls on the Commission and Council to ensure a greater degree of coherence in the EU's human rights dialogues with third countries. MEPs in the committee particularly stress the need for Parliament to be informed of the content of ongoing dialogues and urge the use of more stringent criteria and monitoring mechanisms.
Thursday 6 September
Parliament will debate and vote on a report on the review of the consumer acquis . The report recommends that the scope of this review concentrate on updating and creating coherence between the eight consumer protection directives named in the Green Paper.
The House will also votes on a report on international health regulations. An own-initiative report by the Environment Committee calls for swift implementation throughout the EU of the International Health Regulations (IHR) as revised in 2005 by the World Health Assembly (WHA).
As is usual, the session ends with three debates and votes on human rights issues in the world. On this occasion, the topics are: Burma, Bangladesh and the financing of the Special Court for Sierra Leone.
A pre-session briefing will be held at the European Parliament in Brussels at 11am on Friday 31 August 2007 - PHS 0A50 A last minute pre-session press briefing will be held in Strasbourg on Monday 3 September 2007 at 4.30pm - Room LOW N-1/201.

A summer of "natural" disasters: MEPs to vote on a parliamentary resolution
2007-08-30 - 09:05
The plenary opens on Monday at 5pm with MEs giving their reaction on the forest fires in Greece, their consequences and conclusions to be drawn for prevention and alert measures. MEPs will vote on a resolution on the issue of natural disasters on Tuesday. Following widespread disasters across Europe this summer including floods, droughts and forest fires (although arson or accidents could be the cause in some cases), MEPs will vote on a resolution on this topic. The House held a debate on 11 July in Strasbourg on natural disasters (see link).
Fires in Greece - Commission response
Seven fire-fighting Canadair planes supplied by France, Italy and Spain are currently helping Greece combat the devastating fires that broke out on Friday and have claimed at least 50 lives. Another Canadair from Portugal arrives today and offers for help are still coming in from the members of the Community Mechanism for Civil Protection coordinated by the European Commission. Nine specialised helicopters are also being despatched. This is the biggest offer of assistance to a Member State since the Mechanism was set up in 2001.
Greece has asked the European Commission's Monitoring and Information Centre (MIC) to request European partners to provide water-bombing aircraft to help fight the fires which have been affecting the country since the beginning of the summer but which have struck with particular violence in the last 48 hours.
Since the beginning of the summer, MIC has managed a total of 13 requests from assistance from six countries. The mechanism facilitates the provision of civil protection assistance both in and outside the European Union.
In its wish to further strengthen the civil protection system in Europe, the Commission together with Member States, has started developing the idea of setting up so-called response modules. These modules consist of readily-deployable, pre-defined specialised clusters of personnel and equipment. Eleven key modules have been identified, one of them being a forest fire-fighting module. These units or modules could expect an initiative early this autumn.
Floods in the UK in June and July - application to EU Solidarity Fund
On 20 August, the British government submitted an application to the European Commission for support from the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF, see link hereunder) to help recovery from the recent flooding in the UK. The British government said that a provisional assessment of damage caused by the June and July floods lies at over €4bn - significantly above the €3bn threshold required for a Member State to make an application.
The European Commission will decide if the application is successful. If successful, the British government expects resources to be available in nine to twelve months time.
The EUSF was established in November 2002 to provide financial assistance in the aftermath of major disasters in Member States and pre-accession countries, which cannot be covered by the regular EC Budget. Under the provisions governing the EUSF up to €1bn can be provided in a given budget year to fund uninsurable costs including emergency relief and reconstruction operations, above that provided for in the EU’s spending plans for the period 2007 to 2013.
The UK has to complete a detailed application form including a description of which areas of the UK were affected, the economic and social repercussions of the disaster and the total amount of direct damage caused.
UK and Commission officials will then discuss the final detail of the application and resolve any issues. The Commission will then carry out internal consultations and determine an amount of grant that would be appropriate in the circumstances. The Commission will then recommend a grant for approval by the European Council and European Parliament . The UK and the Commission then sign an agreement on how the grant will be implemented and the money paid.
Debate in July in Strasbourg
During the debate, Linda McAVAN (PES, UK) said: "I hope the British Government is looking to make an assessment of the overall damage in the North of England, Yorkshire and the Humber, and I hope that the Commission will look sympathetically at any bid for the solidarity fund which comes forward.
Looking to the longer term, there has been a lot of debate about whether this was just freak weather or whether it is the impact of climate change. I very much welcome the Commission’s Green Paper on adaptation to climate change. I think this is a very important piece of work and something we all need to make sure we get right so we do not have to come and debate natural disasters of this kind year upon year."

Coordinated measures to stop the spread of diseases
2007-08-30 - 09:05
An own-initiative report by the Environment Committee calls for swift implementation throughout the EU of the International Health Regulations (IHR) as revised in 2005 by the World Health Assembly (WHA). The IHR is an international legal instrument which aims to prevent the spread of disease and provide a public health response proportionate to the risks.
The Environment Committee's report, drafted by its chair Miroslav Ouzký (EPP-ED, CZ), points out that "in a highly mobile and globalising world the need for public health protection with an all-European and international dimension is growing" and that "priority should be given to ensuring maximum protection against the global spread of infectious disease and public health emergencies of international concern".
In particular, the committee backs the WHAs call for "voluntary early application of certain IHR aspects relating to avian and human pandemic influenza". While acknowledging the Member States' right to organise their own health services, the report argues that the IHR regulations are best implemented in a coordinated manner EU-wide and that the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the EU Early Warning and Response System for public health threats can play a useful role in this matter.

President of Portugal - Aníbal Cavaco Silva to address Parliament
2007-08-30 - 09:05
The President of Portugal Aníbal Cavaco Silva will make a formal address on Tuesday 4 September at midday. Portugal currently holds the six-month rotating Presidency of the EU Council. • Aníbal Cavaco Silva was inaugurated as the 19th President of the Portuguese Republic on March 9th 2006. He had been elected in the first round of the presidential election held on January 22nd, in which he stood as an independent candidate.
• President Cavaco Silva recommended an active role by Portugal in the European Union and declared the importance of building up a healthy transatlantic relationship.
• Born on July 15th 1939 in Boliqueime, Loulé (Algarve), President Aníbal Cavaco Silva’s name was linked, as prime minister, to the longest period of political stability seen in Portugal in recent decades; the only party leader to achieve two consecutive absolute majorities, making him the longest-serving Portuguese prime minister under democracy (1985-95).
• Cavaco Silva played an active role in the process that led to the acceleration of European construction in response to the new geopolitical situation that followed the fall of the Berlin wall. He played a central part in several major decisions, influencing the options written into the Treaty of Maastricht – especially with regard to economic and social cohesion and the specific situations of the Member States – and ensured that the escudo was in a position to join the European Monetary System, creating the conditions for Portugal to be one of the first countries of the single European currency.
• He took part in 29 European Councils. During the first half of 1992, under his leadership, Portugal took over the rotating presidency of the European Union for the first time.
• In relations with the Portuguese-speaking world, Cavaco Silva promoted change with a view to the democratic stabilisation of the African regimes, having sponsored the Angolan peace talks and supported an identical process in Mozambique. It was also under his leadership that Portugal was at the centre of the creation of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP) and of the decision to hold Portuguese-Brazilian summits every year.
• On September 7th 1995 he was distinguished in Germany with the Carl Bertelsmann Prize that the Bertelsmann Foundation decided to award to Portugal for the success of its policies directed at improving the labour market and the fight against unemployment during the time Aníbal Cavaco Silva was in office as prime minister. He also received the Joseph Bech Prize (1991) in Luxembourg and the Robert Schumann Medal (1998) for his contribution to European construction, and the Freedom Prize (1995) in Switzerland, awarded by the Schmidheiny Foundation for his activities as a politician and economist.
• He has published a large number of works, with a particular focus on the following books: O Mercado Financeiro Português em 1966 (The Portuguese Financial Market), Economic Effects of Public Debt, Política Orçamental e Estabilização Económica (Budget Policy and Economic Stabilisation), A Política Económica do Governo de Sá Carneiro (The Economic Policy of the Sá Carneiro Government), Finanças Públicas e Política Macroeconómica (Public Finance and Macroeconomic Policy), As Reformas da Década (The Reforms of the Decade), Portugal e a Moeda Única (Portugal and the Single Currency), União Monetária Europeia (European Monetary Union). Formal sitting: Address by President of the Republic of Portugal

The Single Market Review: tackling barriers and inefficiencies
2007-08-30 - 09:05
It has created millions of jobs, extra prosperity, higher exports and increased investment, delivering benefits to businesses and consumers alike. Still, almost 15 years since its coming into existence (on 1 January 1993), the EU's Single Market remains a work in progress. Members of the EP's Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection make clear their vision of a Single Market for the 21st century in an own-initiative report by Jacques TOUBON (EPP-ED, FR). In the report, committee members welcome the Commission’s work on the Single Market Review (SMR), noting that the Review - which aims to review existing mechanisms and to identify gaps - is an opportunity to demonstrate the benefits to be reaped from the effective implementation of the internal market. As MEPs in the committee underline, an improvement in the functioning of the Single Market is still necessary. "There is a need", reads the report, "to complete the opening of network industries, such as transport, telecommunications, postal services and energy transport."
Procurement rules
The report also stresses that public contracts must be awarded in a fair and transparent manner, observing public procurement rules, and that they may also help promote innovation and technological development and help respond to environmental and social concerns, including accessibility for disabled people. The committee calls on the Commission to encourage Member States to improve access for SMEs to public procurement contracts and to apply pre-commercial procurement to improve the innovative capacity of the Single Market.
The report, authored by Jacques Toubon (EPP-ED, FR) focuses on a number of areas where room for improvement is visible and reforms necessary. To that effect, the committee:
- holds the view that tackling climate change and ensuring sustainable development are of paramount importance, and can be achieved only with a balanced energy mix, and that a Single Market policy promoting sustainable and competitive energy is vital to those ends;
- regrets that insufficient emphasis was placed on the potential contribution of nuclear power;
- urges the Commission to adopt a global strategy concerning intellectual property rights, highlighting the importance of establishing a Community Patent
- underlines the importance of a SM policy promoting sustainable and competitive energy -- regretting, however, "that insufficient emphasis [is] placed on the potential contribution of nuclear power"
- points out that 25% of the goods manufactured in the European Union are still not covered by harmonisation measures. The report calls on Member States, therefore, to make full use of the principle of mutual recognition to ensure the free movement of goods in the interest of consumers and businesses - insists on the pursuit of harmonisation in key areas, in particular retail financial services (including means of payment) and taxation
- urges the Commission to push ahead with its proposals concerning a common consolidated corporate tax base
- stresses the importance of encouraging the free movement of workers within the internal market
- welcomes the Commission's initiatives to identify common principles on Services of General Interest, noting that "strong and modern services of general interest are necessary in order to achieve public interest objectives"
- calls on the EU to position itself with regard to future trends in the global economy so as to ensure the efficiency of its trade defence and sustainable competitiveness; believes that the Transatlantic Internal Market "could be one of the appropriate instruments to achieve this"
- believes that the present VAT and excise duty systems are a barrier to the completion of the Single Market, in particular in relation to cross-border trade. The committee calls on the Commission to investigate tax problems related to personal mail order and Internet shopping, and to come forward with proposals for facilitating EU citizens' full benefit from the free movement of goods.

Better regulation in the EU - plain and simple language is key
2007-08-30 - 09:05
As part of a joint debate on better regulation in the EU, Katalin LÉVAI (PES, HU) for the Legal Affairs Committee will be putting forward an own-initiative report entitled "Better Regulation in the EU." The report strongly supports the process of Better Regulation with a view to strengthening the effectiveness, efficiency, coherence, accountability and transparency of EU law. Plain and simple language
The committee insists that, when presenting a legislative proposal, the Commission must avoid unclear and redundant expressions and preferably use plain and comprehensible language, whilst retaining terminological precision and legal certainty. The committee considers, in particular, that the practice of using incomprehensible acronyms and the over-abundance of needless recitals must be abandoned. The report encourages all levels of government to use, whenever possible, clear language that is easily understandable by citizens.
Gold plating
The reports deplores Member States' practice of 'gold plating', and calls upon the Commission to investigate what further measures might be taken to prevent it, including the introduction of a right of direct action for citizens. The report calls for 'follow-up impact assessments' analysing how decisions are in fact implemented in Member States and at local level. The committee supports the increased use, where appropriate, of regulations.
Impact assessments
The report accepts that the Council, like Parliament, must consider the impact of its major amendments upon the Commission's impact assessment. The committee stresses the need for cost-benefit analyses that better reflect the complex regulatory cost structures when directives are implemented by way of national legislation and change the regulatory framework within which companies and individuals operate. The report strongly advocates transparency and independent scrutiny of the carrying-out of impact assessments.
The committee agrees with the Commission that better lawmaking cannot be achieved without an overall picture of the economic, social, environmental, health and international impact of each legislative proposal. The report fully supports, therefore, the setting-up within the Commission of an Impact Assessment Board under the authority of the Commission's President in order to monitor the application of these principles in the drafting of impact assessments by the responsible staff of the Commission. The committee stresses, nevertheless, that, in order to guarantee a minimum level of independent scrutiny in the drafting of impact assessments, an independent panel of experts should be set up to monitor, by means of spot checks, the quality of opinions delivered by the Impact Assessment Board, and that representatives of interested parties should also be allowed to assist in conducting them.

Subsidiarity and proportionality - independent impact assessments needed
2007-08-30 - 09:05
Bert DOORN (EPP-ED, NL) will be presenting a second own-initiative report on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. The report considers that bad regulatory quality in the Member States and at Community level weakens the rule of law and alienates citizens from their institutions. The Legal Affairs Committee stresses the importance of adequate and independent impact assessments, based on wide-ranging consultation of stakeholders. Do nothing?
The committee calls on the Commission to provide a sufficient number of scenarios and policy options (including ‘do-nothing’ options if necessary) as a basis for cost-effective and sustainable solutions.
Reduce administration costs by 25 % by 2012
The report welcomes the Commission action programme to measure the administrative cost for undertakings in Europe and to reduce needless and disproportionate administrative burdens by 25% by 2012. The committee notes that the strategy for a 25% reduction refers to needless administrative burdens for undertakings and cannot, therefore, be equated to a deregulation, nor lead to a change in the policy objectives and level of ambition contained in Community legislation. The report calls on the Commission to ensure that the reduction in needless administrative burdens arising from regulations should not be at the expense of the original objectives of the regulations concerned.
In this light, the committee supports the Commission proposal for the introduction of thresholds for all information requirements, limiting them for SMEs wherever possible.
MEPs in the committee call on the Member States to extend their efforts to reduce the burden resulting from purely national legislation.

MEPs to welcome strategy for the simplification of the regulatory environment
2007-08-30 - 09:05
Giuseppe GARGANI (EPP-ED, IT) for the Legal Affairs Committee will be tabling an own-initiative report on a strategy for the simplification of the regulatory environment. The report welcomes the fact that, for the first time, the simplification initiatives have been included in the Commission’s legislative and work programme for 2007, in confirmation of the political priority to be given to the simplification strategy. The committee calls on the Commission systematically to include from now on the simplification initiatives in a specific part of the legislative and work programme, to indicate therein what priority it intends to give to each individual simplification initiative and, to that end, to set out its simplification proposals already in its annual policy strategy at the start of the annual legislative programming process. The report calls on the Commission to avoid the proliferation of documents containing lists of simplification initiatives, in order to have as clear a reference framework as possible.
National level
The report calls on the Commission to make every effort to ensure that the process being promoted at European level to simplify regulation and generally to improve its quality is not undermined at national level by internal rules or technical barriers. It calls on the Commission to guide and monitor this process also at national level, for instance by acting as a centre for collecting and disseminating the best practices developed within the European Union and its Member States and, not least, responding to indications from stakeholders.
Finally, MEPs in the committee stress that regular and thorough impact assessments play a key role in the simplification process and that such assessments should be considered by the Council and Parliament when amendments are made to a proposal during the legislative process.

Manuel MEDINA ORTEGA (PES, ES) for the Legal Affairs Committee will be tabling an own-initiative report on the institutional and legal implications of the use of "soft law" instruments. The report considers that, in the context of the Community, soft law all too often constitutes an ambiguous and ineffective instrument which is liable to have a detrimental effect on Community legislation and institutional balance and should be used with caution, even where it is provided for in the Treaty. The report recalls that so-called soft law cannot be a substitute for legal acts and instruments, which are available to ensure the continuity of the legislative process, especially in the field of culture and education.
Consumers
MEPs call on the Commission to give special consideration to the effect of soft law on consumers and their possible means of redress before proposing any measure involving soft-law instruments.
Sharing of best practice
The report considers the open method of coordination to be legally dubious, as it operates without sufficient parliamentary participation and judicial review. The committee believes that it should therefore be employed only in exceptional cases and that it would be desirable to consider how Parliament might become involved in the procedure.

The fight against terrorism
2007-08-30 - 09:05
The Council and Commission will make statements on the fight against terrorism based on oral questions from MEPs. The House will also vote on a resolution in October on this topic. The European Union is committed to jointly combating terrorism and to providing for the best possible protection for its citizens. Through good co-operation, several terrorist attacks in Europe have been prevented, and arrests and convictions obtained. As from 15 June 2007, travellers entering or leaving the EU are required to make a declaration to customs authorities if they are carrying €10,000 or more in cash (or its equivalent in other currencies or easily convertible assets such as non crossed cheques). This legislation aims to introduce an EU-wide common approach to controlling cash movements into and out of the EU. It complements the EU's Money Laundering Directive which has already introduced a monitoring of transactions made through credit and financial institutions.
Prüm Treaty
The Justice and Home Affairs Council reached agreement in June, after the EP had been consulted on a Council Decision on the stepping up of cross-border co-operation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime, incorporating in the framework of the Union important provisions of the Prüm Treaty dealing with police co-operation and information exchange on DNA-profiles, fingerprints and vehicle number-plates.
These elements of the Prüm Treaty, an international police co-operation agreement signed by Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Austria on 27 May 2005, have now become part of the legislative framework of the European Union and will be implemented in all Member States.
After this implementation, designated contact points of the law enforcement agencies in the Member States will have mutual access to each others' DNA, fingerprint and vehicle registration information systems.
Questions to the Council
Manfred WEBER (DE), on behalf of the EPP-DE Group, Martine ROURE (FR), on behalf of the PES Group, Alexander ALVARO (DE), on behalf of the ALDE Group will be putting the following questions to the Council on the fight against terrorism:
Since 9-11, 3-11 and the London bombings, the EU has adopted an EU Counter-Terrorism Strategy, an EU Counter-Terrorism Action Plan, a Framework Decision on terrorism and several initiatives to strengthen the coordination between the Member States and between the latter and the European Institutions with the support of the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator.
At inter-institutional level there was no formal involvement of the EP but in 2006 the Council launched the 'High-Level Political Dialogue on Counter-Terrorism between the main European Institutions involved in the fight against terrorism', highlighting the importance of democratic accountability.
At administrative level there have already been two peer evaluations between the Member States on the implementation of the European Union Strategy, and Europol, Eurojust and SITCEN have just started their assessment of the evolution of the threat at European level.
Now it appears that, notwithstanding all the initiatives cited above, the EU has since experienced a number of attempted terrorist attacks, which gives rise to a number of questions:
Does the European Council intend to carry out, with the involvement of the European Parliament and of the national parliaments, a comprehensive evaluation of all counter-terrorism measures adopted until now as well as an assessment of their effectiveness and level of implementation by Member States? And how will Member States be associated?
How does the Council intend to overcome the shortcomings raised in the last Europol-SITCEN report on terrorism and take stock of the MS replies to the 2006 Eurojust questionnaire on the implementation of the Framework Decision on terrorism?
Which other measures have been adopted but not correctly implemented by whom and for which reasons ?
Will the Council now focus on the implementation of the current measures, or are there any current proposals in the pipeline?
How does the Council evaluate the information sharing between Member States and the European Union in this context? Would the Council agree that greater mutual trust is needed between EU authorities and Member States' law enforcement and counter-terrorism services? What role does the Council intend to assign to the intelligence information, what legal framework is foreseen for these formations and what role is to be given to SITCEN as a monitoring and coordinating tool in terrorist investigations?
Considering the resignation of Mr de Vries in February 2007, does the Council consider that the role of the EU counter-terrorism Coordinator should be maintained and, if so, with what mandate? Are there reasons for the resignation which have to do with the overlap of competencies between the EU coordinator for counter-terrorism and SITCEN?
How does the Council intend to strengthen EU citizens' acceptance of the antiterrorism strategy, its transparency and democratic accountability and the involvement of the European Parliament? Will the Council ensure respect for Art. 6 of the TEU?
As regards the involvement of third countries, following the EU-US summit in April 2007, how does the Portuguese Presidency intend to develop transatlantic cooperation to combat terrorism and crime, and will it be pursued through methods which comply with Art. 6 of the TEU and with foreseeable developments in the next IGC, as recommended also by the EP resolution on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners?

Financial instability and the impact on the economy
2007-08-30 - 09:05
MEPs will debate the recent instability in the world's financial markets with the Council and Commission, the day before the European Central Bank (ECB) makes its latest decision on interest rates. Increasing numbers of people defaulting on their loans in the so-called "sub-prime" mortgage market in the United States (where banks lent at higher interest rates to customers with poor or non-existent credit histories) have left a number of lenders in the sector in difficulties. Most of the debt was re-packaged and sold as part of complex financial instruments on the international market, with European banks among the buyers. Uncertainty about the real value of these investments and the extent to which institutions might be exposed to large losses has led to major falls in stock markets and a more cautious approach by investors to lending, reducing the funds available in the financial system. The ECB has injected over 200 billion euro into the European credit market to counter this reduction in liquidity.
The debate will be an opportunity for MEPs to analyse whether the European players, including the ECB, have reacted the right way and discuss possible improvements to financial supervision arrangements in the light of this volatility.
On 6 September, the ECB holds its monthly meeting to decide on possible changes in interest rates. On 11 September, the ECB President, Jean-Claude Trichet, will appear before Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee to discuss the financial market instability. Debate: 05.09.2007

Vote on a resolution on restrictions imposed on liquids on board aeroplanes - MEPs concerned about costs
2007-08-30 - 09:05
The House will vote on a resolution on the restrictions imposed by the EU on liquids that passengers can take on board aeroplanes. MEPs debated this topic on 12 February 2007. (See link below). The Transport Committee calls upon the Commission to review "urgently and on an ongoing basis" the EU-regulation regarding the introduction of liquids onto aircraft. In a draft resolution, MEPs express their concern that the costs engendered by the regulation may not be proportionate to the added value achieved by additional security provisions.
The European Parliament's Transport Committee supports all security measures against terrorist risks in aviation. The need for high-quality security is unquestionable. However, security measures need to be "realistically" designed to minimise the risk and may not be "disproportionate".
With regard to the liquids regulation, MEPs argue that it causes increased costs to airports and operators as well as to passengers resulting from the confiscation of private property.. MEPs also recognise the "substantial inconvenience and disruption" caused to passengers, especially transit passengers.
During the debate in Strasbourg in February, David MARTIN (PES, UK, Labour, Scotland) said: "I have been slightly surprised at the ferocity of the attacks by some of my colleagues on this system. It is clear that there is a serious and more subtle threat to airport security than we have ever faced and that the screening of hand baggage needs to be made as easy as possible. As the Commissioner rightly said, liquid explosives can be disguised as very innocuous substances, and a patchwork of 27 separate regulations would have been unacceptable. I therefore support the initiative he took in introducing these measures but, as he rightly says, these measures can be improved and need to be examined in the light of experience."

Single European Sky - questions to the Commission
2007-08-30 - 09:05
Paolo COSTA (ALDE, IT) on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism will be putting the following questions to the Commission on building the Single European Sky through functional airspace blocks: 1. The Commission makes clear in its Communication that the cost of failing to create a Single European Sky through functional airspace blocks amounts to € 1 billion. Is the Commission satisfied with the progress made in creating a Single European Sky since the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 551/2004 on airspace organisation in April 2004?
2. Why, in the Commission's view, have no new functional airspace blocks become operational since Regulation (EC) No 551/2004 came into force?
3. Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 551/2004 on the organisation of airspace foresees an extension of airspace organisation to the lower airspace and requires the Commission to 'determine any other steps' that might be necessary 'in the light of progress achieved'. In view of that what changes are now required to existing legislation to accelerate the creation of a Single European Sky? Does the Commission agree that it is pointless to wait until the end of 2008 and that it is time now to bring forward a proposal in this direction?
4. Does the Commission agree that the 'bottom up' approach, whereby the initiative to create functional airspace blocks is left to the Member States, has failed and that a new, more pro-active approach at EU level is now required?

Inland transport of dangerous goods - simplifying EU legislation
2007-08-30 - 09:05
The Transport Committee recommends endorsing a Commission proposal to harmonise the rules for the transport of dangerous goods by making them as user-friendly as possible. Committee rapporteur Boguslaw Liberadzki (PES, PL) says that the new proposal integrates the existing rules into one piece of EU law which will cover the land transport modes road and rail and include inland waterway transport as well. A broad majority in the Transport Committee believe that the proposals will contribute to the objective of legislative simplification and that these simpler rules would also mean safer transport. The current EU law on transport of dangerous goods already covers road and rail transport but these rules are complicated and difficult to implicate for citizens, transport operators and national authorities.
With the inclusion of inland waterways, the new legislative format will be much easier to understand and apply than the current legislation. So far, no EU rules for inland waterways exist. Taking into consideration that the impact of this sector is growing, it is felt that an accident in inland waterways might have serious consequences and that one single set of rules would reduce this risk.
The total amount of dangerous goods transport in the EU is about 110 billion tonne/kms a year, of which 58% by road, 25% by rail and 17% by inland waterway. The share of dangerous goods transport in total freight transport is 8%. The current international agreements regulating international transport of dangerous goods are based on UN Recommendations, which have been implemented in the inland transport sector in Europe by means of three instruments:
- European Agreement concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by road (ADR);
- Regulations concerning international carriage of dangerous goods by rail (RID);
- European Agreement concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by inland waterways (ADN)
But for historic reasons, existing EU legislation on the transport of dangerous goods is rather complicated. The Commission says that, if nothing is done, the current complex rules are to become even more complex with changes in international agreements. Obsolete rules would remain and confuse the sectors and the risk of non-compliance would increase.
The new proposal would repeal four existing directives and two Commission decisions. The Transport Committee takes the view that this simplified Community legislation would also simplify the transposition into national legislation. Administrative procedures for consignor and consignee will be easier with simplified and harmonised rules. Documentation of transport operations and vehicles is also expected to be simpler with harmonised rules, as would be the training of persons involved and the work of dangerous goods safety advisors.
Although welcoming the proposal, the committee proposes amendments including several of a technical nature which permit Member States to regulate for safety reasons the transport of dangerous goods not yet covered by the Directive and especially in passenger trains. They can also prohibit, strictly for other reasons than safety, the transport of dangerous goods in their territory.
It is expected that this report at first reading in co-decision may lead to a direct agreement with Council. Rapporteur Bogusław LIBERADZKI PES PL A6-0253/2007 Inland transport of dangerous goods Procedure : Codecision (1st reading)

Megatrucks on EU roads? Yes, but under strict conditons
2007-08-30 - 09:05
Inés Ayala Sender (PES, ES) will be tabling an own-initiative report for the Transport Committee on freight Transport logistics in Europe - the key to sustainable mobility. The Transport Committee is proposing that the use of 60t goods vehicles should only be allowed for certain routes at the request of, and within the Member States. The evaluation of these requests has to respect factors such as the existing infrastructures and safety aspects. In doing so, the Committee says "Yes, but...." to the use of these big lorries under strict conditions.
Originally, the committee itself was divided on this issue, with Members claiming that introducing proposals for 60t lorries would induce a definitive imbalance in favour of only one mode of transport and with others claiming that the form of innovation deserved a change.
The committee welcomes the intention of the Commission to present an Action Plan for Freight Logistics in Autumn 2007, which must serve to put logistics on the political agenda and raise its profile by focusing on its potential, appeal and usefulness. In order to achieve a further simplification of administrative burden, Members demand that an EU single transport document for all carriage of transport must provide transport undertakings with clear legal certainty and replace the large number of existing documents.
MEPs in the committee deplore the impact of the Council's position on TEN-T funding and demand that the added value of the logistics component be taken into account in future TEN-T funding decisions. Other amendments were adopted on training attractiveness of logistics professions (priority for training and life-long training for all staff), urban transport, planning and statistics.

Agriculture
Reform of the milk market, but not at excessive cost to producers
2007-08-30 - 09:05
For the EP Agriculture Committee, savings generated by the milk market reform "mini-package" proposed by the European Commission must benefit the sector. School milk aid needs to be raised, and the necessary adjustments to Europe's dairy market should not jeopardise the existing private storage scheme. This is thrust of a series of reports being proposed. To simplify the common market organisation (CMO) in milk and milk products, in February the Commission proposed three sets of amendments to regulations and directives. Three reports by Elisabeth JEGGLE (EPP-ED, DE) on each of these texts are being put forward by the Agriculture Committee under the procedure for consulting the European Parliament. They endorse the bulk of the measures proposed by the Commission, but also propose several amendments to balance certain aspects of this "mini-reform".
School milk aid rate
MEPs favour introducing a single school milk aid rate, to simplify the management of this scheme. But they consider that aid should be raised from €16.11/100kg to €18.15/100kg - as the EU's German Presidency also suggested in parallel discussions with the Council - to encourage efforts to promote balanced nutrition and combat obesity. MEPs also ask the Commission to assess the possibility of widening the range of products covered by the scheme, notably to include new, innovative and healthy products.
The Agriculture Committee recommends approving without amendment the Commission proposals to:
- reduce the skimmed milk powder intervention price by 2.8%, to €169.80 for 100 kg;
- abolish the system that activates the buying-in of butter when market prices fall below 92% of the intervention price for two consecutive weeks: cumbersome to manage, this system has also outlived its usefulness and should be replaced by a mechanism that allows buying-in at a lower price for a longer period during the year;
- harmonise definitions of butter quality (there are currently 27 national classes);
- abandon mandatory import certificates (which new control systems have rendered unnecessary):
- abolish the arrangement that allows the armed forces to buy cut-price butter (considered superfluous today).
Simplifying the milk market CMO (amending Regulation 1255/1999)
The Agriculture Committee considers that budget savings stemming from changes to the CMO (a total of €117.3m from 2008 to 2013, according to the European Commission) must benefit the dairy sector. It therefore calls for a milk fund restructuring programme from 1 January 2008 to:
- help producers and processors to cope with the growing liberalisation of the market,
- upgrade promotion measures and the dissemination of nutrition information,
- maintain and modernise production in mountainous regions, and
- strengthen the school milk distribution scheme.
According to the rapporteur, these measures could facilitate a "soft landing" for the sector with a view to the CAP "health check" planned for 2008 and forthcoming discussions on the expiry of milk quotas.
MEPs in the committee also oppose the abolition of private storage aids for cream and skimmed milk powder. Ms Jeggle says this instrument needs to be retained as a "safety net". She underlines that similar mechanisms were retained in other sectors in the last reform of the common agricultural policy, and that abolishing them would be an essentially political decision, which must be considered as part of the "health check".
Liberalisation for drinking milk (amendment of Regulation 2597/97)
The Agriculture Committee recommends approving, with some clarifications, the proposal to liberalise drinking milk production and marketing rules, so as to take account of new consumer preferences for less fatty products.
At present, only three milk categories are authorised in the EU: skimmed milk (maximum 0.5% fat), semi-skimmed (from 1.5% to 1.8% fat) and whole milk (3.5% fat). The Commission wants to authorise marketing of milk outside these categories, provided fat content is clearly labelled. To avoid confusing consumers, MEPs in the committee say that the names of these products should be stated on the label, and the proposed margins of tolerance for stating fat content (+/- 0.2%) should be deleted.
Standardisation for preserved milk (amendment of Directive 2001/114)
Finally, Members recommend approving without amendment the Commission proposal to bring authorised protein content for milk powder and condensed milk - currently between 31% and 37% - into line with the international (Codex) standard of 34%. The aim of this is to put European exporters on an equal footing with other exporters.

MEPs concerned about alcohol, alcopops and binge drinking
2007-08-30 - 09:05
Alessandro FOGLIETTA (UEN, IT) will be presenting an own initiative report for the Environment Committee on the European Union strategy to support Member States in reducing alcohol-related harm. The report raises several issues including: labelling and warnings, binge-drinking, "alcopops" and reducing accidents caused by drinking and driving. MEPs in the committee are worried about the increase in alcohol consumption among minors and young people and note a worrying trend on their part to start drinking at an ever-earlier age and, given their greater willingness to take risks, to engage in dangerous forms of behaviour such as binge drinking, other forms of hazardous alcohol consumption which aim at drunkenness, mixed consumption of alcohol and drugs, and driving whilst under the influence of alcohol and drugs.
The report calls on the Member States to pay particular attention to vulnerable social groups, such as children, young people and pregnant women, and to address the problems of hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption by young people, workers and drivers by means of information and awareness-raising campaigns and, where appropriate, a review of compliance with existing national laws.
Health warnings and labels - Commission proposal by 2010?
The report points out that Member States are currently able to introduce obligatory health warnings for alcoholic beverages. MEPs note also that health warnings on alcohol may require European harmonisation similar to health warnings on tobacco and ask the Commission therefore to publish before 1 January 2010 either a legislative proposal to introduce health warnings on alcoholic beverages, or a communication to explain why in contrast to health warnings on tobacco, the introduction or harmonisation of health warnings on alcohol is not necessary.
The report calls on the Commission and Member States, with the involvement of relevant non-governmental organisations and economic associations in the context of the Health and Alcohol Forum proposed by the Commission, to encourage the exchange of proven practices, in particular with a view to preventing hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption among children and young people, and to adopt the following measures:
(i) to launch education campaigns to be conducted by Member States and interest groups on the risks of hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption, especially through school-based educational programmes directed towards children and adolescents, in particular by encouraging them to engage in regular sports activities, but also towards parents in order to prepare them to speak about alcohol-related problems within a family setting, and towards teachers; the idea of responsible and moderate consumption by adults should also be put across at an early stage,
(ii) to limit the access to and availability of alcoholic drinks for young people, for instance by strictly implementing the existing legislation which prohibits selling alcohol to young people, by intensifying controls on sellers and distributors, such as restaurants and bars, supermarkets and retailers,
(iii) to involve retailers and the catering industry in identifying and implementing concrete measures to prevent the selling and serving of alcohol and alcohol pops to minors,
(iv) to particularly focus on such beverages as "alcopops", which are specifically targeted at young people, in order to ensure that their alcoholic nature can be clearly identified by consumers through measures such as stricter labelling requirements for such drinks, and requirements for clearer separation of alcopops from soft drinks in shops, and the selling to minors prohibited; also to promote higher taxes on such beverages,
(v) to draw up guidelines, to be implemented at national level, setting an age limit for purchasing, selling and serving alcoholic drinks,
(vi) to promote at European level blood alcohol content (BAC) limits as close as is workable to 0.00 % for new drivers, as already proposed by Parliament in its resolution of 18 January 2007 on the European Road Safety Action Programme - mid-term review, bearing in mind that some prepared foods may contain traces of alcohol,
(vii) to provide more possibilities to know and verify the blood alcohol content also through the use of auto-calculation on the Internet and the widespread availability of breathanalysers, especially in discos, pubs and stadiums, and on motorways and roads in general, in particular during night hours, and to ensure that the message conveyed to the consumer is that drinking and driving are not compatible,
(viii) to take any necessary measures to increase controls on drink-driving to the maximum,
(ix) to strengthen the sanctions for drink-driving imposed by Member States, such as prolonged withdrawal of the driving licence and periods of confiscation of the vehicle,
(x) to encourage Member States to ensure the availability of alternative public means of transportation for drivers who have consumed alcohol,
(xi) to encourage the extension of "designated-driver programmes" ("who drives doesn't drink") through educational means in view of their beneficial impact on road safety, while reminding passengers of the effects of hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption,
(xii) to set up a European prize for the best campaign against hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption directed at schools and young people,
(xiii) to intensify the exchange of best practice between Member States on how to work against hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption, and between national police forces on controls on drink-driving by young people ,
(xiv) to promote initiatives designed to guarantee psychological follow-up for individuals taken to hospital with acute alcohol intoxication Rapporteur Alessandro FOGLIETTA UEN IT A6-0303/2007 Reducing alcohol-related harm Procedure : own-initiative

Review of the EU consumer acquis - MEPs to give their views
2007-08-30 - 09:05
Béatrice PATRIE (PSE, FR) for the Internal Market Committee will be tabling an own initiative report on the Commission's review of the consumer acquis. The report recommends that the scope of this review concentrate on updating and creating coherence between the eight consumer protection directives named in the Green Paper. In presenting this Green Paper the European Commission is calling on interested parties to express their views on the “Review of the Consumer Acquis”, which was launched in 2004 within the context of the Better Regulation goals. The review covers eight consumer Directives.
The overarching aim of the Review is to achieve a real “consumer” internal market that strikes the right balance between i) a high level of consumer protection; ii) enterprise competitiveness and iii) respect for the subsidiarity principle. The Review is regarded as a unique opportunity to modernise the existing consumer Directives and to simplify the current regulatory environment – both for consumers and professionals. To this end the Directives are being reviewed both as a whole and individually with a view to identifying the regulatory gaps. This Green Paper concludes the diagnostic phase of the Review as well as summing up the Commission’s initial findings.
Degree of harmonisation
The committee points out that harmonisation must not lead to a decline in the level of consumer protection achieved under certain national arrangements, but should lead to a comparable level of consumer protection in all the Member States.
The choice of a mixed approach
The committee expresses its preference for the adoption of a mixed or combined approach, i.e. a horizontal instrument with the primary goal of ensuring the coherence of the existing legislation and enabling loopholes to be closed by grouping together, in consistent law, cross-cutting issues common to all the directives. The report considers that specific questions which are outside the scope of the horizontal instrument should continue to be considered separately in the sectoral directives.

Budget
Presentation by the Council of the draft general EU budget for 2008 - €119.4bn in payments
2007-08-30 - 09:05
The Council will present the EU's draft general budget for 2008. Parliament's first reading of the 2008 Budget in committee is expected to take place during the first week of October, with the view to a vote in plenary on 25 October. On 13 July, the Council gave a mandate to the Presidency, assisted by the General Secretariat of the Council, to establish budget documents and forward them to the European Parliament in accordance with the planned timetable. The details of the Council's draft budget for 2008 can be found at the link below (page 13). The 2008 draft budget at first reading amounts to:
€128.4bn in commitment appropriations
€119.4bn payment appropriations.
Compared with 2007 budget, these amounts represent a 1.44% increase in commitment appropriations and a 3.39% increase in payment appropriations. The main principles that guided the Council were the following:
– an adequate financing of the various EU priorities;
– a carefully controlled increase of payment appropriations;
– a respect of the existing ceilings of the Financial Framework ensuring that, where
appropriate, sufficient margins are left below the ceilings of the different Headings and sub-Headings.
The July budgetary conciliation prepared the ground for further negotiations but left Parliament and Council with a number of challenges for the 2008 Budget. Cuts applied by Council in the competitiveness for growth and jobs and a reduction of payments for cohesion are not supported by Parliament.
Parliament's strategy is underpinned by the idea of a "budget for results" promoted by General Rapporteur Kyösti Virrankoski (ALDE, Finland). "We need to establish clearly what we can get from this budget: the allocation of financial resources must follow political priorities, and not the contrary", the rapporteur said.
Challenges in the "Lisbon lines"
The biggest stumbling blocks are to be found in Heading 1a ("Competitiveness for growth and employment"). The European Parliament delegation deplored the cuts applied by Council in the so-called "Lisbon agenda lines" which deal with research and innovation.
Despite the intention of Council to "re-launch" the Lisbon strategy, these cuts are likely to harm Heading 1a programs. "This insufficient funding for competitiveness programs was flagged up by Parliament in the context of the Financial Perspective talks", Budgets Committee Chairman Reimer Böge said. "We can hardly accept any further cuts at this stage, so soon after the financial framework for 2007-2013 has been agreed".
External issues
On Heading 4 ("the EU as a global player"), a number of issues are expected to take centre stage in a later phase of the 2008 Budget preparation. Financial needs for Kosovo, CFSP and Palestine will have to be found in Heading 4 in full respect of Parliament's priorities. Not unlike previous budgetary procedures, there is hardly any margin for manœuvre in Heading 4.
The European Commission has confirmed that Heading 4 will, in any case, be short of at least €250m next year and announced an amending letter to its proposed Pre-Draft Budget.
Agencies
Finally, the institutions agreed declarations on a number of issues, including on agencies. Parliament and the Commission will work on a revised code of conduct for the creation of new executive agencies, cost-benefit analysis and clear lines of responsibility and accountability will be prioritised. Evaluations will be carried out for existing decentralised agencies over the 2007-2013 period.
Transparency is key for Parliament, which wants to have a clear view of agencies' administrative costs. Both Council and Parliament agreed that such an assessment was needed. Presentation by the Council of the draft general budget - Budget 2008

Human rights
Maximising the impact of human rights dialogues
2007-08-30 - 09:05
Parliament will debate and vote on an own-initiative report by the Foreign Affairs Committee which calls on the Commission and Council to ensure a greater degree of coherence in the EU's human rights dialogues with third countries. MEPs in the committee particularly stress the need for Parliament to be informed of the content of ongoing dialogues and urge the use of more stringent criteria and monitoring mechanisms. The report, drafted by Elena Valenciano (PES, ES) concerns the human rights dialogues that the European Union conducts with third countries. These rights, according to the report should encompass "not only civil and political rights but also social, environmental, economic and cultural rights," and the "dialogue objectives should be based on the principle that human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent." In addition, the report warns that "the promotion and defence of human rights in Third countries should not be conditioned by geopolitical or geo-strategic alliances."
The draft report notes that "there is a wide variety of dialogues, each based on different structures, formats, frequencies, and methodologies, thus obscuring the picture and creating confusion about EU action in this area." It offers some recommendations on how to improve the mechanisms. MEPs in the committee call on the Council to "set clear criteria for the initiation, suspension or termination of a dialogue," and also urge it to put in place "a post-electoral protocol mechanism to monitor and support the democratisation process, which includes the involvement of the civil society at all stages."
China, Russia, Iran in the spotlight
Although the report focuses on the overall process, and not the individual dialogues or countries concerned, it does single out a number of countries for special attention.
The report emphasises "the need to considerably strengthen and improve the EU-China human rights dialogue" and "stresses that China’s human rights record remains a matter of serious concern". The Commission should ensure "that its trading relationship with China is linked to human rights reforms".
The human rights situation in Russia is described as "worrisome", the key areas being freedom of association, freedom of speech and freedom of the press and the media. MEPs urge the Commission and Council to lay down "concrete obligations and establish efficient mechanisms for monitoring and checking fulfilment of the obligations Russia has taken on".
MEPs in the committee are also concerned that the human rights dialogue with Iran has been interrupted since 2004 due to Iran's lack of co-operation. They urge the Commission, meanwhile, to continue financing projects aimed at promoting good governance and to support women's and children's human rights in Iran.
European Neighbourhood Policy
The main purpose of the European Neighbourhood Policy is to establish a privileged relationship with the EU’s eastern and southern neighbours on the basis of a mutual commitment to common values, especially the rule of law, good governance and human rights. MEPs believe "the EU dialogues could have a greater impact on reform in the ENP neighbours" and the report draws attention to "the continual deterioration of the human rights situation in Azerbaijan", which it says underlines the need "to establish a Human Rights Subcommittee as soon as possible with that country". It also calls on the Council to consider the possibility of establishing a human rights dialogue or consultation mechanism with Libya and Syria. The report also stresses the need to set up an "institutionalised human rights subcommittee with Israel, replacing the current provisional mechanism."

The risk of closure of the Gdansk shipyard
2007-08-30 - 09:05
The Commission will make a statement (without resolution) on the risk of closure of the Gdansk shipyard. The shipyard is the birth place of the celebrated Solidarity trade union. Under EU rules, state aid for struggling shipyards can only be granted if it is accompanied by extensive cost-cutting aimed at restoring long-term viability On 20 July, the Commission said: (see link) "As for Gdansk shipyard, Poland has so far not proposed adequate capacity reductions. The Commission has therefore sent Poland an information injunction warning that unless Poland manages to provide information on adequate capacity reductions at the Gdansk yard within one month, the Commission will consider a negative decision on the state subsidies already received by the yard, which could require the aid to be reimbursed. The Commission's action is within the framework of the investigation opened in June 2005 into state aid worth at least €1.3 billion to Polish shipyards which aims to ensure that the aid is used to restore the long-term viability of the yards without undue distortion of competition."
Gdansk under threat
"As regards the shipyard in Gdansk, the Commission does not currently have the information to allow it to approve the capacity reduction to compensate for the distortion to competition caused by the subsidies received. For this reason, the Commission has decided to issue an information injunction that requires Poland to submit, within one month, all necessary information to enable the Commission to reach a conclusion on whether sufficient compensatory reductions are to be made. Otherwise, one of the pre-requisites for authorising restructuring aid to Gdansk Shipyard would not be met and the Commission could order the aid already given to be reimbursed."

Statute of the European Private Company
2007-08-30 - 09:05
Giuseppe GARGANI (EPP-ED, IT) on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs will be putting the following questions to the Commission on the state of play in the legislative proceedings on the 'Statute of the European Private Company' and of the 'Fourteenth Company Law Directive': A. European Private Company
In its resolution P6_(2007)0023 (based on Article 192 paragraph 2 EC) of 1 February 2007, the European Parliament requested the Commission to submit during 2007, on the basis of Article 308 EC, a legislative proposal on the Statute of a European Private Company (EPC). This request mirrors the Commission's own plan to come up with a legislative proposal for an EPC between 2006 and 2008 as stated in its Communication 'Modernising Company Law and Enhancing Corporate Governance' (COM(2003)0284 final). According to the Interinstitutional Agreement signed on 26 May 2005, the Commission shall take account of any request made pursuant to Article 192 EC, and shall provide a prompt and sufficiently detailed reply thereto. It has been heard - inter alia during a symposium (organised by Eurochambres and Businesseurope) held on 15 May 2007 in Brussels (title 'And now the European Private Company Statute...') - that the Commission would not finalise an impact assessment for an EPC Statute until February 2008.
B. Fourteenth Company Law Directive (transfer of registered office)
In its above mentioned Communication (COM(2003)0284 final), the Commission announced a forthcoming legislative proposal on the Fourteenth Company Law Directive (the directive) as a short term project between 2003 and 2005. In the resolution P6_(2006)0295 on recent developments and prospects in relation to company law (4 July 2006), Parliament calls on the Commission to present in the near future a proposal for the directive and stresses that the long-awaited directive would fill a lacuna in the system of the internal market for companies. As yet, the Commission has not offered any proposal for the directive.
1. What is the current state of play in the preparation of the legislative proposals on the Statute of the European Private Company and on the Fourteenth Company Law Directive?
2. What are the substantive problems in each of the dossiers which are making the Commission delay these procedures?
3. What problems other than substantive ones exist and are making the Commission hesitate?
4. Is the Commission still pursuing its task of completing the Internal Market for companies at all, and does it take this responsibility seriously?

Employment policy
Towards a single European labour market?
2007-08-30 - 09:05
Jan ANDERSSON (PES, SE) on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs will be asking the Commission to answer questions on the EURES (European Employment Services) Activity Report 2004-2005 - Towards a single European labour market. Under the new Integrated Economic and Employment Guidelines 2005-2008, mobility is considered a crucial instrument for the success of the Revised Lisbon Strategy. Moreover, the Guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States of July 2005 put an even greater emphasis on mobility. Guideline No 20 specifies that mobility is central to allowing more people to find better employment and calls for the removal of ‘obstacles to mobility for workers across Europe within the framework of the treaties’.
The European Parliament adopted a €2 million increase in the European Employment Services budget line for 2007, aimed at furthering the implementation and operation of the EURES network. The successful conclusion of the 2006 European Year of Workers’ Mobility, led to a significant increase in the consultation of the EURES Job Mobility Portal. The EURES portal should become an important European labour market communications platform – a one-stop shop for workers’ geographic and occupational mobility, aimed at removing existing obstacles (especially in work-related social security questions).
1. Does the Commission intend to extend the content of the EURES portal in order to address the needs of nationals from third countries, since, given the demographic changes within the EU, more sustained immigration flows are likely to be increasingly required to meet the needs of the EU labour market?
2. As a result of the increased visibility acquired by EURES in the context of the European Year, does the Commission intend to provide access to job vacancies and information on job offers for seasonal or short-term workers, since the budget increase is also intended to fund measures to provide information for the seasonal workers in Member States other than their countries of origin?
3. How does the Commission intend to support and promote further the geographic and occupational mobility of workers as a means to improving the functioning of the labour market in Europe?
4. Does the Commission intend to use research results and best practices gained in EURES projects, such as ‘EURES in crossborder regions’, to further the free movement of all European citizens and urge the Member States to lift the transitional measures concerning free movement of labour?

Fisheries
How to match national fleets to existing resources?
2007-08-30 - 09:05
In a report on Member States' efforts to achieve a sustainable balance between fishing capacity and fishing opportunities, drawn up by Paulo CASACA (PES, PT), the Fisheries Committee calls on the Commission to adopt the relevant initiatives for the possible transition from a fleet management system based on restricting vessel tonnage and power to a scheme under which fishing effort can be controlled through management by "geographical fishing areas". The Commission's annual report on Member States' efforts to achieve a sustainable balance between fishing capacity and fishing opportunities describes the situation of the fleet and its development over 2003-2005, broken down by data for the continental fleet and for the fleet in the outermost regions, together with a series of assessments of the content of reports forwarded by national administrations. The Fisheries Committee report relates to this information.
MEPs in the committee urge the Commission to rapidly submit proposals for guidelines that will ensure that the Member States present "harmonised information making it possible to carry out comparative analyses of developments in the various national fleets" and provide each of the Member States with disaggregated information on the level of catches by vessels operating in its coastal areas.
The committee considers it "unacceptable" that Member States fail to comply with their obligations to gather and forward data in relation to matching their fishing capacity to the state of stocks and calls on the Commission to "consider this non-compliance as serious misconduct and penalise it accordingly", as is the case for fishermen's obligations as regards catch data.
States with large fleets such as Italy and France were late submitting their reports, and one of the main states, the United Kingdom, did not submit any report at all, making it impossible for the Commission properly to fulfil its obligations as regards drawing up a summary report so that the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries and the Committee for Fisheries and Agriculture can deliver a balanced opinion on fleet developments. (see explanatory statement in report).
Management by geographical fishing areas
In view of the current situation and the continuing existence of overcapacity, "it might be desirable to reconsider the usefulness of the current schemes for bringing the Community fleet into line with fishing opportunities, leaving room in the Community policy on fisheries conservation and management for other more efficient systems which may themselves lead to capacity reductions even greater than those laid down by Community legislation", states the report.
MEPs in the committee call on the Commission to adopt the relevant initiatives for the possible transition from a fleet management system based on restricting vessel tonnage and power to a scheme under which fishing effort can be controlled through management by geographical fishing areas and the use of appropriate technical measures for the sustainable management of resources.
The Commission should also submit proposals to improve the safety of small-scale coastal and artisanal fishing vessels in the EU aimed at increasing the size and power of engines and renovating vessels so as to improve the hygiene and safety conditions on board, "without thereby implying an increase in fishing effort".
Protect the marine environment and rebuild fish stocks
The report reiterates the need for a "more wide-ranging approach" to measures to protect the marine environment and rebuild fish stocks, in particular by considering and studying certain factors which have a significant impact on the marine environment and the state of fish stocks, such as coastal and offshore pollution, industrial and agricultural effluents, bottom dredging and maritime transport, to complement current management methods. According to MEPs in the committee, a Community initiative in this area is a "priority".
There has been a gradual reduction in the overall capacity and power of the fleet (approximately 2% per year) but "there has been no reduction in the level of exploitation of stocks", notes the committee, since the technical improvements made to vessels cancel out or exceed the possibilities as regards yield and fishing effort that these "modest reductions" represent.
"Member States are still not sufficiently involved in matching the size of the fleet to the available resources", says the rapporteur. "Perhaps in view of the economic and social consequences of adopting measures which would be consistent and necessary but also highly unpopular, the Member States are pursuing a policy of 'laisser faire, laisser passer', in the hope that normal developments, the ever sharper fall in catches, will themselves cause the fleet to cease operating owing to the lack of any economic interest, since exploiting the resources will no longer be viable", he adds.
The Fisheries Committee underlines that dialogue and the industry's participation in all measures laid down to achieve a balance between the fleet and the state of resources are essential conditions if these measures are to prove effective .
Specific Regional Advisory Council for the outermost regions
With regard to the capacity of the fleets registered in the outermost regions and its variation between 2003 and 2005, the results show that the fleet registered in the Spanish and Portuguese outermost regions has been significantly reduced both in terms of tonnage and power. For the French overseas departments there has been a slight decrease in the total number of vessels and their tonnage and an increase in power.
The Fisheries Committee calls on the Commission to submit a proposal for the setting-up of a specific Regional Advisory Council for the outermost regions of the EU. Rapporteur Paulo CASACA PES PT A6-0297/2007 Balancing fishing capacity and fishing opportunities Procedure : own-initiative

Fisheries
Maximum sustainable yield in fisheries - time not yet ripe
2007-08-30 - 09:05
The time is not ripe to propose the introduction of an MSY (Maximum sustainable yield) system, says the Fisheries Committee. In a report by the Fisheries Committee, MEPs deplore the "deficient analysis" and "inadequate solutions" offered by the Commission's communication "Implementing sustainability in EU fisheries through maximum sustainable yield (MSY)". According to the committee, "the strict application of MSY would result in the short term in a considerable, and in some cases drastic, reduction in activity, employment and income for the Community fleet".
Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) is a reference point whose objective is to maximise the economic yield of a fishery in relation to the biological capacity of the stock.
In its communication "Implementing sustainability in EU fisheries through maximum sustainable yield", the Commission proposes a change in fisheries regulation through a change in the management model that will allow the sustainable use of fisheries resources in order to guarantee the industry's viability. In the Commission's own words, fisheries should be managed "looking for success rather than to seek merely to avoid failure".
In the face of such a challenge as that posed by changing the model of Community fisheries management, "it is regrettable that the Commission communication is somewhat simplistic, since it fails either to give a clear account of the need for this change of approach or to provide a detailed description of the type of model to be opted for", says the rapporteur, Carmen FRAGA ESTÉVEZ (EPP-ED, ES).
The Fisheries Committee deplores the "absence of an in-depth evaluation of what applying an MSY model would actually mean", in terms of its shortcomings, the particularities of its application, and the potential risks of any errors in the model. It regrets, notably, the absence of an analysis of the evolution of the MSY concept and the potential advantages of the different approaches.
According to MEPs in the committee, "the time is not ripe to propose the introduction of an MSY system" They say that a deeper and more rigorous analysis is needed of the problems, shortcomings and objectives of the Community's conservation and management policy as such, "with a view to deciding, with all political courage, the most suitable measures for introducing the changes that are most needed to the present Common Fisheries Policy".
The committee believes that the Commission must seize this opportunity to devise a system of access to resources that puts the accent on sustainability, discourages discards, simplifies the technical measures, eliminates discrimination and excessive competition for stocks, introduces the necessary flexibility, and boosts the sector's competitiveness.
MEPs underline that any change to the management system must necessarily include "suitable and financially acceptable compensation mechanisms", and that this will require an assessment of the social and economic impact of the final proposal.
MSY not appropriate for multi-species fisheries
The report also warns that it will be difficult to apply the MSY model to multispecies fisheries (i.e. the majority of those in the EU), since "if the MSY applied were that of the main species the others could be overfished, while if, as would seem logical, one applied that of the most vulnerable species it would be necessary to stop catching those species that were in a good biological state, with adverse effects in economic, employment and competitiveness terms, a situation which would be in total contradiction with the notion of MSY as such."

Europol analysis files
2007-08-30 - 09:05
Agustín DÍAZ DE MERA GARCÍA CONSUEGRA (EPP-ED, ES) will be tabling a non-binding report on the initiative by Finland for adoption of a Council decision amending the Council Act of 3 November 1998 adopting rules applicable to Europol analysis files. The report recommends changing rules concerning how Europol must treat personal data contained on its analysis files. Title III of the Europol Convention in force lays down the rules applicable to analysis files. This Title was modified by the 2003 Protocol, which only came into force in April 2007. Such rules deal with Europol's analysis files and the collection, processing, use and deletion of the personal data contained. The aim now of this Finnish initiative is to adapt the rules on analysis files to the 2003 Protocol, although they will only be valid until the entry into force of the Council decision establishing a European Police Office, which will have the effect of repealing all the previous legislation.
The main changes proposed by Council and supported by the EP's report are:
- after receipt of analysis files, it shall be determined as soon as possible to what extent the data shall be included in a specific file. A decision shall be taken by the Director on the continuation or closure of the file.
- personal data may not be retained for a period longer than that mentioned in the Europol Convention. Where, as a consequence of the continuation of the analysis file, data concerning persons are stored in a file for a period exceeding 5 years, the Joint Supervisory Body shall be informed accordingly.
