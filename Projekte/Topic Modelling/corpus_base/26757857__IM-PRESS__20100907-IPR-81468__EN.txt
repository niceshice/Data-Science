2010-09-08 - 12:42
MEPs want the employment rate in the EU to be increased to 75% by 2020, with a particular focus on vulnerable groups.
Member States should create more and better jobs and increase the employment rate to 75% of the active population by 2020, say MEPs in a resolution on the EU employment guidelines which was drafted by Csaba Ã–ry (EPP, HU) and adopted on Wednesday by 566 votes to 59 with 66 abstentions.
Meanwhile, the employment rate for vulnerable groups - young people aged 15-25, older workers aged 50-64, unskilled women workers, people with disabilities and people with migrant backgrounds - should be increased by 10% by 2014.
Youth unemployment
MEPs believe that 90% of 15-24 year-olds in the EU should be either in education, training or employment.
In addition, Member States should aim to reduce the school drop-out rate to below 10% by 2020.
Poverty
Turning to poverty reduction, MEPs recommend that governments set national targets to reduce by 25% the number of people living below national poverty lines, lifting over 20 million people out of poverty. They should pay special attention to the growing group of working poor and to child poverty.
Lastly, to boost income security at various stages of life, Member States should ensure adequate minimum incomes that are at least above the poverty line.
The employment guidelines are an instrument of the Europe 2020 strategy for growth and jobs that provides targets to be achieved by Member States in the field of employment and social inclusion.
