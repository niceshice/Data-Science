Smiles in Sofia for the first-ever European elections
Bulgaria held its first-ever election to the European Parliament on Sunday with over 200 candidates vying to be one of the country's 18 sitting members. Early polls put the result as close - the central electoral commission will declare the result later in the week. In total 6.7 million of the 7.6 million population were eligible to vote in elections to the European Parliament, just 5 months after Bulgaria joined the EU with its neighbour Romania. Turnout is estimated at around 30%.
Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering commented that "the 18 Bulgarian members will be the voice of the Bulgarian citizens and will represent their interests in the European Parliament". He also congratulated them and wished them well in their mandate.
Referring to the contribution the new 18 could make he went on to say, "I hope that the new members of Parliament will soon be integrated in the work of the House and be able to contribute with their experience and knowledge for the benefit of their voters and the European project. Mr Pöttering also said, "I feel sure that their positive contribution will help to improve voter participation in future elections".
Romania is due to hold a European election later in the year. The next full Europe-wide elections for all EU members is scheduled for June 2009.
