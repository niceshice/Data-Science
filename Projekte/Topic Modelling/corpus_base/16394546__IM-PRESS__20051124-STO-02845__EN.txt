Attempts to combat racism and xenophobia in the European Union present a "mixed picture, both negative and positive" according to Beate Winkler, head of the European monitoring centre on racism and xenophobia (EUMC). She identified continuing discrimination against minorities in the labour market, educational opportunities and housing allocation. A particular problem is that immigrant communities in Europe are "still over-represented in the least prestigious jobs."
The Roma community was found to be particularly affected in all these areas. Mrs Winkler was speaking to MEPs at the Civil Liberties Committee on November 23 at the unveiling of the EUMC's 2005 report into "Racism and Xenophobia, trends, developments and good practice."
Jobs, education and houses the key: Mrs Winkler identified specifically the need for employment, educational and housing polices that would allow minorities to play a more equal and active part in society. In addition, she called for the full implementation of the EU's Racial Equality Directive - which has also met a "mixed response" in some EU members. The importance of political leadership in combating racism and xenophobia was also stressed. As a recent example of this she cited the pan-European response to the London bombings as being important in reducing racial tensions.
Despite this, the report says that "some Member States have been giving out messages in new legislation that new immigrants are not welcome, for political rather than economic reasons. This sits uneasily with the increasing need for labour in many sectors that cannot be met internally."
MEPs who spoke after Mrs Winkler cautioned against excessively harsh language being directed toward immigrants. Giusto Catania, an Italian from the European United Left party said that "often phrases are bandied around creating the false impression that immigrants are potential criminals." The French Socialist MEP Martine Roure said that direct and indirect discrimination was an "unbearable humiliation" and was a factor in hatred and violence. British MEP Timothy Kirkhope said that all countries had their "strains and difficulties." For a full record of the debate please see the press link below.
