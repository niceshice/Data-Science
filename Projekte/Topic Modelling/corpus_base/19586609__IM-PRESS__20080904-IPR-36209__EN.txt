Ingrid Betancourt will address the European Parliament plenary session in a formal sitting on 8 October 2008 following an invitation from European Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering. Mr Pöttering announced today (Thursday) to the Conference of Presidents (political group leaders) that Ingrid Betancourt had accepted the invitation.
President Pöttering said: "I am delighted that Ingrid Betancourt has accepted our invitation to address the European Parliament. We are proud of her courage and thrilled that the Parliament will have the opportunity to salute her."
Ingrid Betancourt was kidnapped by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) on 23 February 2002, and rescued from captivity six and a half years later in Operation Jaque, along with 14 other hostages (three Americans and 11 Colombian policemen and soldiers).
Since her release, Ingrid Betancourt has been actively voicing support for the liberation of all remaining hostages; her visit to the European Parliament is also taking place in that spirit.
