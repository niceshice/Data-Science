MEPs voted in favour of setting up a new temporary committee on climate change on a proposal from the Conference of Presidents. The committee will have 60 members and its mandate will be one year. MEPs decided to set up the temporary committee on climate change, invested with the following powers:
(a) to formulate proposals on the European Union’s future integrated policy on climate change and to coordinate the European Parliament’s position with a view to negotiating the international framework for climate policy after 2012;
(b) to analyse and evaluate the state of climate change and propose appropriate measures, at all levels, accompanied by an assessment of both their financial impact and the cost of inaction;
(c) to draw up as comprehensive an inventory as possible of recent advances and future prospects in combating climate change, in order to provide Parliament with the detailed analysis of these that it needs in order to assume its political responsibilities;
(d) to study the environmental, legal, economic, social, geopolitical, regional and public‑health impact of these recent advances and future prospects;
(e) to analyse and evaluate the application to date of relevant Community legislation;
(f) to this end, to make the necessary contacts and hold hearings with the parliaments and governments of the Member States and third countries, the European institutions and international organisations, as well as representatives of the scientific community, business and civil society, including the networks of local and regional authorities.
Parliament also decided that, while the powers of the European Parliament’s standing committees responsible for the adoption, follow-up and implementation of Community legislation on the subject shall remain unchanged, the temporary committee may make recommendations as to measures or initiatives to be taken.
One year mandate
The House decided that the term of office of the temporary committee shall be twelve months, beginning on 10 May 2007, at the end of which it shall present a report to Parliament containing, as appropriate, recommendations for actions or initiatives to be taken.
