MEPs who blog
As a direct means of communicating via the internet, blogs offer their authors the opportunity to go beyond the usual media channels. As comments and criticisms can be posted in equal measure, blogs are everything that MEPs could wish for. Several MEPs who blog tell us why.
When it comes to communicating via the internet, MEPs like Daniel Caspary (EPP, Germany) and Alain Lipietz (Greens/EFA, France) are old hands. The much-talked-about blog, which offers a highly-developed online space for comment and opinion, represents the latest incarnation of virtual communication. For Alain Lipietz, who has several websites connected with his research and parliamentary activities, a blog “is a great means for keeping voters scattered across a constituency containing tens of millions of people in touch with what is going on.” The French MEP is not content with merely waiting for visitors to show up, as he offers a discussion board along with an automatic “push” facility for sending out news and views to those who sign up to his site. Daniel Caspary takes the view that “blogs are like podcasts and offer a great opportunity for going beyond other media, which do not keep a country’s citizens sufficiently well-informed about European policies.” While blogs are not so widespread in Slovakia and Slovenia, two of those countries’ MEPs, Vladimir Ma ňka (PES, Slovakia) and Borut Pahor (PES, Slovenia) regard them as “a significant political tool whose future influence shouldn’t be under-estimated.” The Latvian MEP, Georgs Andrejevs (ALDE), says that blogs will not be confined to being communication “toys” if they are “credible and reliable.”
"Blogging should not be a one-way activity"
Daniel Caspary believes that the readers of MEPs’ blogs tend to be more technically minded than their voters and he bemoans the fact that there are not greater numbers of relevant analyses and criticisms or fruitful exchanges of views on the site. Alain Lipietz doubts that most of the critical readers on his web forum are those who voted for him. “Most people respond to what I have to say via my e-mail address rather than via the forum. Using the forum as a means of response indicates a certain type of personality, with an undoubted preference for saying what they have to say in public.” Vladimir Maňka is equally convinced that a section of his readers are not from his own political grouping, saying that “they come to read what I have written and to see how I voice my opinions.”
The MEPs are especially keen for comments to continue to appear on their sites, provided that they can be moderated. Borut Pahor says that “the comments sometimes attract more interest than what I have written” but, as he acknowledges, “that’s completely natural.” Daniel Caspary makes the point that “blogging should not be a one-way activity”, while Alain Lipietz goes on to say that: “I accept all the insults directed towards me, but those directed at others (which are racist or homophobic in nature) are deleted.” Like all blogs, comments can turn into prolonged discussions from which – to their great delight – MEP-bloggers are excluded. Blogs and messages are now virtually independent democratic fora!
Messrs Caspary, Lipietz, Ma ňka and Pahor are ardent advocates of blogs as communication tools, whether for European institutions or for MEPs. However, Daniel Caspary has a word of warning for his colleagues: “Only blogs avoiding platitudes and jargon will survive. It will be very interesting to see if politicians are able to communicate in this way – and whether they will be allowed to do so!” To which Georgs Andrejevs adds: “what makes a blog stand out as a political tool as opposed to being merely a gadget for communication are the intentions of the writer.”
