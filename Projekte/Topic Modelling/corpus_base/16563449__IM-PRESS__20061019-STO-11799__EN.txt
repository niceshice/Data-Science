The EU's relations with North Korea are in focus after nuclear test
It is not every day that a group of MPs from North Korea's Supreme People’s Assembly and Iran's Majlis visits the European Parliament. Last week in Brussels they met separately with MEPs from the delegations for relations with each country. It marked the first meeting with Iranian MPs. Neither encounter could be described as a "meeting of minds". North Korea tested a nuclear bomb days before, while Iran's nuclear programme puts it at odds with the international community.
Interparliamentary delegations are an important part of the Parliament's work. They provide a parliamentary angle to any negotiations the EU may be conducting. Their role is also one of fact- finding, asking questions, keeping open political dialogue and monitoring elections. All nationalities and shades of political opinion in the EP are represented.
North Koreans defend nuclear test
The North Korean delegation from the 687-member Supreme People’s Assembly was met with politeness by the 15-member delegation, though MEPs didn't mince their words: "Deliberate provocation", "international pariah" and "completely irresponsible" were just some of the descriptions members used.
Ri Jong Hyok of North Korea - a veteran diplomat, who has served in East Germany and Algeria, chose his (few) words carefully. He said that his country "needed a nuclear deterrent against the US" and that it was "a matter of life and death". He also said human rights dialogue with the West was being used to exert pressure on the regime. He did however thank the EU for humanitarian assistance.
All in all it was a bad few days for North Korea in the EP. In the plenary session, members from all 7 political groups lined up to denounce the nuclear test. Javier Solana - high representative for EU foreign and security policy - told the house that North Korea is a "threat to world peace" and said that the UN Security Council "had to act". In June Parliament passed a resolution strongly critical of the human rights situation there.
Iranian delegation defends uranium enrichment programme
The intentions of Iran and its nuclear programme dominated proceedings in the first ever meeting of MEPs and their counterparts from the 290-seat Iranian Majlis.
The head of the Iranian delegation, Ali Ahmadi, spoke of the "inalienable" rights of the Iranian people to use nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. While MEPs conceded their rights to use the technologies for "peaceful purposes" they said there were no guarantees that Iran's ambitions were peaceful. An EP resolution in February conceded the same point but also criticised Iran for its decision to cease all voluntary cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency.
The UK, France and Germany have been at the forefront of seeking a diplomatic solution to the crisis over Iran's nuclear ambitions. Mr Solana has been coordinating the EU's position during the negotiations. A UN-imposed 31 August deadline for Iran to stop uranium enrichment came and went and the UN is now considering its response.
