1 million less cars in 2009 says Verheugen
MEPs discussed Europe's car industry and Industry Commissioner GÃ¼nter Verheugen said sales could fall by up to 1 million cars next year.
Around 15 million Europeans are employed in the motor industry and one of the main names - Opel (Vauxhall in the UK) - is in difficulty due to the credit crunch and falling sales.
MEPs urged greater investment to build more efficient cars and a move away from subsidies for older models.
They also want realistic targets set for manufacturers and more incentives to boost car sales in Europe and globally.
A representative of the French Presidency said that European Ministers have already accepted the principle that support for Europe's car makers could be useful. Mr Verheugen said he wanted clear and predictable rules rather than subsidies.
DR Congo's 'dirty war' condemned
Recent fighting in the Democratic Republic of Congo's North Kivu province has focused world attention on the plight of the 250,000 displaced people.
It comes five years after the end of previous wars in DR Congo which left an estimated 5 million dead and at times involved 11 countries.
MEPs urged the European Union to keep up its regional development aid to the region. Thus far countries from the Union have pledged 43.5 million euro in additional aid.
The House also called for the strengthening of the UN's MONUC peacekeeping forces with additional EU forces if necessary.
At present several European Union countries have observers with the force but only one European country, Serbia, has a military contingent.
Members from all sides condemned the plunder of the country's vast mineral resources to fund conflict and profiteering. MEPs also commended the aid efforts of Development Commissioner Louis Michel.
France's European affairs Minister Jean-Pierre Jouyet, speaking on behalf of the Council said that the current situation involves sexual violence, looting and the use of child soldiers. He told MEPs that the UN Security Council will consider strengthening the MONUC mandate to be able to protect civilians
