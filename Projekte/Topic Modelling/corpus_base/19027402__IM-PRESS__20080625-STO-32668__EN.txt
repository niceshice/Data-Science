Logging and over-fishing threatening West Africa

Fishermen tend their nets - their livelihood is threatened by over-fishing Illegal fishing and logging of timber in West Africa is devastating local economies and depriving people of jobs. The result is a steady flow of migrants to Europe's shores in search of a better life. These were the conclusions of a debate by MEPs on Monday 16 in Strasbourg. The report adopted calls amongst other things for the labelling of renewable timber and for curbs on unsustainable fishing in West Africa.
The economic importance of timber and fish for countries like Senegal, Cameroon Liberia and Ghana cannot be overstated. However, the resources are dwindling. The German Green MEP Frithjof Schmidt who drafted the report told the House last Monday that in West Africa 87% of the forests had been chopped down.
In addition to a loss of jobs there is also the problem of the resulting desertification which makes food production even more difficult. The report wants all EU countries to use eco-labelling to determine whether timber is coming from sustainable sources. It wants only these products to be allowed to be imported into the European Union.
Over-fishing linked to migration into Europe
As fisheries stocks deplete the world over the rich waters of West Africa make a tempting target. The Governments of these countries often conclude lucrative fishing contracts with the European Union's fleet. This allows vast amounts of fish to be taken out of the water. Then there is the added danger that other vessels from other countries can illegally catch fish.
The result leaves not many fish for coastal communities to rely on for food and trade. This means people have to leave their homes to seek work - and the most popular destination is Europe. A study by the International Organisation for Migration on Senegal showed that there was a direct link between over-fishing and migration.
The report wants EU governments to acknowledge this link and then to take action to preserve stocks and curb illegal fishing.
After their debate on Monday MEPs voted to support the findings of the Schmidt report the next day.
