The year opened with parliamentary hearings of all commissioners-designate. Here a press scrum gathers round Catherine Ashton, Vice-President designate of the Commission and High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. Following the hearings, which saw one commissioner-designate replaced, on 9 February Parliament approved the "Barroso" II European Commission by 488 votes to 137, with 72 abstentions. Herman Van Rompuy, newly installed President of the European Council, became a frequent visitor to Parliament's chamber. On the spot: as the economic and financial crisis deepened in 2010, European Central Bank President, Jean-Claude Trichet, found himself at the centre of attention during his regular visits to Parliament. In February, Parliament struck down the SWIFT data transfer agreement between EU governments and US authorities over civil liberties concerns. A revised agreement was endorsed in July. Here rapporteur Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert is congratulated by colleagues following a key vote. American guests: US Vice-President, Joe Biden, addressed Parliament in May, while Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited in October. Both focused on Parliament's role in areas of common interest such as data transfer and the wider fight against terrorism. September saw Commission President José Manuel Barroso give his first "State of the Union" address to Parliament. Political group leaders responded with their own assessments of his speech. 2010 marked the 20th anniversary of German reunification. The first and only democratic Prime Minister of East Germany, Lothar de Maizière and former European Commission chief Jacques Delors spoke about the momentous historic events, risks and calculations that led to German reunification on 3 October 1990. Hotly contested legislation on maternity leave provision in Europe was passed in October, with the minimum set at 20 weeks with full pay. Here Italian MEP Licia Ronzulli votes with her daughter, one month old, in her arms. Citizens' initiative: Rules for the operation of the new democratic mechanism introduced by the Lisbon Treaty were agreed in November. 1 million signatures and 2 smiles for two of the rapporteurs, Zita Gurmai and Alain Lamassoure.

A look back at 2010 The people, the debates, the key moments As a new year gets underway, we take a last look back at some of the key moments which marked the year for the European Parliament in 2010. The year, which began with Parliament's approval of the "Barroso II" Commission, also saw the first year of the Lisbon Treaty. It was also a year of economic crisis and some dramatic political moments.
