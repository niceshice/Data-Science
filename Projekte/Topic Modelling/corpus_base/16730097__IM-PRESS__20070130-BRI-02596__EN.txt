Promoting healthy diets and physical activity
Parliament adopted an own-initiative on the prevention of overweight, obesity and chronic diseases with 620 votes in favour, 24 against and 14 abstentions. The House welcomes the Commission's commitment to healthy eating (in quantative and qualitative terms) and physical activity, and the fight against obesity and major diet related diseases and calls for this to be regarded henceforth as a political priority of the European Union and its Member States.
MEPs vote in favour of a universal moratorium on the death penalty
MEPs adopted a joint resolution with 591 votes in favour, 45 against and 31 abstentions on the initiative in favour of a universal moratorium on the death penalty.

MEPs say protection of Dalits in India is "grossly inadequate "
Parliament adopted a resolution put forward by the Development Committee on the human rights situation of the Dalits in India. The resolution notes that implementation of laws protecting the rights of Dalits remains grossly inadequate, and that atrocities, untouchability, illiteracy, inequality of opportunity, manual scavenging, underpayment of wages, bonded labour, child labour and landlessness continue to blight the lives of India’s Dalits.
Educational discrimination against young women and girls
"Education and training of girls and women is a human right and an essential element for the full enjoyment of all other social, economic, cultural and political rights", says the Parliament in an own-initiative report drafted by Vera Flasarová (GUE/NGL, CZ). The House believes a range of measures are needed to tackle educational discrimination between men and women in Europe.
Limitation periods for cross border disputes over accidents
Parliament backed a suggestion by its Legal Affairs Committee that the Commission should draft legislation harmonising national rules on limitation periods governing cross-border disputes over fatal accidents and injuries. In a report by Diana Wallis (ALDE, UK), the committee proposes a general limitation period of four years.
Composition of parliamentary committees and list of committee chairs and vice-chairs
The chairs and vice-chairs of the parliamentary committees have been elected at a series of special meetings on Wednesday and Thursday. These elections follow the approval by the plenary session of the membership of each committee. The chairs and vice-chairs are due to serve for second half of the present Parliament's term of office, that is until the next European elections in June 2009. 20070130BRI02596

Opening of Brussels Plenary session - Minute of silence for Hrant Dink/ New composition of committees
2007-02-01 - 16:42
Parliament held one minute of silence in respect of the murdered Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink. MEPs also voted on a proposal from the Conference of Presidents setting out the new composition of parliamentary committees, details are set out below. Minute of silence for murdered Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink
President of the European Parliament Hans-Gert POETTERING referred to the "appalling assassination" of Turkish-Armenian journalist HRANT DINK on 19 January. Mr Dink had called for the recognition of the historic joint past of the Turkish and Armenian peoples. Mr Dink, said President Poettering, had many enemies in Turkey and the President welcomed the Turkish government's commitment to catch and prosecute the perpetrator/s of the crime. It would seem, he said, that the motive of the accused was ultra-nationalism and a contempt for other peoples. President Poettering stated that both Joost LAGENDIJK (Greens/EFA, NL) Chair of the European Parliament - Turkey Delegation and Hélène FLAUTRE (Greens/EFA, FR), Chair of the Parliament's Sub-Committee on Human Rights had attended Mr Dink's funeral.
New composition of parliamentary committees
At the midway point of each parliamentary term, the composition of the twenty Parliamentary Committees and two sub-Committees can change. Parliament adopted the new composition which was based on a proposal from the Conference of Presidents.
The constitutive meetings of the Parliamentary Committees (30 minutes each) took place on the evening of 31 January and the morning of 1 February when the new chairs and four vice-chairs of each committee were elected.
A list of the British and Irish MEPs per committee following their new composition can be found on the "national angle" section of the website, the link to which is given hereunder. 31.01.2007 UK and Irish MEPs appointed to Committees List of Committee chairs and vice-chairs

Formal address by President of Romania
2007-02-01 - 16:42
European Parliament President Poettering welcomed the Romanian President Traian Băsescu to the house. Mr Poettering welcomed the 35 Romanian MEPs, who since 1 January 2007 are full Members of the House, and also welcomed Romania and the Romanian people to the European Union. President of Romania Traian Băsescu began by congratulating EP President Hans-Gert Poettering and leading Members on their recent appointments, and then thanked Parliament as a whole, and especially outgoing EP President Josep Borrell Fontelles, for its support for Romania throughout the accession process.
Economic and political situation improving
"Since 1998, Romanian citizens have been able to speak freely", and at that time, they freely expressed the wish to join the EU, noted Mr Băsescu. Today, despite a long and difficult accession process, 67% of Romanians still back the EU, and look to its co-operative model to deliver on their goals, he said, adding that their optimism is refreshing at a time of widespread scepticism about the Union.
Yet accession is just the start - Romania's true integration will take sustained effort to deliver economic growth, modern infrastructure, efficient institutions, a reliable justice system, and a clean environment - in short, living standards that are comparable with those of other EU citizens, said Mr Băsescu.
Romania has made considerable progress since the 1990s: judges are independent, ministers accountable, public finances and procurement more transparent, orphanages are improving and Roma people are being integrated, but there is still some way to go.
National average income for Romanian workers is still only €328, rural development is a big challenge (large percentage of workers employed in agriculture), and the small business fabric is not yet strong enough to drive the economy, he said.
Part of the family
Mobilising citizens to drive the integration process will entail a sustained information effort, which includes explaining not only the benefits of integration, but also the difficulties - for example, why Romanian workers may be denied access to other Member States' labour markets, even though they are honest, predicted Mr Băsescu.
The EU has bridged the old East-West divide, but there remains some reluctance to accept east Europeans as members of the European family, said Mr Băsescu, appealing to politicians to ensure that peoples understand each other better, so as to strengthen the unity of the 27. East European countries have reason to be proud too, and cohesion among the 27 is a prerequisite for the Union to act as a global player, e.g. on energy security, he added.
Western Balkans
Europe needs an integrated, overall approach with which to address sensitive issues in Kosovo, Serbia, Bosnia and the Republic of Montenegro. Likewise, the "EU perspective should" apply to Moldova, which shares Romania's hopes and wishes, said Mr Băsescu. 2007 will be a crucial year for the Western Balkans, and the international community must demonstrate that there is a viable solution in Kosovo, he noted.
Black Sea
The Black Sea basin offers great prospects - including answers to some of the EU's energy security questions - but also risks, said the President. The EU needs to make instruments available to halt the spread of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, and should be open to any partner ready to engage in dialogue, he said, adding that Romania will be an "active combatant" in Common Foreign and Security Policy efforts to settle the "frozen conflict". Romania likewise favours a solid transatlantic partnership and stepping up co-operation between NATO and the EU.
Benefits of integration
Turning to what Romania stands to gain from integration, Mr Băsescu noted that Romania is Poland's second-largest customer, and, with well above EU average growth of 8.4%, a good prospect for investment. In 2006, foreign direct investment in Romania totalled € 8.5 billion. 17 years of restructuring and reform have helped to strengthen Romania's capacity to build, innovate and contribute to the European project. Its geographic position makes it an important geo-strategic asset to the EU, and its accession to NATO makes it a net contributor to EU security. Its Christian faith, strong European culture and traditions of tolerance, diversity and protecting national minorities mean it is well-placed to help build an EU of 27 Member States.
Constitution, energy, neighbours
Mr Băsescu next commented on three policy priorities listed by the EU's German Presidency - the draft EU constitution, energy security and neighbourhood policy. Romania backs the constitution - "we need a solid treaty that provides legitimacy for our activities" he said. On energy, "we need to liberalise markets, foster co-operation among stakeholders, and transport energy more efficiently" he said, adding that we should look to the Black Sea for some of the answers. Finally, EU neighbourhood policy reflects Europe's values, and Romania will back the German Presidency's efforts.
Romania's accession is a milestone. It is now ready to shed the burden of the past, and, true to its basic principles and values, assume its role as a Member State in the best spirit of Community solidarity, concluded the President. Formal Sitting: 31.01.2007 Biography of Romanian President

Formal address by President of Bulgaria
2007-02-01 - 16:42
A month after his country became a member of the EU, Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov addressed a formal sitting of the European Parliament. Introducing Mr Parvanov, EP President Hans-Gert Poettering spoke of his "joy" at Bulgaria's accession. He congratulated it on the reforms it had made in a short space of time as a condition of EU membership and said he looked forward to Bulgaria's first elections to the EP in May. A month after his country became a member of the EU, Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov addressed a formal sitting of the European Parliament. Introducing Mr Parvanov, EP President Hans-Gert Poettering spoke of his "joy" at Bulgaria's accession. He congratulated it on the reforms it had made in a short space of time as a condition of EU membership and said he looked forward to Bulgaria's first elections to the EP in May.
Bulgarian membership "a triumph of historical justice"
Mr Parvanov described the European Union as "perhaps the most ambitious political, economic and cultural project in the history of mankind" and said his country's accession had been a "triumph of historical justice": Bulgaria had always been European in spirit. Bulgaria's and Romania's accession to the EU had also been "an important political signal" and would now act as an "incentive for the Western Balkan nations".
Bulgaria had made great strides to qualify for EU membership, including economic, legislative and judicial reforms, and he thanked the EP for its "constructive criticism and encouragement" in the process. More challenges lay ahead. Bulgaria especially needed to become more competitive and he pointed out that his country's "obligations to the EU have to be met now, while the benefits only arrive later!".
For example, Mr Parvanov found it difficult to understand why some countries would not open their labour markets to Bulgaria's workers. "The lifting of barriers will bring benefits to Bulgaria and the EU" and the "fears of migrant waves" after the last enlargement had proved unfounded. A key need for Bulgaria was better infrastructure - notably in communications and transport - and Mr Parvanov issued a call for more investment in this area, highlighting "well-functioning schemes for public-private partnerships".
Bulgaria's future contribution to EU policies
Turning to the future of the EU, the president said Bulgaria intended "to play an active role in the debate on the entire agenda of the EU", including the constitution, financing arrangements and foreign, security and defence policy.
On foreign policy, Bulgaria could contribute expertise in relation to the Western Balkans, the Black Sea and Caucasus. Other key issues where his country could play a role included "energy infrastructure, terrorism, illegal immigration and the environment".
Two issues in need of solutions: nuclear power and nurses in Libya
Energy was also a major topic. The president spoke at length about the EU's demand that Bulgaria close down certain nuclear power plants deemed unsafe - a demand it had complied with in order to join the EU. However, he stressed the problems this had caused: "severe energy shortages, power cuts and energy price increases". Bulgaria, he insisted, "attaches importance to safety" but two of the plants need not have been closed down and he called for "an impartial debate" with a "new peer review" of the matter by international experts.
He then turned to the fate of the Bulgarian medical staff imprisoned in Libya, welcomed the "solidarity shown by the whole European Union" on this matter just days after his country's accession and urged that a solution be made "a high priority" for the EU.
Winding up, Mr Parvanov said "a strong Europe is possible only if there are strong leaders capable not just of imposing a vision but also of taking decisions". On issues ranging from enlargement to energy policy, Bulgaria could contribute to finding solutions, he concluded.

Human rights
MEPs vote in favour of a universal moratorium on the death penalty and condemn Saddam execution
2007-02-01 - 16:42
MEPs adopted a joint resolution with 591 votes in favour, 45 against and 31 abstentions on the initiative in favour of a universal moratorium on the death penalty. The resolution says that Parliament is deeply concerned by the fact that national laws still exist, or have been reintroduced, in dozens of countries around the world, providing for the death penalty and the execution of thousands of human beings each year. Parliament condemned the execution of Saddam Hussein and the media's exploitation of his hanging and deplores the way it was carried out.
The resolution was put forward by the EPP-ED, PES, ALDE, Greens/EFA and GUE/NGL groups. At the same time, the trend towards the worldwide abolition of the death penalty continues; the resolution welcomes, in this regard, the complete abolition of the death penalty in Liberia, Mexico, the Philippines and Moldova during the past years and the rejection by the Peruvian Congress of the draft law on the introduction into legislation of the death penalty for crimes of terrorism.
The resolution reiterates the Parliament's long-standing position against the death penalty in all cases and under all circumstances and expresses once more its conviction that the abolition of the death penalty contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and to the progressive development of human rights. The resolution calls for a worldwide moratorium on executions to be established immediately and unconditionally through a relevant resolution of the current United Nations General Assembly, whose actual implementation the UN Secretary-General should be able to monitor. The resolution to be voted strongly supports the initiative of the Italian Chamber of Deputies and Government backed by the EU Council, the Commission and the Council of Europe. The resolution asks the EU Presidency to take appropriate action as a matter of urgency to ensure that such a resolution is urgently submitted to the current UN General Assembly. The resolution also asks the EU Presidency and the Commission to keep Parliament informed of the results achieved in the current UN General Assembly on a universal moratorium on the death penalty.
The resolution urges the EU institutions and the Member States to make every endeavour in the political and diplomatic spheres to ensure the success of this resolution within the current UN General Assembly. Finally, the resolution strongly urges all EU Member States to ratify without delay the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), aiming at the complete abolition of the death penalty.

Human rights
MEPs say protection of Dalits in India is "grossly inadequate"
2007-02-01 - 16:42
Parliament adopted a resolution put forward by the Development Committee on the human rights situation of the Dalits in India. The resolution notes that implementation of laws protecting the rights of Dalits remains grossly inadequate, and that atrocities, untouchability, illiteracy, inequality of opportunity, manual scavenging, underpayment of wages, bonded labour, child labour and landlessness continue to blight the lives of India’s Dalits. The House nevertheless welcomes the various provisions in the Constitution of India for the protection and promotion of the rights of Dalits.
The National Human Rights Commission of India has reported that the implementation of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act remains very unsatisfactory, and whereas it has published numerous recommendations to address this problem.
The European Parliament expresses its concern at the low rate of conviction for the perpetrators of such crimes and calls on the Government of India to improve its criminal justice system in order to facilitate registration of charges against perpetrators of crimes against Dalits, to increase the conviction rate for such perpetrators, to significantly reduce the duration of court procedures; and to take special measures for the protection of Dalit women.
The House calls on the Government of India to take urgent steps to ensure equal access for Dalits to police stations and all other public institutions and facilities, including those related to its democratic structure such as panchayat buildings and polling booths.
MEPs urge the Government of India to engage further with relevant UN human rights bodies on the effective elimination of caste-based discrimination, including the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the UN Special Rapporteurs assigned to develop Principles and Guidelines for the Elimination of Discrimination based on Work and Descent. MEPs call on the Government of India to ratify the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and to take preventive measures to reduce the risk of Dalits facing torture, to take legal measures to criminalise torture in India, to take punitive measures to prosecute police who commit torture, to consistently provide rehabilitation and compensation for torture victims and to put in place an independent complaints mechanism for victims of torture that is accessible to Dalits.
The European Parliament notes with concern the lack of substantive EU engagement with the Indian Government, notably within the EU-India Summits, on the vast problem of caste-based discrimination. The European Parliament urges the Council and the Commission to raise the issue of caste-based discrimination during EU-India Summits and other meetings as part of all political, human rights, civil society, development and trade dialogues and to inform the committees concerned of the progress and outcome of such dialogues.
Lastly, the House urges the European members of the Joint Action Committee to develop dialogue on the problem of caste-based discrimination in terms of its discussions on democracy and human rights, social and employment policy and development cooperation.

Public health
Prevention of overweight, obesity and chronic diseases
2007-02-01 - 16:42
Parliament adopted an own-initiative on the prevention of overweight, obesity and chronic diseases with 620 votes in favour, 24 against and 14 abstentions. The House welcomes the Commission's commitment to healthy eating (in quantative and qualitative terms) and physical activity, and the fight against obesity and major diet related diseases and calls for this to be regarded henceforth as a political priority of the European Union and its Member States. A report prepared by the United Kingdom’s National Audit Office in 2001 estimated that obesity in England alone accounted for 18 million days of sickness absence and 30,000 premature deaths, corresponding to an annual direct health care cost of at least GBP 500 million. The wider costs to the economy, which include lower productivity and lost output, were estimated at a further GBP 2 billion per year. The 2004 report from the United Kingdom’s Chief Medical Officer on the impact of physical activity and its relationship to health estimated the cost of physical inactivity at GBP 8.2 billion annually (including both the health care cost and the wider cost to the economy, such as days lost from work). In Ireland, the direct cost of treating obesity was estimated at some €70 million in 2002.
The European Parliament advises all the Member States to recognise obesity officially as a chronic disease in order to prevent obese people from being stigmatised and discriminated in any way; and to ensure that they have access to appropriate treatment under their national health systems.
Schools are key
The House points out that school is the place where children spend most of their time and that the school environment and, especially school canteens, must therefore encourage young children to develop their tastes, to promote regular physical activity and a healthy lifestyle, particularly in order to deal with the decreasing time allocated to physical education in schools in the EU. The report calls therefore on the Commission to develop mechanisms to promote best practice in schools which take account of the most effective initiatives educating children about healthy eating and, providing food based on high nutritional standards.
MEPs call on Member States to provide sufficient funds for school catering in order to allow schools to serve freshly produced meals, preferably from organic or regional agriculture and to encourage healthy dietary habits from an early age.
The House takes a strong interest in the food signposting systems put in place in several Member States by food companies, retailers or public bodies in order to simplify nutrition messages, recognises the value of such signposting systems as well as healthy-choice logos when they are favoured by consumers and easy to use. MEPs recall that research confirms that schemes which indicate levels of nutrients via an interpretative element are the most helpful to consumers in choosing healthier options. The European Parliament calls on the Commission to draw on this experience and research to develop and introduce an EU-wide front-of-pack nutrition labelling scheme and points out that a consistent message to consumers demand a certain degree of harmonisation in this area and that such messages must be scientifically based.
Concern over decline in nutritional value of fruit and vegetables
The House is concerned about reports that the nutritional content of fruit and vegetables produced in Europe has fallen over the last decades and calls on Commission and Council to take the necessary steps in the 2008 Common Agricultural Policy review in order to consider food nutritive value an important criterion and to enhance quality food production and healthy nutrition incentives in the framework of rural development policies.
MEPs believe that product reformulation is a powerful tool for reducing the intake of fat, sugar and salt in our diets and welcomes the steps taken by a few manufacturers and retailers to move in this direction. The House calls on the Commission, Member States, manufacturers, retailers and caterers to step up efforts to ensure reduced fat, sugar and salt levels in foods. Finally, MEPs call on manufacturers to use product reformulation not just to launch new, sometimes more expensive brands, but to prioritise cutting fat, sugar and salt in existing everyday brands.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Educational discrimination against young women and girls
2007-02-01 - 16:42
"Education and training of girls and women is a human right and an essential element for the full enjoyment of all other social, economic, cultural and political rights", says the Parliament in an own-initiative report drafted by Vera Flasarová (GUE/NGL, CZ). The House believes a range of measures are needed to tackle educational discrimination between men and women in Europe. In the European Union women make less progress overall than men through the education system, including life-long learning, on account of diverse gender-related restrictions, say MEPs. The rapporteur lists a number of barriers: economic factors in socially disadvantaged families; gender-based prejudices in the choice of field of study; gender-based reasons hindering the completion of studies and preventing young women from improving their existing qualifications; prejudice against educated women; religious prejudice preventing women from fulfilling their potential in society in certain countries; difficulty of access to education for girls and young women from immigrant or minority backgrounds.
Among its recommendations, the European Parliament suggests that policy in the area of equal access to education should involve an assessment of gender-differentiated statistics. It also recommends that Member States create and monitor national educational policies designed to enable all girls to complete compulsory schooling.
Vulnerable groups
Special policies are needed for national, ethnic and cultural minorities, especially the Roma minority, including pre-school and zero grade programmes, with a multicultural approach to combat double discrimination. Action is also urged to protect the rights of immigrant women and girls and combat the discrimination they face in their communities of origin by rejecting all forms of cultural and religious relativism which could violate women's fundamental rights.
Flexibility needed
Member States should devise more flexible adult education and lifelong learning programmes so that working women and mothers are able to continue their education in programmes that fit in with their schedules.
Pay gap
The pay gap between women and men remains high: on average women earn 15% less than men, which is the result both of non-compliance with equal pay legislation and structural inequalities such as labour market segregation, differences in work patterns, access to education and training, biased evaluation and pay systems and stereotypes.
Member States are urged to encourage access by women to positions of responsibility and decision-making in public and private undertakings. Particular attention should be paid to academic positions: in education and research, women outnumber men as graduates (59%), yet their presence decreases consistently as they progress on the career ladder, from 43% of PhDs down to only 15% of full professors.

Judicial cooperation
Limitation periods for cross-border disputes over accidents
2007-02-01 - 16:42
Parliament backed a suggestion by its Legal Affairs Committee that the Commission should draft legislation harmonising national rules on limitation periods governing cross-border disputes over fatal accidents and injuries. In a report by Diana Wallis (ALDE, UK), the committee proposes a general limitation period of four years. Cross-border disputes between EU citizens over such accidents and injuries are currently subject to differing "limitation periods", or cut-off points, in each Member State. The current differences in national legislations regarding limitation periods, and particularly the starting date, the possibility of interrupting or stopping the running of time and the date of expiration, may have undesirable consequences for accident victims.
Parliament argues that the general limitation period for all cross-border proceedings involving injuries and fatal accidents should be four years, except where the proper law of the claim provides for a longer period. The committee also proposes a limitation period of ten years for enforcing a damages claim established by a final judgment or arbitral award.
In addition, say MEPs, Member States should be required to set up national information centres for keeping a register of all criminal investigations
