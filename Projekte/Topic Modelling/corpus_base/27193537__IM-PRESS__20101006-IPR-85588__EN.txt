The European Parliament's third annual prize for excellence in journalism will be awarded by EP President Jerzy Buzek next Wednesday 13 October. The prize is given to journalists who have covered major European issues or promoted better understanding of EU institutions and policies. The award ceremony begins at 9am in room PHS 01A002 in the European Parliament.
Juries of journalists in each EU Member State selected 76 national winners: 25 in the written press category, 19 for radio, 21 in the television category and 11 for internet. The award jury in Brussels, composed of three MEPs and six journalists, has since selected one final EU winner for each category: written press, radio, TV and the Internet. Each winner will receive â‚¬5000.
Award ceremony
President Jerzy Buzek will award the prize to the EU-wide winners on 13 October, starting at 09.00h. The ceremony will take place in room PHS 01A002 and will be followed by a panel discussion titled "Journalists - an endangered species?" The event will be web-streamed on Parliament's homepage and EuroparlTV. Almost all national winners from the Member States will attend the event, as will 50 young journalists who are participating in a workshop hosted by the European Parliament.
