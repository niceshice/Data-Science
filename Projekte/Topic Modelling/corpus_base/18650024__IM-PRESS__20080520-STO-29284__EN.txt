MEPs push for more effective rules on development aid
MEPs agreed Thursday proposals to extend the scope of the Turin-based European Training Foundation (ETF) to new areas. They also looked at simplifying aid procedures to developing countries, to make aid more effective, step up the fight against corruption and to take into account the recipients' priorities and timetables. They also voted on a new animal health strategy for the EU 2007-2013 and resolutions on Burma, China, Lebanon and Belarus.
European Training Foundation
The ETF was set up in 1990 to help develop vocational training systems in neighbouring countries. Since then EU policies on education and training and on external relations have changed, meaning it's time to take another look at the aims of the ETF. MEPs adopted a report by French Liberal Bernard Lehideux, including proposals allowing the ETF to operate in all partner countries and extending its scope to include human resource development, particularly education and training with a view to lifelong learning.
"The new regulation will allow the ETF to operate in all of the EU's partner countries, including outside the framework of the neighbourhood policy or the pre-accession programmes," Mr Lehideux said.
Aid effectiveness
MEPs also debated a report by Belgian Liberal Johan Van Hecke on aid effectiveness. It calls on the Commission to strengthen parliamentary scrutiny in the countries receiving development aid and promote cross-country policy dialogue between European donors to tackle the problem of orphan countries and sectors. During the debate, Mr Van Hecke said aid remains too "donor-oriented" and not sufficiently "demand-driven." He added, "for the first time since 2000 the percentage used for official aid has decreased from 0.41% of GNP in 2006 to 0.38% in 2007. In order to achieve the Millennium Goals a dramatic change of course is necessary."
EU countries have spent â‚¬1.8 billion less than promised on aid and MEPs warned against "donor fatigue". Some drew a direct link between the deficiencies of CAP and poverty in Africa, an argument rejected by Development Commissioner Louis Michel.
The report says:
aid procedures should be simplified
better donor coordination is needed
practical measures are needed to fight corruption
aid should be disbursed according to the partners' priorities and timelines.
Joint resolutions voted Thursday :
global treaty to ban uranium weapons
natural disaster in China
tragic situation in Burma
negotiations between the EU and the US on visa exemptions
