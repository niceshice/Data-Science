The money was to benefit 3,582 former workers at the car manufacturer and seven of its suppliers, who left the companies under a voluntary redundancy plan, either to retire early or for retraining.
In committee, social-democrat MEPs following concerns raised in the Employment Committee requested further clarifications about Renault's voluntary redundancy plan. They also wanted further assurances as to how the money would benefit the redundant workers. MEPs were concerned about new retirement legislation that entered into force in France after it applied for the EGF aid. They feared that this new law might negatively affect the status of the staff who left voluntarily for early retirement.
To dispel these concerns, the S&D MEPs demanded that the Commission services carry out an additional audit. Pending this audit, part of the money should be put in reserve, they said. Due to the rejection of their amendments, the social-democrat MEPs voted against the resolution as a whole. As the ECR group and some MEPs from other groups also voted against, the resolution, drafted by Barbara Matera (EPP, IT), was rejected, with 16 votes in favour, 20 against and 2 abstentions. The EPP group was in favour of the resolution. Without the resolution, the money cannot be transferred.
Next steps
Following the committee's blocking of the money transfer, the Commission will now have to submit a new proposal to Parliament and the Council. The matter is likely to be discussed by Parliament, Commission and Council at a budget "trilogue" meeting.
Background
The EGF was established to provide additional support for workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation or the financial crisis and help reintegrate them in the labour market. Its annual ceiling is €500 million.
