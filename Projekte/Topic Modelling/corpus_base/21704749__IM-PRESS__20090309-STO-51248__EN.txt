Northern Spain, January 2007, tarmac is removed from the beach after being spilt by the 'Sierra Nava' refrigerator ship Reducing harmful emissions from European industries by using the best available technologies, road charges for lorries and access to EU documents were on Parliament's agenda Tuesday. MEPs also discussed the EU’s 3rd maritime safety package which includes laws to prevent accidents and pollution at sea and to fix liability in case of accident.
Industrial emissions: MEPs approved laws to update and strengthen rules concerning harmful industrial emissions, targeting mainly the more than 50,000 industrial plants across Europe. In the preceding debate, MEPs from most groups defended a compromise hammered out by the Environment Committee (but not one supported by the right of centre EPP-ED group), on minimum standards for the whole EU and the use of technology to limit emissions.
Speakers from the EPP-ED - the largest group in Parliament - criticized the additional red tape, and rules that would affect farms in particular. Other MEPs were critical of the fact that CO2 limits are not included in the legislation.
German Liberal Holger Krahmer, who drafted the report for Parliament, said, "Nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides are among the main problems. They could be reduced by 60-80% if the best technology was fully used. The technology is not science fiction, it is available, affordable and it works."
Maritime Safety: The plenary reviewed the agreement between and the EP on the 3rd maritime safety package. The package, known as "Erika 3", aims to prevent devastating maritime disasters such as the oil spills caused by the oil tankers Erika (1999) and the Prestige (2002).
The new maritime safety legislation provides for technically dangerous ships that repeatedly breach the rules to be placed permanently on an EU blacklist. It obliges countries to draw up detailed emergency plans and to designate authorities to monitor sea traffic, who can act swiftly if a ship needs assistance. It also lays down common EU rules and standards for ship inspection.
The legislation will harmonise, and in many cases raise, accident liability for ship passenger carriers and mandatory insurance levels.
Road charges: Late afternoon, MEPs debated proposals to allow EU countries to integrate social and environmental costs caused by trucks into road charges and tolls (the so called "Eurovignette"). The new law will be an incentive for the transport sector to become economically more effective and less harmful to the environment, according to Socialist
MEP Saïd El Khadraoui, who is guiding the proposals through Parliament. He said the levies should be reinvested in transport infrastructure and cutting environmental impact.
Also on the agenda: a recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean, car safety, transparency and access to EU documents, child care facilities and immigrant children.
