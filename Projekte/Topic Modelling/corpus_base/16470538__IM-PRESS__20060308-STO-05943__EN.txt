Seat of power: The Red Sofa at the European Parliament
Exhibitions and cultural events are common features at the European Parliament's premises. Last year approximately 150 events took place in Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg. Paintings, photos, concerts, theatre performances, food tasting...all trying to raise awareness of various topics or make a town or region better known to the public and to MEPs.
The exhibitions represent a variety of themes - everything from sport to crimes against humanity. Some recent examples are the Winter Olympics, European noise week, cigarette smuggling in the EU and breast cancer. The Srebrenica massacre and the orange revolution in Ukraine have also been the subjects of exhibitions.
The events can take many forms; a slightly unusual visitor to the Parliament last year was a red couch that has spent 8 years being transported around Europe by German artist Horst Wackerbarth. Everyone, from Mikhail Gorbachev to road sweepers, has at some point sat on it: "sitting on the sofa gives individuals a voice," said the artist. Speaking of his exhibition in the Parliament Mr Wackerbarth said that he "wanted to humanize big terms such as the EU or globalization. People just get scared because those terms are anonymous for them. The sofa was indirectly a stage for the people".
The role of wood in tackling climate change was the subject of another recent exhibition. One of the organisers, Jan Söderlind of the Nordic Timber Council said "the aim was to serve as an eye-opener for the members of the European Parliament as regards wood's role in helping to reduce climate change." We also wanted the MEPs to "acknowledge the European wood industry, which has an annual turnover of more than €165,000 million." The MEP who hosted the event, French Socialist Catherine Guy-Quint called it an important opportunity to "increase knowledge...on the positive contribution of enhanced wood use to both sustainable development and tackling climate change".
It is essential that the initiative has a European dimension, is related to the activities of the European Union or is of interest to the Parliament. One recent example is the exhibition "Tales from a globalizing world", hosted in the Parliament at the beginning of February, a project that showed the growing development gap between North and South and within countries. "Many of the issues raised by the photographs are the very ones which often form the subject matter of our debates" explained British liberal MEP Diana Wallis when opening the exhibition.
For an event to be held it must be sponsored by an MEP and all events must be approved in advance by the Parliament's Quaestors (the European Parliament's five Quaestors are responsible for MEPs' administrative and financial matters). A request can be turned down because of a lack of space, or if the content of the exhibition is deemed unsuitable. Events are mainly aimed at MEPs, officials and persons with access to the Parliament's premises. At the inauguration, exhibitions are also open to visitors.
Most events last for a couple of days to a week and ultimately it is up to those who view them to decide whether they are art, politics, or both!
