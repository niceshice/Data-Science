WTO Meeting in HK
The 149 members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) are meeting in Hong Kong this week to try to agree a way forward on liberalising trade in agriculture, industrial goods and services in a way which will benefit everyone concerned, but in particular developing countries. A delegation of MEPs is taking part in the meeting.
This Ministerial Conference was originally planned to be the point at which the main lines of a global trade deal would be decided, but there has been so little progress up to now that all sides decided to "recalibrate" expectations for the meeting, which now aims to make enough progress for the really difficult issues to be tackled next year. Even that modest aspiration is so far proving hard to achieve, with little sign of compromise by the main players.
Thirty MEPs are in Hong Kong as part of Parliament's delegation. They are having regular meetings with Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and Agriculture Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel, plus briefings from senior Commission officials on the progress of the talks in different areas. They have also been meeting representatives of the British EU presidency and delegations from other EU Member States, major EU trading partners, industry groups and NGOs. The MEPs are being led by Spanish socialist Enrique Baron Crespo, who is chair of Parliament's International Trade Committee - and a former EP President.
At the Brussels plenary session on 1 December, Parliament adopted a resolution saying it was essential that the Doha Round succeeds in order to strengthen the multilateral trade system to ensure harmonious development of the world economy. It strongly supported the placing of development at the heart of the round, stressing the negotiations must help in eradicating poverty. Parliament regrets the slow progress so far, and is deeply concerned about the serious effect that a failure would have on the multilateral trade system. MEPs therefore called for a constructive ministerial conference in Hong Kong to prepare for a successful conclusion of the round in 2006.
Alongside the WTO meeting itself, the MEPs joined MPs from around the world in a meeting of the Parliamentary Conference on the WTO. This conference, organised jointly by the European Parliament and the Inter-Parliamentary Union, aims to provide a measure of parliamentary scrutiny to the work of the WTO. The Hong Kong session is the fourth, previous meetings having taken place in Geneva and Cancun in 2003 and Brussels in 2004.
