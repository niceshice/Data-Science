Final vote on new EU telecoms rules that safeguard internet access
2009-11-19 - 18:01
A major overhaul of EU telecoms rules, which will strengthen the rights of phone users and internet surfers and boost competition among telecoms firms, will be put to a final vote in Parliament on Tuesday. The new rules, to be implemented by mid-2011, will enhance consumer rights, safeguard internet access, protect data, boost competition and modernise radio spectrum use. Internet access safeguards
Under the new rules, a user's internet access may only be cut off if "appropriate, proportionate and necessary within a democratic society" and only after "a prior, fair and impartial procedure" which gives users the opportunity to state their case and respects the principle of presumption of innocence and the right to privacy. MEPs succeeded, in the final round of negotiations with Council representatives, in adding these safeguards on internet access to the draft directive on electronic communications networks and services.
The directive also includes rules to:
- harmonise radio spectrum management across the EU, especially with a view to the switchover from analogue to digital TV by 2012,
- improve co-operation among Member States' telecoms regulators, and
- allow "functional separation", i.e. rules requiring dominant operators to separate their network infrastructure from business units offering services that use this infrastructure.
Citizens' rights and telecoms regulators
Parliament and Council had already agreed in May 2009 on the two other parts of the telecoms package (EU laws on telecoms regulators and citizens' rights), which were approved by MEPs on 6 May 2009 and by the Council on 26 October 2009.
The law on citizens' rights aims to:
- improve consumer rights, e.g. by allowing customers to have their mobile telephone number transferred within one working day when changing operators, and
- to strengthen personal data and privacy protection, e.g. by requiring the user's consent to the use of cookies.
MEPs also agreed with the EU's telecommunications ministers to set up a European body bringing together all 27 national regulators - the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC). Debate : 23.11.09

Tyre labelling: helping consumers to make an informed choice
2009-11-19 - 18:01
All new car tyres in Europe will in future be labelled to help consumers choose the most environmentally friendly models. From November 2012, tyres will bear labels for fuel efficiency, wet grip and noise performance in a system similar to that used for household appliances such as fridges. An agreement on this issue, hammered out between representatives of Parliament and EU governments, will be put to the vote on Wednesday. Unlike fridges, tyres are not always on display in the shops, so MEPs insisted that retailers be obliged to show the label to the buyer before the sale and also on, or with, invoices. Parliament also negotiated a re-design of the noise pictogram so as to promote very quiet tyres.
With almost 25% of total CO2 emissions coming from road transport, reducing vehicles’ energy intensity and carbon footprint is a major challenge for the EU. Tyres account for 20 to 30% of vehicles’ total fuel consumption.
The proposed regulation will help to raise awareness and to open a discourse between seller and buyer allowing consumers to make an informed choice. It would make consumers aware of the significant difference (both in environmental and economic sense) that exists between tyres - for passenger cars, currently a difference of up to 10% in fuel consumption exists between the best- and worst-performing tyres. The total impact at EU level could be impressive: the impact assessment identified a savings potential of 0.56 to 1.51 Mtoe per year. This is equivalent to removing 0.5 million to 1.3 million passenger cars from EU roads.

MEPs call for ambitious agreement in Copenhagen
2009-11-19 - 18:01
EU government leaders must demonstrate political leadership to make a success of the Copenhagen climate change summit in December, says a draft resolution on which MEPs will vote next Wednesday. Future generations might not be able to control climate change if global action is further delayed, says the text. Reaching an ambitious international agreement at Copenhagen will require emission reduction targets for developed and developing countries, funding commitments and penalties for non-compliance.

Airline bankruptcies: MEPs press for passenger compensation
2009-11-19 - 18:01
Passengers who have booked flights with airlines that go bankrupt should receive compensation, according to a draft resolution due to be put to the vote in Strasbourg next week. In the resolution, drafted by the EPP, S&D, ALDE and Green groups, Parliament asks the Commission to revise existing legislation or come up with new laws to ensure passengers are not left stranded, without accommodation or a flight home. MEPs suggest establishing a "reserve compensation fund" as well as the principle of "mutual-responsibility" for passengers of all airlines flying in the same direction with available seats, which would ensure repatriation for stranded passengers.
"Many of these passengers do not have the financial means to deal with this sort of upheaval. They are from those families who spend their savings on a family holiday, only to see their hard-earned money go down the drain through little fault of their own", chairman of the EP's Transport Committee, Brian SIMPSON (S&D, UK), told the Commission during a debate held in plenary last month.
A total of 77 airlines have filed for bankruptcy in the European Union since 2000. This summer, Sky Europe was the latest, leaving many of its customers with no compensation for tickets purchased. Debate : 07/10/2009

EU enlargement strategy for 2009
2009-11-19 - 18:01
Parliament will state its views on the progress made over the past year by EU candidate countries when it votes on a resolution on the 2009 enlargement strategy drawn up by the European Commission. It is the Commission that conducts the accession negotiations with candidate countries but Parliament's approval is needed at the end of the lengthy negotiation procedures for any new accession to go ahead.
Two countries are currently in negotiations for membership - Croatia and Turkey - while talks have yet to start with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a candidate since 2005. Over the last year the EU has received three new membership applications: Montenegro (December 2008), Albania (April 2009) and Iceland (July 2009). On 16 November the 27 EU foreign ministers backed Albania's request for official candidate status.
Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee will draft a resolution on Monday evening, to be debated by the full Parliament on Wednesday and put to the vote on Thursday.

Parliament gets ready for Lisbon Treaty
2009-11-19 - 18:01
Parliament is preparing for the increased powers it is set to receive under the Lisbon Treaty. Enhanced power over EU legislation and a new budget procedure that puts Parliament on an equal footing with the EU governments, not to mention the arrival of eighteen extra MEPs, are among the key changes. MEPs will vote in Strasbourg on changes to the internal EP rules in order to reflect these changes.
Altogether, 18 additional MEPs from 12 Member States will take their seats in Parliament after the new Treaty enters into force (a protocol confirming the addition of these MEPs has already been ratified by all Member States). Until then the MEPs-designate will not enjoy voting rights but can have observer status if the full Parliament approves the changes to the EP rules.
The rule changes also take account of the major increase in Parliament's legislative powers. With the Lisbon Treaty, almost all EU policy issues will fall under the "ordinary legislative procedure", in which Parliament and Council are equal as lawmakers. Budget rules are also being revised as Parliament will enjoy full parity with Council in deciding the EU budget. Debate : 23.11.09

Budgetary control
Parliament set to approve Council's accounts for 2007
2009-11-19 - 18:01
Parliament is expected to sign off the Council's 2007 budget following a recommendation to do so by the Budgetary Control Committee now that Council has agreed to give the EP access to documents, to answer questions and to hold meetings with MEPs. Unlike other EU institutions, the Council had until always refused to give the Budgetary Control Committee an annual activity report, answer its questions or meet its representatives to discuss the issues.
However, leaving aside the Council's newfound willingness to cooperate with Parliament, the committee was also not fully satisfied with the Council's handling of its budget. For the next budget discharge, the committee will check that the Council has made the necessary changes, including closing all extra-budgetary accounts, improving the verification of invoices, publishing all administrative decisions used as a legal basis for budget items, sending Parliament an annual activity report and answering its questions in writing and, if necessary, orally.
The main part of EU's budget, managed by the Commission, as well as all the other institutions' budgets, were approved earlier this year. Debate : 24.11.09

EU civil rights need to be strengthened by a European internet court, mutual recognition by EU countries of same-sex couples, and a set of prisoners' rights, says a draft resolution to be put to the vote on Wednesday. MEPs want the upcoming five-year "Stockholm programme" of EU laws in the area of civil liberties to consolidate and strengthen citizens' rights. The final version of the programme is due to be adopted by the European Council on 10-11 December.
The draft resolution also proposes to strengthen the fight against terrorism, organised crime, illegal immigration, human trafficking and sexual exploitation. A comprehensive package of legal assistance should be offered to victims of crime and in particular victims of trafficking in human beings and gender violence. Debate : 24.11.09

Google Book Search Project: any impact on Europe?
2009-11-19 - 18:01
MEPs will call on the Commission to gives its views on the Google Book Search Project, and the project's impact on the digitisation of books in Europe and on the rights of authors. The project met with hostility from some US authors and publishers, who took legal action against Google, claiming that it was infringing their copyright by digitising their books and making parts of them public. Last year the two parties reached an agreement. A decision by the US courts is pending.
In its oral question the Legal Affairs Committee also asks the Commission to explain whether the EU's copyright legislation needs to be adapted. Vote :26.11.2009 Profile of Klaus-Heiner LEHNE (EPP, DE) Oral question will be available here

MEPs: immunity and statute
Immunity of ex-MEP Tobias Pflüger to be lifted
2009-11-19 - 18:01
Parliament is expected to waive the parliamentary immunity of Tobias Pflüger, a German former MEP who was accused of insulting behaviour towards two police officers during a counter-demonstration against the 2005 Munich Security Conference. In April 2006 Parliament did not defend the former MEP's immunity in connection with the same two charges of insulting behaviour as well as a charge of attempted assault and battery. The House took the view that waiving his immunity would not negatively affect Mr Pflüger's political activity.
In March 2009 a Munich court (Amtsgericht München) found Mr Pflüger guilty of insulting behaviour. However, a month later the public prosecutor appealed against the penalty, requesting that it be increased.
The Legal Affairs Committee, which is in charge of examining requests to waive parliamentary immunity, sees no reason for Parliament to take a position on the same set of facts. It therefore recommends that the plenary lift Mr Pflüger's immunity. Debate : 23.11.09 (probably)

Budget
Aid to Ireland and Belgium following job losses in computer and textile industries
2009-11-19 - 18:01
Parliament will vote to approve the use of €14.8 million from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to support 2400 employees who lost their jobs when Dell closed its factory in Ireland and € 9.2 million to support 2168 textile workers who lost their jobs in Belgium. Globalisation Adjustment Fund
The European Council agreed to create a European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in December 2005, the legal basis was adopted by Parliament and Council a year later and the fund entered into force on 19 January 2007.
The fund aims to support workers, mainly in regions and sectors which have been disadvantaged by exposure to the globalised economy. It has a potential annual budget of 500 million Euros to facilitate the reintegration into employment of workers.
As the Community budget has no specific budget line for the EGF, the amount reserved (500 million Euros per annum) comes from appropriations initially allocated to other budgetary tasks and left available.
Dell factory in Limerick
The Dell plant in Limerick focused on desktop PC sales, these dropped by 23% in the first quarter of 2009 and a total of 2 840 people working for Dell and its suppliers lost their jobs. 2400 of these will receive help from the EGF.
The redundancies were a consequence of a rapid decline in demand and the company's decision to transfer production of laptops, notebooks and netbooks from Limerick to Asian original design manufacturers, largely based in China, where both production and labour costs are lower.
Dell represents 1.7% of total employment in the Mid-West Region, a region where unemployment before the recent Dell redundancies was already higher than the national average.
Job guidance, training and support to set up own businesses
The package will help 2 400 redundant workers by offering them job guidance, support to set up their own business, training and retraining, an internship programme and education allowances and grants. All in all, these actions will cost € 22 817 000 of which the EGF would provide € 14 831 050, that is 65 % of total costs.
The Irish authorities confirmed that the EGF support does not replace measures which are the responsibility of the company and have assured that the actions provide support for individual workers and are not to be used for restructuring companies or sectors. They also confirmed that the actions do not receive any other EU support.
Possible connections to Dell in Poland
The Employment Committee asked in its opinion to the Budgets Committee whether there could be any links between the redundancies in Ireland and Polish state support (approved by the commission) to Dell to set up a factory in Łódź in Poland and why Dell could not afford to keep its factory in Ireland when it could afford to buy a competitor (Perot Systems) in September 2009.
The Commission answered that the Polish factory was planned long before (Poland notified the Commission in December 2007) the closure in Limerick and that the purchase of the competitor had nothing to do with the Irish closure.
Other EGF grants
So far, this year, the following EGF money has been granted:
Spain:Automobile industry / Castilla y Leon and Aragón: €2 694 300, 1082 redundancies
Spain Textiles / Cataluña: €3 306 750, 1 720 redundancies
Portugal Textiles / Norte - Centro € 832 800, 1 588 redundancies
Germany Mobile phone sector (Nokia) €5 553 850, 1 316 redundancies
Belgium Textiles / Oot en West Vlaanderen and Limburg regions € 9 198 874, 2 199 redundancies
Ireland Computer manufacturing industry / Region of Mid-West (countries of Limerick, Clare, North Tipperary and the city of Limerick) €14 831 050, 2 400 redundancies
TOTAL: € 37 107 624*
Margins: € 462 892 376

Concern over safety of European railways
2009-11-19 - 18:01
The safety of rail freight transport in the EU is a matter of serious concern to MEPs, after recent tragedies such as the rail crash in Viareggio (Italy) last June, and near Rotterdam (Netherlands) last September. They will ask the Commission to explain how it plans to ensure that EU rail freight safety standards are fully upheld. The existing EU Rail Safety Directive sets out clear guidance on the maintenance standards of freight wagons but the Commission has recently published a report stating that Member Sates do not always properly implement the rules, leading to inconsistent standards and safety hazards.

Europol reforms awaiting Lisbon Treaty: MEPs want decision powers

Four proposals, on Europol's analysis work files, the confidentiality of its information, its exchange of personal data with partners and its agreements with third countries, may well be rejected in a plenary vote. MEPs argue that Europol files should not be amended until the Lisbon Treaty, which gives Parliament decision-taking powers in the area of police co-operation, has entered into force. MEPs are likely to call on the Commission and Council to agree in plenary to table a proposal for a new Europol decision within six months of the treaty's entry into force. Joint debate : 23.11.2009

Better statistics on the use of pesticides
2009-11-19 - 18:01
The sale and use of pesticides needs to be monitored more strictly as part of EU plans to ensure they are used more safely. To this end, Parliament will vote next week on the introduction of new rules for the dissemination of statistics on the sale and use of pesticides. The vote will be on a third-reading agreement reached between Parliament and EU government representatives. It includes compromises on the thorniest issues, such as the scope of the regulation: it will be restricted to plant protection products and include non-agricultural uses. The draft law will lay down rules on the frequency and format of data collection and the requirement to report data periodically. It also complements other legislation on pesticides agreed at the end of last year. Debate : 23.11.2009
