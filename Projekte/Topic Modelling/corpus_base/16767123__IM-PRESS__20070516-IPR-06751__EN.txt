The European Parliament adopted a written declaration on establishing a green hydrogen economy and a third industrial revolution in Europe through a partnership with committed regions and cities, SMEs and civil society organisations with 420 MEPs signing the declaration. The President of the European Parliament Hans-Gert PÃ¶ttering announced at the beginning of the session in Strasbourg, that with more than half of all MEPs signing the declaration it had been adopted.
The written declaration calls upon the EU Institutions to:
- pursue a 20% increase in energy efficiency by 2020,
- reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2020 (compared to 1990 levels),
- produce 33% of electricity and 25% of overall energy from renewable energy sources by 2020,
- institute hydrogen fuel cell storage technology, and other storage technologies, for portable, stationary and transport uses and establish a decentralised bottom-up hydrogen infrastructure by 2025 in all EU Member States,
- make power grids smart and independent by 2025 so that regions, cities, SMEs and citizens can produce and share energy in accordance with the same open-access principles as apply to the internet now.
Global warming and costs of fossil fuels, say MEPs, are increasing and having regard to the debate launched by the European Parliament and the Commission on the future of energy policy and climate change. A post-fossil fuel and post-nuclear energy vision should be the next important project of the European Union.
The declaration says the five key factors for energy independence are: maximising energy efficiency, reducing global-warming gas emissions, optimising the commercial introduction of renewable energies, establishing hydrogen fuel-cell technology to store renewable energies and creating smart power grids to distribute energy.
What's next
The written declaration will be forwarded, together with the names of the signatories, to the Commission and the Member States. The declaration will be included in the minutes of the sitting. Publication in the minutes closes the procedure.
