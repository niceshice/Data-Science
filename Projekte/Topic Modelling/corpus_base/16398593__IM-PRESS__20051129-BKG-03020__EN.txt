Opening of the session - President Borrell on kidnappings in Iraq and World AIDS Day on 1 December
Opening of the session - President Borrell on kidnappings in Iraq / World AIDS Day
President Borrell opened the mini-session in Brussels with statements on kidnappings in Iraq and World AIDS Day. The President also highlighted the changes to the agenda.
President Borrell calls on all to exercise influence to release hostages in Iraq
Among most recent victims, two are European citizens: Susanne Osthoff from Germany, a prestigious archaeologist who has been a member of Iraqi society for the last ten years, and who has devoted all her efforts helping the Iraqi people since the start of the war. The second European kidnapped is a British citizen, Norman Kember, a member of a Canadian NGO abducted with two Canadians and one United States colleague. There has been an intense mobilisation to free them, especially in Germany and Britain. We should support and actively participate in this campaign, repeating that nothing could ever justify such acts.
World AIDS Day - President Borrell expresses thanks to volunteers who help around the world
Turning to a more global problem affecting millions of human beings, the President said " Tomorrow is World Day for the fight against AIDS. The European Parliament must mobilise efforts and political influence to focus on this issue. The mobilisation so far has been strong but inadequate - we must make citizens aware AIDS pandemic continues to expand. In 2001, 35 million people were affected. Four years later, the figure is now 41 million, half of whom are women and 2.5 million are children under 15. Five million more people will be infected this year. Pandemic is advancing at 10 per cent per year. Three million people will die this year, half a million of then children. AIDS is also a matter of inequality. We in the industrialised world have assistance and prevention, and research for vaccinations, but most do not have this possibility. In Africa, especially Sub-Saharan Africa, a high price is being paid. 26 million people are infected. With 10 per cent of world's population, they have 60 per cent of carriers. Only seven per cent have access to proper health care. These are dramatic and cruel figures - they show this is an issue of world inequality alongside malnutrition and the famine crisis. We need more help for prevention, for understanding and a cure. AIDS is also an expression of exclusion because of the irrational fear, condemnation of behaviour on religious grounds and isolation in families and the workplace - we need to fight against daily. Parliament should express its gratitude to the millions of volunteers who help around the world. The Parliament will have an information campaign and special meeting of the Development Committee tomorrow. We should be aware of extent of drama and political will needed to confront it ."
Parliament calls for a constructive WTO meeting in Hong Kong
Vote
As trade ministers from the 148 members of the WTO prepare for the Hong Kong ministerial conference of 13-18 December, the European Parliament set out on Thursday its expectations for the meeting in a resolution adopted by a more than four to one majority. A delegation of 30 MEPs will be taking part in the meeting and a parallel session of the Parliamentary Conference on the WTO.
In the resolution, which received 475 votes in favour, 106 against and 14 abstentions, MEPs say it is essential that the Doha Round succeeds in order to strengthen the multilateral trade system to ensure harmonious development of the world economy. They strongly support the placing of development at the heart of the round, stressing the negotiations must help in eradicating poverty. They also regret the slow progress so far, and are deeply concerned about the serious effect that a failure would have on the multilateral trade system. They therefore call for a constructive ministerial conference in Hong Kong to prepare for a successful conclusion of the round in 2006. Emphasising the need for a balanced outcome covering every key sector they call on all stakeholders, especially in more advanced countries, to assume their responsibilities to bring the round closer to a successful conclusion.
Agriculture
The resolution says the Hong Kong meeting must agree on the phasing out of all export subsidies by all developed country WTO members in parallel and stresses the need for a substantial reduction in trade distorting domestic support and a significant improvement in market access. The four groups reiterate their support for the CAP reform. Stressing the importance of the multifunctional character of EU agriculture being respected, the resolution also supports the EU's focus on non-trade concerns such as food safety and quality, the environment and employment in rural areas. MEPs call for the effective recognition of geographical indications as part of the round. The issue of sensitive products needs to be resolved in a way which fully respects the Doha Development Round's principles. An effective solution needs to be found on cotton - including the elimination of all export subsidies from developed countries by 2010.
NAMA - Non-agricultural market access
Parliament calls for the acceleration of NAMA negotiations, saying trade barriers between developing countries as well as between developed and developing countries are an obstacle to sustainable development. Advanced countries should open their markets to the least developed countries, while the problem of preference erosion should also be addressed. The principle of less-than-full reciprocity needs to be respected, as does the issue of the significant government income from industrial tariffs in many developing countries. There needs to be adequate protection of nascent industries, promotion of industrialisation and diversification and safeguarding of jobs, especially for the Least Developed Countries (LDCs). All trading partners, where justified, should also remove their non-tariff barriers.
Services
Calling for Hong Kong to "lay the foundations for an ambitious agreement on trade in services" the resolution says market access for EU service provides should be enhanced while also safeguarding WTO members' ability to regulate their service sectors. While calling for substantive progress in this field, MEPs say an exception should be made for health, education and audiovisual services. They call on developed and emerging WTO members to make efforts of similar ambition as the EU's offer of January 2005 and for supplementary approaches to this field to be investigated, with due regard for the interests of LDCs.
Development Issues
Trade coupled with aid and debt relief is essential to meet the 2015 Millennium Goals, says the resolution, calling for concrete results on development aspects of the round at Hong Kong. Special and Differential Treatment should be an integral part of the WTO agreements. Developed countries should give tariff- and quota-free access to all goods from LDCs, along the lines of the EU's Everything but Arms plan. The resolution supports the idea of a "free round" for LDCs and vulnerable countries. There also needs to be more trade related technical assistance for LDCs and a coherent "aid for trade" facility to help poorer countries make the most of any trade deal. The text calls for an urgent and permanent solution to the issue of TRIPs and TRIMs (Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and Trade Related Investment Measures) to ensure access to medicines for countries with no manufacturing capacity facing public health concerns.
Among other issues dealt with by the resolution, there is a call for stronger multilateral rules on anti-dumping. surveillance and countervailing measures, taking account of the needs of developing countries and LDCs. MEPs also stress the need to take account of social, environmental and cultural issues. They call for Parliament to be kept fully informed throughout the negotiations, noting the EP's right of assent to the conclusion of trade rounds, agreed at the end of the Uruguay Round. Finally, they say reform of the WTO is much needed, including better negotiating procedures and greater efficiency and transparency, and a better Dispute Settlement Mechanism.
Debate
As hopes fade for a broad political agreement on international trade at the Hong Kong ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organisation on 13-18 December, MEPs debated the EU's aims for the meeting with ministers and the Commission. . The European Parliament voted on Thursday on its expectations. A delegation of 30 MEPs will be taking part in the meeting and a parallel session of the Parliamentary Conference on the WTO.
Four political groups (EPP-ED, PES, ALDE and UEN) have put forward a draft joint resolution on the subject, which gives a good idea of what can be expected in Thursday's vote. The following is a summary of this draft resolution.
The four groups say it is essential that the Doha Round succeeds in order to strengthen the multilateral trade system to ensure harmonious development of the world economy. They strongly support the placing of development at the heart of the round, stressing the negotiations must help in eradicating poverty. They also regret the slow progress so far, and are deeply concerned about the serious effect that a failure would have on the multilateral trade system. They therefore call for a constructive ministerial conference in Hong Kong to prepare for a successful conclusion of the round in 2006. Emphasising the need for a balanced outcome covering every key sector they call on all stakeholders, especially in more advanced countries, to assume their responsibilities to bring the round closer to a successful conclusion.
Preparation for WTO conference
MEPs seek tough measures on bird flu
The European Parliament is pushing for tougher measures to control bird flu. It wants improved early warning systems so that the authorities are immediately informed about any outbreak of the virus even if it is low pathogenic flu with few symptoms, because that can mutate into the highly pathogenic deadly form. The Parliament also urges the development of low-cost vaccines for poultry and a coordinated emergency plan in the event of human contamination.
MEPs are calling for tough new measures on avian flu control. These measures, which the Parliament wants to come into force as quickly as possible, introduce compulsory surveillance in the Member States for Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza, which can mutate into the Highly Pathogenic form. The House also emphasises the need to develop cost-effective vaccines for poultry.
Parliament seeks to beef up the measures to be taken by the EU if bird flu hits Europe. Firstly, early warning systems must be improved, say the House; the authorities must be informed immediately of any outbreak of the virus, even if it is believed to be Low Pathogenic.
Temporary restrictions could be introduced on the transport of birds in the event of a crisis, pending the findings of epidemiological surveys, says the Parliament. Poultry and other birds must not be moved to other establishments until it is established that there is no risk they will spread the disease. Eggs can be exempted in order to be transported to a processing plant, as thermal elimination of the virus is regarded as more effective by MEPs than destruction on the spot. Robust contingency plans should also be drawn up to deal with any outbreak and to ensure proper co-ordination among animal and public health authorities.
MEPs say that robust contingency plans should also be drawn up to deal with any outbreak and to ensure proper co-ordination among animal and public health authorities. All good sense measures must be taken so that confidence among consumers is restored.
The measures to be taken in the event of a crisis in the EU's neighbouring countries should also be tightened up, with restrictions on movements and imports from non-EU countries, the extension of protection zones to the EU's neighbours and the supply of vaccines where these countries are unable to combat a crisis without outside assistance.
For cases of human contamination, MEPs believe coordinated emergency plans should be envisaged, notably to determine the measures to be put in place in the event of a confirmed risk. These emergency plans would promote coordination between Member States as well as targeting populations needing to be vaccinated as a matter of priority. Anti-virals and vaccines must be as widely available as possible: Member States must create sufficient stockpiles of anti-virals and ensure that they have adequate capacity to produce vaccines against the strain causing the crisis. If a crisis occurs outside the EU, the House believes the Commission should be able to act within 24 hours by imposing measures such as quarantine, the disinfection of any airports receiving flights from certain regions and travel restrictions.
Parliament also recommends closer cooperation with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, based at Solna in Sweden. The role of this agency, which began operations in May 2005, is to help strengthen Europe's defences against infectious diseases such as influenza, SARS and HIV/AIDS.
More funding for veterinary measures
The Parliament will also adopted a report on veterinary expenditure. Here the House stresses the need for equal co-financing rates for outbreaks of both High Pathogenic and Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza. The report calls for a Community-Member State ratio of 50-50 for both types, recognising the need to eradicate the Low Pathogenic form as this can mutate into HPAI. Parliament also favours the idea of the Community paying 100% of the cost of vaccinations.
These two reports have been adopted following the presentation by the European Commission of a proposed directive designed to update measures to be taken in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza. After Parliament's vote on Thursday the ball will be in the court of the Council, which plans to push through the legislation (a priority of the UK Presidency) before the end of the year.

MEPs back the importance of euro-regions and reducing inequalities
In adopting an own-initiative report on the role of "Euroregions" in the development of regional policy, MEPs s underline the need to give priority to eliminating disparities between regions in the new Member States and in the old Member States.
Parliament also stresses that cross-border cooperation provides a suitable approach to solving daily problems on both sides of the border, especially in economic, social, cultural and environmental fields.
Natural handicaps to cross-border co-operation
MEPs also recall the importance of cross-border co-operation and Euroregions for Member States with natural handicaps including small island states.
Lastly, the House stresses the need to support cross-border co-operation and the establishment of Euroregions, including regions from the sensitive area of the Middle East, in an effort to promote friendly relations, stability, security and economic interests in terms of mutual respect and benefit.
Report on the role of "Euroregions" in the development of regional policy
VAT in the spotlight
Parliament has adopted two reports and one resolution on the VAT system, covering minimum standard rates, reduced rates for labout intensive services and the refund system for businesses trading outside their home Member State.
Both reports were drawn up by Zsolt László BECSEY (EPP-ED, HU). The first deals with the minimum standard rate of VAT in the EU. This is currently fixed at 15 per cent until the end of 2005. The Commission is proposing to extend this minimum rate until the end of 2010. Parliament approved this extension, under the consultation procedure, but MEPs also voted to set a maximum rate at 25 per cent. This would have the aim of preventing an further divergence in the standard rates applied by the Member States, thereby avoiding structural imbalances in the EU. (At present, Cyprus and Luxembourg have standard rates of 15 per cent, while Denmark, Hungary and Sweden are at 25 per cent, with the others ranged in between.) Parliament is also asking the Commission to make a general assessment of the macro-economic impact of implicit and standard VAT rates in the Member States, which should also consider allowing all Member States the same opportunity to apply reduced rates on certain goods and services.
The second report which was adopted with 512 votes in favour, 81 against and 10 abstentions deals with the final aspect of the VAT one-stop-shop scheme, which aims to simplify the VAT system in particular for small businesses trading outside their home Member State - the particular issue here being the detailed rules of VAT refunds due to companies from VAT authorities outside their own Member States. Parliament is being consulted on this particular measure some time after the rest of the package because of a change to the legal base. Under the proposed procedure, requests for refunds would continue to be dealt with by the Member State where the VAT was paid, the amount refundable would be determined under the deduction rules of the Member State where the expenses are incurred, and the repayments made directly by that Member State to the requesting taxable person. MEPs adopted a few amendments aimed in particular at clarifying the various deadlines within which VAT authorities must respond to applications for refunds.
Since both of the above items come under the consultation procedure, the final decision is now up to the Council.
The resolution relates to the lack of progress in the Council of Ministers in agreeing what to do next regarding the experiment introduced in 1999 which allows some Member States to apply reduced rates of VAT to certain labour intensive services. This provision expires at the end of 2005, and was only open to the nine Member States who originally took up the opportunity so none of the new Member States joining in 2004 were able to use it. Ireland has not applied these reduced rates, in the UK jurisdiction they apply only for housing repairs on the Isle of Man. MEPs are urging the Council to prolong the experiment until the end of 2006, by which time the Commission is requested to present a comprehensive evaluation - they say the previous evaluation was based on insufficient data. They point to the alarming situation regarding the expiry of the provisions and an immediate switch to standard VAT rates that might lead to price increases job cuts in the sectors concerned. They call for the Commission and Council to avoid legal uncertainty after the end of the year. Following the evaluation, Parliament supports making these exemptions permanent for those sectors where results are satisfactory. In other sectors, the reduced rates should be phased out in a planned way. Parliament also calls on the Council to allow new Member States to apply reduced rates to certain labour-intensive services if they so wish, putting an end to the current discriminatory situation. 1.

Preparing for a wider euro area
MEPs have approved the legal changes necessary for new Member States wishing to adopt the euro as their currency, possibly as early as 1 January 2007. A report by Dariusz ROSATI (PES, PL) seeks modifications in the timetable for the cash changeover, but otherwise broadly support's the Commission's plans.
MEPs say the period between adoption of the euro and the introduction of notes and coins should be no more than one year, while agreeing with the Commission that it could be eliminated altogether. They want to limit the period of dual circulation of the old and new notes and coins to no more than two months, with banks changing the old currencies for euro without charge for a further three months. Finally, they call for thorough preparations by the Member States adopting the single currency, notably including sufficiently lengthy periods of dual pricing.
The changes need to become law by the end of 2005 if there is to be sufficient time for country's aiming to adopt the euro in January 2007 to make the necessary preparations. Currently, Estonia, Lithuania and Slovenia are aiming at this entry date.

MEPs underline their powers on the EU budget for 2007-2013
In adopting an own initiative report on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure, Parliament reminds the Council that there will be no Financial Perspective and no Interinstitutional Agreement without an agreement between the European Parliament and the Council. The House also recalls that since it adopted its negotiating position on 8 June 2005 in due time, it will reject any attempt to hold it responsible for any delay in reaching agreement.
MEPs also tress that there will be no Financial Perspective without an agreement on a revised Interinstitutional Agreement on the budgetary procedure. Nevertheless, Parliament confirms their will to make all efforts to find an agreement on the next Financial Perspective.
Finally, the House reminds the Council that in absence of a financial framework 2007-2013 and a new Interinstitutional Agreement the financial needs of the European Union including for multi-annual programmes can be ensured in other ways which would mean a complex annual budgetary procedure.
