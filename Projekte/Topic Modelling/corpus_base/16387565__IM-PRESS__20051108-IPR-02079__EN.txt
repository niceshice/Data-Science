Ombudsman

Through the European Ombudsman, EU citizens can obtain redress for cases of maladministration by Community institutions and bodies. The Ombudsman is elected by the European Parliament in a procedure in which the Petitions Committee plays a central role.
Parliament adopted a report by 426 votes in favour, 3 against, with 9 abstentions on the European Ombudsman's activities in 2004. MEPs call on the EU institutions to adopt a harmonised code of good administrative behaviour.
The resolution welcomes the efforts to give the Ombudsman's work a higher media profile, believing this could help reduce the number of complaints received which fall outside his remit. In 2004, almost 75% of complaints lodged fell outside the Ombudsman's remit as they did not concern a Community institution or body. The current Ombudsman, Nikiforos DIAMANDOUROS , is thus urged to continue his efforts to raise public awareness of his functions and responsibilities.
This year, which marks the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the Ombudsman's office, 3,726 complaints were received. This represents a sharp increase on the previous year (+53%), half of the extra cases being accounted for by complaints from citizens of the ten new Member States. The cases of maladministration meriting investigation by the Ombudsman can be categorised as follows: lack of transparency or refusal to provide information (22%), discrimination (19%), avoidable delays (12%), procedural errors (9%), injustice or abuse of power (7%), failure to fulfil obligations (7%), negligence (6%) and errors in law (5%).
Parliament wants all EU institutions to interpret, as broadly as possible, the provisions of Regulation No 1049/2001 governing public access to documents. It also approves of the efforts by the Ombudsman to persuade the institutions to meet shorter deadlines for dealing with this type of complaint.
A common code of conduct for all European institutions
MEPs particularly support the Ombudsman's efforts to provide all Community institutions and bodies with a harmonised " code of good administrative behaviour " and urge the Commission to end the current situation.
In addition, the House calls on the Ombudsman to define more precisely the concept of " maladministration ", drawing up a strict and exhaustive list of institutions and bodies covered and categorically excluding all complaints which fall under the responsibility of the Member States’ authorities.
The resolution also backs a review of the Ombudsman's statute and the extension and strengthening of the system of non-judicial appeal which it says " provides citizens with an alternative to legal action whose decisions and recommendations are not legally binding and do not constitute coercive measures ". The Ombudsman is also called on to seek amicable solutions wherever possible in the cases he deals with.
Finally, MEPs commend the good working relationship developed between the Ombudsman's Office and the Petitions Committee, including the process for the mutual transfer of cases, and they stress that they value the close cooperation established by the European Ombudsman with his national, regional and local counterparts, although they would like to see greater cooperation with the petitions committees of the national parliaments.
Analysis of complaints examined in 2004
The statistics for the year 2004 show that the institution has already reached maturity: 3,726 complaints were received in 2004 (an increase of 53% over 2003), of which 3536 were from individual citizens and 190 from companies and associations. The sharp rise in the number of complaints is not just a result of enlargement: 657 complaints came from the new Member States, equivalent to 51% of the rate of increase for 2004, while the remaining 49% were accounted for by complaints from the 15 old Member States and from third countries.
The most numerous complaints came from citizens of the following countries: 482 from Spain (12.9%), 464 from Germany (12.4%), 303 from France (8.1%), 285 from Poland (7.6%), 269 from Italy (7.2%), 268 from Belgium (7.2%) and 195 from the United Kingdom (5.2%). In terms of the EU’s population, however, the geographical distribution of complaints is slightly different: Germany (18%), France (13.5%), United Kingdom (13%), Italy (12.6%), Spain (9.2%), Poland (8.3%) and the Netherlands (3.5%).
