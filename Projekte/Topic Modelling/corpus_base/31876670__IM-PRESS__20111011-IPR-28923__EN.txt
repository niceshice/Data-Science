Andrew BOREHAM BXL (+32) 2 28 42319 PORT (+32) 498 98 34 01 EMAIL press-en@europarl.europa.eu Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek welcomed progress towards democracy in the Middle East, but condemned recent violence there, at the opening of this week's Brussels plenary session. He also condemned the 7-year jail sentence imposed on Ukrainian opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko on 11 October.
Mr Buzek welcomed the advent of stability in Libya, albeit with concern for the plight of refugees. He also welcomed the fact that Tunisia seemed to be heading for free elections, and said he would visit it in the coming weeks, to convey Parliament's wishes for neighbourly co-operation.
He condemned recent violence in Egypt, calling on the authorities there not to foment discord and to promote religious tolerance. He also condemned recent violence in Syria and Yemen, calling on the international community to "stand up to their brutal regimes".
Tymoshenko sentence "politically motivated"
The seven-year jail sentence imposed on Ukraine's former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko was a "politically-motivated act" and a case of "selective application of the law" said Mr Buzek, stressing that proper application of the law is a prerequisite for any EU-Ukraine co-operation agreement.
Other announcements
Lena Ek (ALDE, SE) has resigned to take up a post in the Swedish government.
A resolution on the situation in Egypt, Syria and Yemen will be put to the vote at the October II plenary session.
