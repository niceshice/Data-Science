STOA exhibition - looking to the future
For 20 years the "Scientific Technology Options Assessment" or STOA has been advising Parliament's committees and MEPs on science and technology as they draft and vote on legislation. An exhibition in Strasbourg this week looks back over the last two decades and features examples of scientific breakthroughs such as hybrid cars and tools that can explore the human body. With over 300 studies behind it STOA is now looking at transport and energy issues.
A key aspect of STOA is its independence and its role in stimulating scientific and technological know-how in the Parliament. STOA also works closely with research institutes, consultancies, laboratories and individual researchers.
Some of its studies have looked into: renewable energies, antibiotic resistance and therapies against cancer. A current study is looking at climate change and energy resources in 2007 to help prepare future legislation.
However, it is not resting on its laurels. It recently launched a "pairing" scheme where MEPs and scientists will spend a day in each others' "constituency" - an MEP will go to a science research centre and a scientist will come to the Parliament to shadow an MEP.
STOA's work gives Parliament scientific "credibility"
The importance of STOA to the Parliament's work was summed up by President Pöttering who opened the exhibition. He said that it had helped Parliament build "credibility" when dealing with scientific and technological legislation.
Speaking at the exhibition Greek MEP Antonios Trakatellis (EPP-ED) paid tribute to the STOA team when he said that "it's sometimes difficult for lawmakers to understand a scientific issue and decide the right thing to do - STOA helps decisively".
The Parliament's scientific research panel comprises 15 MEPs whose Chair is Philippe Busquin (PES, BE). The work of STOA is carried out in partnership with external experts including research institutes, consultancies, laboratories and individual researchers. STOA was officially launched in March 1987.
