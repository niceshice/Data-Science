Will all lorry drivers have to follow same working time rules?

A lorry driver at the wheel of his vehicle Bauer wants separate rules for independents Socialists want self-employed drivers within scope of rules Should independent lorry drivers follow the same rules as those employed by companies and should the EU set limits on their working time, or does being independent imply self-regulation? Parliament is divided along political lines: generally the centre-right opposes regulation and the centre-left backs it. Over a year of talks could come to a head with a key vote in the Employment Committee Wednesday.
The key question is whether to include self-employed workers within the scope of legislation on working time for lorry drivers, meaning setting limits on their hours for activities other than driving. Self-employed driving hours and rest periods are regulated.
Before the European elections last year, MEPs voted to include them under the 2002 directive - rejecting the European Commission's separate proposal for independents - but when it returned to the Employment Committee in September the plenary decision was overturned by one vote, sending the proposal back to the drawing board.
Parliament split over inclusion of self-employed drivers
Slovak EPP member Edit Bauer is guiding the proposals through the EP and she supports the Commission's position. "In my opinion it was probably a mistake to include the regulation of the working time of the self-employed in the 2002 Directive...Moreover, it would hardly be possible to enforce this regulation, or it would be very expensive."
But British Socialist Stephen Hughes, who is acting as the "shadow rapporteur on the dossier said, "if we don't include the self-employed, there will be a double regime for working time, which could lead to unfair competition and the proliferation of bogus self-employed drivers, since it is so advantageous for the sector (with long working hours, low costs and no social welfare obligations)".
He also sees dangers. "Excluding the self-employed would lead to unsecure roads given that such legislation would in effect introduce the 86-hour week. Fatigue kills and it does not make any difference if the driver is employed or self-employed."
Call for crackdown on "bogus self-employed"
Ms Bauer wants to tackle the problem of "bogus self-employed", giving a more detailed definition of what constitutes a "self-employed" driver (ie: someone working for multiple employers) in order to "identify and eliminate" those trying to play the system.
"We are asking the European Commission to focus on how to control self-employed and not only in connection with road transport activities, as it can cause problems on the labour market and distort economic competition," Ms Bauer said.
