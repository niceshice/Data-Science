External/international trade

Any trade in equipment such as spiked batons, thumb-cuffs and any body-worn electric-shock weapon should be banned in Europe, say MEPs in a resolution adopted on Thursday. Penalties should also be imposed on those who infringe EU rules, they add. And Member States should report regularly on their export licences issued for instruments that could be used for torture or other ill-treatment.
The list of equipment whose trade is prohibited by Council Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 does not include spiked batons, certain wall or floor restraints, certain leg restraints, finger-cuffs, thumb-cuffs, thumbscrews and body-worn electric-shock stun devices other than ‘stun belts’. MEPs therefore want them to be banned by updating Annex II of the regulation.
Complete reporting by Member States
With only seven EU States having produced public annual reports giving details of export licensing decisions, MEPs urge all Member States to submit reports with information such as the number of applications received, items involved, countries of destination and the decisions taken on each application.
In addition, Member States should inform the Commission about the penalties for infringement of the above regulation and ensure they are implemented. These penalties must be beefed up if they prove insufficient, says Parliament.
Investigating imports of electric shock stun belts by Member States
The resolution, which was adopted by show of hands, also strongly condemns attempts by Members States or European companies to import electric-shock stun belts, imports of which are prohibited, or other devices with similar effects. MEPs ask for a an urgent investigation by the Commission to investigate if and when such devices have been transferred to any Member State and to determine whether they have been used by law enforcement or prison authorities.
