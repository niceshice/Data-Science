The European Parliament's Budgets Committee on Wednesday backed a proposal to provide EU funding for 834 workers in the Czech Republic and Poland who were made redundant following the closure of their companies.
EGF Czech Republic
The Czech Republic submitted an application to mobilise the EGF in respect of 634 redundancies in the Unilever ČR company, operating in the retail sector in the region of Střední Čechy. The proposed amount is €323,820.
EGF Poland
Poland has requested assistance in respect of 594 redundancies in three firms. The companies produced machinery and equipment in the region of Podkarpackie in Poland, which has been severely hit by the economic crisis. The proposed amount is €453,570, which will be used to assist 200 people find their way back to the labour market.
Next steps
Following the green light by the committee, the full Parliament and the Council of Ministers still have to give their approval.
The Budgets Committee also decided to ask for an evaluation on the long-term integration into the labour market of workers that received support through the EGF.
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was established to provide additional support for workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation or the financial crisis and to assist them with their reintegration into the labour market. The annual ceiling of the fund is €500 million.
