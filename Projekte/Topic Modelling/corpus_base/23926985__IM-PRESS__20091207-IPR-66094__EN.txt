europarlTV interviews Jean-Claude Trichet ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet expects the eurozone economy to grow "at a moderate pace" next year but warns that any growth will be "surrounded by a high level of uncertainty". At his quarterly meeting with MEPs on Monday, Mr Trichet added that monetary exit strategies need to be "timely and gradual".
He also said that the key ECB interest rates are still at "appropriate at current levels" and will stay unchanged. In addition, "six-month refinancing operations will be ended at the end of March next year".
Monetary exit strategies from the crisis
In reply to questions by Burkhard Balz (EPP, DE) and Edward Scicluna (S&D, MT) on the coordination of exit strategies with national ministries and the fear that the crisis might recur, Mr Trichet assured MEPs that there is a "very good understanding" with national authorities. Trichet conceded that demand for credit has diminished – "as always after recession"– and that it has to be always taken into account that shocks still can happen, as they are very "unpredictable".
He pointed to the danger that the market might get "addicted" to measures introduced, so the ECB is trying to find the "appropriate moment" to stop them. But, noting that in many countries banks are already repaying their loans and the situation is getting better, he stressed again that such a decision has to be "timely".
Systemic risk and future financial supervision architecture
Otmar Karas (EPP, AT) said that the four main political groups in the EP had condemned the deal the Council reached last week on the financial supervisory package. According to Trichet, this may not be "the best option" but given the complexity of this issue, he considered "the Swedish presidency has done a good job".
Arlene McCarthy (S&D, UK) asked a number of practical questions about the ESRB such as its close cooperation with ECB, data collection on systemic risk and the launching of recruitment procedures for its staff. Mr. Trichet assured her that the ECB is "working a lot" on all these practical aspects and explained that the ESRB was "designated to allow close cooperation" with ECB and national authorities. Central banks want to participate in this exercise and to concentrate on systemic risk detection.
In response to Sylvie Goulard (ALDE, FR), who stressed the need for the risk system "to be really effective", Mr Trichet stressed that "well before the crisis", the ECB called for a body with a "close link to macro-supervision" to be set up, which would in his view be better, but stressed again that the compromise reached by Swedish presidency was a good one.
