Petrol vapour contains the potentially cancerous benzene © J.Sullivan/Getty/AFP When you fill up your car with petrol you often find that your hand will reek of petrol unless you have worn gloves. Escaping petrol vapour contains benzene which has been linked to cancer and contributes to the formation of ground-level ozone smog which damages human health and the environment. Tuesday sees MEPs vote on new measures agreed with EU Transport Ministers that could will give the green light to new technology to suck the vapour back into the tank and prevent it escaping.
It is hoped that the new technologies will be able to create a vacuum and suck the dispensing hose and nozzle, either to the station's underground storage tank or directly back to the fuel pump.

The plan is for these methods to be compulsory at all new or renovated petrol stations from 2012 and for it to be used in all filling stations from 2018, although very small ones will be exempted. The MEP who drafted Parliament's position on the new measures was Greek GUE/NGL member Dimitrios Papadimoulis.
The deal was brokered by the Czech Presidency of the EU. Speaking about the measures Jana Reinišová, deputy head of the country's representation to the Union, said that "vapour recuperation systems will not only improve the protection of environment and of public health, but also save petrol". The vote will take place Tuesday from 12.00 CET.
Petrol vapour
Petrol vapour contains a mix of hydrocarbons including benzene
Hydrocarbons react in the atmosphere to make ground-level ozone
Human exposure to ground-level ozone can irritate the respiratory system and inflame the lungs and even cause death
Ozone damage is the most serious regional air pollution problem affecting forests, vegetation and agricultural crops in Europe
