EP President Jerzy Buzek at a press conference on the hearings of Commissioner designates. Strasbourg, 18 Jan Speaking to journalists following the decision of the Bulgarian government to withdraw Rumiana Jeleva as commissioner-designate, Parliament President Jerzy Buzek said the democratic process was working and indicated the next steps of the procedure.
Buzek acknowledged the decision of the Bulgarian government and said that there was now a “clear agenda” for the coming weeks. Parliament would now await the new commissioner-designate from Bulgaria and the proposal of Commission President Barroso for the portfolio to be held by the new candidate.
As soon as possible thereafter Parliament would forward a questionnaire to the commissioner-designate and schedule the necessary parliamentary hearing in accordance with the same procedure as applied to all other candidates.
Mr Buzek currently expected the hearing to be held on 3 February, with Parliament’s vote on the Commission as a whole to take place on 9 February, two days ahead of the next meeting of the European Council. These dates would be confirmed as soon as possible.
Asked whether he foresaw any other new hearings being scheduled alongside that for the new Bulgarian nominee, Buzek said that, on the basis of his discussions so far he did not expect this to be the case, but that Parliament’s final position on all the other commissioners-designate would be decided by political group leaders at a meeting scheduled for Thursday 21 January.
The President's statement came after Parliament received the news on Tuesday morning of the withdrawal of the Bulgarian nominee Rumiana Jeleva. Mrs Jeleva had appeared before Parliament’s Development Committee a week earlier, on Tuesday, 12 January 2010.
It now falls to the Bulgarian government to put forward another nominee for the post of commissioner, and for President Barroso to present the new commissioner-designate to the European Parliament together with the portfolio attributed.
Updates concerning the next steps to be taken in the hearings procedure will be available from this site.
