High charges affect 147 million people across the EU
As anyone who has ever made telephone calls on holiday or on a business trip will know - the bill when it arrives can often be very costly. In fact these "roaming" charges are roughly four times higher than domestic ones. Reducing them is the subject of a new European Commission regulation discussed on Tuesday at a hearing in Parliament. The aim is ambitious: to reduce the cost of using a mobile abroad by up 70% and force companies to give consumers more information on their charges.
An example highlights the extent of the problem. In Poland a local call will cost the equivalent of € 0.19. Should a German customer cross into Poland and make the same call they will pay from € 0.32 to € 2.56.
The Commission are proposing three approaches to getting a better deal for the consumer. Firstly, by regulating "wholesale prices" - the prices that phone operators pay one another when their customers use another network.
Secondly, regulating the retail price that consumers will actually pay. Finally, make it obligatory for operators to inform customers of their roaming charges. This could be done by sending them a text message when they go to another country.
At the hearing - attended by MEPs, phone regulators and telecoms companies and organised by Parliament's Industry and Internal Market Committees - there was consensus that prices are far too high.
"a huge bill at the end of the month"
Paul Rübig of the European People's Party said charges vary from "high to excessive" and that you realise this when you receive "a huge bill at the end of the month". Mr Rübig is the rapporteur on the issue for the Industry Committee. He favours a balanced approach to help the interests of the caller and the mobile phone industry.
Socialist MEP Joseph Muscat - rapporteur for the Internal Market Committee - called for a threefold approach: this includes "transparency" - "no surprises" when you get your phone bill: "simplicity" - the proposed regulation should be understandable and finally "flexibility" to give the consumers choice.
The umbrella group that represents national phone regulators - the European Regulators Group called for competition to allow flexibility and innovation. Its representative told the hearing that "we have to avoid a situation of uniformity of prices, which will decrease competition".
Also present was representative of the Spanish telecoms giant "Telefonica" who pointed out that retail prices had gone down by 20% between May 2005 and May 2006
MEPs on the Industry Committee - the lead one for this regulation - will vote on a report on this issue on 11 April whilst the full Parliament will vote in its May Plenary session.
