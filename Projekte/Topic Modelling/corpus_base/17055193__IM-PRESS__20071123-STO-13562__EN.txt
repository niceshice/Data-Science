Romanians go to the polls
One of the newest members of the EU goes to the polls on Sunday to elect Members of the European Parliament for the first time. Over 18 million Romanians can vote in an election that has focused on living standards and the extent to which Romanians can move freely around the Union. The 35 MEPs elected will hold office until EP elections in mid-2009. They will replace the sitting Romanian MEPs who were nominated by the national parliament for the first months of EU membership.
The electorate can choose from among 13 parties or the single independent candidate on the list. Candidates must be 23 to stand and Romanians, and citizens from other EU countries with their main residence in Romania who may also take part in the election, must be 18 to vote. Candidates will be elected via proportional representation. Official results are not expected until Wednesday. Appeal for high turnout
The poll is crucial as it will be an early indicator of attitudes towards the country's membership of the EU since January this year. Its importance was underlined by Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering when he visited Bucharest on 15-16 October. He called on the people of Romania to vote in the "greatest possible numbers". He went on to say that "by casting the vote on the 25th of November, the citizens of Romania will have the chance to express the importance of their country as an important member state of the European Union". Romania joins Bulgaria in historic poll
When they joined the EU in January this year the Treaty of Accession stipulated that both Romania and Bulgaria must hold elections to the European Parliament in 2007. Bulgaria elected its 18 MEPs on 20 May this year. The elections on Sunday will coincide with a referendum on election reform for national elections in Romania.
