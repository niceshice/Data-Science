China: Foreign Affairs Committee calls for progress on human rights
2006-09-05 - 10:55
Although the Foreign Affairs Committee says EU and China have an "increasingly positive trade relationship" and that it looks forward to "closer cooperation", its report on China takes a critical line on the political and human rights situation in the country - on issues ranging from Tibet to Taiwan, and the death penalty to animal welfare.
The own-initiative report by Bastiaan BELDER (IND/DEM, NL) on EU-China relations acknowledges the increasing importance of the growing economic relationship between the Union and the People's Republic, but also airs several concerns. It condemns the loose enforcement of anti-dumping regulations, the " artificially low value " at which the Chinese currency is pegged, and urges the Chinese government to " considerably improve the protection of Intellectual Property Rights ."
Political system, Taiwan, Tibet, Human Rights
On the political front, the committee speaks out in favour of more pluralism, institutional modernisation, and a truly independent judiciary. It says the " will and approval of the 23 million citizens of Taiwan must surely be respected and taken into account in negotiations with China on Taiwan's status ." It also urges both Japan and China to " refrain from any action which might offend the historic memory or the sensibilities of the other ." The committee strongly recommends that " the EU arms embargo against China remain in place until greater progress is made on human rights issues ."
The report " urges China to abolish the death penalty " and expresses concern "about recent reports of continuing serious human rights abuses in Tibetan areas of China ." It calls for a Chinese law " guaranteeing genuine religious freedom ," and expressly calls on the government " to cease its persecution and imprisonment of […] Christian groups ," as well as Falun Gong practitioners. The committee also expresses its concern that "the practice of torture remains widespread in China " and condemns " the existence of the Laogai labour camps " and police psychiatric and " re-education " methods used against detainees. It also urges China to " protect the welfare of, and prevent cruelty to, animals ," especially in the fur industry.
Dissenting views
The report was adopted in committee 42 votes in favour to 14 against with 2 abstentions. Socialist members voted against, having argued that report was unduly focused on the human rights situation in China, and did not sufficiently address other aspects of the relationship. A significant number of amendments are therefore likely to be tabled when the report comes before the House next week.

Accession to the Hague Conference on Private International Law
2006-09-05 - 10:55
Diana WALLIS (ALDE, UK), for the Legal Affairs Committee, will be recommending that Parliament grant its assent to the EC joining the Hague Conference on Private International Law. (HCCH).
The Council agreed to the text of a draft decision on the accession of the European Community to the HCCH. At present, the Community enjoys only observer status in the HCCH but full membership is necessary for two reasons:
- it would grant the Community a status consistent with its new role as a major international player in the field of civil judicial cooperation, and
- enable the Community to fully participate in the negotiation of conventions in areas of its competence by expressing its views and positions and ensuring consistency and coherence between its own rules and envisaged international instruments. Moreover, the Community as such rather than its Member States would be the subject of the rights and obligations stemming from Hague Conventions in areas of its competence.
The HCCH is a long-established international organisation with the objective of ensuring the progressive unification of the rules of private international law, mainly by negotiating and drafting international conventions.
Questions to the Council and Commission
Giuseppe GARGANI (EPP-ED, IT), on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, will be asking the Council and the Commission the following question on the involvement of the European Parliament in the work of the Hague Conference following the accession of the Community:
In view of the proposed accession of the Community to the Hague Conference on private international law, the Council is asked what practical steps it intends to propose in order to involve Parliament in the proceedings of the Conference and consult it on draft Hague Conventions, particularly where they touch on areas where Parliament shares the power of codecision with the Council and/or where the Community has already legislated or is contemplating legislating in the particular area .

Tax cars on pollution, not for registration
2006-09-05 - 10:55
Monday evening sees a debate on passenger vehicle taxes which fits exactly with the current arguments about the future of road taxes and how to tackle vehicle pollution.
The European Commission is proposing the abolition of national vehicle registration taxes which would be replaced by taxes based on levels of carbon dioxide produced by each vehicle. Part of the reasoning is to avoid situations whereby people moving to another EU Member State are obliged to pay tax in two countries; at the same time, the proposal has environmental aims linked to cutting carbon dioxide emissions. The report tabled by the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee suggests that the UK is at the forefront of moves to see pollution levels linked to vehicle taxation . MEPs in the committee suggest the tax should be linked to pollution in general and not just CO2.
In the report drawn up by Karin Riis-Jørgensen (ALDE, DK), for the committee backs the Commission’s general approach, though it proposes that the environmental aspect should be more broad, with the level of tax linked to fuel efficiency and pollutant emissions as well as carbon dioxide. At the suggestion of the rapporteur, the committee notes that the changes should be revenue neutral.
Taxation rules require unanimous support within the Council of Ministers. The European Parliament is only consulted on these proposals. However, it is an opportunity for MEPs to put forward amendments tightening up the environmental aspects of the proposed directive.

Pollution caused by ships
2006-09-05 - 10:55
Luis DE GRANDES PASCUAL (EPP-ED, ES),for the Transport Committee, will be putting forward a legislative report on funding to deal with pollution caused by ships.
The committee warmly welcomes the Commission proposals for a financial package of €154 million for the period 2007-2013 for the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) to combat pollution by ships. The funds will enable EMSA to make specialised anti-pollution vessels available to Member States in order to recover pollutants and develop satellite images to detect pollution in good time. The Transport Committee feels that particular attention should be paid to those areas identified as the most vulnerable.
The budget is aimed at bringing supplementary assistance via the contacting of commercial ships equipped with recovery and stocking equipments for polluting substances. These ships should be ready to intervene whenever required by a Member State.
EMSA has opted for long-term chartering by concluding stand-by contracts with commercial ship operators having vessels of sufficient capacity that can be adapted for pollution response purposes. There are for priority regions: the Baltic Sea, the Western approaches to the English Channel, the Atlantic Coast with two areas, the North and the South, and the Mediterranean: particularly the area along the tanker trade route from the Black Sea. Contracts have already been signed providing for 7 ships spread in the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean Sea (La Valetta, Malta) and the other approaches of the Channel (Brest, France).
Another crucial activity covered by the multi-annual funding will be the establishment of a satellite imagery service centre, which would complement the activities of the Member States and the Commission in responding to illegal discharges and accidental spills from ships. Pollution caused by hazardous and noxious services will also be under the scope of the directive.

Transfer of data to the US to prevent and combat terrorism
2006-09-05 - 10:55
Sophia IN 'T VELD (ALDE, NL) will be tabling an own-initiative report on the negotiations for an agreement with the United States of America on the use of passenger name records (PNR) data to prevent and combat terrorism and transnational crime, including organised crime. Given that the Council needs to conclude a new agreement for the transfer of passenger name records with the US government by 30 September, (the EP is not formally consulted) the Civil Liberties Committee is proposing drawing up a recommendation to the Council, with the need to ensure that the US offers adequate protection of European passenger data and that sufficient safeguards are in place. For the interim agreement, this would in particular mean: Ensuring that the interim agreement only covers the period until November 2007, following which a medium-term agreement be negotiated with full involvement of Parliament. Ensuring that deficiencies already identified in the current agreement be rectified, such as the switch to a PUSH system --US officers should request concrete data on a case by case basis, instead of being granted access to the full database-- and reduction in the number of PNR data fields. Including the Parliament in the negotiation process as observers and holding a meeting with LIBE-US Congress. As concerns the agreement to be put in place in the medium-term (November 2007), MEPs in the committee wish to implement the bridging clause, transferring security matters from the third to the first pillar so that Parliament will have co-decision powers for the adoption of the post-2007 agreement, and an eventual EU PNR policy. Background In September 2004, the European Parliament brought a legal case against the Commission in the European Court of Justice (ECJ), calling for annulment of an agreement between the European Community and the US on the processing and transfers of personal data, as well as of the 2004 Commission Decision on the adequate protection of those data. MEPs argued that the legal basis (Article 95 EC) was incorrect, that Parliament should have had assent rather than simple consultation, that the agreement was in breach of the principle of proportionality and that the US did not offer adequate data protection. On 30 May 2006 the ECJ annulled the Council international agreement, on the grounds that the legal basis was not considered appropriate since the transfer to the US and the use of PNR data relates to data processing operations concerning public security and activities of the State in areas of criminal law (i.e. third pillar), which fall outside the scope of Directive 95/46/EC that concerns the first pillar. EU-US agreement on PNR will have no further legal effect after 30 September 2006. The ECJ chose to consider only the procedural issues, and did not express any views on the EP's objections against the substance of the agreement. Council decided, at COREPER level, on 22 June to negotiate a new PNR agreement with the US, based on article 38 and 24 TEU as a legal basis (no formal consultation of the EP or competence for the ECJ), which would have the same substance as the current agreement and would expire at the same time (November 2007). Following the August 10 alleged terror plot in London, the interior ministers of Britain, Germany, France, Finland and Portugal held an informal meeting in London Last 16/08/2006 with the European Union’s justice commissioner and its counter-terrorism coordinator, to give 'an urgent response'. They agreed to present plans to an EU meeting in September. The proposals include expanding data-sharing on airline passengers, with the possibility of including details of travellers’ biometric identifiers, such as fingerprints or iris scans. In addition, Commissioner for Justice, freedom and security, Franco FRATTINI announced the need for an EU PNR system --extending the PNR transfer system to all flights within Europe--, despite the fact that Parliament on three different occasions has rejected this idea. 30 September 2006 is the deadline imposed by the ECJ for the EU to end data transfers to the US and to renegotiate an agreement. Rapporteur Sophia IN 'T VELD ALDE NL A6-0252/2006 Report with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the negotiations for an agreement with the United States of America on the use of passenger name records (PNR) data to prevent and combat terrorism and transnational crime, including organised crime Procedure: own-initiative

Social policy
A European social model for the future: a unity of values with a diversity of systems
2006-09-05 - 10:55
José Silva Penneda (EPP-ED, PT) and Proinsias De Rossa (PES IE), for Employment and Social Affairs Committee, are putting forward a joint own initiative report on a European Social Model for the future. In the report, MEPs in the committee outline the concept of the European Social Model which reflects a common set of values implemented in different ways in the Member States.
The report underlines the urgent need for the concept to be reformed and stresses what has to be done in future to preserve the model.
The European Social model: not a cost, but a positive factor in the EU's economic growth
The European Social Model " reflects a common set of values, based on the preservation of peace, social justice, equality, solidarity, the promotion of freedom and democracy and respect of human rights ". According to MEPs in the committee, " in the last 60 years this set of common values has allowed a growing EU to successfully become an area of greater economic prosperity and social justice ". They underline that social policies, when appropriately designed " can not be regarded as a cost but, instead, as a positive factor in the EU's economic growth ".
Although Member States have different social systems, and have implemented these values in different ways, they commonly aim to attain a balance between economic growth and social solidarity, and this is reflected in the European Social Model as a unity of values with a diversity of systems, members underline.
Urgent need to reform to preserve the model
MEPs in the committee stress the necessity to preserve and enhance the values associated with the European Social Model and the high social standards already achieved. They are convinced that the economic and social systems must be urgently reformed where they fail to meet the criteria of efficiency and socially sustainable development, and where they are inadequate to tackle the challenges of demographic change, globalisation and the IT revolution.
Also to restore citizens' confidence in the EU project, which provides jobs, growth and prosperity, the EU's commitment to a Social Europe needs to be renewed, the committee stresses.
Actions needed on EU and Member State level
MEPs in the committee underline that even if employment and social policy remain broadly within national competence, the EU needs to create an economic and social framework which allows Member States to implement reforms as necessary at national level, according to their own economic, social and political circumstances.
The Commission is asked to take further initiatives to achieve full implementation of the internal market, having regard to exclude any race to the bottom in social, consumer or environmental conditions. The Commission should also incorporate the social dimension in its impact analyses, in accordance with the social clause provided for in the proposed Constitutional Treaty.
Since many Member States are far from achieving the Lisbon Strategy objectives they are called to achieve, in particular, the specific targets set for employment, especially of women and young people, Research and Development investment, child care and lifelong learning.
Member States should furthermore undertake reforms in order to ensure the financial sustainability of national social systems, without prejudicing acquired rights, mutual support and intergenerational solidarity. They should also improve the coordination of their tax policies with a view to avoiding harmful tax competition, ensuring sustainable financing for social protection and making tax policy more employment friendly. The EU funds, such as the European Structural Funds, should be used more efficiently to co-finance national reforms.
The committee also underlines that any successful reform of the social systems should involve all stakeholders, in particular the social partners and civil society.

Public health
Improving the mental health of the EU population
2006-09-05 - 10:55
John BOWIS (EPP-ED, UK) for the Environment and Public Health Committee will be putting forward an own-initiative report drawn up by in response to the Commission's Green Paper on a strategy on mental health for the European Union.
MEPs in the committee draw attention to the " sizeable differences " in mental health expenditure in individual Member States and welcomed the Commission's commitment to mental health promotion. They call for the Green Paper to be followed up with a proposal for a directive on mental health in Europe and " the defence of and respect for the civil and fundamental rights of persons suffering from mental disorders ". Any such proposal should involve partnership and consultation with those who have experienced or are experiencing mental health problems, their families and carers and advocacy NGOs, associations of family members and other interested parties.
MEPs in the committee want the key target groups identified by the Commission (children, employees, older people and disadvantaged members of society) to be extended to include those with severe mental illness, those with long-term and terminal illnesses, the disabled, prisoners, ethnic and other minority groups, those sleeping rough, migrants, those in precarious jobs and the unemployed. They also feel that the Green Paper did not take due account of the gender dimension. The report acknowledges that men and women may have different mental health needs, and called for more research in order to develop separate approaches and treatments for the two sexes.
Among its many recommendations, the committee calls for " a multi-disciplinary and multi-agency response " to tackling complex mental ill health situations, such as those involving children or adolescents. It also urges employers to introduce " Mental Health at Work " policies with a view to ensuring the best possible jobs for and best possible incorporation into the labour market of persons with mental disorders.
Pointing out that one of the greatest challenges in mental health is the ageing of Europe's population; the report wants to see more research into neurodegenerative diseases or other psychiatric illnesses in the elderly. MEPs in the committee also stress that the " defeat of stigma " should be at the heart of any future mental health strategy, for example by establishing annual campaigns on mental health issues in order to combat ignorance and injustice. The committee also wants to see mental health services reformed with a view to providing high-quality community care at home or in sheltered accommodation, regular monitoring and assessment and respite care. The Commission is urged to support continuing reforms in any Member State that practised the abuse of psychiatry, over-use of medication or incarceration, or " inhumane practices such as caged beds or excessive use of seclusion rooms ".
Other points raised in the report include the need for more research into therapeutic and psychological interventions, into the development of more effective drugs with fewer side-effects, and into determinants of mental disorders and suicide. There should also be greater involvement of service users in all aspects of mental health research. Lastly, the committee called for the Commission to set up a " Mental Health Coordinating and Monitoring Group " to collect information on mental health practice and promotion in the EU, to assess the adequacy (in terms of numbers and training) of existing mental health professionals and infrastructure, and to disseminate information on best practice.

Economic and monetary affairs
Statistical classification of economic activities
2006-09-05 - 10:55
MEPs will be voting on a report by Guntars KRASTS (UEN, LV) for the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee broadly approving a proposed regulation revising the system for the statistical classification of economic activities (NACE Revision 2), subject to a number of mainly technical and drafting amendments.
The committee says that the implementing measures should be adopted under the regulatory procedure provided for in Article 5 of Council Decision 1999/468/EC. Another amendment stipulates that consideration should be given to the principle that the benefits of updating must outweigh its costs and that additional costs and burden on businesses should remain within a reasonable limit. Lastly, the report proposed a whole series of technical clarifications to the Annexes.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Daphne should stand alone, says Women's Rights Committee
2006-09-05 - 10:55
Daphne, the EU programme seeking to combat violence against children, young people and women, is a success and should not be merged with efforts to prevent drug abuse, according to the Women's Rights Committee. In a first reading report on the Commission's proposal to establish new programme for 2007-2013 on the "Fight against violence (Daphne) and drugs prevention and information" the committee calls for two separate programmes.
The report, drafted by Lissy GRÖNER (PES, DE) says there are important differences between the two issues. The anti-violence plans would not be a new programme, but a third phase of Daphne ('Daphne III'), with a proposed budget set at €115.87 million for 2007-2013.
European Year against violence against women
The committee wants Daphne to support a " European Year against violence against women ". MEPs in the committee say this would be valuable for awareness raising and for sharing of good practice. They also call for the help desk service to NGOs and other organisations to be continued, and for the establishment of a " think tank " to provide guidelines to the Commission on the social, cultural and political context for the selection of projects.
Clear and credible targets
The committee says that clear and credible targets are required, such as halving the number of people who fall victim to violence and human trafficking over the next ten-year period. It says Daphne should be open to a wider range of NGOs, as well as countries outside the EU, in particular Eastern European and Central Asian, ACP and Mediterranean countries. MEPs in the committee call on the Commission to " aim at ensuring the participation of all countries to which the programme is open ".
The Daphne programme was established in 1997. It has funded over 350 projects, supporting organisations that develop measures and action to prevent or to combat all types of violence against children, young people and women and to protect the victims and at-risk groups.
The Civil Liberties Committee is drafting the legislative report on the drugs prevention and information programme.

Budgetary control
The costs of interpretation in the EU institutions - call for pragmatic solutions
2006-09-05 - 10:55
Alexander STUBB (EPP-ED FI), for the Budgetary Control Committee, will be putting forward an own initiative report on interpretation expenditure incurred by the Parliament, the Commission and the Council. This report follows the presentation in November 2005 of a Special Report by the Court of Auditors on the interpretation expenditures of Parliament, Commission and Council for the year 2003.
The report says that the total cost of all the linguistic services of the EU institutions, translation and interpretation combined, represent merely 1 % of the total EU budget. MEPs int the Budgetary Control Committee consider that multilingualism is one of the key features of the European Union, which highlights cultural and linguistic diversity and ensures equal treatment of EU citizens. The committee also c onsiders that multilingualism is an expression of the EU's cultural diversity, which must be preserved, and that, therefore, while the increasing number of official languages calls for pragmatic solutions in the preparatory work within the institutions, multilingualism must be guaranteed to ensure the legitimacy and diversity of the European Union.
The committee notes that the overall cost of interpretation in 2003 was €57m as regards the European Parliament and €106m as regards the Council, the Commission, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions and some agencies. MEPs in the committee are, however, very concerned that in 2003 approximately 16% (€ 25.9m) of the total interpretation costs of €163m represented costs for services supplied but not used and for stand-by arrangements.
The committee is of the opinion that the Parliament, the Council and the Commission should endeavour to reduce 'implicit or explicit stand-by duty', these arrangements accounting for €18m spent on interpretation services supplied but not used. The committee notes that reserve interpreters should be available for ad hoc meetings with a short request time.
European Parliament costs
The committee notes that the full cost for an interpretation day is almost 30% higher in Parliament than in the Council or the Commission, one reason being that very few local interpreters can be used during Strasbourg sessions, which increases Parliament's interpretation costs in Strasbourg by 13 %.
The Budgetary Control Committee also urges its administration to raise Members' awareness of interpretation costs. The House asks if the administration makes best possible use of the language profiles of Members. MEPs in the committee stress that this should not lead to a ranking of official EU languages.
The committee notes that in 2003, it spent €4m on interpretation services made available but not used due to late requests or cancellations. The committee asks that last-minute cancellations and last-minute requests be discouraged. Finally, MEPs in the committee call on the interpretation services to be more flexible in their service planning and request system.

Fisheries
Simplifying and improving the Common Fisheries Policy
2006-09-05 - 10:55
The Fisheries Committee fully supports the objectives established by the Commission, in particular those concerned with making existing texts simpler, clearer and more accessible, reducing the workload and the administrative costs shouldered by the administrative bodies responsible for fisheries, and reducing the burdens and the restrictions imposed on fishermen.
Philippe MORILLON (ALDE, FR) will be putting forward an own initiative report on simplifying and improving the Common Fisheries Policy.
The committee insists that the advisory bodies (in particular the Regional Advisory Councils and the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture) must play an integral role in the process of simplification and of assessing the effectiveness and implementation of existing and new measures. The committee also considers that closer consultation with these bodies would undoubtedly result in those involved in the fisheries sector identifying more closely with fisheries legislation.
The Fisheries Committee states once again that a harmonised inspection and monitoring system applicable to all who work in the sector and accompanied by a uniform set of interpretation provisions and penalty procedures should be established as a matter of urgency in order to bolster fishermen’s trust in the basic principle of equal treatment; considers that the Community Fisheries Monitoring Agency should contribute to the achievement of this objective.

Fisheries
Eco-labelling schemes for fisheries products
2006-09-05 - 10:55
The Fisheries Committee welcomes the communication from the Commission launching a debate on a Community approach towards eco-labelling schemes for fisheries products. MEPs in the committee regret, however, the delays on the part of the Commission in coming forward with its communication, which have in the meantime allowed privately initiated eco-labels to proliferate without any form of control, giving rise to issues of credibility and confusion for producers and consumers.
Carmen FRAGA ESTÉVEZ (EPP-ED, ES) will be putting a forward an own-initiative report on eco-labelling for fisheries products.
The committee draws attention, furthermore, to the real objectives of many of these labels which, given the growing importance that consumers place on sustainable development, are simply used as a means to increase sales, denying the consumer any real guarantee that the products actually contribute to sustainability.
The committee also deplores the communication's lack of ambition and considers that the chosen option (which consists of establishing minimum requirements for voluntary eco-labelling schemes) does not fully address the issues in question; considers that whatever labels are used in the marketplace must be independently monitored in order to be absolutely reliable and credible for the consumer.
MEPs in the committee believe that the range of schemes currently in place adds to the complexity of the issue and that any future proposal must not be designed in such a way that those already operating in the market are given a commercial advantage.

Culture
Protection of the European cultural and architectural heritage in rural and island areas
2006-09-05 - 10:55
Nikoloas SUFINAKIS (PES, GR) for the Education and Culture Committee will be putting forward an own initiative report on the European natural and architectural cultural heritage in rural and insular areas.
This report seeks to stress the specific nature and the importance of the European natural and architectural cultural heritage pinpointing the challenges arising in connection with rural and island areas. Almost 90% of the territory of the enlarged Europe is made up of farmland containing precious wildlife reserves and cultural assets. This valuable cultural heritage, however, is constantly being undermined by social and technological progress, modern farming methods, unbridled economic exploitation and property development and human in difference.
The Culture Committee proposes specific measures to safeguard and develop Europe's natural and architectural cultural heritage particularly in rural and island areas and small traditional communities, such as a systematic survey of the cultural heritage in rural and island areas, the drafting of a legislative framework to conserve it, funding for the restoration of local monuments and continuation of traditional farming methods, comprehensive measures for the restoration of traditional communities original architectural configurations as well as the training for professionals involved in the use and management of space, architecture, building restoration and related activities in how to conserve the specific nature of the heritage while meeting present-day needs.
Given the inadequate funding earmarked for Community cultural programmes, additional appropriations must be sought from other Community instruments including the common agricultural policy (LEADER), the cohesion policy (URBAN II and INTERREG III) as well as the Culture 2007 Programme. Cooperation with the Council of Europe should also play an important role. Finally, a European Year for Cultural Heritage should be introduced with the objective of making European citizens more aware of the importance of promoting their cultural heritage.

Education
More lifelong learning for adults
2006-09-05 - 10:55
Although the concept of lifelong learning is gaining ground, too few adults are participating so national strategies should be urgently implemented in all Member States, says the Culture and Education Committee. Early school leavers, the disabled, long-term unemployed people, women, older people and those with low basic skills should have priority in the Commission's proposals regarding key competences for lifelong learning.
In adopting a report by Helga TRÜPEL (Greens/EFA, DE), MEPs in the committee stress the importance of creating a European frame of reference for eight key competences, offering EU citizens a tool to adapt to an evolving labour market in a knowledge based society.
The eight proposed competences include communication in the mother tongue, in foreign languages, maths, science and technology, but the Committee also highlighted the importance of civic competence, based on the concepts of democracy, justice, equality, citizenship and civil rights.
Knowledge of the main events, trends and agents of change in national, European and world history and present, including the aspect of European diversity, was essential, said the committee, as was the knowledge of the aims, values and policies of social and political movements. In the light of the Lisbon strategy, the report also stresses the need for the achievement of an average employment rate for the EU of 70% overall and of at least 60% among women.

Environment
Hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade - Rotterdam Convention
2006-09-05 - 10:55
Johannes BLOKLAND (IND/DEM, NL), for the Environment Committee, will be recommending that Parliament approve the Council common position on hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade - Rotterdam Convention without amendment.
The aim is to conclude, on behalf of the European Community, the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade. The European Commission proposes that the Rotterdam Convention signed by the Community on 11 September 1998 under the auspices of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), should be approved on behalf of the Community.
It should be recalled that Council Decision 2003/106/EC of 19 December 2002 on the approval, on behalf of the European Community, of the Convention, of the Rotterdam Convention authorised the President of the Council to designate the person or persons empowered to deposit the instrument of approval on behalf of the Community with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The instrument of approval, together with the declaration of competence was lodged with the depositary on 20 December 2002. The Rotterdam Convention entered into force on 24 February 2004.
In its judgment of 10 January 2006 in case C-94/03 (Commission v. Council), the Court of Justice of the EC annulled Decision 2003/106/EC as it was based solely on Article 175(1), in conjunction with Article 300 of the Treaty, ruling that both Articles 133 and 175(1), in conjunction with the relevant provisions of Article 300, were the appropriate legal basis.
The annulment of Council Decision 2003/106/EC does not affect the original Community ratification of the Convention and the EC remains a Party in accordance with the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. However it is necessary to adopt a new Council Decision with the above-mentioned dual legal base together with an amended declaration of competence to be delivered to the UN depositary reflecting the change in the legal base. To avoid any legal vacuum, it is proposed that the new decision should have retroactive effect back to the date of adoption of the previous Council Decision.
As regards the required change to the legal base of the Council Regulation implementing the Convention’s provisions, this, as well other amendments will be included in a separate proposal that the Commission will be putting forward.
