The political integration of the Western Balkans into the EU can only take place if there is "better, more intensive regional and international economic co-operation", says the European Parliament. In a report drafted by Bastiaan BELDER (IND/DEM, NL), the House states that the EU "must show genuine commitment to the Western Balkans" if its pledge to enable these countries to accede to the EU on schedule is to be fulfilled.
"A serious prospect of EU membership for the Western Balkan states can act as a catalyst to encourage their population and governments to move away from regressive nationalism, sectarian violence and towards a future of integration with the rest of Europe," the report says. The report was adopted with 522 votes in favour, 12 against and 15 abstentions.
"The EU has set aside almost €8 billion in support of the 2007-2010 period, but without appropriate co-operation and without creating a sense that everyone is working together towards a common goal, the hoped-for results will not be achieved," it adds.
Call for deeper integration into world trade system
The House calls on the Commission and the Council to implement all appropriate measures encouraging deeper integration of the Western Balkans into the world trade and economic system, "in particular through WTO accession for countries in the region which are not yet members".
The report also recognises that the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) contributes significantly to the preparation of the Western Balkan countries’ accession to the European Union.
Commission and Member States to provide additional financial resources
In terms of funding, the report urges the Commission and the Member States to endow the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA) with the additional financial resources needed to develop projects tailored to real needs and to provide effective and focused assistance at local and regional levels.
It also calls on the Council and the Commission to supply the states in the region with economic and administrative technical assistance by duly qualified persons, in cooperation with the international and regional organisations dealing with Western Balkan economic issues, in order to strengthen local public structures, establish a more efficient and diversified economic base and improve the penetration of local products into foreign markets, and into the European Union in particular.
Structural Funds and better financing for SME-related projects
The Commission and the Western Balkan countries should make sufficient financial resources available for infrastructure modernisation, says the report, and the Commission and the Member States should ensure that SMEs have access to EU Structural Funds and to provide better financing for SME-related projects.
It stresses, however, that further financial assistance to the Western Balkans (and notably to Kosovo) should be conditional on the establishment, with the support of international financial institutions, of a comprehensive and realistic long-term economic development plan and calls on the Commission to set up an institutional framework to enhance cooperation between the Community and the private sector in the countries of the Western Balkans which will ensure the appropriate use of Community funds.
Continuation of the Stabilisation and Association Process
MEPs call on the Commission to monitor developments and, if necessary, to adopt adequate measures in order to guarantee the smooth continuation of the Stabilisation and Association Process, which in its view "is an important factor for stability in the region and in the best interests of the EU itself".
In light of this, it urges Member States to conclude the ratification process for all the Stabilisation and Association Agreements (SAAs) as soon as possible.
