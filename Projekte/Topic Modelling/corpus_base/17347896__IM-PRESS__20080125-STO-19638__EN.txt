Water and climate change is one subject we are reporting on this week
The week ahead sees a live webcast of all the debates from a 2-day sitting of the European Parliament in Brussels. The EU's relations with Iran will be debated and MEPs will discuss the postal services directive. You can read an account of those debates here online. Here on Europarl we will also report on a meeting of the Climate Change Committee on water and on steps to improve the labelling of appliances in the EU in a bid to save energy.
Monday sees Ukraine's Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko in Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee. You can watch this live online from 1530-1730 on Monday.
Climate, environment issues
"Climate change and the world's water" - on Tuesday we report on the views and debates from this meeting of Parliament's climate change committee. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines MEP (EPP-ED) will talk us through the main points of the meeting. One of the key issues could be the extent to which climate change will lead to greater desertification in parts of Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East. This will aggravate already acute food shortages and could lead to greater migration towards Europe.
Energy efficiency: on Wednesday we look at the issues highlighted in a new report by British Liberal Fiona Hall about the need to label products in Europe so to see how much energy they use.
Ways to help Europe's Roma community
On Thursday, Roma MEPs Lívia Járóka (EPP-ED) and Viktória Mohácsi (ALDE), both of whom are from Hungary, will share their views on the European Roma strategy following the debate that took place in Strasbourg on 16 January.
On Friday we will have a full round-up of the Plenary debates from Brussels.
You can follow all the Plenary debates here online using the "EP Live" part of the site. Watch live on Wednesday from 1500 CET and on Thursday from 0900.
