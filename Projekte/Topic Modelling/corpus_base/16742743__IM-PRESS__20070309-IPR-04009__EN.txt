Parliament adopted a report which urges that the EU Member States ratify as swiftly as possible the Consolidated Maritime Labour Convention adopted by the International Labour Organisation in 2006. The convention aims to improve working conditions for seafarers, thus reducing unfair competition on the global market as well as making merchant shipping a more attractive profession.
The consultation report, drafted by Mary-Lou McDONALD (GUE/NGL, IE), endorses with minor amendments the proposal for a Council decision authorising Member States to ratify the Convention, which incorporates all existing conventions and recommendations on maritime labour adopted by the ILO since 1919 into a single text. It lays down labour standards applicable to the crews of vessels with a gross tonnage of 500 tonnes or more engaged in international voyages or sailing between foreign ports.
The Convention will enter into force upon ratification by at least 30 states, which must together represent at least 33% of the worldâ€™s entire merchant shipping tonnage.
With 80% of maritime accidents being linked to human error, the rapporteur stresses the importance of speedy ratification and implementation of the Convention, which should not pose any problem as all EU Member States voted in favour of the Convention in Geneva in February 2006.
The rapporteur points out that it is important to normalise the status of seafarers in order to limit the negative effects of globalisation, namely social dumping, which penalises seafarers and ship-owners complying with the rules in force, and to define decent working conditions. Ratification and entry into force of the Convention would represent an important contribution from the EU to the promotion of decent labour standards worldwide.
