How EU aid can help women in the developing world was discussed
MEPs debated the European Union's overseas development assistance, specifically the experience of the countries that joined after 2004, on the final day of the Plenary. Later, they discussed women in developing countries and how aid could help them. In the afternoon the traditional human rights debates focused on Armenia and Russia.
The EU and its Overseas Development Assistance
MEPs discussed the amount of gross national income that EU countries who joined the Union since 2004 should give for development aid. A report by Lithuanian Liberal Danutė Budreikaitė sets out the current situation. The objective is that they donate 0.17 % of GNI to official development assistance (ODA) by 2010 - rising to 0.33% by 2015
Ms Budreikaitė said. “In 2004 and 2007, the 12 new States became donors through the development policy but had no experience in the field...new Member States have limited financial and human resources: they should focus their attention where they have experience.” She added that they had “a great experience of dealing with their eastern neighbours”. She pointed to the complementary roles of neighbourhood and development policy and suggested the creation of a new parliamentary assembly of EU and neighbouring countries (similar to the ACP-EU).
European aid Commissioner Louis Michel noted that as the EU is the world’s biggest donor, it has “duty to set an example”.
Women in developing countries
German MEP Feleknas Uca's (GUE/NGL) report on women in developing countries calls for measures to promote women's rights in areas such as responsible governance, employment, education, health and violence against women.
Ms Uca said that more than 40% of women in Africa don't go to primary school, while 75% of agricultural work is done by women. She said tackling "traditional" forms of violence should be one of the main priorities while unlimited access to reproductive health is fundamental for gender equality.
Human rights Armenia, Russia
In the human rights debates in the afternoon Marie Anne Isler Béguin (Chair of Parliament's delegation to Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia) said that Armenia was facing “a political crisis” since Presidential elections. She called for an inquiry about the events during demonstrations of political opponents (where 8 people died) and the release of prisoners.
MEPs condemned the use of force by the police against demonstrators protesting in Russia after the presidential elections on 2 March. Bernd Posselt (EPP-ED, DE) said Dimitri Medvedev “has to move away from the Putin system” to “start with a clean slate”. Ms.Alexandra Dobolyi (PSE, HU) called for a pragmatic approach: "Russia is a strategic partner that we need for example to tackle global challenges”.
Afghan jouirnalist Perwiz Kambakhsh, is facing prison for circulating an article on women's rights in Islam: MEPs called for his release and reasserted their opposition to the death penalty.
They also spoke about the case of Mehdi Kazemi, a 19-year-old gay Iranian citizen, who faces deportation from Europe back to Iran, where he could be tortured and even executed. Raül Romeva i Rueda said “The president of Iran said that there was no problem in Iran with homosexuals because there are no homosexuals. What he didn't say was that the homosexuals are executed.” The resolution calls for Mehdi Kazemi to be granted asylum or protection on EU soil.
Votes on Thursday
MEPs adopted a report on women in prison, calling for youngsters below 18 not to be in the same prisons as older people. They backed a report calling for Europe to become more actively engaged in assistance to Iraq and improve the transparency of its aid to the country. Finally, a report saying minimum taxes for diesel should rise to equal petrol tax minimums was also adopted.
20080307STO23301 EU development policy and the new Member States Empowering women: the key to development Human rights: Armenia, Russia, Afghan journalist and Iranian homosexual Taking account of the special needs of women in prisons Support democratic governance in Iraq, and increase EU presence on the ground, say MEPs Minimum taxes for diesel should rise to equal petrol tax minimums
