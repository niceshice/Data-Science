Snow greets MEPs as they arrive in Strasbourg for the first session of 2009 (12-15 Jan) Czech PM Mirek Topolánek addresses the House (14 Jan), announcing his 6 month tenure of the European Presidency. EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering watches the celebratory video marking the 10th birthday of Euro (13 Jan). Children dressed as the Magi visited Parliament to mark the Epiphany. Europe's central banker, Jean-Claude Trichet and EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering head to the debate to mark 10 years of the euro. Latvia's President Valdis Zatlers addresses the House (13 Jan) and speaks of the changes his country has seen since joining the European Union in 2004. Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek takes questions over the Czech Republic's Presidency of the European Council. MEPs discuss some of the troubling issues that have occupied debates at the start of 2009. Eight MEPs who entered the Gaza Strip at the height of the recent fighting describe the situation on the ground to journalists. MEPs vote on a resolution calling for a ceasefire in the Middle East. The snow-covered Strasbourg that greeted MEPs arriving for the 12-15 January plenary session felt appropriate given the physical and political chill many felt as Europe's gas was cut due to the Russia-Ukraine gas dispute. This, the war in Gaza and the 10th anniversary of the euro were the big themes on the agenda. Get a flavour of the first sitting of 2009 with our photo gallery.
From children dressed as Magi to mark the Epiphany to Europe's chief banker and Latvia's President there's lots to catch up on from Parliament's Strasbourg headquarters.
