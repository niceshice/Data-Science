Are you part of a project that will help promote understanding between peoples of different countries? Are you between 16 and 30 years of age? If the answer to these questions is yes, you can enter the European Charlemagne Youth Prize. Organised by the European Parliament and the Foundation of the International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen, the prize provides funding of €2,000 - €5,000 for existing projects that foster a shared sense of European identity and cooperation.
As well as promoting European and international understanding, the winning projects will serve as role models for young people living in Europe. In particular the organisers are looking for practical examples of Europeans living together. The deadline for applications is 8 February.
How do I apply?
All citizens or residents aged 16-30, of the 27 EU member states can apply, individually or in groups, provided that the project submitted is up and running. Applications can be made in all official EU languages.
The projects can focus on the organisation of various youth events, youth exchanges or internet projects with a European dimension. Application forms are available on the European Parliament's national Information Office web sites and the Charlemagne website. Check out full details, competition rules and the application form via the first link below.
How will the winners be chosen?
The three best projects will be selected in two steps. First phase, national juries consisting of at least two MEPs and one representative of a youth organisation will select a national winner from each of 27 Member States by 14 March.
Then, on 4 April, the European jury, consisting of three MEP's, the President of the European Parliament and four representatives of the Foundation of the International Charlemagne Prize, will select the winner from the 27 projects submitted by national juries.
The prizes
The €5,000, €3,000 and €2,000 prizes for the three best projects will be presented by the President of the EP and a representative of the Foundation of the International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen. The three laureates will also be invited to visit the European Parliament in May 2008.
Representatives of the 27 national projects will be invited to the award ceremony in Aachen, Germany, on 29 April.
You can get an application form either on this website or on the Charlemagne prize website below. The competition is open until 8 February!
