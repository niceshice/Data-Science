Summer on the web

As temperatures climb across Europe the political temperature in Parliament falls as MEPs take advantage of a more measured pace over the summer to spend time in their home countries. The next plenary session is on 3 September in Strasbourg although some committee and group meetings start on 27 August in Brussels. A delegation of MEPs will also be monitoring elections in Sierra Leone. Over the summer we will publish a number of stories on our website - below is a taster of our summer schedule.
As many summers are devoted to activities other than work one of our first stories will be about two MEPs who are piano maestros. They will explain their view of politics and their love of piano playing - and whether the two are related!
As the Erasmus student exchange programme turns 20 the student days of some MEPs are recalled as they share their experiences from there Erasmus days. We look at what the programme has achieved and whether there is sufficient funding to make it available to less well-off students and their families.
We also look at the day a group of young journalists from around Europe came to the Parliament - with several of them writing articles for this website. Several weeks on they give us their analysis of what they liked - and what they didn't.
Finally, a look back. Over the next few weeks we will be republishing some of the most memorable issues and stories the Parliament has dealt with over the last few months. We pick out some of the best moments - remember the Indian President's poem to the people of Europe?
We wish you and enjoyable summer and hope you will enjoy what we have to offer!
