Erosion of soil can lead to floods, landslides
The Plenary session opened with Parliament's President Hans Gert Pöttering sending condolences to the families of those killed in the Finnish school shooting last week. He also mentioned the 10th anniversary of the banning of landmines - for which the Nobel Prize was awarded in 1997. He reaffirmed the Parliament's commitment to a world without landmines. The protection of Europe's soil from contamination, the need for more sport in schools and aircraft emissions were also discussed on Monday.
Soil - guarding against contamination and floods
Action to protect soil in Europe was the subject of two reports debated in Parliament on Monday. The risks of contamination, floods, landslides, desertification and climate change were all cited as the reasons such a strategy is needed.
The report by Spanish MEP Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines (EPP-ED) concerned the setting up of a legal framework including a proposal to set up public inventories of contaminated sites within the EU.
The second report by Italian Liberal Vittorio Prodi concerns a thematic strategy for soil protection. It cites erosion and resulting natural disasters as some of the reasons soil protection is needed. Amendments were proposed aiming to give more flexibility to individual countries on how they put the directive into practice. Both reports are voted on Tuesday.
The role of sport in education
An own-initiative report by Hungary's Pál Schmitt (EPP-ED) for the culture and education committee states that physical education should be compulsory in school and children should have at least three physical education lessons a week.
Among the facts presented in the report are:
14 million overweight people in the EU
Across the entire EU27, almost 1 in 4 children is overweight
400,000 new overweight or obese children per year
The average time that primary schools allocate to physical education has fallen from 121 to 109 minutes per week since 2002
50% of children have physical activities at school (Schmitt)
Mr Schmitt, a double Olympic fencing champion, called the lack of physical activity at school a lifestyle problem. "It is important to exercise regularly. Physical fitness should be enhanced by schools and is important for children also to develop mentally".
The report urges EU governments to carry out information campaigns, aimed at children from a very early age and their parents, on the need to adopt a healthy lifestyle, and engage in regular physical activity and on the health risks linked to an unhealthy diet.
Emissions Trading Scheme - should Aircraft be included
MEPs debated how aviation should be included in the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme. Against a background of a booming low-cost airline industry and increased business travel, they considered a proposal for the Emissions Scheme to apply to all European air traffic by 2010, alongside steep cuts in emissions.
