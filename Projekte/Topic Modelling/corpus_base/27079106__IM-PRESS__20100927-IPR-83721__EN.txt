The European Parliament's Budget Committee agreed on Wednesday to back EU funding for 1649 workers in Spain and Denmark who became redundant due to the closure of their companies.
The total financial assistance approved by MEPs is €11,951,544. The funding for Denmark will go to two enterprises in the Syddanmark region, Linak A.S. and the Danfoss Group. For Spain the funds will go to Galicia, where 82 companies had to lay off staff between 1 March 2009 and 30 June 2009. Following the green light by the committee, the full Parliament and the Council of Ministers still have to give their approval.
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was established to provide additional support for workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation or the financial crisis and to assist them with their reintegration into the labour market. The annual ceiling of the fund is €500 million.
