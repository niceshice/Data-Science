European elections 2009 - Thursday 4 June 2009 72 MEPs to be elected in the UK On Thursday 4 June 2009, the British electorate will elect 72 MEPs. This figure is based on the Treaty of Nice. In total in the 27 EU Member States, some 736 MEPs will be elected from 4-7 June 2009. From 2004-2009, the UK had 78 MEPs. The UK will have six fewer MEPs. The UK is divided into twelve regions. Residents of Gibraltar will vote in the South West region (since June 2004).
At the European Council meeting of 11 and 12 December, the following text was agreed by the Heads of State and governments in the conclusions:
"Treaty of Lisbon â€“ Transitional measures concerning the composition of the European Parliament
In the event that the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force after the European elections of June 2009, transitional measures will be adopted as soon as possible, in accordance with the necessary legal procedures, in order to increase, until the end of the 2009-2014 legislative period, in conformity with the numbers provided for in the framework of the IGC which approved the Treaty of Lisbon, the number of MEPs of the twelve Member States for which the number of MEPs was set to increase. Therefore, the total number of MEPs will rise from 736 to 754 until the end of the 2009-2014 legislative period. The objective is that this modification should enter into force, if possible, during the year 2010."
When and if the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force, it would mean that the UK would have one extra MEP rising from 72 (Treaty of Nice stipulates 72) to 73 for a temporary basis until the European elections in 2014.
