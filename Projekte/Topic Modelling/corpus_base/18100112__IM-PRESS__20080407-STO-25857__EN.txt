Meeting in Brussels on Wednesday MEPs voted to approve the appointment of the EU's new Heath Commissioner Androula Vassiliou. They also debated the EU aspirations of Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) and their progress towards accession. European initiatives in combating cancer and a debate about the current situation in Lebanon also featured during the day.
Chairing the sitting Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering noted the appointment of MEP Alexander Stubb as Finnish Minister of Foreign affairs and welcomed his successor, Sirpa Pietikäinen, a former minister for the environment.
MEPs voted in favour of approving the new Cypriot Commissioner Androula Vassiliou for Public Health, Food Safety, Animal Health and Welfare. Ms Vassiliou underwent a parliamentary confirmation hearing on 1 April. She will now serve at least until the appointment of a new Commission after the June 2009 European Parliament elections.
EU hopes of FYROM and Croatia discussed
The EU aspirations of Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia were under the spotlight on Wednesday as MEPs discussed their progress towards accession. A majority of speakers stressed the fact that EU membership for both countries could bring stability and prosperity to the troubled south eastern region of Europe.
Croatia - on track for EU membership on 2011?
"We should make every effort so that Croatia becomes a member state by 2011" - that was the position of parliament's rapporteur on Croatia Hannes Swoboda (PSE). He told the plenary that "I would have hoped that 2008 would be the year in which the negotiations would be concluded. That is unfortunately not realistic". He said every effort should be made to get them into the EU by 2011.
His report identified the need to improve the judiciary, eradicate in some case unacceptably high corruption and resolve some border issues with Slovenia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. MEPs voted to adopt the report on Thursday.
FYROM - EU entry negotiations to start this year
A representative of the Council - Slovenia's Minister for European Affairs Janez Lenarčič - told the parliament that he hopes negotiations will be opened this year and said that the country could act as a stabilising force in the region.
Dutch rapporteur on FYROM Erik Meijer (GUE/NGL) has outlined the key areas in which he hopes to see improvements in the course of this year, leading to a favourable evaluation of the progress in preparations for EU membership.
Speaking to MEPs he said that "I hope the report in 2009 will reflect perfectly normal developments...involving environmental protection, improvements in the legal system, modernisation of the railways, equality of all religious communities and freedom for trade unions".
He also noted that the "relationship between the two language communities has improved after the split in 2001".
A vote on the report was postponed after MEPs agreed a delay would make it easier for Greece and FYROM to find more time to reach agreement on the name of the country . Athens objects to the "Macedonia" name that FYROM would like to adopt as this is the name of a region in Greece itself.
