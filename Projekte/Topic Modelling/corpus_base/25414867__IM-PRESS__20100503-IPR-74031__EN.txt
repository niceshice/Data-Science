Informal proposals to amend last week’s Council decision on the setting up of the EU External Action Service, and not least who pays its staff, were debated by Foreign Affairs Committee MEPs on Tuesday morning. These proposals will become formal once the staff issue has been clarified, most probably in June, said Elmar Brok (EPP, DE).
Elmar Brok, the leading MEP on the European External Action Service (EEAS), presented informal proposals to amend last week’s Council’s decision EU Foreign Ministers. These proposals had been prepared with his Constitutional Affairs Committee counterpart, Belgian Liberal Guy Verhostadt.
"Swift is the most useful and educational process when it comes to Parliament’s powers", said Mr Brok, stressing that Parliament should not move away from its "package" negotiating strategy.
On the composition of the EEAS, Mr Brok said that civil servants will have to be paid from the Community budget and that seconded staff from the Member States should be limited. "Otherwise, the Service would be flooded with national staff and would not represent the Union any more" and "Member States would have the impression that the EEAS is their property", he said.
The proposed amendments would strengthen the coherence of the Service, said Guy Verhofstadt (ALDE, BE), adding that "if the link with the European Commission is not strong enough, Parliament will have to consider tabling new amendments to repatriate community-wide policies within the EC".
On the budget issue, Mr Verhofstadt said EEAS funding should come out of the European Commission Budget (Section III) on which Parliament’s rights, including granting a discharge for proper budget implementation, "are fully guaranteed".
The key points set out in the informal working document are:
EEAS to be attached to the Commission in administrative, organisational and budgetary terms and to be accountable to Parliament,
EEAS to be managed by a Director General, instead of a Secretary General, the High Representative/Vice President "shall be represented" by political deputies,
Policy coordination mechanism to be set up to ensure coherence of action,
External action instruments: management of operational expenditure to be the responsibility of the Commission, EEAS to prepare Commission decisions on the European Development Fund, Development Cooperation Instrument and Neighbourhood Policy,
Staff: officials from other institutions to be able to apply for vacant posts, appointments to be based on merit, adequate geographical representation and gender balance needed, at least 50% of staff to originate from the European Commission and 30% from the Member States,
Budget: inclusion of new personnel and costs of necessary infrastructure to be linked to appropriate increase of EU Budget related to external relations, and
Memorandum of Understanding to outline relations with the EP, access to confidential documents.
