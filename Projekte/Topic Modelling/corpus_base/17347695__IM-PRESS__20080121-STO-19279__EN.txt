Communication is key to the success of Eurocorps
As well as cooperation in European coal and steel production one of the key ideas of many post war politicians was for military forces to be merged to prevent further European wars. "Eurocorps" was established in 1992 in Strasbourg and includes France, Germany, Spain, Belgium and Luxembourg as "framework nations". A further four "contributing countries" Austria, Poland, Turkey, and Greece also take part. The 1000 strong force can be deployed under the flags of both NATO and the EU.
During the January plenary week Parliament's Subcommittee for Security and Defence, headed by chairman Karl von Wogau, paid a visit to Eurocorps' headquarters in Strasbourg. Lt.-General Commander Pedro Pitarch, Eurocorps' commander, showed the MEPs around this military institution.
The five founding members provide Eurocorps' commanders and military infrastructure. The so-called "contributing countries" provide some military staff and various forms of support.
In principle, each framework nation supplies one general to fill one of the five command positions, and every two years the composition of the command structure changes. There is one exception, however. The Luxembourg army is so small that it has no generals!
A European army in the making?
Since the enlargement of the European Union in 2004 and 2007, interest in Eurocorps is growing. Poland, which has a long-lasting military tradition, has become an official contributing country and aspires to join the core five framework nations. Romania has shown interest in becoming a contributing country.
Eurocorps operates within the NATO and EU framework. Most of the partner countries are members of both international organisations. However, Austria is not a member of NATO and Turkey is a candidate for EU membership. Eurocorps therefore offers an interesting platform for international military cooperation for these countries.
Eurocorps in Kosovo, Afghanistan
It falls to the Foreign Affairs Ministers of the framework nations to decide about deploying Eurocorps. In the past, Eurocorps was used almost exclusively in NATO operations: Bosnia-Herzegovina (1998-2000), Kosovo (March - October 2000) and Afghanistan (August 2004 - February 2005).
Parliament's delegation saw a high level of motivation among staff, who feel it is a privilege to serve part of their military career in a multinational force. "All the men and women lucky enough to be part of this great military organization take pride in serving their respective countries and giving their support to the European idea of being united under the Eurocorps banner," said Spanish Eurocorps commander General Pitarch.
