Vote on a resolution in the EP hemicycle 8 October 2009 Amid the noise and clamour of debate last week we picked out a few things which caught our eye. For the 2-day session on Wednesday and Thursday the agenda and Chamber was packed as the implications of Ireland's yes to Lisbon and Italy's media were passionately debated. As well as the words were the images and we bring a few of them here to you in the accompanying slideshow.
Angelika Niebler is recovering: To much relief MEPs were told that the German Christian Democrat Member is getting better after being attacked near the Parliament in Brussels. Members from all sides applauded as they heard the news, although the response of the Belgian police was questioned.
Lisbon treaty: A majority of MEPs from all sides welcomed the decisive Irish yes vote in Wednesday's debate. The leader of the largest bloc Joseph Daul called it a yes for "security and shared values".
Czech and balances: Czech President and Lisbon non-signer Vaclav Klaus received several mentions despite not being in the Chamber. Socialist leader Martin Schulz asked him rhetorically "if he is fully aware that this continent faces a decisive moment".
Stormy waters in Brussels: As the debate on the Ireland vote wound up one of the worst lightning storms in recent years hit Brussels, flooding parts of the city. A political omen or a sign the Lisbon storm has passed?
Europe's media Commissioner Viviane Reding knows how to keep her cool. The lively debate on freedom of the media in Italy provoked animated discussions in the Chamber interrupting her response to the debate. The gavel of Roberta Angelilli in the Chair eventually brought things to order...
Airline bankruptcies: MEPs formally asked Transport Commissioner Tajani to open a debate on how to improve passengers' right legislation and to bring up a reserve compensation fund for those affected by bankrupt airlines.
Abruzzo earthquake: Members voted to give the green light to €493 million in aid to the Abruzzo region of Italy to help reconstruction after April's earthquake.
Financial crises and poorest countries: Members called for eradication of abuses of tax havens, tax evasion and illicit capital flight from developing countries by suggesting the creation of better worldwide regulation.
Sakharov finalists chosen: Three finalists for this year's Prize for freedom of thought were chosen this week. Izzeldin Abuelaish, Dawit Issak or the Memorial organisation will be announced as a winner on 22 October. The prize will be awarded in Strasbourg on 16 December.
This year's sitting in Brussels will take place on 11 and 12 November. In the meantime Members will meet for their regular plenary session in Strasbourg from 19-22 October.
