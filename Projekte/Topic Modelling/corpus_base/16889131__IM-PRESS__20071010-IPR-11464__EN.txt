EP President Pöttering calls for abolition of the death penalty.
On the World Day against the death penalty (10 October), EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering stated that the European Parliament opposed the death penalty. President Pöttering paid tribute to the freed Bulgarian medics who were present in the Parliamentary Chamber. Mr Pöttering recalled that the Bulgarian medics were held in custody in Libya for eight years and said that the European Parliament had, on several occasions, called for the freeing of the medics and had opposed the death penalty.
"We thank all countries that have abolished the death penalty, in particular Rwanda. We also call on China to break its 'wall of silence' on the use of the death penalty. We appeal for support for the EU sponsored UN resolution and for all countries to support it in New York".
The European Parliament, has in fact, he recalled, adopted three resolutions on the abolition of the death penalty this year (see below) and "we pay tribute to all victims of the death penalty." MEPs observed a minute of silence in their memory.
