Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection
Video games have powerful psychological effects, especially on young people. To protect users from these sometimes harmful effects, various methods have been devised for assessing the content of video games and for classifying and labelling them. PEGI (Pan European Game Information) is a Europe-wide self-regulation system for rating video game content by age group and preventing young people from exposure to unsuitable games. However, several EU Member States have no legislation to take account of the special nature of video games on the internet. The Internal Market Committee is holding a public workshop on consumer protection in the field of video games at a time when Parliament is preparing a report on this topic and the European Commission is proposing new measures to be taken by the Member States. 14:00 16:00 Brussels, ASP 5G2 Programme of the Hearing Combating the deterioration of agricultural land in the EU
