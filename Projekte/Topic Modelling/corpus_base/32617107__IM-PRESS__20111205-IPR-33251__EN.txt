Italy had requested the aid to help 528 workers made redundant by 323 construction industry firms in the Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol region.
Next steps
Following the committee's green light, the aid will need to be approved by Parliament and the Council of Ministers. The Council approved Italy's application on 28 November. Parliament's plenary vote is scheduled for 13 December.
Background
The EGF was established to provide additional support for workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation or the financial crisis and to assist them with their reintegration into the labour market. The annual ceiling of the fund is €500 million.
In the chair: Alain LAMASSOURE (EPP, FR)
