Aung San Suu Kyi Images of Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi will be displayed on the European Parliament's buildings at Place du Luxembourg, Brussels, this Thursday and Friday in support of the EP's campaign for her release before her trial resumes on 26 June.
A giant image of Aung San Suu Kyi will be projected onto the building of the former Quartier Léopold station from 10pm to midnight on Thursday 18 and Friday 19 June.
In addition, posters of the former Sakharov Prize winner, with the slogan "Free Aung San Suu Kyi now" in English and Burmese, will be placed on the outside of the walkways linking the different EP buildings as of Friday morning.
European Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering has called on the Burmese military authorities to release Aung San Suu Kyi immediately and unconditionally, saying "She was arrested on 14 May accused of violating the conditions of her detention under house arrest, as an obvious pretext for keeping her detained as the country approaches new multi-party elections in 2010." Mr Pöttering also appealed for a fair and transparent trial in accordance with international standards.
He added "The European Parliament, which enshrines the values of democracy and freedom for which the European Union is a beacon throughout the world, reaffirms its complete support and solidarity with Aung San Suu Kyi. This courageous woman represents the best hopes of her people for a free and prosperous future."
