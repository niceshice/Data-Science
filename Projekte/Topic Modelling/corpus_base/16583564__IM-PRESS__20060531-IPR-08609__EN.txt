The European Parliament has welcomed the European Commission's proposal that 2008 should be declared "European Year of International Cultural Dialogue". Erna HENNICOT-SCHOEPGES (EPP-ED, L) saw her report adopted with 548 votes in favour, 62 against and with 22 abstentions. MEPs had tabled 48 amendments. A small majority of MEPs (299/298/17) is pressing for dialogue between religions to be the main topic of the year's events.
The year should be concluded with an Intercultural Forum in the European Parliament bringing together civil society and political and religious representatives.
MEPs are also keen to bring intercultural dialogue into the mainstream of Community policies. They back the idea of raising the profile of all EU measures related to intercultural dialogue and making them more consistent. The campaign should also highlight the contribution of different cultures to Europe's heritage and lifestyles as well as helping promote intercultural dialogues in schools.
Members also suggested the creation of a prize for intercultural dialogue to reward a youth project in the context of Community programmes such as Socrates, Youth and Culture. Finally, MEPs called for cooperation with the private sector, broadcasters and other media as partners for disseminating information of the European year of Intercultural Dialogue, particularly in the context of major sporting events taking place in 2008, namely the European Football Championships and the Beijing Olympic Games, at the same time combating human trafficking and forced prostitution of women during these events.
International dialogue already occupies an important place in many Community policies (e.g. education, youth, anti-racism, asylum policy) as well as in the EU's external relations. Key aims are the promotion of cultural diversity and active citizenship. The Commission's proposal should be seen against this background.
