Opening of the Brussels May plenary session: Pöttering expresses solidarity with Burma/Myanmar
Opening the Brussels plenary session, EP President Hans-Gert PÖTTERING made a statement on the devastation caused by the cyclone in Burma/Myanmar. President Pöttering said: "We all are aware of the terrible consequences of the tropical storm, which hit Burma/Myanmar last Sunday, a tragedy that killed over tens of thousands people, left hundreds of thousands homeless and destroyed infrastructures in the most populated area of the country. The people in Burma/Myanmar deserve our deep solidarity; I therefore wish to express it here on behalf of the European Parliament and in all sincerity. At the same time we think about our Sakharov Prize Winner Aung SAN SUU KYI at this time. We are united with her in solidarity and demand her release so that she can work for freedom and democracy for her people."
Written declaration on microcredit adopted by the European Parliament
EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering announced the adoption of the written declaration on microcredit. It calls on the Commission and the Council to lend greater support to microcredit projects and to bolster programmes to help women. The written declaration calls for human and financial resources to be allocated to microcredit projects in the developing countries and in the Mediterranean.
MEPs debate the situation in Georgia amid escalating tension in the region
Debating the situation in Georgia given the escalating tensions in the region and concerns over build-up of Russian troops, many MEPs expressed their solidarity and support for Georgia's territorial integrity given the deteriorating situation in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. MEPs will vote on a resolution on this topic in June .
EU-US economic ties should be strengthened says MEPs
Creating uniform standards for trade and investment and removing non-tariff barriers are among the suggestions of MEPs to strengthen ties between the two trade blocs. On the ban on imported hormone-treated beef, MEPs say it is fully justified "on the basis of scientific evidence" in a resolution adopted Thursday (8 May) by the House. A single authorisation procedure for all food and feed containing GMOs is also suggested.
Towards an EU policy on sport - MEPs concerned about TV rights, player selections and doping
Stricter rules on doping, no quotas for football players from specific countries and a fair distribution of lottery profits are among the proposals of the European Parliament in a report adopted by a large majority (518 in favour to 49 against and 9 abstentions). The report calls for the Commission to come up with clearer guidelines on how to apply EU rules in the area of sport. Parliament also voices concern about the possible deregulation of gambling markets.
MEPs review progress on human rights in the world in 2007
The European Parliament adopted by an overwhelming majority on Thursday (8 May) its 2007 annual report on human rights in the world. One positive development identified in the report is the UN's call for a moratorium on the death penalty. However, human rights abuses in many countries, notably China, Iran and Russia, continue to give cause for concern. The report, drafted by Marco CAPPATO (ALDE, IT) and approved by 533 votes in favour to 63 against and 41 abstentions, also evaluates the EU's efforts to promote human rights through its own policies.
EU election observation missions: objectives, practices and future challenges
The report on election observation missions is the first of its kind, and supports the EU's observation missions, underlining how crucial they are, especially in developing countries. The European Parliament wants to increase its role especially in the immediate post-election period when the new parliaments are called, and legislators need advice on how to function in a democracy. The report was drafted by José Ignacio SALAFRANCA SÁNCHEZ-NEYRA (EPP-ED, ES) and Véronique DE KEYSER (PES, BE) and considers that in absolute terms the holding of elections cannot be regarded as the sole indicator of democracy, but that, nevertheless, it has a positive effect on the democratisation process as measured by improvements in civil liberties, provided that political pluralism, freedom of assembly and association, freedom of expression, equal access to the media, secret ballots and respect for human rights are secured.
European Parliament calls for more transparency on lobbying
A mandatory public register for lobbyists, common to the Council, Commission and Parliament and providing for "full financial disclosure", was proposed by the European Parliament. Lobbyists would also have to comply with a code of conduct and face sanctions if they infringed it. MEPs voted in favour of a mandatory public register of lobbyists. MEPs backed a "one-stop-shop" proposal, whereby lobbyists would need to register only once to have access to Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
Cotton - support schemes for farmers
Parliament adopted a non-binding report on support schemes for farmers (support for cotton) which calls for a deeper revision of the aid system introduced in 2004 so as to allow more flexibility to Member States. MEPs say that policies to forecast, mitigate and combat the effects of climate change on cotton-producing regions may be funded under the national support programmes. Cotton growing represents only 0.15% of EU agriculture production but is very important at economic, social and environmental levels in EU southern countries and should therefore be preserved according to MEPs. After the 2004 reform was annulled by the European Court of Justice at the request of Spain, the Commission has tabled a new proposal based on the same lines.
Trade and economic relations with the countries of South East Asia (ASEAN)
The EP is in favour of concluding a free-trade accord between the EU and the 10 countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). However, say MEPs in the committee, the agreement must meet certain conditions regarding sustainable development, the fight against fraud and respect for human rights. The report, drafted by Glyn FORD (PES, UK) and adopted by an overwhelming majority, supports plans for a free-trade agreement with ASEAN subject to WTO rules and the outcome of the Doha development round. Glyn Ford said: "ASEAN is an increasingly important power in the world. ASEAN is the EU's 5th largest trading partner, ranking ahead of Japan. This EU-ASEAN FTA would be beneficial to both sides, including to poor countries in the region. For obvious reasons, Burma will not be part of that trade agreement".
A "precautionary approach" to deep-sea fish stocks
The European Parliament adopted a report on the management of deep-sea fish stocks. MEPs note "a certain lack of symmetry between the situation described in the Commission communication and the actual situation", calling on the Commission, the Member States and the fishing industry to "fill in the gaps" that exist so that effort control measures can be adapted to each fishery, recognising that most deep-water fisheries are mixed fisheries.
Fisheries agreement EC - Seychelles
MEPs adopted a non-binding report drawn up by Josu ORTUONDO LARREA (ALDE, ES) recommending approval to the conclusion of a fisheries agreement between the European Community and Seychelles. Fishing opportunities remain unchanged (40 tuna seiners from France, Spain and Italy and 12 surface longliners from France, Spain and Portugal), the annual financial contribution increases from 4,125,000 euros to 5,355,000 euros and the reference tonnage from 55,000 tonnes to 63,000 tonnes.
MEPs back reduced rate excise duty for Madeira's local beer
A proposed Council Decision authorising Portugal to apply until 31 December 2013 a reduced rate of excise duty to beer brewed in Madeira by small independent breweries and consumed locally is endorsed by the European Parliament (report by Sergio MARQUES , EPP-ED, PT) adopted Thursday (8 May). Portugal points out that this measure is considered essential to the survival of the local brewing industry. The decision would apply where annual production exceeds 200,000 hectolitres but not 300,000 hectolitres. Production in excess of 200,000 hectolitres will be eligible for the reduced rate only to the extent that it is consumed locally, so as not to undermine the EU single market. 20080430BRI28006

Opening of the Brussels May plenary session: Pöttering expresses solidarity with Burma/Myanmar
2008-05-08 - 17:32
At the start of the Brussels plenary session, EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering made a statement on the devastation caused by the cyclone in Burma/Myanmar. President Pöttering said: "We all are aware of the terrible consequences of the tropical storm, which hit Burma/Myanmar last Sunday, a tragedy that killed over tens of thousands people, left hundreds of thousands homeless and destroyed infrastructures in the most populated area of the country. It is an absolutely unprecedented disaster at the scale of the country .
The military junta that rules the country has obviously worsened the situation by acting improperly. Neither was prevention ensured, nor was relief provided swiftly enough to the population. Moreover, it was decided to hold the "constitutional referendum" on 10 May as scheduled, displaying therewith a lack of concern and legitimacy.
However, the fact that help from abroad was not opposed as in the case of the tsunami catastrophe in 2006 should be seen as a positive move. The European Union has already started carrying out its emergency assistance operations, and during our next plenary session in Strasbourg we shall hear the European Commission report on the humanitarian assistance which is provided, as well as on the conditions for delivering aid to the country.
The people in Burma/Myanmar deserve our deep solidarity; I therefore wish to express it here on behalf of the European Parliament and in all sincerity.
At the same time we think about our Sakharov Prize Winner Aung San Suu Kyi at this time. We are united with her in solidarity and demand her release so that she can work for freedom and democracy for her people."
Agenda changes
The House approved the following changes to the rules:
- Statements by the Council and Commission on Georgia with resolution in June Strasbourg
- Oral question on misleading directory companies removed from the agenda because the Council was unable to be present
The votes on the Lehne and Virrankoski reports to be postponed to the next Strasbourg plenary.

Written declaration on microcredit adopted by the European Parliament
2008-05-08 - 17:32
EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering announced the adoption of the written declaration on microcredit. It calls on the Commission and the Council to lend greater support to microcredit projects and to bolster programmes to help women. The written declaration calls for human and financial resources to be allocated to microcredit projects in the developing countries and in the Mediterranean. The declaration requests the Commission and the Council to recognise the importance of microcredit in the context of the Barcelona Process and in the neighbourhood and development policies.
More than half of the total of number of MEPs have now signed the declaration (424 out of 785) which means that it becomes an official position of the European Parliament. The declaration was put forward by Jamila MADEIRA (PES, PT), Ana Maria GOMES (PES, PT), Anna ZÁBORSKÁ (EPP-ED, SK), Luisa MORGANTINI (GUE/NGL, IT) and Miguel Angel MARTÍNEZ MARTÍNEZ (PES, ES).
MEPs point out that microcredit represents a method of lending small amounts that can be accessed by disadvantaged persons and that microcredit has permitted the extremely successful development of self-help employment projects, while also enabling the improvement of living conditions, and is also an important vehicle for the empowerment of women.
Finally, the House says that microcredit is a key tool for the combating of poverty and an instrument for achieving the Millennium Goals. Written declaration adopted on microcredit (adopted 7 May 08)

MEPs debate the situation in Georgia amid escalating tension in the region
2008-05-08 - 17:32
The European Parliament debated the situation in Georgia given the escalated tensions in the region and concerns over build-up of Russian troops. Many MEPs expressed their solidarity and support for Georgia's territorial integrity given the deteriorating situation in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. MEPs will vote on a resolution on this topic in June. Council Presidency
"We are particularly worried about the increased number of Russian forces in Abkhazia, and the introduction of 15 additional checkpoints on the border with Georgia," Slovenian State Secretary for European Affairs Janez Lenarcic said on behalf of the Council Presidency. "The EU stresses its commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia within its internationally recognised border according to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1808," he added. On Georgia's internal politics, the State Secretary expressed his hope for free and fair elections, saying "the Georgian authorities must establish the trust of the population in these elections."
Commission
External Affairs Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner expressed her "whole-hearted support for Georgia," saying that "the decision by Russia to strengthen links with separatist elements in the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia represent an erosion of Georgia's territorial integrity." She urged Russia to rethink this decision, or to at least not implement it. She said "any proposed action should be measured against its capacity to lower the temperature" in the area, given that "the stability of the entire South Caucasus is in danger." She added that "in the past 4 years, Georgia has made tremendous efforts to move towards democratic society," and reminded MEPs of the 2 million euros of electoral aid the Commission has pledged to Georgia for the upcoming polls.
Group speakers
Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Jacek Saryusz-Wolski (EPP-ED, PL) said Russian actions "violate existing agreements and the territorial integrity of Georgia, undermining international peace efforts." He urged Russia to reverse its decision to strengthen ties with separatists and to withdraw its forces, called on the UN forces on the ground to become a "truly international peace force" and asked the Council to "consider an ESDP mission" in Abkhazia. "The EU should act in line with its ambitions, to not only be a payer, but also a player in conflict resolution situation," he added.
Hannes Swoboda (PES, AT) said "a border has suddenly been drawn in the middle of the country." He nevertheless said Georgia must also show restraint, and refrain from using "war-like terms," such as those by Deputy Prime Minister Giorgi Baramidze yesterday in the Foreign Affairs Committee. He said a "peace mission unilaterally led by one of the parties to the conflict, especially the bigger one," was untenable. He also urged free and fair elections in the upcoming May 21 parliamentary polls in Georgia.
On behalf of the ALDE group, Georgs Andrejevs (ALDE, LV) said Russian military troops are having a "destabilising effect," and said "EU supervised troops should be considered." He added that a true democratic political culture in Georgia is important, saying the "administrative bodies of Georgia have not done everything necessary to convince people that they will deal with electoral concerns from the previous elections."
Marie Anne Isler Béguin (Greens/EFA, FR), Chair of the EP's Delegation for Relations with the South Caucasus said the situation "is close to annexation." "There is no confidence to be rebuilt, no dialogue; it has been broken off for two years," she added. "History will not pardon us if we do nothing," she warned, adding that the Balkans offered lessons that need to be heeded.
Konrad Szymanski (UEN, PL) said "a shameful silence has reigned in the EU about Georgia." He said ethnic cleansing in the 1990s had let to the present situation, and warned that "saying no to Georgian membership of NATO encourages Russia in its actions." "If we assist Russia in partitioning the region, the new imperialism of Russia will push the region to the brink of war," he added.
"The situation in Georgia is so bad today that 25% of its population has left the country," said Miloslav Ransdorf (EUL/NGL, CZ). He said new Russian President Medvedev "will need some time to implement what he has said he will do: to offer a friendly hand to Georgia."
British speakers
Charles Tannock (EPP-ED, UK) stated that "Russia has a new President today but Vladimir Putin's new job as Prime Minister will enable him to maintain his grip on power and supervise his protégé, Dimitri Medvedev. As a result, Russian foreign policy will not change. Recognition of Kosovo has opened a can of worms and has given Russia the moral high ground. It would indeed be tragic if through our approach to Kosovo we have irreparably damaged Georgia and precipitated conflict in a country whose territorial integrity we should defend strongly."
Robert Evans (PES, UK) said the EU is not doing enough to support Georgia at this time of "Russia's imperialism", that "Russia has never respected the territorial authority of Georgia over Abkhazia" and that we should be doing everything we can to stop the situation "before we have another Balkan crisis".
Response to the debate
Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner replied that Georgia "should not fall into the trap of reacting violently, and must also strengthen its own democracy." She added that "there is no question of the EU standing idly by," adding that the Council has already started talks on visa facilitation with Georgia, and more and more Member States see the importance of the issue, although unanimity is not yet reached. She also reminded MEPs that the Commission has given significant aid to Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) who have fled Abkhazia in previous years. Vote will take place in June 2008

EU-US economic ties should be strengthened says MEPs
2008-05-08 - 17:32
Creating uniform standards for trade and investment and removing non-tariff barriers are among the suggestions of MEPs to strengthen ties between the two trade blocs. On the ban on imported hormone-treated beef, MEPs say it is fully justified "on the basis of scientific evidence" in a resolution adopted this Thursday by the House. A single authorisation procedure for all food and feed containing GMOs is also suggested. A close transatlantic partnership is a vital instrument to shape globalisation, says the resolution, which supports strengthening transatlantic economic integration which started at the 2007 EU-US Summit. The Summit adopted a 'Framework for advancing transatlantic economic integration between the EU and the US' and established the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC).
The results achieved by the TEC demonstrate that the transatlantic market cannot be built on administrative work only, but that strong and continuous political guidance is needed.
Regulatory alignment and safety of products
Mutual recognition of securities markets between the US and the EU would be an important step forward, as well as the adoption of the IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) by the US side, says the resolution.
When creating uniform standards for trade and investment -future roadmap for achieving mutual recognition in 2009 of EU-US trade partnership agreements - a high level of social, environmental and health standards must be guaranteed.
The safety of imported products should also become a priority within the TEC, according to the resolution. MEPs underline the need for close EU-US cooperation to ensure that China and other third countries raise their production standards to meet EU/US safety requirements, in particular for toys.
MEPs point out the crucial role of the European Parliament and the US Congress in controlling the process of standard alignment and the removal of barriers to trade and investment.
Agricultural issues
An urgent solution with regard to the ongoing discussions on the ban on imports into the EU of US poultry which has undergone pathogen reduction treatments should be found.
MEPs acknowledge also the considerable investments made by the European poultry sector, in accordance with European legislation, to reduce salmonella contamination.
According to the House, the Community's decision to prohibit the import of hormone-treated beef has been "fully justified on the basis of scientific evidence". MEPs call on the US to lift its sanctions on European goods without further delay. The importance of a single authorisation procedure for all food and feed containing GMOs is emphasised.
Doha Development Agenda
MEPs recommend that greater coherence between bilateral trade agreements and the WTO multilateral rules should be discussed within the TEC. The resolution calls on the TEC to support the Doha declaration on the TRIPS Agreement, facilitating access to life-saving medicines for those countries which have no production capacity for pharmaceutical products.
The Future TLD agenda should include a discussion on the US cargo scanning regulation. The proposal to inspect 100% of shipping containers coming from overseas as a measure to avert terrorist threats is "unnecessary and unrealistic". A WTO post-Doha agenda, including a WTO reform, human rights, and environmental and social rights clauses in bilateral trade agreements should also discussed. Text adopted by the EP (click on 8 May)

Sport
Towards an EU policy on sport - MEPs concerned about TV rights, player selections and doping
2008-05-08 - 17:32
Stricter rules on doping, no quotas for football players from specific countries and a fair distribution of lottery profits are among the proposals of the European Parliament in a report adopted by a large majority (518 in favour 49 against and 9 abstentions). The report calls for the Commission to come up with clearer guidelines on how to apply EU rules in the area of sport. Parliament also voices concern about the possible deregulation of gambling markets. The report, drafted by Manolis MAVROMMATIS (EPP-ED, EL) welcomes the Commission's July 2007 White Paper on Sport and emphasises the important role of sport in society. It notes that about 60% of EU citizens regularly participate in sporting activities within or outside some 700,000 clubs, and that sport in a broader sense generated € 407 billion in value-added in 2004 (3.4% of EU GDP) and employment for 15 million people (5.4% of the labour force).
No discrimination on nationality - but favour home-grown players
MEPs call on Member States and sports associations not to introduce new rules that will create discrimination on the basis of nationality, such as the rule of 6+5, where 6 players on the field in the beginning of the match will have to be from the country of the club they are playing for. They also call on the Commission to recognise the legality of measures that favour a minimum number of locally trained players and believe that the UEFA-rule on home grown players by which a minimum number of players in a team should be trained in the club or in the same league is better.
Sport needs more certainty as to the law
The rapporteur Manolis Mavrommatis was delighted that sport has a more prominent place in the Lisbon treaty: "We need to protect the specific nature of sport and it is good that the European Union will now push forward a policy in the sport area," he said.
With a view to the Lisbon Treaty's ratification, the role of sport in Europe must be given a "strategic orientation", and the application of Community law must be clarified, says the report. MEPs ask the Commission to respect sport's specificity and to create clear guidelines as to how EU rules should be applied. MEPs also request a special budget line in the budget 2009 for preparatory actions in the field of sport, given that the Lisbon Treaty, if ratified, foresees incentive measures in the area of sport.
Self regulation
MEPs agree with the Commission that most challenges can be addressed though self regulation 4 provided that EU law is complied with, and believe that a structured partnership and dialogue between the Commission and sports movements is essential for good governance of sport, in order to avoid legal uncertainty and to respect the autonomy of the sports organisations.
Fight against doping
Doping is a key concern for MEPs, as it undermines transparency and fair competition. Policies to prevent and combat doping should include avoiding excessively busy sports calendars that put pressure on the athletes, say MEPs, who also call on professional clubs and sports organisations to adopt a pledge to combat doping and invite the Commission to consider treating trade in illicit doping substances in the same way as trade in illicit drugs.
Amateur sport and possible deregulation of gambling markets
The report also voices concern about the possible deregulation of lotteries and gambling markets. MEPs consider it appropriate to use lottery profits for purposes that are in the public interest, and calls on the Commission and the Member States to adopt regulatory measures to ensure that sport is protected from any improper influence relating to betting. They stress the need to continue to provide for the possibility of reduced VAT for sporting activities. MEPs also underline the important role of sport in society, as an effective tool for social integration and the importance of supporting measures for persons with disabilities.
Solidarity in the selling of TV rights - key sporting events should be free-to-air
Television rights are the primary source of income for professional sport in Europe. To ensure that not only the biggest clubs will benefit from the selling of the rights, MEPs recommend that Member States and national sports federations and leagues introduce collective selling of media rights so that there should be an equitable redistribution of income between the clubs within and between the leagues and between professional and amateur sport. They also encourage the sports organisations to reinvest a percentage of the revenue from TV rights to a particular sport to fund the volunteer and non-profit sectors MEPs acknowledge the right of the member states to assure wide access by television coverage sport events of major interest of the public such as Olympic Games, the football World Cup and the European football Championship and support Member states in drawing up a list of events of major importance that should be on free-to-air television.
The House repeats its support for Member States drawing up a list of events of major importance to the public that should be on free-to-air television under Article 3a of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive and condemns FIFA's court actions in this respect.
Stop human trafficking and favour home-grown players
Immigration laws should always be respected when recruiting new talented players to the European playing fields say MEPs, who call on the sports governing bodies to engage in the fight against human trafficking, subscribe to a European Charter for solidarity, create a solidarity fund to finance programmes in the countries most affected by human trafficking and review the FIFA rules of transfer in relation to the protection of minors. MEPs urge the Commission to openly express itself in favour of the stricter application of the FIFA regulations banning transfers of players aged under 16 within the EU and endorsing the principle that players should sign their first professional contract with the club which has trained them. MEPs also believe that the sports governing bodies should improve the rules concerning players' agents, and call on the Commission to support this initiative - if necessary by proposing a directive.
More gender equality in sport and fight against racism
MEPs regret that the Commission White Paper on sport does not take the gender aspect adequately into account especially concerning equal pay for female and male athletes and urge the Member States to value women performances in sport equally as men by introducing legal provisions to ensure that women are not awarded less valuable financial or other prizes in sporting events. The report also calls on sports organisations and Member States to adopt the strictest measures to combat racism and discrimination in sports, and calls on professional sports organisations and sports clubs to launch campaigns to tackle all forms of discrimination, racism, and xenophobia in connection to matches and sports activities both inside and outside stadiums.
Muscle drain
Finally, the House insists that development through sport should never lead to "muscle drain" and calls on the Union to address this issue in its policy dialogue and cooperation with partner countries. Text adopted by the EP (click on 8 May)

Human rights
MEPs review progress on human rights in the world in 2007
2008-05-08 - 17:32
The European Parliament adopted by an overwhelming majority on Thursday (8 May) its 2007 annual report on human rights in the world. One positive development identified in the report is the UN's call for a moratorium on the death penalty. However, human rights abuses in many countries, notably China, Iran and Russia, continue to give cause for concern. The report also evaluates EU's efforts to promote human rights through its own policies. The report, drafted by Marco Cappato (ALDE, IT), was approved by 533 votes in favour to 63 against and 41 abstentions.
Death penalty, women's rights and children's rights
The death penalty is one of the main topics highlighted. The adoption in 2007 of a UN resolution calling for a global moratorium on the use of the death penalty is seen as a huge step forward. However, MEPs still want to see "the eradication of capital punishment in Europe" and ultimately its universal abolition.
Women's rights is another key issue, which Parliament says should be raised in all EU human rights dialogues, with the aim of combating "discrimination and violence against women and girls, including, most prominently, gender-selected abortion, all forms of harmful traditional or customary practices, for example female genital mutilation and early or forced marriage".
Among other subjects addressed are children's rights (including the special problem of children and armed conflict), torture, the protection of human rights defenders and the rights of minorities and the disabled.
China, Iran and Russia
Several countries are singled out for special attention. The EP "expresses its disquiet at the serious human rights violations in China and stresses that, despite promises made by the regime with a view to the forthcoming Olympic Games, the situation on the ground regarding human rights has not improved". Moreover, China "still carries out the greatest number of executions worldwide".
MEPs are "deeply concerned that respect for fundamental rights in Iran, especially freedom of expression and assembly, continued to deteriorate in 2007". Iran is condemned for its "increasing use of capital punishment" and the arrest of thousands of men and women for "immoral behaviour", and is urged to resume the human rights dialogue with the EU interrupted in 2004.
In Russia, the situation in Chechnya is highlighted, together with the persecution of journalists, human rights defenders and political prisoners, and Russia's unwillingness to admit election observers. There is disappointment at the "lack of results from the European Union-Russia consultations on human rights".
Among other countries highlighted are Sudan (Darfur), Uzbekistan, Burma and Pakistan. MEPs also call on Cuba to allow two past winners of the EP's Sakharov Prize for human rights to come to the EP.
Human rights work of the UN and international community …
Turning to the work of international actors, the EP stresses "the crucial role" of the new UN Human Rights Council within the overall UN architecture as "the sole body monitoring and addressing human rights violations".
In the belief that the international community should do more to support democracy, MEPs call for the creation of "a genuine network of democracies around the world" by strengthening existing institutions.
… of the European Union …
The German and Portuguese EU presidencies are congratulated on their achievements in 2007, such as progress towards finalising EU guidelines on the rights of the child. However, Parliament says "the European Union is still far from conducting a coherent and hard-hitting policy to uphold and promote human rights around the world". Moreover, assessing the human rights impact of its policies is not easy, partly owing to a lack of data. The committee calls for "quantifiable indices and benchmarks" to measure their effectiveness.
More broadly, Mr Cappato's report argues that the "non-violent" defence of human rights should be specifically promoted as "a priority objective in EU human rights and democracy policy".
All EU states that have failed to sign certain international human rights conventions are urged to do so, including the Czech Republic as "the only remaining EU Member State not to have ratified the Rome Statute" on the International Criminal Court. Romania is urged to rescind its Bilateral Immunity Agreement with the USA on the ICC.
…and of the European Parliament
Lastly, human rights play a prominent role in the work of the European Parliament itself. A high-profile example last year was the report of the EP temporary committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for "rendition flights". Another is the holding of regular "urgency" debates and resolutions on human rights. The report calls on the Council to attend these debates and for the resolutions be translated into the languages spoken in the target areas. Finally, it calls for the EP to be involved in the EU's human rights dialogues and consultations with partner countries. Text adopted by the EP (click on 8 May)

EU election observation missions: objectives, practices and future challenges
2008-05-08 - 17:32
The report on election observation missions is the first of its kind, and supports the EU's observation missions, underlining how crucial they are, especially in developing countries. The European Parliament wants to increase its role especially in the immediate post-election period when the new parliaments are called, and legislators need advice on how to function in a democracy. The report was drafted by José Ignacio SALAFRANCA SÁNCHEZ-NEYRA (EPP-ED, ES) and Véronique DE KEYSER (PES, BE) and considers that in absolute terms the holding of elections cannot be regarded as the sole indicator of democracy, but that, nevertheless, it has a positive effect on the democratisation process as measured by improvements in civil liberties, provided that political pluralism, freedom of assembly and association, freedom of expression, equal access to the media, secret ballots and respect for human rights are secured.
European Consensus on Democracy
The European Parliament regrets that the EU still lacks a common, comprehensive strategy for promoting democracy, and urges all EU institutions and Member States to continue their efforts to make possible the adoption of such a strategy. The House, in this regard, urges all EU institutions and Member States to agree to establish a European Consensus on Democracy.
The report condemns the recent imposition by certain OSCE participating States of restrictions on the duration of Election Observation Missions (EOM) and their refusal to issue, or delay in issuing, visas for observers, which has made it impossible for the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights to fulfil its mandate.
Public statements and press conferences
The report stresses, in particular, the importance of coordinating all public statements related to the findings of EU EOMs and avoiding the issue of any statement in advance of the presentation by the EU EOM of its preliminary statement, and underlines the key role played in terms of visibility and credibility by the press conference, where the preliminary statement is presented for the first time. The report calls for both the press statements and reports of findings to be released in accordance with a timetable which takes into account the electoral sensitivities on the ground.
" Business as usual"
The report condemns past examples of practices consisting of a "business as usual" attitude towards countries in respect of which EU EOMs have been severely critical of the electoral process, regrets, on the other hand, that democratic elections are not always legitimated by the EU, and believes that these inconsistencies undermine the fragile idea of democracy in these countries and the image of the EU.

European Parliament calls for more transparency on lobbying
2008-05-08 - 17:32
A mandatory public register for lobbyists, common to the Council, Commission and Parliament and providing for "full financial disclosure", was proposed by the European Parliament. Lobbyists would also have to comply with a code of conduct and face sanctions if they infringed it. MEPs voted in favour of a mandatory public register of lobbyists. MEPs backed a "one-stop-shop" proposal, whereby lobbyists would need to register only once to have access to Parliament, the Commission and the Council. During the debate, all groups' speakers expressed general support for the report. Ingo FRIEDRICH (EPP-ED, DE), rapporteur, commented on an amendment tabled by the liberal group to include churches in the list of lobbying organisations, saying: "churches are partners according to the treaties, not lobbying". Carlos CARNERO GONZÁLEZ (PES, ES) said socialists will support two amendments tabled by the Greens, one of which calls for the register to be into force before the 2009 EP elections.
Anneli JÄÄTTEENMÄKI (ALDE, FI) explained that the ALDE group is particularly pleased for the decision to make the register mandatory, as advocated by them. Ryszard CZARNECKI (UEN, PL) expressed support for a joint register and said: "Our constituencies have the right to know who lobbyists are". Monica FRASSONI (Greens/EFA, IT) said: "There is a tendency to underrate the effectiveness of lobbying work". She also said that lawyers, when trying to influence legislation, should be considered as lobbyists, even when providing legal advice. Sylvia-Yvonne KAUFMANN , from GUE/NGL group, said having clear rules on lobbying is "crucial for credibility for EU legislation". Finally, Jens-Peter BONDE (IND/DEM, DK) said the EU should follow the example of the US regime on lobbying: "Why can't we be as transparent?" he concluded.
Mandatory common register
MEPs voted in favour of a mandatory public register of lobbyists. MEPs also backed a "one-stop-shop" proposal, whereby lobbyists would need to register only once to have access to Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
To this end, MEPs suggested that the three institutions set up a joint working group without delay, to prepare a proposal on the common register by the end of 2008.
"Full financial disclosure" and sanctions foreseen
According to the resolution, lobbyists will have to abide by a code of conduct. A mechanism will be provided for expelling those who infringe the rules. MEPs also called for lobbyists' conduct to be closely monitored, sanctions in the event of misbehaviour and sufficient human and financial resources to verify the information included in the register.
Moreover, MEPs suggested that the mandatory register should include "full financial disclosure" by lobbyists. Professional consultancies and law firms in particular would have to disclose the relative weight of their major clients and the costs associated with lobbying. NGOs and think tanks would be required to state their overall budgets and main sources of funding.
The inter-institutional working group is also expected to propose specific criteria for financial disclosure.
Who is a lobbyist?
MEPs acknowledge that lobbyists can provide useful expertise, but considered it essential for them to be able to identify the organisations represented by lobby groups.
MEPs defined a lobbyist as anyone "influencing the policy formulation and decision-making processes of the European institutions". Both public and private interest representatives and profit and non-profit organisations, when regularly influencing the institutions, may therefore be considered lobbyists. The approved report also lists NGOs, think tanks, lawyers (when they are not providing legal assistance or legal advice), trade unions and employers' associations.
The "legislative footprint"
The EP also decided that rapporteurs should be permitted to attach to their reports an indicative list of lobbyists who were consulted and had a "significant input" during the preparation of the text.
MEPs suggested that this "legislative footprint", as the rapporteur described it, should also be used by the Commission, for its legislative initiatives.
The European Parliament has had a voluntary register of lobbyists and a code of lobbying conduct in place for the past ten years. The rapporteur estimated that there are about 15,000 lobbyists, and 2,500 lobby organisations, in Brussels. A count of permanent visitors’ badges and “express” badges, suggests that there are approximately 5,000 lobbyists operating in the EP. Text adopted by the EP (click on 8 May)

Agriculture
Cotton - support schemes for farmers
2008-05-08 - 17:32
Parliament adopted a non-binding report on support schemes for farmers (support for cotton) which calls for a deeper revision of the aid system introduced in 2004 so as to allow more flexibility to Member States. MEPs say that policies to forecast, mitigate and combat the effects of climate change on cotton-producing regions may be funded under the national support programmes. Cotton growing represents only 0.15% of EU agriculture production but is very important at economic, social and environmental levels in EU Southern countries and should therefore be preserved according to MEPs. After the 2004 reform was annulled by the European Court of Justice at the request of Spain, the Commission has tabled a new proposal based on the same lines.
Internationally, the EU is a minor player on the world cotton market, contributing only about 2% to the world’s total production of cotton. The main producing countries are China, the USA and India. The cotton sector, despite being of limited significance to the EU as a whole (contributing only 0.15% of the final agricultural output) has strong regional importance in the two main producing Member States namely Greece and Spain. Around 76% of the EU’s total output is grown in Greece. A small amount of cotton is also grown in Bulgaria. Most farmers growing cotton are small in size (Greece 4.5 ha and Spain 11.0 ha). In Greece there are 79 700 farmers growing cotton and in Spain 9 500. Text adopted by the EP (click on 8 May)

External/international trade
Trade and economic relations with the countries of South East Asia (ASEAN)
2008-05-08 - 17:32
The EP is in favour of concluding a free-trade accord between the EU and the 10 countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). However, say MEPs in the committee, the agreement must meet certain conditions regarding sustainable development, the fight against fraud and respect for human rights. The report, drafted by Glyn FORD (PES, UK) and adopted by an overwhelming majority, supports plans for a free-trade agreement with ASEAN subject to WTO rules and the outcome of the Doha development round. Glyn Ford said: "ASEAN is an increasingly important power in the world. ASEAN is the EU's 5th largest trading partner, ranking ahead of Japan. This EU-ASEAN FTA would be beneficial to both sides, including to poor countries in the region. For obvious reasons, Burma will not be part of that trade agreement".
MEPs voice concern at the slowness of the negotiations launched in April 2007, believe that it should be possible to suspend preferential custom tariffs granted under the agreement if key points of the partnership and cooperation agreement are violated, in particular the human rights clauses.
Food prices
Parliament expresses concern about the consequences of higher rice prices, particularly for poorer households in rice-importing ASEAN countries. The House calls on both sides to give priority in the negotiations to the need to stabilise the price of commodities, in particular the price of food, and to approach the issue of agro-fuels with great caution.
Sustainable development
The planned agreement should ask the ASEAN countries to ratify and apply the basic conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), according to the EP report. MEPs particularly emphasise the need to ban child labour and forced labour.
Measures to combat the destruction of tropical forests should also be included in the agreement, says the report. The ASEAN countries who try to stem the illegal exploitation of forests should be supported, say MEPs in the committee, who also want to give preference to environmentally-friendly biofuels and cut customs tariffs on environmental and/or fair-trade products.
Intellectual property rights and the anti-counterfeiting measures
The report highlights the need to observe intellectual property rights (IPR), especially for models and designs, sound recordings and other cultural goods, as well as the fight against the counterfeiting of drugs and medicines. It also calls for protection of and respect for geographical indications and labels of origin, as well as more transparency in the award of public contracts, state aid and other subsidies.
Burma
"The current situation in Burma makes it impossible for that country to be included in the agreement", argues the Trade Committee's report. At joint hearing held in early April by the EP Development Committee and Human Rights Subcommittee, the EU was urged to target better its sanctions on the Burmese junta.
Least developed countries
The report also stresses the situation of the least developed countries (LDCs) in the region: Cambodia, Laos and Burma. At present the Commission's negotiating mandate does not provide for negotiations with the LDCs. If these countries wished to join the free-trade agreement with the EU, the Council would have to revise the mandate it has given the Commission.
For the other poorer countries who are members of ASEAN but do not belong to the LDC group, the report urges flexible arrangements - more or less equivalent to those envisaged in economic partnership agreements (EPAs) - to enable these countries to cope with the loss of customs revenue.
Corruption
In order to promote good governance, transparency and the rule of law, the Parliament wishes to see intervention from Member States and the Commission in cases where there is clear legal evidence that officials from ASEAN countries are involved in corruption cases related to natural resources. The House ask the Commission to report to the Parliament on any action it will undertake in this regard.
Banking secrecy
A resolution to the problem of banking secrecy in Singapore is "essential if there is to be a real prospect of a region-to-region [free-trade agreement]", argues the report.
Lastly, MEPs point out that, since the Lisbon Treaty is due to enter into force before the end of the negotiations, the approval of the European Parliament will be needed once the negotiations are completed.
The members of ASEAN are: Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar (Burma), the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Text adopted by the EP (click on 8 May)

Fisheries
A "precautionary approach" to deep-sea fish stocks
2008-05-08 - 17:32
The European Parliament adopted a report on the management of deep-sea fish stocks. MEPs note "a certain lack of symmetry between the situation described in the Commission communication and the actual situation", calling on the Commission, the Member States and the fishing industry to "fill in the gaps" that exist so that effort control measures can be adapted to each fishery, recognising that most deep-water fisheries are mixed fisheries. "These are mixed fisheries where the situation for most stocks is uncertain, given the scant information available, and where several of the species, such as sharks, orange roughly and blue ling, are not fished directly. Since they straddle Community waters and the regulatory area of the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission, disagreements sometimes arise over management arrangements", explains Rosa MIGUÉLEZ RAMOS.
MEPs point out to the Commission that, "even where total allowable catches (TACs) and effort limitations for these fisheries have been fixed arbitrarily owing to the lack of biological knowledge, the precautionary approach to and the exploitation of each species considered as a deep-water species must be observed and TACs must be set accordingly, on the basis of precise scientific studies".
Given that many of these stocks are managed in international waters, measures must be coordinated within the various RFOs [Regional Fisheries Organisations] so that the measures adopted take account of all fleets operating in these fisheries, notes the report. "All restrictions should apply to fishermen from all contracting parties, in order to prevent disadvantages from arising".
A ban on discards
The European Parliament stresses the need to "introduce a ban on discards in the deep-water fishery", which would enable scientists to study with more precision the complex diversity of species, "many of them inedible, being landed".
The Commission, within the framework of measures to reduce by-catches and ban discards, should "impose a ban on all fishing activity over seamounts, hydrothermal vents and within five miles of all identified coldwater corals", MEPs add.
Parliament takes the view that the Commission, within the framework of measures to reduce by-catches and eliminate discards, should vary the levels of fishing effort according to the species targeted and those caught merely by accident, whilst at the same time strengthening monitoring and control procedures.
New programmes for the collection of scientific information
MEPs call on the Commission to introduce new programmes for the collection of scientific information, if necessary using research vessels. "One example might be that undertaken by the Spanish fisheries administration in the regulatory area of the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission, mapping the Hatton Bank, where deep-water species are caught", says the report. The research focused on the distribution of seamounts, cold-water coral reefs and hydrothermal vents in order to identify sensitive zones in the areas in which fishing fleets operate.

Fisheries agreement EC - Seychelles
2008-05-08 - 17:32
MEPs adopted a non-binding report drawn up by Josu ORTUONDO LARREA (ALDE, ES) recommending approval to the conclusion of a fisheries agreement between the European Community and Seychelles. Fishing opportunities remain unchanged (40 tuna seiners from France, Spain and Italy and 12 surface longliners from France, Spain and Portugal), the annual financial contribution increases from 4 125 000 euros to 5 355 000 euros and the reference tonnage from 55 000 tonnes to 63.000 tonnes. In the explanatory statement of the report, Josu ORTUONDO LARREA highlights that this is the Community’s biggest tuna agreement with a third country in terms of both reference tonnage and financial contribution and a key element ensuring the consistency and viability of other tuna agreements between the Community and other countries in the Indian Ocean (Madagascar, Comoros, Mauritius, Mozambique).
The purpose of the proposed agreement is to amend the existing Protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Seychelles, adopted on 23 January 2006, which repealed and replaced the agreement of 1987.
The Protocol, which will apply until 17 January 2011, sets out the following fishing opportunities:
Tuna seiners
Spain: 22 vessels
France: 17 vessels
Italy: 1 vessel
Surface longliners
Spain: 2 vessels
France: 5 vessels
Portugal: 5 vessels Text adopted by the EP (click on 8 May)

MEPs back reduced rate excise duty for Madeira's local beer
2008-05-08 - 17:32
A proposed Council Decision authorising Portugal to apply until 31 December 2013 a reduced rate of excise duty to beer brewed in Madeira by small independent breweries and consumed locally is endorsed by the European Parliament (report by Sergio Marques, EPP-ED, PT). Portugal points out that this measure is considered essential to the survival of the local brewing industry. The decision would apply where annual production exceeds 200,000 hectolitres but not 300,000 hectolitres. Production in excess of 200,000 hectolitres will be eligible for the reduced rate only to the extent that it is consumed locally, so as not to undermine the EU single market.
Close to the limit
Council directives 92/83/EEC and 92/84/EEC (alcoholic beverage excise duties) allow reduced rates, of no more than 50% below the standard national rate, on beer from small independent breweries.
In Madeira, these breweries already get a full 50% reduced rate under national rules. However, mainly due to increased tourism, one of the two breweries in Madeira is close to producing 200,000 hectolitres annually, whereupon its entitlement to reduced rates under the existing rules will cease.
Offsetting disadvantages
The disadvantages faced by the Madeira breweries include remoteness, fragmented terrain and tight local markets. These disadvantages are compounded by strong competition from beer brewed by large national and multinational breweries and imported from other EU Member States.
EC Treaty Article 299(2) takes account of the outermost regions' special characteristics and constraints without undermining the integrity of the Community legal order. In this context Portugal has requested a derogation from Treaty Article 90 (discriminatory taxation) in order to apply a rate of excise duty lower than the national rate fixed in accordance with Directive 92/84/EEC.
