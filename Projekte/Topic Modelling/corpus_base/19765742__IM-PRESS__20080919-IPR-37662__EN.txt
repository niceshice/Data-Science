European Parliament President Hans-Gert PÃ¶ttering announced the adoption of the written declaration on the proclamation of 23 August as European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism since it has been signed by more than half of all MEPs (409 out of 785 on 15 September)
The written declaration, put forward by Marianne MIKKO (PES, EE), Christopher BEAZLEY (EPP-ED, UK), Inese VAIDERE (UEN, LV), Zita GURMAI (PES, HU) and Alexander ALVARO (ALDE, DE), proposed that 23 August be proclaimed European Day of Remembrance for Victims of the Crimes of Stalinism and Nazism, in order to preserve the memory of the victims of mass deportations and exterminations while, at the same time, rooting democracy more firmly and reinforcing peace and stability in our continent.
The written declaration points out that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 23 August 1939 between the Soviet Union and Germany divided Europe into two spheres of interest by means of secret additional protocols.
The mass deportations, murders and enslavements committed in the context of the acts of aggression by Stalinism and Nazism fall into the category of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Under international law, statutory limitations do not apply to war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Finally, MEPs say that the influence and significance of the Soviet order and occupation on/for citizens of the post-Communist States are little known in Europe.
