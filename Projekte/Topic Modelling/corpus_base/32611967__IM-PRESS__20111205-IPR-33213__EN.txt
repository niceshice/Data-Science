Delegation Chair Jo Leinen (S&D, DE) commented: “The European Parliament believes the future of the Kyoto Protocol and the climate fund for developing countries is key to success or failure in Durban. I am pleased that the first week has made some progress. This week will now be crucial in laying these vital building blocks towards a binding international deal.”
Press conference
Delegation chair Jo Leinen will hold a joint press conference with Climate Action Commissioner Connie Hedegaard on Wednesday, 7 December from 15.00-15.30 (GMT+2), Yellowwood room, ICC, Durban (or via livestream on the UNFCCC website.)
Climate financing, programme
Nicholas Stern will give a keynote address at Parliament’s ‘Side Event’ on climate financing on Wednesday. In their Durban programme, MEPs will discuss negotiations with the Commission and Polish Presidency, meet counterparts from other parliaments (Japan, South Africa and Mexico), as well as local and international NGO representatives.
Parliament position
In its 16 November resolution, Parliament called for the EU to give “clear and unequivocal” support to a new phase of the expiring Kyoto Protocol, urged agreement to ‘operationalise’ the Green Climate Fund and noted the economic benefits to the EU if it goes beyond its 20% 2020 emissions target (see link below).
