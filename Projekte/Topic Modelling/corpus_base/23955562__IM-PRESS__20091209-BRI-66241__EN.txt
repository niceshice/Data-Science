Russian human rights defenders to receive Sakharov Prize
This year's Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought will be awarded in Strasbourg to Oleg Orlov, Sergei Kovalev and Lyudmila Alexeyeva on behalf of the organisation Memorial and all other human rights defenders in Russia. The ceremony takes place on Wednesday 16 December.
Adoption of 2010 budget
On Thursday Parliament will adopt the EU budget for 2010. The main challenge for this year's budget was to find the funding for the already agreed but not yet financed economic recovery plan, which will cost the EU €2.4 billion next year.
Easier access to credit to help the unemployed start up a business
Parliament is set to back a plan to create a micro-finance instrument to help people at risk of losing their jobs to start up their own businesses.
Review of the Swedish Presidency
MEPs will give their verdict on the Swedish EU Presidency and the outcome of the December European Council. Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt will introduce both topics to the plenary.
The EU's role in Afghanistan and Pakistan
On Wednesday Parliament will debate the EU's new action plan for Afghanistan and Pakistan, including the recent agreement by NATO allies to send 6800 troops to reinforce the international presence in the country.
The Middle East and East Jerusalem
MEPs will look at the current situation in the Middle East and East Jerusalem in a debate with the Commission and Council. The Council statement of 8 December calls for negotiations to take place over the core issues of the conflict, emphasising that a way must be found to make Jerusalem the capital of both Israel and a future Palestinian state.
MEPs to quiz President Barroso on EU 2020 Strategy
The second half of the new Question Hour with the Commission President on Tuesday afternoon will be devoted to the EU 2020 Strategy, which is intended to build on the current Lisbon Strategy and make the EU a greener social market. During the first part of question hour the political group leaders can ask questions on any topic they wish.
Public access to documents: Parliament to reopen the debate
The Lisbon Treaty is supposed to bring greater transparency and easier access to EU documents. This issue is dear to the hearts of MEPs, who next week in Strasbourg will press the Commission and Council to move forward in the revision of existing legislation on access to documents. There will be a debate, with a resolution on Wednesday.
***
With the Lisbon Treaty, in force as of 1 December 2009, the European Parliament has important new lawmaking powers. Virtually all EU legislation is now decided by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers together - including agriculture, immigration, energy and the EU budget. As the only directly elected EU institution, Parliament's position in making sure the EU is accountable to its citizens is also strengthened, for example by MEPs having a bigger say in appointments to many of the EU's top jobs. 20091209BRI66241 Draft agenda - 14-17 December 2009 EuroparlTV - watch live broadcasts from plenary

Human rights
Russian human rights defenders to receive Sakharov Prize
2009-12-10 - 16:25
This year's Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought will be awarded in Strasbourg to Oleg Orlov, Sergei Kovalev and Lyudmila Alexeyeva on behalf of the organisation Memorial and all other human rights defenders in Russia. The ceremony takes place on Wednesday 16 December. Announcing the Memorial organisation as the winner of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought on 22 October, European Parliament President Jerzy Buzek said: "By awarding this year's Prize to Oleg Orlov, Sergei Kovalev and Lyudmila Alexeyeva on behalf of Memorial and all other human rights defenders in Russia, we hope to contribute to ending the circle of fear and violence surrounding human rights defenders in the Russian Federation and to advance our message that civil society activists everywhere must be free to exercise their most basic rights of freedom of thought and freedom of expression."
Founded in 1988, Memorial is a non-governmental Russian organisation promoting the truth about political repression in former Soviet states and combating human rights violations to try and bring about a democratic future in the region. The organisation created a database of over 1,300,000 names of persecuted people with the aim of building a publicly available archive on the consequences of totalitarian repression in former Soviet states.
Purpose of the Sakharov Prize
Human rights, democracy and the rule of law are key priorities for the European Parliament. The Sakharov Prize, awarded since 1988 and named after Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov (1921-1989), is awarded to individuals or organisations who seek to:
- defend human rights and fundamental freedoms, particularly the right to free expression;
- safeguard minority rights;
- foster respect for international law;
- promote democracy and the rule of law.

Budget
Adoption of 2010 budget
2009-12-10 - 16:25
On Thursday Parliament will adopt the EU budget for 2010. The main challenge for this year's budget was to find the funding for the already agreed but not yet financed economic recovery plan, which will cost the EU €2.4 billion next year.
If the full Parliament endorses the proposals of its Budgets Committee, the total 2010 budget will be €141.453 billion in commitments and €122.937 billion in payments.
The main part of EU's 2010 budget was agreed at the 18 November budget conciliation meeting with the Council of Ministers. To finance the economic recovery plan, the conciliation committee agreed to use margins and leftovers from heading 2 (mainly agriculture) and heading 5 (administration) in 2009 and 2010. The Member States will also add some extra money through the flexibility instrument, which will also finance support for the closure of the Bulgarian nuclear plant Kozloduy.
The Budgets Committee made some final adjustments in its second reading on 2 December.
This annual budget, like the last one, was negotiated under the Nice Treaty rules, which meant that Parliament had no formal power over farm expenditure. Nevertheless, Parliament managed to introduce a €300 million budget line to support milk farmers, an aid that MEPs have demanded for years. According to the rapporteur, László Surján (EPP,HU), this was the "the spirit of Lisbon" already influencing this year's budget process. With the Lisbon Treaty, Parliament has gained full powers over the EU budget.
If the full Parliament backs the Budgets Committee's proposals, this will be next year's budget:

Social policy
Easier access to credit to help the unemployed start up a business
2009-12-10 - 16:25
Parliament is set to back a plan to create a micro-finance instrument to help people at risk of losing their jobs to start up their own businesses.
The European Microfinance Facility is an instrument aimed at people who want to start or develop micro-enterprises (businesses with less than 10 people the turnover of which does not exceed €2 million) but who have difficulty accessing the conventional credit market. It is set for a four-year period and is scheduled to come into force on 1 January 2010.
The reports by Kinga GÖNCZ (S-D, HU) proposed that the EU funding for this programme does not come from the funding for Progress, an existing programme to help the unemployed.
The Commission had initially proposed that the micro-credit facility be allocated €100 million from the Progress programme for employment and social solidarity. Its justification for this was that under the 2006 inter-institutional agreement, the Progress programme had been allocated an additional €114 million, at Parliament's request. Debate : 14.12.2009
Vote : 16.12.2009 €100 million EU micro-finance facility to help unemployed start small businesses (European Commission) Employment: micro-credit facility for start-ups must not be funded through the Progress programme Profile of Rapporteur Kinga GÖNCZ Report on European Microfinance Facility

Congo and Belarus
2009-12-10 - 16:25
Violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the situation in Belarus will be the subject of debates this week between MEPs, the Council and Commission.
Congo
Parliament will discuss the recent violent ethnic clashes that have made more than 44,000 people flee their homes in the western part of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Sexual violence is being used as a weapon of war and terror in the Democratic Republic of Congo, especially in the city of Goma and in its surrounding area, in the North Kivu province near the border with Rwanda. The United Nations has recorded at least 200,000 cases of sexual violence against women and girls in this region since 1996. Parliament is expected to adopt a resolution on this issue on Thursday.
Belarus
MEPs will discuss the Council's recent decision not to lift the sanctions (assets freeze) against certain Belarus officials, which will be extended until October 2010. Progress is still needed in areas such as reform of the electoral code, freedom of expression and of the media and the need for Belarus to introduce a moratorium on death penalty, says the Council decision.
However, Member States have kept in place the temporary suspension of another sanction - a travel ban on senior Belarus officials - as a way to encourage reforms. President Lukashenko and others are therefore allowed to travel to Europe. The Commission is to propose directives on visa facilitation and readmission agreements with Belarus.

Questions about the legal basis for antiterrorist measures
2009-12-10 - 16:25
MEPs will question the Commission and Council about proposals for restrictive measures, including the freezing of assets, against individuals linked to Al-Qaeda, and against people threatening the rule of law in Zimbabwe and Somalia. They fear Parliament could be excluded from the decision-making process. A resolution will be put to the vote on Wednesday. At issue is the legal base chosen by the Commission and the Council Presidency. MEPs note that the Council's choice of Article 215 of the Treaty, which gives Parliament only a consultative role, is related to external action, while the envisaged measures are applicable on EU territory (even if they originate outside the EU).
MEPs also want information on the work of the UN sanctions committee, which has imposed targeted sanctions (freezing of assets or blocking of financial transactions) on a number of individuals. Oral question with resolution

Continuing obstacles to recognition of professional qualifications in the EU
2009-12-10 - 16:25
Parliament will ask the Commission why freedom of movement for professional people in the single market remains difficult. The laws on recognition of qualifications that are supposed to encourage mobility are not properly applied and there are many complaints. MEPs want to know what steps the Commission plans to take.
If people wish to work abroad, for most jobs the authorities of the host country would need to recognise their qualifications. A directive intended to rationalise the current system was adopted in 2005. However, although the deadline for implementation of the directive in the Member States was 20 October 2007, seventeen out of twenty-six states have not yet managed to implement it in full and Greece has not done so at all.

EU action for victims of terrorism
2009-12-10 - 16:25
The next steps towards protecting victims of terrorism, including a possible European charter on terrorism, will be the subject of a debate with the Commission. At the moment, national laws on the protection of victims vary greatly. In a resolution on the Stockholm programme adopted in November, MEPs argued that the rights of victims of terrorism should be better protected, with priority going to financial compensation. They also proposed further action on witness protection, with incentives for those who cooperate in dismantling terrorist networks. Commission statement

Regional policy
The future of EU regional policy
2009-12-10 - 16:25
MEPs will question the Commission on the future of EU regional policy after 2013. They are concerned about unofficial budget reform proposals that may lead to deep cuts in regional policy funding. In a recent debate, MEPs of the Regional Development Committee voiced concern that the EU may lose its say on regional policy, with a large part of it being transferred to national governments.

Public access to documents: Parliament to reopen the debate
2009-12-10 - 16:25
The Lisbon Treaty is supposed to bring greater transparency and easier access to EU documents. This issue is dear to the hearts of MEPs, who next week in Strasbourg will press the Commission and Council to move forward in the revision of existing legislation on access to documents. There will be a debate, with a resolution on Wednesday. In March 2009, MEPs adopted amendments to the draft proposal on access to documents but postponed the final vote on the legislative resolution, leaving the door open for further negotiations in case they can reach a first-reading agreement with Council. Debate : 15.12.2009
Vote : 16.12.2009 EP press release on access to documents Oral question on Improvement needed in the legal framework for access to documents following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, Regulation (EC) 1049/2001 Profile of Rapporteur Michael Cashman (S&D, UK)

Human rights
Deportation of Western Saharan campaigner Aminatou Haidar
2009-12-10 - 16:25
Aminatou Haidar, a Saharawi human rights activist, was arrested by the Moroccan authorities on 13 November at El Aaiún airport and deported to Lanzarote in the Canary Islands, Spain. She has since been on hunger strike, asking to be repatriated to her country. MEPs in Strasbourg will debate her situation and then vote on an urgent resolution on the matter. Aminatou Haidar was arrested last November, on her return to El Aaiún, for allegedly refusing to tick "Morocco" in the "Country box" of her entry card. She claims the Western Sahara is not a part of Morocco.
Aminatou Haidar received the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award and was nominated to the Nobel Peace Prize in 2008. In 2005 she was among the nominees for the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. Debate: Thursday 17 December, 15.00h
Vote: Thursday 17 December
