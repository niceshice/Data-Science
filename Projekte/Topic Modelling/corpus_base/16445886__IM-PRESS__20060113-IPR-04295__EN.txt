Do CIA detention centres exist in Europe? Has the CIA been using European airports to transport terrorist suspects to places where they could face torture? These are two questions that lie at the heart of a new temporary committee set up by the Parliament . The cross-party committee of 46 MEPs will also examine whether European governments knew about these alleged practices - and if EU citizens have been involved.
MEPs agreed on Thursday the membership of the temporary committee of the European Parliament to investigate allegations of the transport and illegal detention of prisoners by the CIA in European countries. Parliament voted on Wednesday to set up the committee.
The temporary committee's mandate will be to collect and analyse information to find out:
- whether the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) or other US agents or intelligence services of other third countries have carried out abductions, "extraordinary rendition", detentions at secret sites, torture, inhuman or degrading treatment of prisoners on EU territory or in acceding or candidate countries, or have used this territory to these ends, for example by through flights to or from such countries;
- whether such actions, which would have been carried out as part of the fight against terrorism, could be considered a violation of Article 6 of the EU Treaty, of certain provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights, of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and of other international treaties and agreements, including EU-US agreements on extradition;
- whether EU citizens or the candidate countries, or any other person entitled to protection from the EU have been detained;
- whether EU Member States or institutions have been involved or have been complicit in the illegal deprivation of the liberty of individuals.
Parliament also states that the temporary committee will liaise and cooperate "as closely as possible" with, inter alia, the Council of Europe, the European Commissioner responsible for human rights, the UN Commissioner for Human Rights and with national parliaments. It also states that the committee should submit an interim report within four months after it starts work.
Under Rule 175 of its Rules of Procedure, the European Parliament may set up a temporary committee at any time. The mandate runs for a maximum of twelve months, unless Parliament decides to extend it.
