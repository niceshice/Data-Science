Europe should take advantage of the present improvement in economic growth to make the changes and investment needed to enhance its potential growth rates for the longer term, so as to be able to generate more employment. This is the key message of the report on the EU’s Broad Economic Policy Guidelines, adopted by the Economics Committee without opposition on Wednesday.
In their advice to Member States, contained in the report drawn up by Udo Bullmann (PES, DE), MEPs in the committee call, among other points, for:
effective coordination of economic policies, including growth-intensive public spending, stimulation of private investment and public-private cooperation, notably on projects for science, research, transport, communication, energy and environmental sustainability;
improved access to financing for small and medium sized businesses, along with favourable tax and social contribution arrangements;
the curbing of protectionist tendencies;
action to make the labour market more inclusive, balancing job security and flexibility, as well as better opportunities to combine professional and family life;
enhanced and structured economic cooperation in the EU and in particular the euro area.
Institutional action recommended by the report includes:
a “league table” of the best and worst performers among the Member States in terms of implementing reforms to achieve the jobs and growth goals of the Lisbon Strategy;
action to make the Lisbon Strategy more visible to all players in Member States’ societies, with broader consultation;
a joint process of reflection between the EU bodies via an inter-institutional working party following the spring summit, to develop the next set of integrated policy guidelines for the years to come.
The Broad Economic Policy Guidelines, adopted each year by the EU’s Heads of State or Government at their spring summit, are one of the main methods for coordinating economic policy between the EU’s Member States. Together with the Employment Policy Guidelines, they form a package, known as the “integrated policy guidelines.”
