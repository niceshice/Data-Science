European Council President Herman Van Rompuy discussing summit with MEPs Opening the Conference of Presidents Tuesday, EP president Jerzy Buzek called the euro and Schengen EU "landmarks" that must be protected, a position backed up by MEPs, who focused mainly on Greece, economic governance and a possible reform of the Schengen rules when discussing the outcome of the European Summit last week.
European Council President, Herman Van Rompuy s poke of a "workmanlike" council that included "a good long discussion" on the budgetary surveillance rules which he urged Parliament to approve, without seeking too perfect an agreement, as "the best is the enemy of the good" and could threaten to delay the process.
He called on the Greek parliament to approve the IMF/EU programme of economic reform on which the deal to finance Greek debt is based, while Commission President José Manuel Barroso said, "we have shown once again that we can reach agreement when it is needed" but added that the EU needs more scope to front-load structural programmes to encourage growth.
"The euro hasn't died", EPP leader Joseph Daul said. "We need more Europe and that applies to our economies too and I'm delighted to see that EU 27 has reaffirmed a key principle that our economies have to be competitive...Competitiveness underpins our social model".
Socialist leader Martin Schulz questioned the "dominance of a few rating agencies in New York" over EU crisis-related decision-making, explaining how the draconian measures imposed on Greece are caused by those same rating agencies. He also questioned the unanimity of the council over the economic governance measures, especially the provision for semi-automatic sanctions against countries that break fiscal policy rules.
German Green Rebecca Harms said, "we need to look at resetting the framework conditions, to look at a package which will enable the economy to be revived," while GUE/NGL President, Lothar Bisky said, "when we are looking at the crucial aims of Europe 2020, employment, research and development, and combating poverty and further education, we haven't seen any success yet".
"As we speak, there are hundreds of thousands gathering in Athens," EFD co-president Nigel Farage said, warning "don't think that the Arab spring can't turn into a Mediterranean summer of discontent as people fight to get their democratic rights back".
Schengen
Commenting on Schengen, Mr Barroso said, "as a last resort, internal border controls could be reintroduced for a limited amount of time if a member state is not complying" with EU rules.
But ALDE leader Guy Verhofstadt said the EP will never approve the proposed changes to the Schengen area rules, restricting passport free travel in cases of uncontrollable migratory flows. That is "not saving but killing Schengen" and is a threat to the EU, he said. "We need to share the burden in cases of a mass influx as we did in the case of Kosovo".
"We need existing legislation to be applied more effectively and existing agencies to be more efficient," Timothy Kirkhope said for the ECR group. "The challenges we face in the present movement of people are really serious and they cannot be simply wished away with clichés… border controls must be maintained where necessary."
