Institutions

Issues such as the Lisbon Treaty, unemployment and support for Neelie Kroes and Tony Blair came up during Parliament's first-ever "question time" with Commission President José Manuel Barroso. Mr Barroso first answered a round of questions from political group leaders, followed by MEPs' questions on the financial crisis.
Paulo RANGEL (EPP, PT) asked whether the Commission had taken any steps to ensure the transition between the Nice and Lisbon Treaties. Mr Barroso replied: "All countries have adopted the Lisbon Treaty from a democratic point of view, although there is still a pending issue, and the European Commission is waiting to see what the Czech Constitutional Court will decide".
Stephen HUGHES (S&D, UK) expressed concern that the financial crisis could "turn into a social crisis" and asked Mr Barroso about his policy for economic recovery. Mr Barroso replied that "without the EU recovery plan, it would have been much worse", adding that his employment summit plan had been downgraded by seven Member States.
ALDE group leader Guy VERHOFSTADT (BE), asked Mr Barroso whether he agrees with Commissioner Neelie Kroes' position on German support for Opel. "I always support my Commissioners", said Mr Barroso, adding that he had given Ms Kroes his support in advance.
Greens/EFA, co-President Rebecca HARMS (DE), asked about the negotiations for Copenhagen and the EU's plans for a global agreement on emission reductions. "I hope that the European Council at the end of this month will come to a solid position", said Mr Barroso, adding that the Commission will fight for a strong proposal.
Michał Tomasz KAMIŃSKI (ECR, PL) asked about plans to strengthen the single market as a way out of the crisis. Mr Barroso pointed out that the single market had been listed as a high-priority issue in his guidelines, and said he would commission a report on ways to improve it.
Lothar BISKY (EUL/NGL, DE) noted that the Commission had called on Member States to cut their budget deficits, and asked whether public spending cuts could choke off the recovery. "At a certain moment, we have to come back to sustainability", said the President, adding that "we are preparing an exit strategy", but that it would not take effect before 2011. "This is a question of solidarity with future generations", he said.
Nigel FARAGE (EFD, UK) welcomed "a chance to hold the executive to account" and asked whether Tony Blair's position as a favourite for the Council Presidency of the Council was in exchange for his "surrender" on the British rebate. Mr Barroso denied that there was any such
"secret deal".
