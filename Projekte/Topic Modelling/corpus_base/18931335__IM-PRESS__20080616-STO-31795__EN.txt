MEPs supported Slovakia's euro ambitions Tuesday opened with a debate on the "return directive", which aims to establish norms across the EU for the amount of time illegal immigrants can be detained. The day also saw MEPs vote to back Slovakia's ambitions to join the euro. The proposed liberalisation of Europe's energy market through the "3rd energy package" was also on the agenda. This would separate production from supply in an effort to boost competition and allow consumers more choice.
Illegal immigration - 6 month detention agreed
Parliament voted Wednesday to support a compromise reached with EU ministers on illegal immigration that says 6 months should be the maximum immigrants can be detained. At present the period of time varies dramatically from one country to another.
During Tuesday's debate, Parliament's Rapporteur for the directive - German Christian Democrat Manfred Weber - assured the House that the legislation includes protection for "children and unaccompanied minors, access to health and education systems and the use of detention only when necessary". However, there were still concerns over human rights with French Socialist Martine Roure telling fellow MEPs that the compromise does not provide adequate protection of fundamental rights.
Bratislava braced for the Euro
Although a final decision falls to EU leaders meeting this week, MEPs approved Slovakia's ambition to become the 16th country to adopt the euro. A report on the issue by Maltese MEP David Casa (EPP-ED) said that although Slovakia met the criteria, care should be taken about the level of inflation. Equally it said that more efforts are needed to explain the benefits of the euro to citizens. It also called for prices of staple goods to be monitored to avoid unnecessary prices rise.
Reform of Europe's energy market
As oil prices rise to record levels, the reform of Europe's electricity market was on the agenda. The "3rd energy package" aims to liberalise the energy market by separating production from supply. In practical terms this would mean that state operators would have to give up their monopoly positions. Advocates say that it will lead to greater competition, more investment in infrastructure and that it could make the European Emissions Trading Scheme workable in the long term. MEPs vote Wednesday.
Wednesday afternoon, the House will debate the recent rise in oil prices. Watch all the debates live here on the Parliament's website.
