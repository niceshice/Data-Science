Petitions: a key tool for the European citizen
Petitions

Petitions to the European Parliament are a valuable tool which enables Europe's citizens to react if they believe EU laws have been infringed. But the Petitions Committee's 2009 annual report, adopted by Parliament on Tuesday, says an interactive petitions website is needed to improve awareness of what can and cannot be achieved through petitions.
Frequently-raised issues in petitions submitted in 2009 included freedom of movement, residence permits for non-EU family members, recognition of qualifications and the environment, says the annual report, which was drafted by Carlos Iturgaiz Angulo (EPP, ES).
Indeed, petitions from citizens who have difficulty exercising their right to free movement are on the increase. They often refer to the excessive time taken by host Member States to issue residence permits to third-country family members and difficulties in exercising voting rights or having qualifications recognised. Many other complaints last year were about environmental issues and commercial practices that are unfair to small businesses.
User-friendly, interactive petitions portal
Unfortunately, says the report, a growing number of the complaints submitted fall outside the EU's area of competence, such as calculating retirement benefits and enforcing national courts' decisions. In fact, 54% of the 1,924 petitions received by Parliament in 2009 had to be declared inadmissible.
To raise awareness of what can and cannot be achieved by submitting complaints to Parliament and to reach out more effectively to the public, MEPs call for the creation of a user-friendly, interactive petitions portal. They also propose setting up an electronic register through which citizens can lend support to, or withdraw their backing from, a petition.
Citizens' Initiative
The right of Citizens' Initiative, provided for under the Lisbon Treaty and due to be introduced soon, will enable members of the public to ask the European Commission to table a new draft law on an EU-related matter, provided it is backed by at least one million citizens from one third of the EU's Member States. Parliament points out that, once it is up and running, this procedure will help ensure "enhanced transparency and accountability in the EU decision-making process".
MEPs also recall that Parliament has already received campaign-type petitions bearing more than one million signatures. They stress the need to ensure that citizens are fully aware of the distinction between these petitions and Citizens' Initiatives. "Campaign" petitions set out concerns that existing EU laws may have been infringed, whereas Citizen's Initiatives will serve to propose new EU legislation.
Statistics
In 2009, Parliament received 1,924 petitions, slightly up on 2008 (1,849). About 46% of the complaints received last year were declared admissible, a very similar percentage to 2008. These petitions focused mainly on the environment (228 petitions), fundamental rights (164), justice (159) and the single market (142).
Most of petitions received in 2009 concerned the Union as a whole (403), followed by Germany (298), Spain (279), Italy (176) and Romania (143). German continues to be the most used language, with 548 petitions, followed by English (343), Spanish (237), Italian (203) and Polish (116). For the second year in a row, electronic petitions outnumbered those submitted by post.
