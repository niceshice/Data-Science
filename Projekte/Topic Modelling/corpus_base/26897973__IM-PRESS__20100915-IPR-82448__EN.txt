Leading MEPs of the EP Foreign Committee will decide Monday 20 September in Strasbourg who, among the 27 new Heads of EU Delegation appointed today by Catherine Ashton, will be invited to appear before the Committee in the coming weeks.
Before taking up their posts, EU Special Representatives and Heads of Delegations to countries and organisations which Parliament considers "strategically important" have to appear before the Foreign Affairs Committee, according to the deal reached on the External Action Service with the Council, the Commission and the High Representative and endorsed by Parliament last July.
Mondayâ€™s meeting will be neither webstreamed nor accessible to the media. The EP Press Service will provide an update on the decision.
