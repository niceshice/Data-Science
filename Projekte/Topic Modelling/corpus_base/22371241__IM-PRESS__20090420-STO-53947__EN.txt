The safe disposal of unused animal by-products and the plight of women in Afghanistan were also discussed.
There is a growing trend in the use of " e-money ", which is defined as storing cash in electronic form in online payment accounts or electronic gift vouchers. MEPs want to update existing legislation on e-money business to achieve a true single market, while allowing the industry to expand. The aim is to improve consumer confidence, allowing people to convert electronic credit into cash whenever they want, while also providing the monetary value of the credit anytime at their request.
Better electronic payment systems
MEPs approved a report by Lithuanian Margarita Starkevičiūtė (EPP-ED) that aims to facilitate electronic payments across different EU countries , particularly in the Euro zone through the principle of equal charges for corresponding domestic and cross-border payments and the development of cross-border direct debit schemes.
Animal by-products risk to health
Animal by-products are a risk to human health if not dealt with properly, according to German Christian Democrat Horst Schnellhardt, who drafted a report on the health and hygiene of by-products not intended for human consumption. "Animal by-products can be used elsewhere. Of course, will not resolve the issue of the rotten meat scandal 100%, but traceability is a step in the right direction. We need researchers and help."
In the traditional debate on human rights abuses around the world on the final day of the planery session, MEPs debated the situation of women in Afghanistan. In particular the instances of attacks on women, depriving them of the right to vote and treating them like chattels was deplored by Members. Other debates included s upport for the Special Court of Sierra Leone and the humanitarian situation of Camp Ashraf in Iraq
