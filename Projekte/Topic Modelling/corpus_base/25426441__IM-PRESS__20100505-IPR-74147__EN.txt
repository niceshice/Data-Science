Every EU household should have access to broadband Internet at a competitive price by 2013 and be trained in the skills needed to participate fully in the new digital society, argues a resolution adopted by Parliament on Wednesday. MEPs call for specific, measurable targets and a regular review of the 2015.eu strategy's achievements, including the goal of ensuring that 75% of mobile subscribers are 3G users by 2015.
Parliament urges the Commission "to come forward with a proposal for an ambitious digital agenda and action plan enabling Europe to progress towards an open and prosperous digital society". Commitment will be needed at all political levels to make a success of the Digital Agenda for Europe: 2015.eu, says today's resolution, drafted by Pilar del Castillo Vera (EPP, ES), which was approved by a large majority.
Citizens and consumers at the heart of the strategy
MEPs want high-speed access and digital skills for all, including disadvantaged members of the population (the elderly, the disabled and those on low incomes) and people living in rural and remote regions. They believe 50% of EU households should be connected to very high-speed networks by 2015 and 100% by 2020 and that "all primary and secondary schools must have reliable, quality Internet connections by 2013 and very high-speed Internet connections by 2015". In addition, "ICT training and e-learning should become an integral part of lifelong learning activities, enabling better and accessible education and training programmes".
A clear legal framework laying down the rights and duties of citizens while protecting personal data is essential, says the resolution. Preserving "a fair balance between the right-holders’ rights and the general public’s access to content and knowledge" is also crucial. Minors and young adults need special protection, say MEPs, and action is needed to improve digital security.
A single competitive digital market
Parliament emphasises the need to accelerate the harmonised deployment of the digital dividend spectrum in a non-discriminatory manner. It adds that the EU must remain the ‘mobile continent’ in the world and seek to remove barriers to cross-border online trade.
