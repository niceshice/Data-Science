It is the European Commission's initial proposal of 18 weeks' maternity leave, and not Parliament's counter-proposal of 20 weeks, that will serve as a basis for further negotiations, announced the Belgian Presidency at Monday's Council meeting, the first to discuss the issue since Parliament's vote. This shows that the Council "didn't fully understand Parliament's role within the provisions of the Lisbon Treaty", commented rapporteur Edite Estrela (S&D, PT).
"I regret that some Member States expressed a disrespectful position towards the European Parliament. When they implied that the only basis for a possible compromise is the European Commissions' proposal, somehow it showed they didn't fully understand the role of the Parliament within the provisions of the Lisbon Treaty. Neither did they take into consideration the large majority reached in the Parliament", commented rapporteur Edite Estrela (S&D, PT).
"However, I would like to thank the Belgian Presidency of the EU, and the representatives of the following (Hungarian) Presidency, for the commitment, determination and the efforts shown in order to work towards an agreement with the European Parliament. As Parliament's rapporteur, I would like to reiterate my availability to work together with the Council in order to reach an agreement which will fulfil the needs of European families and of the European economy", she added.
On 20 October, Parliament amended the Commission's initial proposal to provide 20 weeks' maternity leave on full pay and introduce 2 weeks' paternity leave, and also added provisions banning discrimination of pregnant workers and protecting the health and safety of pregnant women at work.
Next steps
The Belgian Presidency announced that before the end of the year, it would table recommendations on how to proceed.
