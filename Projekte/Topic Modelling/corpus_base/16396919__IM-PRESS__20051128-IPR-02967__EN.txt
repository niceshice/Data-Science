MEPs underline their powers on the EU budget for 2007 - 2013
Budget
2005-12-01 - 12:47
In adopting an own initiative report on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure, Parliament reminds the Council that there will be no Financial Perspective and no Interinstitutional Agreement without an agreement between the European Parliament and the Council. The House also recalls that since it adopted its negotiating position on 8 June 2005 in due time, it will reject any attempt to hold it responsible for any delay in reaching agreement.
MEPs also tress that there will be no Financial Perspective without an agreement on a revised Interinstitutional Agreement on the budgetary procedure. Nevertheless, Parliament confirms their will to make all efforts to find an agreement on the next Financial Perspective.
Finally, the House reminds the Council that in absence of a financial framework 2007-2013 and a new Interinstitutional Agreement the financial needs of the European Union including for multi-annual programmes can be ensured in other ways which would mean a complex annual budgetary procedure.
