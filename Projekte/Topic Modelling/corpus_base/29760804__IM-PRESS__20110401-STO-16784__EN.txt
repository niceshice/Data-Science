Bill Gates talks aid with Development Committee MEPs The fight against poverty and disease was in the spotlight Tuesday when Microsoft founder and major private aid donor Bill Gates was in Parliament's Development Committee to present his Living Proof initiative, aimed at showing what can really be achieved by development aid. Private philanthropy versus government aid was one issue discussed.
"Millions of lives can be saved each year," the founder of the Gates Foundation said. "The bottom line is that the aid community makes a difference and there are opportunities to do more."
Helping poor farmers to feed their communities, raising income and nutrition levels, enabling children to go to school are at the core of Gates's initiative. His campaign "Living Proof" also distributes vaccines, cutting HIV/AIDS-related deaths and mother-to-child HIV transmissions. Health is the key, he told MEPs, "better health conditions can address all the other issues that we wanted to improve".
Mr Gates said agriculture is a fundamental target area. "If we can help farmers to be more productive, we not only help them but also deal with the challenge that the world needs more food."
Development Committee members were curious about how philanthropy works in relation to government aid. "Even if you want to maximise philanthropy, it will not phase out aid from rich governments," he said.
Mr Gates thanked Europeans for their "incredible generosity", as the world's largest aid donor and said, "every country should do best it can."
However, he said that a lot of aid isn't properly targeted. But, "we are learning to be smarter about aid spending," he added.
In response to a question from an MEP about being sure big donations go to the right people, Mr Gates said, "some money will be misused (but)...less than 5%". He said it is possible to track investment, for example, "if you send money for vaccines, you can see if children are actually getting them".
Later, Mr Gates met EP President Jerzy Buzek and Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.
