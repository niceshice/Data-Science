Airport slots: MEPs agree to suspend the "use it or lose it" rule

Airline companies hit by the economic slowdown will benefit from relaxed rules on the allocation of airport slots, allowing them not to lose unused slots, according to a draft Regulation adopted by the Transport Committee on Wednesday evening (22/04).
Air carriers will be entitled to the same series of slots during the summer 2010 scheduling season as were allocated to them during the summer 2009 season, even if they use them less than 80% of the time this year, according to the draft Regulation revising rules laid out by the EU in 1993 (Regulation EEC No 95/93.)
MEPs will meet with Council and Commission representatives Thursday morning (23/04) to try and close the deal, for final approval at the next plenary session in May.
The global economic crisis led to a significant reduction in air traffic over the winter 2008/09 scheduling season. More than 80% of European airports have seen a reduction in traffic since the beginning of the year and the summer season is expected to confirm this negative trend, with Eurocontrol forecasting a 4.9% fall in the number of flights.
The revised rules were therefore proposed by the Commission in March as an urgent measure to prevent airline companies from suffering the consequences in 2010 of their under-use of slots in 2009.
Future revisions of the rules
Transport Committee MEPs approved the Commission's proposal for the 2009 season, but refused to allow use of the "comitology" procedure - which would delegate decisions to the Commission without requiring new co-decision legislation - for future revisions of the rules.
Airline slots are allocated to companies each season (in November for the following summer season and in June for the following winter season) at the IATA (International Air Transport Association) scheduling conferences. They grant airports the right to schedule a landing or departure during a specific time period.
MEPs agreed that s hould the economic situation of airlines continue to deteriorate during the winter 2009/10 season, the Commission may propose to renew all or part of these arrangements for winter 2010/11. They also insisted that the Commission would have to draw up a revised framework Regulation to determine future slot allocations. Parliament would then be called upon again to amend and adopt the revised Regulation.
Network airlines in favour, airports and low-cost companies critical
Representatives of network airlines, consulted by Parliament's rapporteur and Chairman of the Transport Committee, Paolo Costa (IT, ALDE), said the suspension of the "use it or lose it" rule is absolutely necessary in light of the sharp drop in demand. Airlines should not be forced to maintain operations at an uneconomical level in order to protect the slots, they told the rapporteur. Airline representatives also pointed out that the proposal would prevent European airlines, for which there have been no bail-outs, from losing slots to major competitors in China, India and Japan, who benefit from substantial state aids.
European airports reply that the proposed rules are anti-competitive, as they would create a barrier to efficient airlines wantint to enter the market. They told MEPs that there are many airlines waiting to take up slots at all major airports in Europe. The proposed measure would prevent airports from using scarce capacity in the most efficient way, they said.
Representatives of low-cost carriers, also severely hit by the crisis, expressed their fears that the measures will lead to fewer flights and higher ticket prices for consumers.
