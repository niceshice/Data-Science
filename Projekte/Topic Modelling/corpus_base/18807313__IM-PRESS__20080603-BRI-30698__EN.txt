Opening of the Brussels plenary session - 20th anniversary of Lithuanian freedom movement and Green Week
In his announcements at the start of the June Brussels plenary session, EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering congratulated Lithuania on their 20th anniversary of the Sąjūdis liberation movement, which had led to the liberation of the country from the Soviet Union. The President then drew attention to the forthcoming Green Week at the European Parliament in Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg, underlining the EP's plans to reduce its CO2 emissions by 30% by 2020.
Co-operation with the Mediterranean: Fresh impetus and concrete projects needed for Barcelona process
MEPs support the "fresh political and practical impetus" given to the revised Barcelona process in order to raise its profile and highlight its tangible benefits for citizens and, in particular, for citizens on the southern shore of the Mediterranean but ask that concrete projects such as solar electricity and water desalination are promoted. The Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly (EMPA) should become the parliamentary dimension of the Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean.
Lisbon Treaty at the heart of reports on CFSP and ESDP
The impact of the Lisbon Treaty on the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and its European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) was at the core of two reports voted in the European Parliament on Thursday (5 June). While pointing to the increased effectiveness the new Treaty could give to the EU's foreign policy, the reports also pointed to the need for increased parliamentary scrutiny and democratic legitimacy of these policies.
European Parliament looks forward working with new US President
In adopting a joint resolution on EU-USA relations ahead of a key summit on 9-10 June, MEPs looks forward, in the light of the forthcoming US presidential election, to working with the new US President and hopes for a strengthened US commitment to multilateralism and to peace and democracy worldwide. MEPs are also of the view that the US plan to establish an anti-missile system in Europe at this time may hamper international disarmament efforts.
Russia should revoke official ties with Abkhazia, and withdraw additional troops from the region, says EP resolution
After a debate on Georgia, held on 7 May in Strasbourg, Parliament adopted a resolution on the situation in the country. The Parliament "expresses its deep disapproval at Russia’s announcement that it would establish official ties with institutions within the separatist authorities of South Ossetia and Abkhazia," says the resolution adopted by a large majority of MEPs (581 votes in favour, 50 against and 17abstentions) calling on Russia to "revoke this decision."
More choice and lower costs for bank customers
Consumers should have more choice in, and pay less for, banking and financial services. This could be achieved in part by removing the obstacles to cross-border products, according to MEPs. One way to do this is to reduce the differences between national regulations. Parliament also stresses the importance of improving financial literacy among consumers. Parliament adopted two own-initiative reports, one from Othmar KARAS (EPP-ED, AT), reacting to a Commission green paper on retail financial services, and one from Gianni PITTELLA (PES, IT), which responds to the Commission’s inquiry into competition in retail banking.
High food safety standards but flexibility for micro-enterprises
The European Parliament wants to guarantee the highest possible food hygiene safety while giving flexibility to exempt especially micro-enterprises from certain obligations under the food hygiene regulation concerning the HACCP - system (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point), a system to ensure and to control the EU food hygiene rules. According to the rapporteur Horst SCHNELLHARDT (EPP-ED, DE), the report makes a contribution to cutting red tape without lowering the very high EU hygiene standards. It needs to ensure that the flexibility built in the regulation becomes a reality. He calls for an easing of the administrative burden for SMEs while making sure that the food hygiene is respected. Parliament, he said, must sent the signal right now to clarify that it has the will to roll back bureaucracy and make life easier for SMEs in Europe, without diluting hygiene standards.
Coach drivers will be able to work up to 12 consecutive days under strict conditions say MEPs
Parliament adopted a legislative report on common rules for access to the market for coach and bus which would allow drivers of tourist coaches from 1 January 2009 to work up to 12 consecutive days under certain strict conditions. The conditions on the 12-day rule were put forward by the European Parliament after reaching agreement with the social partners. The report was adopted with 587 votes in favour 54 against and 6 abstentions.
Young farmers need more incentives say MEPs
The European Parliament adopted an own initiative report by Donato Tommaso VERALDI (ALDE, IT), calling on the EU to boost its incentives for young farmers with a view to effect generation change and make the agro-food sector more dynamic. The report was adopted with 571 votes in favour, 31 against and 39 abstentions.
Work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2007
Parliament adopted an own-initiative report on behalf of the Development Committee on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2007. The report welcomes the fact that in 2007 the Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) provided a framework for an open, democratic and in-depth dialogue on the negotiation of EPAs between the European Union and the ACP countries, as shown by the adoption of the Kigali Declaration on development-friendly EPAs.
Protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems
MEPs adopted a report on the protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems in the high seas from the adverse impacts of bottom fishing gears, which is a priority of the Slovenian Council Presidency in the fisheries sector. While welcoming the Commission proposal, rapporteur, Duarte FREITAS (EPP-ED, PT) put forward a number of amendments which he considered to be important for the general balance of the regulation.
Community system against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing
Parliament adopted a non-binding report on the proposal for a regulation establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. MEPs adopted several amendments concerning the Community list of IUU fishing vessels, the inspections to be carried out and the sanctions and other measures to be imposed by Member States. The report was adopted with 624 votes in favour, 12 against and 8 abstentions. 20080603BRI30698

Opening of the Brussels plenary session - 20th anniversary of Lithuanian freedom movement and Green Week
2008-06-09 - 11:17
In his announcements at the start of the June Brussels plenary session, EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering highlighted the anniversary of Lithuania's liberation movement as well as the European Parliament's plans for cutting its own CO2 emissions. Mr Pöttering opened by congratulating Lithuania on the 20th anniversary of the Sąjūdis liberation movement, which had led to the liberation of the country from the Soviet Union.
The president then drew attention to the forthcoming Green Week at the European Parliament in Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg, underlining the EP's plans to reduce its CO2 emissions by 30% by 2020.
He warmly welcomed Archbishop Galaktion of Bulgaria as well as a number of recent winners of European prizes for youth and European integration, and lastly a 10-member delegation from Navarre, Spain, all of whom were present in the public galleries.
One minor change to the agenda was announced: the debates on the Aubert and Freitas reports (both on fisheries) would take place slightly later than scheduled, after the debate on retail financial services.

Co-operation with the Mediterranean: Fresh impetus and concrete projects needed for Barcelona process
2008-06-09 - 11:17
MEPs support the "fresh political and practical impetus" given to the revised Barcelona process in order to raise its profile and highlight its tangible benefits for citizens and, in particular, for citizens on the southern shore of the Mediterranean but ask that concrete projects such as solar electricity and water desalination are promoted. The Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly (EMPA) should become the parliamentary dimension of the Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean. MEPs support the development of the Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean as "a consolidation of the Euro-Mediterranean area". This process should lead to a strong partnership in foreign and security policy. On human rights, the resolution says that the Euro-Mediterranean partnership has not yet led to the expected results in this area.
The Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly (EMPA) should become an integral part of the institutional framework of the Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean, as its "parliamentary dimension". EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering chairs the EMPA until March 2009.
The EMPA is the only parliamentary assembly uniting the 27 EU Member States and all the parties involved in the Middle East peace process. As a consultative body, the EMPA should have the right to make "proposals" and "evaluations".
Co-presidency and secretariat
The proposal to establish a co-presidency of the Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean at head of State and Government and at foreign minister level is welcomed.
Concerning the Southern branch of the presidency, the resolution says that it should be nominated "by consensus of the Southern partners". The country holding the presidency should invite all the states participating at the Barcelona Process.
The new secretariat should make the Barcelona Process "more visible on the ground" according to MEPs. It should be concentrated on projects such as sea motorways, the intercommunion of the Arab Maghreb motorway (AMA), the de-pollution of the Mediterranean and a Mediterranean Solar Plan.
The resolution welcomes the proposal to organise every two years, summit meetings. The EMPA should be "fully involved" in the preparation and proceedings of these summits. The proposal to establish a Joint Permanent Committee, based in Brussels, of appointed representatives from all the participants in the Barcelona Process is also supported.
The projects under the Barcelona Process should be open to all EU states and Mediterranean partners interested to participate. MEPs ask the Commission to inform on a regular basis the EP and the EMPA on the development of these regional projects and to consider the proposals and evaluations submitted at parliamentary level.
The EU Mediterranean partnership cannot focus "solely" on economic and trade issues. The third pillar meant to contribute to "peace, stability and prosperity" and the project of a Charter for Peace and Stability have not made significant progress, says MEPs.
The resolution recalls the proposal for the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Development Bank capable of attracting direct foreign investments and reaffirms the necessity to strengthen the status of women in the Mediterranean region.
The Commission's proposals will have to be endorsed by the June European Council (19-20 June) before the official launch of the Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean at the Paris Summit on 13 July. The EMPA Bureau will meet in Paris on 12 July.

Lisbon Treaty at the heart of reports on CFSP and ESDP
2008-06-09 - 11:17
The impact of the Lisbon Treaty on the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and its European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) was at the core of two reports voted in the European Parliament on Thursday (5 June). While pointing to the increased effectiveness the new Treaty could give to the EU's foreign policy, the reports also pointed to the need for increased parliamentary scrutiny and democratic legitimacy of these policies. The own-initiative report by Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Jacek Saryusz-Wolski (EPP-ED, PL) on the Council's 2006 Annual Report on CFSP points out that "the future office of High Representative/Vice-President of the Commission will derive its legitimacy directly from the European Parliament." It also stresses the need for "transparency and democratic input" into the process of setting up the planned European External Action Service (EEAS), and calls for a mechanism to be set up to provide confidential information to select Foreign Affairs Committee Members. Finally, it notes that "further efforts are needed in order to streamline the decision-making process as regards foreign policy with a view to overcoming the veto power and introducing qualified majority voting."
Energy security and the EU's neighbourhood high on the agenda
The report considers that "stability in the Western Balkans should be the top priority for the EU in 2008." It says the "dialogue with Serbia should be intensified" to take concrete steps, for example on visa liberalisation, and considers that the EU should "initiate appropriate processes in order to avoid Serbia's isolation." MEPs also said the "EULEX mission in Kosovo must safeguard the interests of national minorities," and voice their concern at the stalemate in transferring responsibilities from UNMIK to EULEX in Kosovo.
The report "is of the view that the importance of the foreign policy dimensions of energy security [...] will continue increasing," and calls for diversification of supply, increase in energy efficiency and EU solidarity, while also deploring "the uncoordinated signing of bilateral energy agreements by Member States." In addition, Members note that strengthening the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) should be a "main objective for 2008," especially in three key regional cooperation areas: the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea, the latter two of which should be "assured by finding new organisational structures for regional cooperation."
Russia and China
The House "considers the review in 2008 by the Union of its relations with Russia as very important," and asks Member States to "coordinate relations with the Russian Federation on the basis of the Union's common interests." The report recommends that "political and economic relations with China be deepened in 2008, on condition that substantial progress be made in the field of democracy and human rights, and that China heed the EU's grave concerns about its conduct in Tibet."
European Security Strategy and European Security and Defence Policy
Helmut Kuhne's (PES, DE) own-initiative report on the implementation of the European Security Strategy (ESS) and the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) calls on the High Representative to "assess in a White Paper the progress made, and any shortcomings, in the implementation of the ESS since 2003," and to "include in that White Paper proposals for improving and complementing the ESS." The House adds that a future assessment of the ESS "has to be carried out with greater democratic accountability and therefore be made in close consultation" with the Parliament. Members also stressed the need to "have a European Parliament position available before an ESDP operation," to add democratic legitimacy to EU military operations.
Battle Groups, EUROCORPS, and a European Peace Corps
The report deplores the fact that partly due to "narrowly defined terms of deployment," the Battle Group concept has "not solved the force generation problem for concrete operations." It therefore calls for urgent clarification of the Battle Group concept. The House "proposes to place EUROCORPS as a standing force under EU command and invites all Member States to contribute to it." In addition, MEPs call on the Council and Commission to "establish an EU Civil Peace Corps for crisis management and conflict prevention." Finally, an idea to urge the Council to "examine options for the setting up of an integrated civil-military 'Human Security Response Force' to carry out human security operations" was voted down by a significant majority of MEPs (418-205-7).
Non-proliferation and weapons exports
The report reiterates Parliament's long-standing position that it "finds it embarrassing that, despite the fact that the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports will celebrate its tenth anniversary in 2008, it is not yet legally binding, and uncontrolled arms exports from EU Member States seem to be continuing without much hindrance." Members also call for Europe to be made a "nuclear-weapon-free zone," and for a "global convention banning nuclear weapons." The House is also of the view that "the US plan to establish an anti-missile system in Europe at this time may hamper international disarmament efforts." With regard to the specific case of Iran, the report "reaffirms that the proliferation risks attaching to the Iranian nuclear programme remain a source of serious concern to the EU and the international community."

European Parliament looks forward working with new US President
2008-06-09 - 11:17
In adopting a joint resolution on EU-USA relations ahead of a key summit on 9-10 June, MEPs looks forward, in the light of the forthcoming US presidential election, to working with the new US President and hopes for a strengthened US commitment to multilateralism and to peace and democracy worldwide. MEPs are also of the view that the US plan to establish an anti-missile system in Europe at this time may hamper international disarmament efforts. MEPs are aware that on some subjects, such as the International Criminal Court and the Kyoto Climate Change Protocol, transatlantic differences of approach still persist. The House hopes that the next President of the United States engages his Administration in solving these problems.
The resolution was adopted with 552 votes in favour 68 against and 23 abstentions.
Climate change
The European Parliament urges the US to do its utmost to wrap up work on its domestic climate legislation by the December 2009 UN conference in Copenhagen. The House also invites the US to persist in its efforts to establish a carbon trading system that in the future could be linked with the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) since both the environment and industry generally will be best served if the emerging carbon market mechanisms throughout the world are compatible and interoperable.
Parliament welcomes, therefore, the provision in the EU ETS draft proposals to allow linking up to other mandatory cap-and-trade systems, including sub-national systems. In this context, the House is encouraged by the emergence of regional carbon trade systems within the US.
Guantánamo Bay
The House is concerned that the very existence of the Guantánamo Bay detention centre and the practice of extraordinary arrests and renditions continues to send out a negative signal as to how the fight against terrorism is being pursued. Parliament urges the Council to issue a clear and forceful declaration calling on the US Government to put an end to the practice of arbitrary arrests and extraordinary renditions and to request the United States Government to try or else release the remaining detainees and to resettle and compensate them in full compliance with international law and standards and to give clarifications regarding the existence of secret prisons outside US territory.
Extraordinary renditions
The European Parliament urges the Council and the US Government to issue a clear and forceful joint declaration to put an end to the practice of arbitrary arrests and extraordinary renditions and requests the US Government to try or else release the remaining detainees in full compliance with international law and standards and to give clarifications regarding the existence of secret prisons outside US territory.
Anti-missile system
MEPs are of the view that the US plan to establish an anti-missile system in Europe at this time may hamper international disarmament efforts.
Nuclear proliferation, missile defence, arms control and NATO
Parliament welcomes the close cooperation between the EU and the US on the Iranian nuclear issue leading, on 3 March 2008, to the adoption by the UNSC of Resolution 1803, which imposes new sanctions on Iran. The House calls on the US, following its diplomatic success in the negotiations with North Korea, to participate directly in negotiations with Iran along with the EU, since the US is in a position to offer additional security guarantees which take account of Iran's security concerns; stresses the importance of cooperation with the US, Russia, China and non-aligned countries with a view to considering complementary concepts aimed at achieving a comprehensive agreement with Iran on its nuclear facilities and their use.

Russia should revoke official ties with Abkhazia, and withdraw additional troops from the region, says EP resolution
2008-06-09 - 11:17
After a debate on Georgia, held on 7 May in Strasbourg, Parliament adopted a resolution on the situation in the country. The Parliament "expresses its deep disapproval at Russia’s announcement that it would establish official ties with institutions within the separatist authorities of South Ossetia and Abkhazia," says the resolution adopted by a large majority of MEPs (581 votes in favour, 50 against and 17abstentions) calling on Russia to "revoke this decision." The resolution "urges the Russian Federation to immediately withdraw its additional troops in Abkhazia," and "takes the view that the present peacekeeping format must be revised since the Russian troops have lost their role of neutral and impartial peacekeepers." It therefore "calls on the Council to consider bolstering the international presence in the conflict zone by sending an ESDP border mission" to the region.
Message to Council: visa facilitation and frankness with Russia
The House calls on the Council and the Commission to "firmly raise the issues of Abkhazia and South Ossetia with their Russian counterparts at the forthcoming EU-Russia summit," which is to be held on 26-27 June. It also asks that they "speed up the opening of negotiations on the EU-Georgia visa regime in order to conclude the visa facilitation and readmission agreements with Georgia in the near future to ensure that citizens of Georgia are not disadvantaged in relation to those holding Russian passports in the separatist regions."
A mixed review of Georgian elections
MEPs take note of the parliamentary elections held in Georgia on 21 May, noting "that overall the election day was calm and generally was assessed positively and that substantial progress has been made since the January presidential elections." Nevertheless, they also stress that "further efforts have to be made in close cooperation with the international community in order to address and solve all the problems identified in the electoral process caused by the inconsistent and incomplete implementation of the OSCE and Council of Europe standards, and to improve and consolidate Georgia’s democratic achievements." They therefore call on Georgian authorities to "deal with all complaints about the electoral process in a transparent manner and to work on further improvement so that trust and confidence in the electoral process can increase further."
British speakers in the debate on 7 May 2008
Speaking in the debate on 7 May Charles TANNOCK (EPP-ED, UK) said: "A flood of petrodollars is making Russia a resurgent power but, regrettably, it sees everything in zero-sum terms. Putin’s foreign policy priority – to reconstruct something looking like the old Soviet Union – has been focused on what Russia patronisingly refers to as its ‘near abroad’ – the former Soviet Republics in the Baltics, Eastern Europe and the South Caucasus, where Russia is determined to retain its sphere of influence. They are being punished for looking westwards towards NATO and the EU, rather than towards Moscow.
Georgia, under the Western-oriented reformist President Saakashvili, has suffered considerably from Russia’s heavy-handedness. Aside from using trade and energy supplies as diplomatic weapons, Putin has consistently sought to undermine Georgia’s territorial integrity through tacit support for the breakaway, self-styled republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The arrival of yet more Russian soldiers in Abkhazia – supposedly as peacekeepers but undoubtedly combat ready – and the shooting down of a Georgian drone recently has provocatively increased tension in the region."
Robert EVANS (PES, UK) said: "Russia has never accepted the territorial integrity of Georgia with respect to Abkhazia or South Ossetia. We know from what we have heard in recent weeks that Russian and Abkhazian separatists have apparently been involved in the spy plane incidents which have led to this rise in tension and we must all recognise that one thing has led on to another." Mr Evans expressed concern that the European Union is not doing enough to stop this escalating violence. "Do nothing and the whole area could dissolve into a war – a war which no one will win."
So my message this afternoon – not just to this Parliament, but to Mr Lenarčič for the Council and, indeed, to Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner – is to do everything within your means, at the highest level, to ensure that everyone, above all the Russians, understands how dangerous the moves are that are taking place in this area and that we have got to stop this escalation before we have another Balkan crisis.

Economic and monetary affairs
More choice and lower costs for bank customers
2008-06-09 - 11:17
Consumers should have more choice in, and pay less for, banking and financial services. This could be achieved in part by removing the obstacles to cross-border products, according to MEPs. One way to do this is to reduce the differences between national regulations. Parliament also stresses the importance of improving financial literacy among consumers. Parliament adopted two own-initiative reports, one from Othmar KARAS (EPP-ED, AT), reacting to a Commission green paper on retail financial services, and one from Gianni PITTELLA (PES, IT), which responds to the Commission’s inquiry into competition in retail banking.
The goal: tangible benefits for consumers
According to the Karas report, the aim is to deliver tangible benefits for consumers by securing greater choice and lower prices, enhancing consumer confidence and empowering consumers. Given the need for a secure environment for both bank and customer, and believing that cross border activity is crucial to increase competition 6, Parliament calls for an approach of “targeted full harmonisation” to the regulatory framework: i.e. making essential elements of the rules equal in all Member States, while applying mutual recognition to the rest. There is also the possibility of a “28th regime” of EU regulation specifically to cover cross-border products, which the report says is worth careful study.
“Same risk, same rules”
Real and fair competition can arise only if there is a level playing field, with regulators applying the “same risk, same rules” approach to different businesses, but this does not mean adopting a “one-size-fits-all” approach. What is needed is comparable transparency and disclosure requirements, especially at the point of sale.
Financial literacy
While legislation should aim for very high standards of consumer protection, all players should take steps to improve financial literacy at all levels, including the basic principle that a higher return usually means a higher risk.
Fragmented regulation a barrier to cross-border activity
Given the closely related topic, some of the same ground is covered by the Pittella report, which also highlights the obstacles caused to cross-border banking by a fragmented regulatory approach and highlights money laundering regulations as being one area that needs to be examined.
Changing banks: a seamless process ?
When customers want to change banks, says the report, there should be no disruption as they close on account and open another. Charges applied for closing an account should only be those which are “fully justified.” MEPs emphasise, moreover, that access to basic banking services is a right for all.
Common standards on information
The report says there should be a comparable system in all Member States by which banks set out for customers opening an account the costs and charges they impose. If the industry does not act on this issue, legislation may be needed.
Banks need to have access to fraud and credit checking data across borders, but with proper safeguards for consumer data protection.
Pluralism in types of provider
MEPs stress the importance of pluralism in types of service provider in banking. They also want the Commission to check that the Single European Payments Area project does not reduce competition in payment settlement services.
Interbank charges
The report also calls for an examination of the different types of inter-bank charges, for credit cards, cash machine withdrawals and other payments. It says the Commission should establish agreed criteria on what is allowed by competition rules in this area, ensuring a level playing field.

Coach drivers will be able to work up to 12 consecutive days under strict conditions say MEPs
2008-06-09 - 11:17
Parliament adopted a legislative report on common rules for access to the market for coach and bus which would allow drivers of tourist coaches from 1 January 2009 to work up to 12 consecutive days under certain strict conditions. The conditions on the 12-day rule were put forward by the European Parliament after reaching agreement with the social partners. The report was adopted with 587 votes in favour 54 against and 6 abstentions. MEPs point out that the aim of the legislation, among others, is to encourage coach tours specifically for tourists on low incomes and promote tourism in the regions there is a need to re-introduce the 12-day rule for round trips by coach.
The House saw an amendment tabled by the EPP-ED, PES, and ALDE adopted, which incorporates the agreement with the social partners into the new legislation. The agreement contains a range of joint requirements that would have to be observed by any driver carrying out an occasional international transport service that involves use of the 12-day derogation. It contains a complete set of joint requirements that would have to be observed by any driver that involves use of the 12-day derogation.
Parliament make it clear that in the case of driving that takes place during the entire period from 10pm to 6am, the vehicle shall be double manned throughout or the driving period referred to in Article 7 shall be reduced to 3 hours.
Parliament also says that Member States may refrain from applying the authorisation procedure to cross-border regular services not extending more than 50 km beyond the border. They should inform the Commission and neighbouring countries thereof.
On Wednesday 22 May 2008 in Strasbourg, Parliament decided to postpone the vote on this report until today in order to reach an agreement with the social partners.
Entry into force 1 January 2009
The legislation will enter into force on 1 January 2009, provided that the Council of Transport Ministers agrees with the EP proposals at its next meeting on 13 June. Text, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 5 June)

High food safety standards but flexibility for micro-enterprises
2008-06-09 - 11:17
The European Parliament wants to guarantee the highest possible food hygiene safety while giving flexibility to exempt especially micro-enterprises from certain obligations under the food hygiene regulation concerning the HACCP - system (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point), a system to ensure and to control the EU food hygiene rules. • The proposal is part of the better regulation strategy to reduce administrative burden (fast track procedure package). The proposal amends the Regulation on the hygiene of foodstuffs from 2004.
• The Commission proposes to exempt small food businesses from the requirement to putting in place, implementing and maintaining a permanent procedure or procedures based on the hazard analysis and critical control points ("HACCP") principles. This exemption should apply to micro-enterprises that are predominantly selling food directly to the final consumer.
• The European Parliament adopted 2 amendments, calling national authorities to allow for more flexibility in particular in relation to micro-enterprises.
For the European Parliament it is important that the high European level of food safety will not be reduced by generally excluding all micro-enterprises from the food hygiene principles. The two amendments adopted introduce more flexibility while giving the national authorities more room to decide whether micro - or even medium sized companies should adhere to or be exempted from the HACCP procedures. Their decision shall be taken on the basis of a regular hazard analysis and not only on the basis of the size of the company, as proposed by the Commission.
According to the rapporteur Horst SCHNELLHARDT (EPP-ED, DE) the report makes a contribution to cutting red tape without lowering the very high EU hygiene standards. It needs to ensure that the flexibility built in the regulation becomes a reality. He calls for an easing of the administrative burden for SMEs while making sure that the food hygiene is respected. Parliament, he said, must sent the signal right now to clarify that it has the will to roll back bureaucracy and make life easier for SMEs in Europe, without diluting hygiene standards.
Background/procedure :
• The HACCP system is an internationally recognised and recommended system of food safety management. It focuses on identifying the‘ critical points’ in a process where food safety problems (or ‘hazards’) could arise and putting steps in place to prevent things going wrong
• Over 99% of all enterprises in Europe are SMEs, 90% of SMEs are actually micro-enterprises (less than 10 employees) and the average company has just five workers. However, these micro-enterprises account for 53% of all jobs in Europe, so their importance to the European economy is enormous. Text, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 5 June)

Young farmers need more incentives say MEPs
2008-06-09 - 11:17
The European Parliament adopted an own initiative report by Donato Tommaso VERALDI (ALDE, IT), calling on the EU to boost its incentives for young farmers with a view to effect generation change and make the agro-food sector more dynamic. The report was adopted with 571 votes in favour, 31 against and 39 abstentions. In recent years there has been a trend towards the depopulation of rural areas in the EU, which is more marked in remote areas, together with a steady ageing of the rural population. More than 50% of EU holdings are run by farmers over the age of 55, and 25% by farmers over the age of 65.
However, farms run by young people are, on average, more profitable and young farmers are more willing to adopt innovative solutions, use environment-friendly farming methods and adjust to market requirements. MEPs feel the "health check" of the CAP is a good opportunity to tackle the issue.
Therefore, the report drafted by Donato Tommaso VERALDI (ALDE, IT) on the future of young farmers under the ongoing reform of the CAP calls on the EU to boost its incentives for young farmers and remove obstacles to their settlement, making the sector more attractive to young people. These incentives include:
• improving setting-up support as these policies no longer meet farmers' needs or reflect the difficulties involved in taking over / setting up in problem farming areas;
• solving high indebtedness and credit access problems which makes it difficult for young farmers to establish a good competitive position;
• facilitating succession and land policy measures including facilitating succession arrangements for non-family members and looking into the "considerable increase in land prices"; and
• improving training and access to research by, for example, increasing support for lifelong training for farmers and improving farmers' access to research findings and the latest innovations relating to production methods and tools.
UK and Ireland
In 2005 young farmers (under the age of 35) in the UK represented 5.6% of the total farming workforce and in Ireland they represented 10.5%. The EU average was 8.3%. In 1995, the proportion of young farmers in the total farming workforce was significantly higher, representing approximately 10% in the UK and 14% in Ireland.
Pilot programme for developing countries
Lastly, the House calls for the elaboration of a pilot project to facilitate an exchange programme between young farmers in developing countries and young farmers in the EU to enable them to gain firsthand understanding of the functioning of their respective markets, of their respective use of technology and their methods of adapting to the prevailing climatic conditions.

Development and cooperation
Work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2007
2008-06-09 - 11:17
Parliament adopted an own-initiative report on behalf of the Development Committee on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2007. The report welcomes the fact that in 2007 the Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) provided a framework for an open, democratic and in-depth dialogue on the negotiation of EPAs between the European Union and the ACP countries, as shown by the adoption of the Kigali Declaration on development-friendly EPAs. The House stresses the concerns expressed by the JPA over several aspects of the negotiations, with regard to both form and substance and points out that the debate is continuing since the adoption of EPAs with the Caribbean and interim agreements with certain countries and regions.
MEPs call on the parliaments of the ACP countries to demand that their governments and the Commission involve them in the process relating to the preparation and implementation of the Country Strategy Papers concerning cooperation between the European Union and their country (period 2008-2013).
The report calls on the Commission to supply all available information to the parliaments of the ACP countries and to provide them with assistance in this work of democratic control, in particular by supporting their capacities.
Darfur and Congo
The report considers that the JPA resolution on the situation in Darfur, adopted in Wiesbaden on 28 June 2007 and the JPA resolution on the situation in Congo, in Kigali on 22 November 2007, are significant examples of this enhanced dialogue.
Parliament considers that the JPA, a forum for debate between European and ACP parliamentarians, plays a positive role in political dialogue and in the quest for a global, inclusive agreement for peace and development for the people of Darfur.

Protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems
2008-06-09 - 11:17
MEPs adopted a report on the protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems in the high seas from the adverse impacts of bottom fishing gears, which is a priority of the Slovenian Council Presidency in the fisheries sector. While welcoming the Commission proposal, rapporteur, Duarte FREITAS (EPP-ED, PT) put forward a number of amendments which he considered to be important for the general balance of the regulation. In coastal areas, the management and protection of ecosystems, in line with Community guidelines, are the responsibility of the coastal states. In international waters, the protection of the marine environment is generally laid down by regional maritime conventions, where these exist, while the adoption of measures for the protection and management of marine living resources and the regulation of the impact of fishing on vulnerable ecosystems comes under the responsibility of Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMO). However, there are high-sea areas that are not covered by any organisation or regional fisheries management convention, and this, in practice, is tantamount to an encouragement to engage in destructive fishery activities.
The report was adopted with 579 votes in favour, 35 against and 13 abstentions.
The main aim of this proposal is to fill this vacuum and take the lead in regulating fishing activities in such areas. The proposed regulation implements the recommendations issued by the General Assembly of the United Nations on measures to eliminate destructive fishing practices that threaten vulnerable marine ecosystems in the high seas. The proposal applies to EU vessels operating in the high seas in areas that are not subject to regulation by a RFMO and thus require unilateral flag State regulation.
In order to conduct fishing activities with bottom gears in the high seas, Community fishing vessels must have a special fishing permit. The applications for these fishing permits shall be accompanied by a detailed fishing plan specifying in particular:
• the intended location of the activities;
• the targeted species;
• the depth at which the gears will be deployed;
• the configuration of the bathymetric profile of the seabed in the intended fishing grounds.
According to the Hosue, the type of gear should be mentioned, in addition to the depths, given that each type of equipment represents a different potential threat to the ecosystems. The fishing plan should also specify the species likely to be taken as by-catch, MEPs say.
Given that the specific conditions for the validation of fishing permits in particular areas is contained in Articles 4 and 5 of the proposal, MEPs consider that the depth restrictions proposed in Article 6 ("The use of bottom gears at depths beyond 1000m shall be prohibited") are totally unnecessary. Moreover, there are no scientific studies which prove that vulnerable marine ecosystems exist or cease to exist above or below this particular limit, adds the report.
Other amendments are intended to simplify procedures, an essential factor in protecting the ecosystems in question, and to add a reference to the work now under way in the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO).
Member States should be given some time to prepare for the necessary new administrative procedures. Therefore, the rapporteur proposes that the regulation enters into force 30 days after its publication in the Official Journal of the EU, instead of on the seventh day following that of its publication, as indicated by the Commission.
Bottom gears means fishing equipment deployed on and in contact with the sea bed, such as bottom trawls, dredges, bottom-set gillnets, bottom-set longlines, pots and traps. Text, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 5 June)

Community system against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing
2008-06-09 - 11:17
Parliament adopted a non-binding report on the proposal for a regulation establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. MEPs adopted several amendments concerning the Community list of IUU fishing vessels, the inspections to be carried out and the sanctions and other measures to be imposed by Member States. The report was adopted with 624 votes in favour, 12 against and 8 abstentions. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is a serious and growing problem worldwide. In certain fisheries, such as bluefin tuna and cod, the percentage of IUU fish is very high, sometimes as much as half of the total catch or even more. Among the most important IUU fishery scandals in recent years are bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean, cod in the Barents and Baltic Seas and Patagonian toothfish.
According to the rapporteur, Marie-Hélène AUBERT (Greens/EFA, FR), the proposal establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing "deserves the full support of Parliament, for it is to a significant extent based upon the demands that Parliament itself has made" on its report on the implementation of the EU action plan against IUU fishing, from 15 February 2007.
"If the proposal is adopted in its present form, it would put the Community at the forefront of international efforts to eliminate IUU fishing and in a position to put pressure on States which continue to allow IUU fishing by their vessels. Considering the Community's prominence as one of the largest fishing powers and the largest market in the world, the EU has a clear responsibility to be at the forefront", she says.
The essential elements of the proposal consist of:
• the creation of a list of vessels (both EU-flagged and non-EU) that are involved in IUU fishing;
• a scheme of port state control that would prohibit access by third country IUU vessels;
• a ban on the importation of IUU fish, by requiring certification by the flag state that the fish is legal;
• the development of a Community Alert System when there is a suspicion that IUU fish has been detected;
• prohibition of importing fish from countries that have been identified as not cooperating with the EU scheme;
• provisions detailing what actions are to be taken in each of the above situations.
There is also a need to ensure full compatibility between this proposal and the "Control Regulation", which is to be the subject of a new proposal for regulation in October.
The scope of the regulation and the IUU list
As far as the scope of the regulation goes, the question is whether the regulation should also apply to EU-flagged vessels or only to the vessels of third countries.
Marie-Hélène AUBERT believes that "if the provisions of the IUU regulation are not applicable to EU vessels, then it will be claimed, with justification, that the EU allows itself the privilege of conducting IUU fishing while it criticises others".
"The Community must apply the same rules to its own vessels and operators that it applies to others. Member States and parts of the industry argue that EU vessels are already regulated under the provisions of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), so they are fundamentally different from vessels from other countries. This is equivalent to saying we are better than everybody else. This position is not valid", she argues.
According to the European Parliament, in addition to the owner and operator, the flag state must also be informed that one of its vessels is to be included in the European Community IUU vessel list, especially since it will then be required to take measures in this regard.
The IUU vessels list and the list of non-cooperating states should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union, says the Hosue. This will ensure that the list can be found in a specific official publication.
Furthermore, where one of an owner’s vessels has been included in an IUU list, a detailed inspection shall be carried out on all that owner's vessels.
Member States shall refuse to allow the export of a vessel flying their flag that is on the IUU list and may not under any circumstances grant support or subsidies to IUU vessels, MEPs propose to add.
Access to ports of Member States, the provision of port services, and the conduct of landing, transhipment or on-board processing operations in such ports shall be prohibited for third country fishing vessels that are included on the Community list of IUU fishing vessels. The report also states that Member States shall carry out inspections in their ports "of at least 50% of landings, transhipments and on-board processing operations by third country fishing vessels each year", while the Commission proposes of at least 15% of landings.
The catch certificate
The catch certificate, which would allow for a better traceability of the fish product, must continue to be a pillar of the regulation, "otherwise the entire scheme will be merely cosmetic and have no serious impact on IUU fishing", says the rapporteur.
"It has been described as too complex, but fishing in today's globalised world is a very complex business, with fish travelling all around the world between the time it is caught and the final sale to the consumer. Passing through multiple borders, ports and airports offers many opportunities to mix legal and illegal fish, in effect laundering the IUU fish. An effective and comprehensive system of traceability is essential to minimise amount of fish laundering that occurs", she adds.
Penalties must be dissuasive enough
At present, sanctions applied by the various Member States differ widely and both the Commission and the Court of Auditors have noted that the fines are not dissuasive. The European Parliament has also long called for harmonized penalties, sufficient to be dissuasive, instead of a simple "cost of doing business".
Since IUU vessels tend to concentrate on the most lucrative fisheries (bluefin tuna, cod) it is necessary that sanctions can be imposed that are high enough to be dissuasive.
The European Parliament agrees that the "administrative sanctions" should include fines of a maximum of at least €300,000 for natural persons and of at least €500,000 for legal persons, adding that "Member States may also opt for penal sanctions provided that the amount of such sanctions is at least equivalent to that of the administrative sanctions".
The sanctions shall be accompanied by other sanctions or measures, in particular "a temporary ban for at least the duration of the programming period, or a permanent ban on access to public aid or subsidies", or "the repayment of public aid or subsidies received by IUU vessels during the relevant financial period".
During the first year following the entry into force of this regulation, six-monthly checks shall be carried out to determine Member States’ preparedness to fully comply with its provisions. Should any instances of non-compliance be identified, the Member State(s) concerned shall be required to make the necessary adjustments, says the European Parliament.
Impact on developing countries
MEPs also add that the Commission shall, within three months of the entry into force of this regulation, publish an analysis of its probable impact on developing countries and a proposal for the funding of specific programmes to support its implementation and eliminate possible negative impacts.
