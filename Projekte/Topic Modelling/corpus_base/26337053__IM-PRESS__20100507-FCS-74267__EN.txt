Check what's on the plenary agenda Economic crisis tops Parliament's plenary agenda
MEPs will debate the massive new euro-zone lending facility and the associated proposals to improve economic governance with the Commission and Council. Political groups will ask how the Commission and the Council intend to make economic coordination mechanisms more effective and what role they foresee for the Commission and the European Parliament in the task force to strengthen economic governance.
Common EU rules to facilitate safe organ donations . People needing liver transplants or other organ donations should face shorter waiting times if on Wednesday the plenary backs a compromise, agreed by EP and Council negotiating teams, on a draft EU law setting out quality and safety standards for transplantation of human organs. MEPs will also vote on an own-initiative report on the Commission Action Plan on organ donation.
Energy efficiency : final vote on measures to cut consumption . New energy efficiency measures for buildings and the new layout of the EU energy efficiency label will be put to a plenary vote on Tuesday. These measures - which come in addition to the EU's 2008 climate change package - were agreed with the Council last year but have to be endorsed by the full Parliament.
Resettling refugees : volunteer host countries could receive €6,000 per person resettled. EU Member States volunteering to welcome third-country refugees could receive up to €6,000 per resettled person under a draft law, as amended by the Civil Liberties Committee, to be put to a plenary vote on Wednesday. EU Member States currently contribute far less to refugee resettlement than do other developed countries such as the USA, Australia and Canada. On Tuesday, MEPs should also approve the setting up of a European Asylum Support Office, further to an agreement with the Council.
"Made in" labels would become compulsory for clothes sold in Europe if Parliament backs Internal Market Committee amendments to a proposed EU labelling system on Tuesday.
Self-employed women should have same maternity leave rights as employees. EU Member States should grant standard social protection, including at least 14 weeks' maternity leave allowance, for self-employed women and for spouses or life partners of self-employed workers, says a proposed update of an EU directive, to be put to a plenary vote on Tuesday.
Europe 2020 growth and employment strategy. Parliament's observations on the EU 2020 growth and employment strategy will be set out in a resolution to be voted Wednesday, further to a plenary debate in Brussels on 5 May. MEPs will also debate oral questions on the strategy, and vote Thursday on reports by Louis Grech (S&D, MT), on delivering a single market for consumers and citizens, Liem Hoang (S&D, FR), on the long-term sustainability of public finances, and Lambert van Nistelrooij (EPP, NL), on funding for research and innovation.
Parliament may ban " meat glue ". A proposal to authorise the use of "meat glue" enzyme bovine/porcine thrombin, which can be used to stick scraps of meat together, could be rejected in a plenary vote on Wednesday, since the Environment Committee has already objected that thrombin-glued meat could mislead consumers.
Making life easier for farmers. Any reform of the Common Agricultural Policy must clarify its rules, says a draft resolution to be voted on Tuesday. MEPs propose to make farmers' lives easier by creating a single payment system, simplifying rules on electronic identification of animals, and even creating a helpdesk phone line for farmers in each EU Member State. This resolution is part of a wider debate on how best to reshape EU farm policy in time for the EU's next multi-annual budgeting period, which starts in 2013.

Jean Lambert on Asylum: MEPs set to back EU Support Office
MEP Jean Lambert believes the Asylum Office is a major step forward Office to help coordinate Euro response Based in under pressure Malta The EU received over 250,000 asylum applications in 2008. To get a common system to deal with asylum requests MEPs are likely to give the green light on Tuesday for the creation of a European Asylum Support Office. To be based in Valletta in Malta, the office will help European Government's raise standards "so that people who are in need of protection actually get a fair deal", explains Jean Lambert MEP who is steering the measure through Parliament. Her report will be put to the vote Tuesday at 12.
Jean Lambert, why does the EU need an asylum support office and what will it be tasked with?
The EU needs the Office because at the moment we have a huge divergence between the way in which different member states deliver the asylum laws and asylum directives. From Governments which have a system which hardly ever grants refugee status to that where they have a fully fledged really competent system
The office by itself won't be enough, but it will be a help. One of the particular roles it has is to try and give a more standardised version of information about the country of origin of those seeking protection.
So when member states are making decisions whether it's about those from Iraq, from Chechnya or other countries where we know that there are enormous divergences, people should feel they are being treated fairly and that they are not just treated on the base of politics of the state concerned.
The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) will be established, rather symbolically, in Malta (a favoured destination for asylum seekers). Do you think this will influence its perspective, and maybe help shift the burden of care from small 'front line' EU Members?
I think we have to be very careful that the fact that it is based in Malta does not mean that it becomes dominated by the situation in Malta. We know that Malta is under a lot of pressure and has mixed flows of people of whom some are asylum seekers and some are not. Certainly in Malta they have invested a lot into their own asylum system and they were very keen to have this office.
In part it is a symbol to show to the people of Malta that the European Union really is in solidarity with them. Nevertheless, this is an asylum office for the whole of the European Union.
You negotiated on the setting up of the EASO with EU Member States. Does the result correspond to Parliament's demands?
In a negotiation I suppose no side ever gets entirely what it wants. Certainly there are some of the issues about the relationship with the Parliament where we would have liked a stronger role. On the other hand there is a big discussion about the role of other agencies and the European institutions.
We would have liked the office to have more of a monitoring role rather than a support role. Member States wanted it to be called 'support office' for a particular reason. But at least we found that negotiating with the Swedish Presidency (of the EU) was a real negotiation.

Opening of the Strasbourg session: EP celebrates IDAHO
EP President Jerzy Buzek is pictured during the opening of May Plenary Session in Strasbourg. At the start of this week's Strasbourg session, EP President Jerzy Buzek announced that, as every year, the EU was celebrating 17 May as International Day against Homophobia (IDAHO). This year's Europe Day and the Charlemagne Prizes were among other topics mentioned by Mr Buzek, who also congratulated the new UK and Hungarian governments on taking office. He welcomed a request to send condolences to families of soldiers killed in Afghanistan.
"This is the sixth time the EU has celebrated International Day against Homophobia", said Mr Buzek in his opening words, stressing that the EU was opposed to all forms of discrimination, under its Treaty and its Charter on Fundamental Rights.
Last week had seen the 60th anniversary of the Schuman Declaration, now celebrated as Europe Day, and Parliament had held its usual Open Days on 8 and 9 May, with over 30,000 citizens visiting its premises in Strasbourg and Brussels.
On Tuesday 11 May, Mr Buzek had awarded the Charlemagne Youth Prize in Aachen. First, second and third places had gone, respectively, to the German, Irish and Bulgarian entrants (click here for more information). The main Charlemagne Prize was awarded two days later to Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk.
On 14 and 15 May in Stockholm, the President had attended the Conference of Speakers of EU Parliaments, where future cooperation and the forthcoming Belgian EU presidency were discussed.
Mr Buzek congratulated the new British and Hungarian governments on taking office and expressed the hope that they would prove stable and decisive.
Lastly, in the wake of the deaths of two Italian soldiers in Afghanistan this morning, the President warmly endorsed requests by Italian and British MEPs for condolences to be sent to their families and those of all other troops who had died while serving under the NATO mission in that country.
Making organ transplants easier

The donor liver is stored in cooled saline (salt and water) solution in which it can be preserved for up to 8 hours. ©BELGA Shorter waiting times give those in need of an organ transplant a better chance to survive, yet all too often patients die while still waiting for a suitable donor. Common European rules on organ transplants will be debated by the European Parliament Tuesday afternoon from 1500. At stake across Europe is not only ensuring that organs are safely acquired and transplanted but also the growing demand for them.
Almost 60,000 patients are on waiting lists EU-wide and every day 12 of them die still waiting for a transplant.
Speaking ahead of the debate, Miroslav Mikolášik, Parliament's rapporteur on the subject told us he had "stressed the main principles guiding donation and transplantation - voluntary and unpaid donation and particularly protection of the living donors. In order to prevent illegal organ trafficking, any commercialisation or financial incentives must be strictly excluded". The role of donor coordination between foreign countries would also be expanded and encouraged.
He also said that if approved by fellow MEPs then European Governments would have three years to incorporate the recommendations of this Directive into national legislation.
Over 80% of Europeans support the donor card but only around only 12% actually have one. There are also huge differences in donor numbers between member states. In Spain there are 34.6 donations per million people compared with 0.5 per million in Romania
Trying to match donors and recipients separately in each member state seriously limits options, also leading to phenomena like organ trafficking. Existing exchange organisations - Eurotransplant (Austria, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Croatia, Germany, the Netherlands and Slovenia) and Scandiatransplant (Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Iceland) cover only limited number of EU countries.
The creation of a European area of organ transplants, with harmonised quality assurance systems, improved cooperation between member states and higher number of donors through specific campaigns and administrative procedures could make a difference.
Guaranteeing the quality and safety of organs
The EU directive examined by the EP foresees each member state having a National Authority enforcing a National Quality Programme.
The proposal envisages public or non-profit private National Authorities. Their role will be to enforce, via the National Quality Programme, the quality and safety of organs, ensuring that all correct procedures and safeguards are followed by all organisations or companies involved, from the identification of the donor and organ harvesting to the actual transplantation.
It would enhance the safety of recipients and facilitate the exchange of organs between member states by ensuring that all organs conform to certain minimum standards. The National Authorities will supervise exchanges between countries and, to facilitate this, a network of such authorities would be set up, with the European Commission establishing the necessary systems and protocols for the dissemination of information.
Speaking after the Committee backed his plans Mr Mikolášik said "the objective is to have more organs for more patients," explained Miroslav Mikolášik, Parliament's rapporteur on the subject. "This includes more cooperation between member states." Currently many states are excluded from the two trans-European transplant organisations, yet "there are organs, of good quality with good traceability" in all countries, he said.
Participants in the Eurotransplant area exchange around 20% of all organs transplanted each year (around 3,300 organs), while only 2% of organs leave or enter the Eurotransplant area.
More efficient and accessible transplants
In parallel to the directive, a 10 point action plan for 2009-2015 will be discussed Tuesday afternoon. It has been proposed to improve the quality and safety of organs, increase organ availability and make transplant procedures more efficient and accessible.
Actions include the exchange of information and best practices to help countries with low organ availability improve their donor rates, the appointment of "Transplant Donor Coordinators" in hospitals and enhancing public awareness.
A report by Spanish Socialist Andres Perello Rodriguez on the action plan supports the goals and proposes that countries propose that people become donors for example when applying for a passport or driving licence or online.
"We are trying to make sure that the persons who need just an organ to stay alive can survive, that Europeans who are waiting for an organ will stay alive," he said.
Organ Trafficking
MEPs said that, to combat organ trafficking there should be no financial rewards for organ donation, with the exception of defraying the costs of live donors, who in turn should "in principle" only be allowed to donate to close relatives and in any case act as a last resort in case no organ is found.
Parliament is scheduled to vote on the proposals 18 May.

EP seeks equal treatment for self-employed
Mother with baby on one arm and mobile phone in hand Debate Monday Vote Tuesday MEPs want to promote female entrepreneurship and are proposing new rules to bridge the gender gap for self-employed workers and their partners and to ensure everyone has social protection. MEPs want Member States to provide social protection, including at least 14 weeks maternity allowance, in line with national law. They debate the proposals Monday and vote on them Tuesday.
At the moment there are important differences in access to social protection between employed and self-employed workers and their partners. According to the EU's statistics agency Eurosat, 10.5% of workers were self-employed in 2007.
The aim of the proposals is to ensure equal treatment for self-employed men and women and their spouses or long-term partners, specifically by improving social protection, maternity benefits and status.
Astrid Lulling, who is steering the proposals through the EP said, "like salaried workers, independents must have social protection and contribute to their pensions. It is even more important that their partners are protected, especially in the case of divorce. They mustn't have to rely on rights linked to their husband's insurance."
The Women's Committee wants all EU countries to offer social protection to self-employed workers and their partners. Each country could decide if self-employed workers must sign up for spousal protection or can opt out.
Maternity benefits for independents
The new rules would also grant maternity protection to self-employed women and the wives or life partners of self-employed men. "Today there isn't maternity protection in all member states for self-employed women and the partners of self-employed men," Ms Lulling said. "We want to create the right, obligatory or voluntary, for 14 weeks paid maternity leave."
General rules on maternity leave are currently being discussed under a separate proposal and the committee wants any decisions about the length of maternity leave to be made applicable to self-employed workers too. Rules on the health and safety of pregnant workers - which includes provisions on maternity and paternity leave, are scheduled to be voted on in July.

EU Strategy for Youth
Group of students in caps and gowns Vote in plenary Tuesday Youth unemployment double the averaga Youth unemployment now stands at double the rate for the overall working population, due in part to the economic crisis, and MEPs have already criticised the lack of proposed future budget funding to help deal with the problem. On Tuesday, the European Parliament will vote on the development of a European Youth Strategy for the next 10 years.
Greek Christian Democrat Georgios Papanikolaou drew up the report on the youth strategy and told us "Youth in society is like the oil in an engine. If there is no good oil then the engine does not work or it malfunctions. If there is no happy and cheerful youth then the society is doomed to collapse."
Consequences for society
Today, more than 5.5 million Europeans under 25 are unemployed, equivalent to 21.4%, twice as high as the overall unemployment rate in the EU and it is expected to rise.
Youth unemployment can have heavy social and economic costs. EU studies show that when youth unemployment levels rise, poverty, illness and crime rates go up too.
"At this sensitive age man struggles for self completeness and a job is one of the key factors for achieving it. A young man confronted with unemployment in the most productive age of his life is unavoidably exposed to stress, depression and sadness," Mr Papanikolaou said. "If young people are deprived of hope and energy then the future, the sustainability and the viability of the whole society is at stake."
Why is youth employment high?
What barriers are young people facing that make it so much harder for them to get jobs? Mr Papanikolaou said it is partly because of the economic crisis, but also because employers are looking for professional experience. He called for more emphasis on "linking higher education with the labour market more effectively".
In addition, the jobs offered to young people are often internships, which offer far less security. "The concept of traineeships should be redirected to ensure better future working opportunities," Mr Papanikolaou said.
What the EU can do?
Youth policy is decided at national level and cooperation between member states is voluntary. Mr Papanikolaou is calling for a decisive and coordinated youth policy by the Member States and strong political will to deal with unemployment at the EU level.
He wants flexibility for European youth programs, a strong focus on education and a cross-sectoral approach, which "leads to a more explicit reference on youth issues in every policy area".

Richard Ashworth on simplifying the CAP
British MEP Richard Ashworth Farmer facing new challenges EU farm budget still at 40% of total The Common Agricultural Policy is too bureaucratic and administrative burdens take "farmers away from the day-to-day job of managing livestock or farming the land" says British MEP Richard Ashworth (ECR). In the run up to CAP reform in 2013, simplification of rules and controls is a key issue for farmers who must "secure the food supply to 500 million European citizens at a reasonable cost” according to Mr Ashworth whose report on the issue is being put to the vote Tuesday.
What’s the stake of the current debate on CAP?
The CAP still accounts for 40% of the EU budget. When you refer to CAP though, the initial reaction of the man in the street will be to think of wine lakes, food mountains and supporting inefficiency. That was the debate 15 years ago, but now it is about guaranteeing and securing the food supply to 500 million European citizens at a reasonable cost.
Europe is going through a financial crisis: can agriculture maintain its share of the budget after 2013 in these circumstances?
We can’t have a CAP reform before we get a budget reform. The economic crisis, unemployment and lots of other areas, were not even on the horizon when we last reformed CAP. Then there are energy security, climate change, migration control. Citizens expect Europe to deliver on these things, but with the same budget as before. Agriculture will have to fight hard to maintain 40% of the budget.
Why should the CAP be simplified? Once simplified, how will it benefit farmers, can you give a few concrete examples?
Farmers have to comply with environmental, health and welfare standards. The CAP today is too bureaucratic; many regulations are not proportionate to the risks.
Most farmers already have to comply with very comprehensive quality assurance and traceability standards imposed by retailers or processors. It’s very irritating if literally a week later a man from the Ministry comes round with a clipboard to inspect you again. All that paperwork again because the schemes are not harmonized. That takes farmers away from the day-to-day job of managing livestock or farming the land.
Another cause of anger amongst farmers is that any mistake in the forms submitted will be penalized, generally on a standard basis, so a tiny little error gets you that same disproportionate penalty. And very often that mistake was made not out of wilful intent to defraud the EU, but, say, because of wrong information from the local food standard agency. This is blatantly unfair. There should be a presumption that first offence no penalty, but if you keep doing it then quite obviously you should.
Another controversial area: why can’t we self-certify, why do we need the man with the clipboard? By all means, once every three years have a spot check. We should treat people as grown-ups and allow them to self-certify.
Farmers from the newly-joined EU countries still receive lower subsidies than those farmers from countries that joined the EU before. Will that change after 2013?
They joined on the basis of a transitional arrangement that they would gradually come up to speed with the EU-15. There is logic in that, but I have certain sympathy for the EU-12 looking across the fence seeing British, German, French farmers fully supported when they are not.
On the other hand, the transitional process gives them other advantages; considerably lower costs. I want to see agriculture simpler, fairer and more transparent. Otherwise I can see new Members States crying foul to block any CAP or budget reform until we make sure that the CAP is fair. I can see their point.
You yourself were a farmer in New Zealand in the beginning of 70's just before the UK joined the EU. What would you tell farmers there about EU agriculture?
First, I would be clear that European farmers by and large are not ‘subsidy-junkies’. Most farmers would prefer to be fully independent rather than subsidized.
But then we have to be realistic; we are not New Zealand. The average worker’s salary here is considerably higher than in New Zealand. But the average farmer's income here is only half that of the average worker. Without support we would have a crisis.
The public in Europe for very real reasons also place expectations on farmers in terms of environment, animal health and welfare, plant sanitation, etc. That implies costs which we cannot pass on to our consumers. So it is only right and proper that the EU recognizes that and compensates farmers for delivering public goods.

The EP held a debate on simplifying the CAP on April 19. A full vote will be held on May 18.

Resettling refugees: financial incentives for volunteer host countries
MEPs vote on Tuesday 18 May at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France European Asylum Support Office backed by MEPs Funding to help resettlement of refugees EU Member States that volunteer to welcome third-country refugees could receive up to €6,000 per resettled person under a draft EU law amended by Parliament on Tuesday. EU Member States currently contribute far less to refugee resettlement than do other developed countries such as the USA, Australia and Canada. MEPs also approved the setting up of a European Asylum Support Office, following an agreement reached with the Council.
The EU contributed to only 6.7% of the global resettlement of refugees in 2008, with 4,378 individuals. The UNHCR estimates that 747,000 are in need of resettlement. To date, only ten EU Member States have taken part in any resettlement schemes.
To encourage more Member States to help in resettlement, MEPs are proposing that they should receive funding of €6,000 per person for the first year for Member States applying for the first time, €5,000 in the second year and €4,000 thereafter. The additional amount that newly participating Member States receive for the first two years must be invested in developing a sustainable resettlement programme.
Parliament adopted the report by Portuguese MEP Rui Tavares (GUE/NGL) by 512 votes to 81, with 7 abstentions.
The programme seeks to resettle in the EU individuals who have been granted refugee status in third countries (for example, Iraqi refugees in Syria). It will follow a number of EU priorities, upon which Parliament and the Council have yet to agree. MEPs wish priority to go to children and women at risk of violence or exploitation, unaccompanied minors, persons with serious medical needs, and survivors of violence and torture. The Council wishes to establish priorities according to the geographic origin and nationality of refugees.
Asylum: an agency to assist Member States
Parliament also approved the creation of a European Asylum Support Office when it adopted a second-reading report by British Green MEP Jean Lambert. Based in Valletta (Malta) the office will lend its expertise to Member States receiving asylum seekers. It will seek to strengthen co-operation among national authorities and afford administrative support to Member States subject to particular pressure. Parliament and the Council agreed at second reading to assign the office the task of co-ordinating information exchange on resettlement measures carried out by Member States.
Finally, the EU decision establishing a European Refugee Fund is expected to be amended to ensure that it is adequately funded, when MEPs vote on Wednesday on a report by Claude Moraes (S&D, UK) on this matter.
"Made in" labels could become compulsory for clothes
Countries that have well established quality clothes industries are anxious to keep the "Made in" label to boost sales. ©BELGA/FREY/Jean Francois Country of origin labels should become compulsory for clothes sold "Made in" labels currently voluntary Country of origin labels should become compulsory for clothes sold in Europe so that consumers are not misled by labels suggesting they were made in an EU Member State, said the European Parliament on Tuesday when it approved an update of the EU clothes labelling scheme.
The only way to ensure that consumers are not deceived by labels implying clothes were made in the EU when they were in fact made in a third country is to make "made in" labels mandatory, MEPs decided. "Made in" labels are currently voluntary in the EU but in practice their use depends on national laws. In comparison, country of origin labelling is strictly regulated in, for example, the USA, Canada and Japan.
New textiles to hit the market faster
Current EU legislation on textile labelling applies only to the harmonisation of textile fibre names - there are currently 48 fibres (18 natural and 30 synthetic) sold on the single market - and the labelling of the fibre composition of textile products.
Although Parliament was initially asked to vote only on a technical proposal by the Commission (aiming at cutting the time taken to place new fibres on the market), MEPs turned this into a more political proposal, to make country of origin labelling mandatory in the new regulation.
EU legislation: new labelling requirements may be needed
To help consumers to make informed choices, MEPs also asked the Commission to produce a report within two years, and if necessary a proposal for legislation to impose the new labelling requirements EU-wide. This report should examine the harmonised requirements on care labelling (currently voluntary), clothing and footwear sizes, on health and safety warnings (flammability, possible allergenic substances) and on social labelling.
Parliament's report on this subject was drafted by Toine Manders and adopted by 528 votes to 18, with 108 abstentions.
Wives of self-employed should have similar maternity leave rights to employees
Self employed women and the wives / partners of the self employed should get 14 weeks maternity leave say MEPs. ©BELGA/Alliance/Hans Wiedl 14 weeks for self employed women Wives or life partners of self-employed workers covered EU Member States should grant standard social protection, including at least 14 weeks' maternity leave allowance, for self-employed women and for wives or life partners of self-employed workers, says Parliament in a binding proposal to update an EU directive.
Compromise amendments agreed with Council say it should be up to Member States to decide whether paying for membership of social insurance schemes (covering maternity leave, sickness, invalidity and old age) must be mandatory for self-employed women or whether they can access this system voluntarily.
The EU is to update an existing law to give standard social protection rights to self-employed workers and the spouses or life partners of self-employed workers. Spouses or life partners are not employees but they nonetheless habitually help the self-employed worker (which is very common in farming, small firms and liberal professions). Self-employed workers, and self-employed workers' assisting spouses could either be given the opportunity to pay to join a social coverage scheme or could be forced to do so, as each Member State chooses, stress MEPs in a sensitive compromise amendment negotiated with the Council at second reading.
In any event, any pregnant self-employed woman or self-employed worker's spouse would be entitled to a "sufficient maternity allowance to cover interruptions at their work" of at least 14 weeks' maternity leave, i.e. the minimum paid maternity leave laid down for normal employees by the EU maternity leave directive.
Again, it will be up to Member States to decide whether the leave is mandatory or voluntary, and whether this social protection can also be "proportional to the participation in the activities of the self-employed worker".
Temporary replacement
Access to any existing national services providing temporary replacement of a woman on maternity leave can be considered "an alternative to, or a part of, the maternity allowance", said MEPs. In this case, the woman in leave would not receive the full maternity allowance but could be easily replaced in the family business.
No discrimination when establishing a company
Lastly, Parliament calls on Member States to take necessary measures to ensure that the conditions for establishing a company between spouses (or life partners when recognised by national law) are not more restrictive than between other persons.
Next steps
The Council is set to adopt these amendments on 7 June. Member States will then have two years to implement all these changes to the directive, or up to four years "if Member States find difficulties" in finding the way to grant standard social protection to self-employed workers or spouses and partners of the self-employed.
MEPs want deeds not words in governing of Europe's economy
Left to right from top left:Diego Lopez Garrido, Olli Rehn, Joseph Daul, Martin Schulz, Guy Verhofstadt, Rebecca Harms, Timothy Kirkhope, Lothar Bisky, Niki Tzavela . Calls for more euro-coordination Fiscal responsibility How Europe should govern its economy amid the current crisis and what may be left its wake dominated debate in the European Parliament Wednesday morning. In the 3 hour debate many MEPs called for the European Union to coordinate its economic policies more closely to mirror such cooperation in other policy fields. The need for fiscal responsibility and the reigning in of public debt was also emphasised. Many Members felt that the financial system itself was rotten and encouraged irresponsible behaviour - leaving taxpayers to foot the bill.
For the Spanish Presidency of the European Union, State Secretary Diego Lopez Garrido told the House that serious deficits, debts and speculative actions have caused the current crisis. To remedy it he proposed short term help such as to Greece and longer-term structural reforms of pensions, health systems and labour markets. He also called for closer coordination of economic policies.
Speaking in the Chamber the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs Olli Rehn told MEPs that "the EU is prepared to defend the euro whatever it takes". Referring to a Communication of 12 May he said that competitiveness must be raised and crisis resolution mechanisms improved. He also said that the Commission would be willing to make recommendations on each national budget of a Member State to ensure that countries adhered to the terms of the Stability and Growth pact.
Call for deficits to be reduced
Joseph Daul , the leader of the largest group in Parliament, the centre right European People's Party, commented that the latest measures to fight the crisis in the euro zone were not sufficient. He went on to say that deficits must be reduced and measures have to be taken now, irrespective of whether the government is right or left wing .
Mr Daul also told the House that sanctions must be put in place for States that fail in their obligations to report the accuracy of deficits. His finished by saying "if we have to make budget cuts everywhere, MEPs and civil servants have to lead the way".
Martin Schulz of the Socialist and Democrats group was critical of what he called "laissez-faire ideology". He called the current system "partly immoral, perverse". He also criticised rating agencies which during the peak of problems in Greece were "already looking at the next target and trying to bring down Portugal. They should be controlled, they should be subject to rules" he said.
He went on to stress the fact that Europe needed economic governance, "anybody who is against that has not understood the message".
"A governance crisis"
For the Liberal ALDE group its leader Guy Verhofstadt said the problems amounted to one of "a governance crisis". He asks the Commission not to wait for Governments to come up with its own initiatives and that they should "put a global package on the table before Governments and before Parliament".
According to Mr Verhofstadt it should contain four elements; consolidation of the Stability pact, a more convincing 2020 Strategy, a European Monetary Fund EMF and a European bond market.
Rebecca Harms of the Greens/EFA said her bloc had supported a mechanism on financial stabilisation adopted two weeks ago but wanted recognition of more joint economic policy - "not simply to fight the symptoms of the crisis but to tackle the full extent of the crisis".
She remarked that saving banks was misguided and that "we have to move beyond this saving, it is costing billions and billions and we don't know where we are going to get the money from".
She also said that within the whole EU she wanted to ban toxic financial products, keep hedge funds on a short leash and tax financial transactions.
"Will" to fulfil commitments?
British MEP Timothy Kirkhope (ECR) said that what Europe too often lacks are not extra powers but the will to fulfil commitments. He said he hoped that Europe 2020 initiative will not fail on this aspect. The "EU needs powers to call for a prior draft budget presentation by Member States and to impose tougher sanctions" he said.
Lothar Bisky (GUE/NGL) told the House that "Governments have used taxpayer's money to save casino capitalism". He called for regulation of financial sector, coordination of tax policies, ban of hedge funds and tax heavens.
Greek MEP Niki Tzavela (EFD) said the European Central Bank should guarantee euro bonds, covering 60% of GDP of Member States. She also supported the use of development aid to help Greece finance its debts.

Heart transplant patient Jennifer Sutton comes face to face with her own heart at the Wellcome Collection's Heart Exhibition in central London, 4 September 2007. ©BELGA/AFP/SHAUN CURRY Shorter waiting times Common standards People needing organ transplants should face shorter waiting times after Parliament approved on Wednesday a draft directive on quality and safety standards for human organs used for transplants. The directive covers all stages of the chain from donation to transplantation and provides for cooperation between Member States. MEPs also adopted a resolution on an Action Plan for organ donation.
Over the past 50 years organ transplants have become an established practice worldwide. Yet the queues are long - about 60,000 patients are now on waiting lists in the EU - and every day 12 people die while on a list.
Common quality and safety standards are needed at EU level to facilitate the donation, transplantation and exchange of organs. Parliament today voted by 643 votes to 16 with 8 abstentions to endorse an agreement with the Council on a directive laying down such standards. The MEP who steered the legislation through Parliament was Miroslav Mikolášik (EPP, SK).
Guaranteeing quality and safety
A key step is to designate the competent authority in each country responsible for quality and safety standards. These authorities will have to establish rules for all stages from donation to transplantation or disposal, based on the standards laid down in the directive. Member States can keep or introduce more stringent rules if they wish.
The authorities will approve procurement organisations and transplant centres, set up reporting and management systems for serious adverse reactions, collect data on the outcome of transplants and supervise organ swaps with other Member States and third countries. Traceability from donor to patient and vice-versa will be part of the system, while confidentiality and data security will be ensured.
Living donors and fighting organ trafficking
Member States must ensure the "the highest possible protection of living donors," say MEPs. Organ donations must be "voluntary and unpaid" but living donors may receive compensation "provided it is strictly limited to making good the expenses and loss of incomes related to the donation". Member States must ban any advertising of a need for, or availability of, human organs where the aim is financial gain.
Cooperation between Member States
To ease cooperation, the Commission will set up a network of authorities and lay down procedures to transmit information between Member States. Governments may also set up agreements with European organ exchange organisations.
Member States will have to transpose the directive within two years of its entry into force.
Action Plan on Organ Donation and Transplantation (2009-2015)
In a separate resolution, drafted by Andres Perello Rodriguez (S&D, ES) and adopted by show of hands, MEPs welcome a Commission Action Plan on organ donation and stress that appointing transplant donor co-ordinators in each hospital and swapping information and best practice will help countries with low organ availability to improve their donation rates.
MEPs urge Member States to consider enabling citizens to join a donor register when applying for a passport or driving licence and to include references on their national ID cards or driving licences identifying them as organ donors. Members States should consider offering on-line enrolment in national and European donors' registers and MEPs want the Commission to look into developing a system whereby the wishes expressed by citizens are taken into account in as many Member States as possible.
New energy labels for household appliances; low-energy buildings from 2020
Upgrading buildings can save energy ©BELGA_Novosti_Vitaliy Ankov Labels on household appliances such as fridges, washing machines and ovens will have to include more information on energy consumption, following a vote by MEPs on Wednesday. Parliament approved a new layout of the EU energy efficiency label introducing additional "plus" classes to the familiar colour scheme. On Tuesday MEPs approved new energy efficiency legislation for buildings, to apply by 2020.
The existing energy label already helps consumers assess the running costs when buying new household appliances such as fridges, freezers, washing machines, tumble driers, dishwashers, ovens and air-conditioners. Manufacturers are currently obliged to indicate the annual energy consumption irrespective of whether the product performs well (dark green “A” class) or poorly (red “G” class) on this measure. Depending on the kind of product, the label also shows water consumption, noise level or heat output.
Seven classes, seven colours - new top marks
Under the new legislation, the layout of the energy efficiency label will allow for up to three new energy classes, to reflect technological progress, but will still limit the total number of classes to seven. The present scale is from "A" to "G", so in future it could evolve as follows:
- If a new product using less energy than existing ones is classified as "A+", then the least energy efficient class will be "F",
- If a new product using less energy than existing ones is classified as "A++", then the least energy efficient class will be "E",
- If a new product using less energy than existing ones is classified as "A+++", then the least energy efficient class will be "D".
The labelling colour scheme - from dark green for most energy efficient products to red for least energy efficient ones - will be adjusted accordingly, so the highest energy efficiency class will remain dark green and the least energy efficiency one will be red.
The energy classes and the specific products that must labelled will be determined by a Commission working group.
Advertising of white goods must indicate energy efficiency
Any advert mentioning the energy consumption or price of a specific model of household appliance will have to show the product's energy class. Advertising with additional information should help consumers make a choice based on the energy savings potential of products to reduce their energy bill in the long run.
Similar provisions will apply to any technical promotional literature such as manuals and manufacturers' brochures, whether printed or available on the internet.
Energy label for window frames and other energy-saving products
In future, the label must also be attached to energy-consuming products for commercial and industrial use, such as cold storage rooms, display cabinets, industrial cooking appliances, vending machines and industrial motors.
Additionally, the energy labelling obligation will apply to energy-related products, including construction products, which do not consume energy but "have a significant direct or indirect impact" on energy savings such as window glazing and frames or outer doors, says the final text.
Once published in the EU Official Journal, Member States will have one year to adapt their national laws to the new rules on energy labelling.
The directive approved at second reading on Wednesday is part of a wider energy efficiency legislative package. The EP's report was drafted by MEP Anni Podimata (S&D, GR).

Only low-energy buildings to be built after 2020
On Tuesday 18 May, MEPs approved the EU's new energy efficiency legislation for buildings, which will help consumers to cut their energy bills and the EU as a whole to hit its climate change target of using 20% less energy in ten years' time. Member States will have to alter their building codes so that all new buildings constructed from the end of 2020 meet high energy-saving standards. Existing buildings will have to be upgraded where possible.
Buildings account for around 40% of the EU's total energy use and are Europe's largest source of emissions, so improving their energy performance would help reach CO2 emission goals.
The directive sets out rules for the energy performance of both new and existing buildings. Member States will have to take measures to achieve these requirements at "cost-optimal levels".
Higher standards for new buildings
All buildings put up from the end of 2020 must have high energy-saving standards and, to a large extent, use renewable energy. Public authorities' building projects are to lead the way two years earlier. Part of the funding for these changes will come from the EU budget.
Upgrading of existing buildings
Where feasible the energy performance of existing buildings will have to be improved during major renovations. When renovating, owners will be encouraged to install "smart meters" and replace heating, hot-water plumbing and air-conditioning systems with high-efficiency alternatives such as heat pumps. Regular inspections of boilers and air conditioning systems will be required.
The directive approved at second reading on Tuesday is part of a wider energy efficiency legislative package. The EP's report was drafted by MEP Silvia-Adriana Ţicău (S&D, RO).

MEPs veto "meat glue" authorisation
What exactly is in your steak? ©BELGA/Science The European Parliament has blocked the authorisation of "meat glue" thrombin as a food additive. The enzyme, derived from pigs or cattle, can be used to stick scraps of meat together to form single pieces. In a vote on Wednesday, MEPs declared that such reconstituted meat products carry an unacceptably high risk of misleading consumers.
The European Commission had proposed to add porcine/bovine thrombin to a list of approved additives. However, MEPs narrowly decided to block the proposal when they backed a resolution tabled by the Environment Committee by 370 votes in favour, 262 against and 32 abstentions. A minimum of 369 votes in favour was needed to exercise Parliament's right of veto under the "regulatory procedure with scrutiny".
Addressing the plenary, Environment Committee Chair and German Socialist MEP Jo Leinen said: "Consumers in Europe should be able to trust that they are buying a real steak or ham, not pieces of meat that have been glued together." A different view was expressed by Spanish EPP Member Pilar Ayuso, who argued that the binding procedure had been declared safe and was already practised in some countries.
Member State authorities are currently able to decide at national level whether to allow the use of thrombin as a "processing aid" in food. The Commission proposal was a step towards clarifying that thrombin is a food additive which should be subject to regulation at EU level. Under EU legislation, a food additive may only be permitted in the European Union if it offers benefits to consumers and does not mislead them.
According to the Commission's proposal, meat products reconstituted with thrombin would have required labelling and would have been excluded from restaurants. However, MEPs considered that such measures would not have provided adequate protection against misleading consumers.
Parliament also highlighted a higher risk of bacterial infection in meat products created with thrombin, due to the larger surface area of meat and the cold bonding process that is used
Europe's relations Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia debated Thursday
A column of Russian armoured vehicles moves towards the Roki tunnel on the border with Russia as they leave South Ossetia on August 23, 2008. ©BELGA_AFP_DMITRY KOSTYUKOV Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia lie in one of the most strategic places in Europe. They lay cheek by jowl with their powerful neighbours Russia, Turkey and Iran which only adds to the complications of the European Union's relations with them. Thursday morning from 10 am will see MEPs debating policy towards the Southern Caucasus. We spoke to Bulgarian Socialist MEP Evgeni Kirilov who has drafted a report on the issue and Czech MEP Milan Cabrnoch who heads Parliament's delegation for relations with Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia.
Mr Kirilov told us that "sometimes we tend to forget that South Caucasus is in Europe". He went on to say that "once the security improves the conditions for development of these three countries will generally be much better, but also conditions for progress towards a European integration would exist".
He sees this as requisite for the opening of negotiations on an Association Agreement covering trade between the EU and these countries.
On whether the three countries could ever be in the European Union Milan Cabrnoch told us that "it depends on how we look at the European Union. If we look at the EU as a voluntary and mutually beneficial union of countries which have a common interest in the free flow of capital, goods, services and persons... I believe that nothing should prevent these countries to become one day members of such a community based on these four freedoms - if they fulfil the criteria".
Mr Kirilov said that the EU "hasn't been active enough so far" and "it should contribute to much bigger presence of the EU in the region". He told us that the eruption of the Russia - Georgia conflict had made it imperative for the EU to involve itself more actively in the region. He also believes Europe should do more to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
Apart from conflict resolution, Milan Cabrnoch underlined the importance of "energy security, support to democracy, the safeguarding of human rights and freedom of media".
The debate can be seen live from the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Thursday 20 May.

Single market, regional policy and debt surveillance crucial for EU2020 targets
MEPs voting during the May session The completion of the single market, the sustainability of national debts and a grass-roots led EU cohesion policy are central to the success of the EU2020 strategy, insisted MEPs in a series of resolutions adopted on Thursday. The vote on Parliament's EU 2020 resolution has been postponed until June.
The EU should pass a "Single Market Act" by May 2011, setting out policy priorities for creating a highly competitive social market and green economy and covering both legislative and non-legislative initiatives, says a resolution drafted by Louis Grech (S&D, MT) and adopted by 578 votes to 28, with 16 abstentions.
MEPs call for "a more holistic approach" to the EU internal market that takes full account of citizens' concerns. Strengthening it will be vital if the Europe 2020 strategy is to preserve the social dimension of the EU model, whilst at the same time giving the Union the competitive edge it needs. This position is intended as Parliament's contribution to a report prepared by Mario Monti, at Commission President José Manuel Barroso's request, on revitalising the single market.
Healthier public finances
A resolution on the long-term sustainability of public finances, adopted by 302 votes to 275 with 34 abstentions, calls for the prioritisation of debt surveillance, asks the Commission to evaluate the quality of Member States' debts, insists on Commission oversight of national debt statistics and emphasises that stronger supervision of the financial markets is essential for guaranteeing the long-term health of national budgets.
To improve transparency and evaluate the soundness of debt, Parliament also asks the Commission to carry out studies to assess the quality of the Member States' debt. It also blames poor statistics for the markets' loss of faith in public finances and calls for the Commission to be empowered to control the reporting obligations of Member States.
At the end of the vote, the author of the draft resolution, Liem Hoang Ngoc (S&D, FR) declared that he would withdraw his name from the resolution as adopted since it dealt a serious blow to the EU's citizens. "The EPP and liberals want to make citizens pay for the crisis", he said.
Regional policy and R&D
A resolution on the "Contribution of the Cohesion policy to the achievement of Lisbon and EU 2020 objectives", drafted by Ricardo Cortés Lastra (S&D, ES) and adopted by show of hands, stresses the importance of involving local and regional authorities as well as stakeholders from civil society in the implementation of the EU 2020 Strategy.
In the final resolution, drafted by Lambert Van Nistelrooij (EPP, NL) and adopted by 559 votes to 18 with 36 abstentions, MEPs called for more "synergies" between EU research and innovation funds, regional development funds and the 7th Framework for Research and Development. Parliament also stresses that sustainable economic growth is increasingly dependent on the capacity of regional economies to innovate and invest in new technologies.
