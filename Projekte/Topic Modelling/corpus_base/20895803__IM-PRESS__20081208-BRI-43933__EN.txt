President Sarkozy to report to MEPs on outcome of the 11-12 December European Council summit
On Tuesday 16 December, at 10am, the House will debate the outcome of the European Council of 11 and 12 December after hearing statements from French President and President-in-Office of the EU Council, Nicolas Sarkozy and Commission President José Manuel Barroso. Parliament will also debate the work of the French Presidency over the last six months. The three main topics being address at this key summit are: the economic crisis, the Lisbon treaty and the climate and energy package. EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering will address the Heads of State and government at the December summit.
Climate change and energy package 20 20 20 by 2020
MEPs will debate the climate change and energy package. At the time of publication, agreement between Council and Parliament has been reached on CO2 emissions from cars (Sacconi report), monitoring and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from fuels (Corbey report) and on the Renewables Directive (Turmes report). The overarching aims are to reduce EU greenhouse gases by 20%, to reach 20% of renewable energy and increase energy efficiency all by 20% by 2020.
Cleaning up heavy vehicle exhaust emissions: new Euro VI standards
Proposed tougher limits on harmful exhaust emissions from trucks, lorries and buses, including ozone precursors such as nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons as well as particles were backed in a compromise adopted between Parliament and Council representatives. If the Plenary adopts this compromise, the new "Euro VI" regulation emission limits will apply de facto from 1 January 2014 for new vehicles, nine months earlier than the Commission proposed.
Working Time Directive: MEPs to vote on opt-out
Parliament will vote at second reading on the working time directive. The directive is being revised in order to strike a balance between protecting workers and the flexible organisation of work, and to take account of rulings by the European Court of Justice.
The 1993 directive on the organisation of working time lays down basic principles concerning maximum weekly working hours, daily rest time, breaks, weekly rest time, annual holidays and the duration of night work. It also lists various derogations that Member States may allow for certain categories of worker (for example senior executives) or certain sectors.
European Works Council - better information and consultation for workers
Members of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee are proposing amendments to the recast directive on the European works councils, which was unveiled by the European Commission in July as part of the new social agenda. Around 820 European works councils are currently operating, representing some 14.5 million workers. Parliament and Council have agreed a first-reading agreement on this topic. The updates to Directive 94/45/EC proposed by the Commission are designed to tighten up the definitions of information and consultation of workers, define the powers of European works councils, require employees' representatives to report to the employees they represent and enable them to receive the training they require without loss of wages.
EU credit system for vocational training to ease cross-border mobility
The planned European Credit System for Vocational Education and Training (ECVET) will help ease cross-border mobility of workers and create transparency for professional qualifications gained abroad, says the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. However, participating in the initiative should be voluntary and "variations between national qualifications must not be erased".
Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought: 20th anniversary and 2008 winner Chinese political activist Hu Jia
This year's Sakharov Prize ceremonies in Strasbourg have a dual character. To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the award Parliament has invited a number of former winners of the Prize to Strasbourg. However, the winner of the Prize for 2008, Chinese dissident Hu Jia , will be unable to receive his award as he is imprisoned in China. Instead, a special ceremony will be held in Parliament's Plenary Chamber in his honour.
A new directive to improve the safety of toys just before the festive season
The European Parliament and Council have reached agreement on legislation to aimed at making toys safer which will be debated and voted on in Strasbourg just before the festive season. The new legislation will beef up safety regulations and ban the use of certain chemicals and heavy metals. The report on the safety of toys, drafted by Marianne Thyssen (EPP-ED, BE) aims to strengthen and update the rules on toy safety. The existing directive has given good service but needs replacing.
Traffic offences: effective cross-border enforcement
At present, drivers committing an offence under the Highway Code in a Member State other than their own often avoid paying the penalty imposed on local drivers. The Transport Committee recommends approving legislation to ensure that drivers will be able to be identified and fined for offences they commit anywhere in the EU. Speeding, drink-driving, not wearing a seat belt and failing to stop at a red light will all be covered by the proposal.
Budget 2009: Budgets Committee backs deal with Council but restates EP priorities
Parliament's Budgets Committee is proposing its second reading on the draft EU budget for 2009. MEPs endorse the agreement concluded with the Council on the level of payments (€116.1 billion) while increasing some expenditure on the EP's priorities (growth, cohesion, employment) above the level of the preliminary draft budget. The agreement on the "food facility" for developing countries was also approved.
Too many violations of fundamental rights in the EU, says the Civil Liberties Committee
MEPs in the Civil Liberties Committee express their concern over the "high number of fundamental rights violations in the EU", pointing to instances of serious discrimination against minorities and threats to privacy. They also urge EU Institutions and Member States to cooperate in the field of immigration and asylum. The vote on this report will take place in January 2009. In a report drafted by Giusto CATANIA (GUE/NGL, IT), the committee proposes its overview of the situation of fundamental rights in the EU. A previous report on this issue was rejected by the plenary session in 2004 and the committee has aimed for a broad compromise.
European area of freedom, security and justice (FSJA) - questions to Council
At the end of 2009 the European Council should adopt the new multiannual programme for the FSJA. Ten years after Tampere, the European Union ‘acquis’ is now substantial, even if its overall balance seems to be more oriented to cooperation between administrations, especially in security matters, than to the protection and promotion at European level of citizens’ fundamental rights. Bearing this in mind, Gérard DEPREZ (ALDE, BE), on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs will be asking the Council questions on progress in 2008 of the European area of freedom, security and justice (FSJA)
Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee recommends approving increase in bank deposit guarantee
The committee is proposing a report by Christian EHLER (EPP-ED, DE), which, if approved by Parliament in plenary session, would amend existing legislation on deposit guarantee schemes and raise the guarantee level in the event of deposits being unavailable. The report also modifies the deadline for payouts and proposes setting up an emergency fund.
Reducing administrative burden for EU's mid-sized companies
Aimed at reducing administrative burden for EU companies, the Commission is proposing legislative measures in the areas of company law, accounting and auditing as part of a second fast track package. Ieke van den BURG (PSE, NL) will be tabling a report, on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee, which introduces five amendments to the Commission proposal.
Financial services rules: clearing and settlement and credit claims
MEPs are to vote on proposals to update European rules relating to two aspects of the “plumbing” of the financial system: the aim, on the one hand, is to reflect in law the increasingly interconnected operation of clearing and settlement systems, and, on the other hand, to create a level playing field for central banks in Europe regarding the rules on accepting credit claims (receivable assets resulting from bank loans) as collateral from commercial banks.
New employment and payment system for MEPs' assistants
The Legal Affairs committee endorses legislation to add-on contracts of Brussels-based MEPs' assistants to the statute for European civil servants. This new scheme, of which the outlines were set out by the European Parliament in July, is part of a larger package of measures taken by the Parliament to overhaul the entire system of employing and paying MEPs' assistants. The proposal is due for a vote in Parliament's plenary in December in Strasbourg.
Operational solidarity between Member States essential in the fight against illegal immigration, say MEPs
All Member States should meet their obligations with regard to the fight against illegal immigration, and should make available the material and human resources to enable FRONTEX, the agency responsible for managing operational cooperation at the external borders of the EU, to "function effectively", says Javier Moreno SÁNCHEZ on behalf of the Civil Liberties Committee. The Committee's own-initiative report on the evaluation and future development of the FRONTEX agency and of the European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR) considers the agency to be an "essential instrument" in the EU's global strategy on immigration and calls on the Commission to "present proposals to review the mandate of the Agency in order to strengthen its role and make it more effective".
e-Justice portals give citizens and businesses improved access to justice
e-Justice portals should be created to provide citizens and businesses with improved access to justice, says the Committee on Legal Affairs. In its own-initiative report, the Committee calls on the European Commission to put forward a legislative proposal on e-Justice that would not only improve access to justice, but would facilitate a cross-border judicial system and contribute to an efficient single market. The report, drafted by Diana WALLIS (ALDE, UK), recommends the creation of two separate e-Justice portals - one would be the European e-Justice portal for citizens, and the other would be a secure system designed specifically for judicial authorities.
Fighting counterfeited goods is a priority, says the International Trade Committee
To fight the burgeoning counterfeiting market, worth approximately €500, the Committee on International Trade is calling for specialised anti-counterfeiting teams to be set up in Member States. The business sector also has an important role in raising consumer awareness of the consequences of buying counterfeit goods, say MEPs, goods which are no longer confined to luxury and high-quality goods but also include commonly used products such as toys, medicines, cosmetics and food.
MEPs question the Commission on counterfeit goods just before the festive season
Counterfeiting and piracy have developed at an increasing rate in recent years. In 2007, customs registered over 43 000 cases of fake goods seized at the EU's external border, compared to 37 000 in 2006, an increase of almost 17%. Counterfeiting is increasingly about fake medicines, fake food products, fake cosmetics, fake toys and fake electronic equipment. In addition to the serious economic damage to businesses in the internal market, these products can cause serious harm to consumers. Arlene McCARTHY (PES, UK), on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection will be asking the Commission questions on consumer protection aspects of counterfeiting.
Building a genuine and transparent EU arms market
The European Union should create a genuine single market for defence equipment. This is the aim of a directive on the transfer of defence-related products. MEPs and Council have reached a first-reading deal on this.
Reducing the bureaucratic burden on small and innovative regional development projects
The report recommends that Parliament give its assent to a Commission proposal to revise Council Regulation 1083/2006 Article 55 (EU contributions to "revenue-generating" projects), so as to reduce the bureaucratic burden on small projects co-funded by the European Social fund (ESF), the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) or the Cohesion Fund, facilitate more innovative projects, especially in the environmental, social, energy and research fields, and accelerate funding decisions.
Measures to enhance the role of the European Judicial Network
The European Judicial Network, set up in 2002 to simplify judicial co-operation between Member States and facilitate citizens' access to justice in litigation with cross-border impact, is still far from achieving its full potential. A report drafted by Ona JUKNEVIČIENĖ (ALDE, LT) on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, introduces 17 amendments to the Commission proposal aimed at enhancing the role of the Network.
Human rights in the world
As usual the session ends with three debates and votes on human rights issues in the world, on this occasion the topics are: Zimbabwe, Nicaragua and Russia: aggression against human rights defenders and the trial on the murder of Anna Politkovskaya. 20081208BRI43933 Draft agenda - 15-18 December 2008 Watch live broadcasts from the plenary on-line

European Council
President Sarkozy to report to MEPs on outcome of the 11-12 December European Council summit
2008-12-11 - 11:29
On Tuesday 16 December, at 10am, the House will debate the outcome of the European Council of 11 and 12 December after hearing statements from French President and President-in-Office of the EU Council, Nicolas Sarkozy and Commission President José Manuel Barroso. Parliament will also debate the work of the French Presidency over the last six months. The three main topics to be addressed at this key summit are: the economic crisis, the Lisbon treaty and the climate and energy package. EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering will address the Heads of State and government at the December summit.
Climate change and energy package
At the time of publication, agreement between Council and Parliament has been reached on the CO2 emissions from cars (Guido SACCONI (PES, IT) report, the monitoring and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from fuels (Dorette CORBEY (PES, NL) report, and on the Renewables Directive (Claude TURMES (Greens/EFA, LU) report. However, further negotiations between Council and Parliament will be required to reach a first-reading deal on the directives on shared efforts to reduce greenhouse emissions (Satu HASSI (Greens/EFA, FI), the report on geological storage of carbon dioxide (CCS - Chris DAVIES (ALDE, GB)) and the greenhouse gas emission allowance trading system (Avril DOYLE (EPP-ED, IE) report.
Lisbon Treaty
Following the conclusions of the 15-16 October 2008 meeting, the European Council return to this matter in December 2008 with a view to defining the elements of a solution and a common path to be followed. President Pöttering welcomed the recent Irish Parliament report on Ireland's future in the European Union stating that "this report represents a further step towards us finding a way to respond to Irish concerns expressed in the Referendum of 12 June, while at the same time allowing the Lisbon Treaty to enter into force. It will certainly inform the Irish Government's preparations for the crucial European Council meeting in Brussels on 11 and 12 December."
More about the European Council
The European Council brings together the Heads of State and Government of the 27 Member States and the President of the European Commission. They are assisted by the foreign affairs ministers of the EU Member States and a member of the Commission. European Council meetings are also attended by the High-Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union, who assists the President of the European Council, and by the Secretary-General of the European Commission.
Though it does not adopt formal legislative acts, the European Council is the most important decision-making body of the European Union. It is the institution that gives the EU the necessary impetus for its development and defines its general political guidelines, in particular in the domain of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. Joint debate : European Council/French Presidency

Climate change and energy package 20 20 20 by 2020
2008-12-11 - 11:29
MEPs will debate the climate change and energy package. At the time of publication, agreement between Council and Parliament has been reached on CO2 emissions from cars (Sacconi report), monitoring and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from fuels (Corbey report) and on the Renewables Directive (Turmes report). The overarching aims are to reduce EU greenhouse gases by 20%, to reach 20% of renewable energy and increase energy efficiency all by 20% by 2020. Further negotiations between the Council and European Parliament will be required to reach a first-reading deal on the directives on shared efforts to reduce greenhouse emissions (Hassi report) on geological storage of carbon dioxide (CCS - Chris Davies report) and the greenhouse gas emission allowance trading system (Avril Doyle report).
1. MEPs and Council Presidency reach deal on CO2 emissions from cars (Sacconi report)
Following a series of meetings between MEPs and the French Presidency of the European Council, the two sides have informally agreed details of future targets on CO2 emissions from cars. The compromise reached still needs to be put to a first reading vote at Parliament's December plenary session in Strasbourg and then formally be endorsed by the full Council.
The informal compromise concerns a draft regulation which sets emission performance standards for new passenger cars (the "M1" category) registered in the EU. These account for 12% of overall EU emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the main greenhouse gas, according to European Commission's figures. The new regulation is part of the EU's effort to reduce CO2 emissions by 20% by 2020.
The compromise backs the Commission's proposed target of an average of 120g of CO2/km for the whole car industry by 2012, compared to the current levels of 160g/km.The regulation sets an average target of 130g CO2/km for new passenger cars to be reached by improvements in vehicle motor technology. It will be supplemented by additional measures to reach a further 10g/km reduction, to reach the 120g/km target, through other technical improvements such as better tyres or the use of biofuels.
The key elements of the compromise are as follows:
- long term target:
The compromise introduces a long term target for 2020 for the new car fleet of average emissions of 95 g CO2/km.
- phasing in:
the compromise says that manufacturers will be given interim targets of ensuring that average CO2 emissions of 65% of their fleets in January 2012, 75% in January 2013, 80 % in January 2014 and 100% from 2015, comply with the car manufacturer's specific CO2 emissions target.
- excess emissions premiums:
The compromise provides that manufacturers will have to pay the following fines (so called excess emissions premiums) if their average emissions of CO2 exceed their specific emission target set by the regulation:
from 2012 until 2018:
5 Euro for the first gram of CO2
15 Euro for the second gram of CO2
25 Euro for the third gram of CO2
95 Euro from the fourth gram of CO2 onwards.
From 2019 manufacturers will have to pay 95 euro for each gram exceeding the target.
Eco-innovations:
Following a demand by the Environment Committee, the compromise states that car manufacturers can apply to be given special credits for eco-innovations - that is innovative CO2 reducing technologies on the car, such as energy efficient lights, which are currently not included in the normal test cycle. The total contribution of those technologies can be up to a 7- gram CO2 reduction of each manufacturer's average specific target.
Special targets for small manufacturers:
The compromise allows- as proposed by the Commission- small manufacturers which produce less than 10,000 new registered cars to apply to the commission for a derogation from the specific emissions target.
As demanded by the Environment committee, also larger independent car manufacturers - producing 10,000 to 300,000 new registered cars per year - will have the chance to apply for an alternative target of reducing their average specific emissions by 25 per cent compared to 2007 levels. Such application may be made by the manufacturer or together with any of its connected undertakings.
Supercredits
In its vote, the Environment committee had proposed to introduce a multiplier for ultra low carbon vehicles, to give incentives to car manufacturers. The compromise states that each new passenger car with CO2 emissions of less than 50 g CO2/km shall count as: 3,5 cars in 2012 and 2013, 2,5 cars in 2014 and 1,5 cars in 2015. By this calculation the average CO2 emissions from manufacturers will be reduced. From 2016 it shall count as any other car.

2. MEPs and Council Presidency reach deal on renewables directive (Turmes report)
After several rounds of informal negotiations, EP negotiators have reached an agreement with the Council's Presidency on a proposed directive on renewable energies including biofuel targets. The compromise still needs to be formally endorsed by the full Council and put to a first-reading vote at Parliament's December plenary session in Strasbourg.
MEPs and the Council's Presidency reached an informal compromise on a proposed directive which establishes mandatory national targets to be achieved by the Member States, so as to ensure that the EU will reach its climate target of at least 20% renewable energy in the total energy consumption by 2020.
Satisfied with the agreement, Parliament's rapporteur, Claude TURMES (Greens/EFA, LU) said: "This is a good day for climate and energy security in Europe. With this major legislation renewable energy will be put at the very heart of EU energy policies and at the same time reinvigorate the European economy and jobs through green technology investments".
2014 review will not change the 20% target
On Tuesday morning MEPs and the Council Presidency solved the last outstanding issue: they agreed that the Commission's evaluation of the implementation of the directive, which is to take place by 2014, will not affect the overall 20% target but will serve to improve, if necessary, the efficiency of cooperation mechanisms.
Achieving national targets jointly through cooperation mechanisms
The political agreement fully incorporated the Industry Committee's proposals for cooperation mechanisms to allow Member States to:
run joint projects with one or more Member States on green electricity production, heating or cooling;
transfer renewable energy "statistically" between each other;
join or partly coordinate their national support schemes.
The compromise also adds the possibility to count green electricity consumed in a Member State but produced by newly constructed joint projects with third countries.
10% target for the transport sector
The informal compromise backs the target of at least 10% renewable energies in the transport sector by 2020:
"second-generation" biofuels produced from waste, residues, or non-food cellulosic and ligno-cellulosic biomass will be double credited towards the 10% target;
renewable electricity for trains will be counted only once;
renewable electricity consumed by electric cars will be considered 2.5 times its input;
to be counted biofuels must save at least 35% of greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels; from 2017 greenhouse gas emission savings of existing installations must be at least 50%, those of new installations at least 60%;
the Commission will develop a methodology to measure the greenhouse gas emissions caused by indirect land use changes - that is when crops for biofuels production are grown in areas which have previously been used to grow a food crop and this food crop production then moves to other areas which were not in use before (e.g. existing forests)
National targets
National overall targets for the share of energy from renewable sources in final consumption of energy in 2020.
UK and Ireland
Share of energy from renewable sources in final consumption of energy, 2005 (S 2005 ) =1.3% UK 3.1% -Ireland
Target for share of energy from renewable sources in final consumption of energy, 2020 (S 2020 ) =15% UK 16% Ireland

3. EU Emission Trading System (ETS -Doyle report)
Parliament and the Council have yet to agree from when all new CO 2 emission permits are be auctioned under the next edition of the EU Emission Trading System (EU ETS), or upon which industries will get how many allowances for free and for how long (although deals have been struck on other issues). Parliament, Council and Commission representatives are to meet this Saturday to seek an agreement on the outstanding points. Any compromise needs to be put to a first-reading vote at Parliament's December plenary session in Strasbourg and then has to be approved by the Council.
The EU ETS is a "cap and trade" system: it caps the overall level of emissions allowed but, within that limit, allows participants to buy and sell allowances as they require, so as to cut emissions cost-effectively. Launched in January 2005, it is a key tool for achieving the EU's aim of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20 % by 2020 from 1990 levels, or by 30% in event of an international agreement. The ETS currently covers over 10,000 installations in the energy and industrial sectors, which are collectively responsible for close to half of the EU's emissions of CO 2 and 40% of its total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
The current ETS covers for example power stations, oil refineries and factories making cement, glass, lime, bricks, ceramics, and pulp. The Commission proposes to extend its scope to include new industries (e.g. aluminium and ammonia producers and petrochemicals) and two further gases (nitrous oxide and perfluorocarbons). With its proposal the Commission plans to reduce GHG emissions from most industrial sectors covered by the ETS by 21% from 2005 levels by 2020.
In the first and second trading periods (2005 -2012) the great majority of allowances were allocated free of charge to installations. The Commission now proposes that, from 2013, full auctioning of emission allowances should be the rule. A phasing in of auctioning is proposed for manufacturing industries. According to the Commission proposal, industries will receive a certain quota of emission allowances free of charge but will have to purchase any further emission allowances.
Remaining issues
No agreement has been reached yet on how and when auctioning shall be introduced or which industries will get how many allowances for free for how long, since no final Council position has been established. Other outstanding issues include the use of the auction revenues, the funding of carbon capture and storage (CCS). These issues are to be debated at the forthcoming European Council with a view to adopting a Council position. Thereafter, another meeting between the French Presidency of the Council and MEPs will be scheduled to discuss outstanding issues and seek an agreement between the parliaments delegation led by Avril Doyle (EPP-ED, IR) and the Council. If an agreement can be reached on all outstanding points, Parliament plans to vote on the agreement at its first reading, on 17 December.
Environment Committee backs Commission proposal for full auctioning of permits, with an exception for energy-intensive industries
In its 17 October vote on the report by Avril DOYLE (EPP-ED, IE), the Environment Committee backed Commission plans to phase out free emission permits, leading to full auctioning, with an exception for energy-intensive sectors. The Committee said that 85% of all emission allowances for the manufacturing sector should be allocated free of charge in 2013 (not 80%, as proposed by the Commission), a share that is to be reduced to 0 % in 2020.
The committee also backed the Commission's proposed exception for sectors at serious risk of "carbon leakage" - that is the relocation of production to third countries with a less strict climate policy, leading to increased CO 2 emissions by these countries. MEPs agreed that these sectors might receive up to 100% of free allowances until 2020. MEPs did not list the sectors "exposed to carbon leakage" but asked the Commission to identify them three months earlier than the Commission's proposed date of 31 March 2010, and then to revise them every four years, rather than every three. They also set out detailed criteria for identifying sectors exposed to carbon leakage.
Use auction revenues to adapt to climate change in the EU and reduce emissions in developing countries
The Environment Committee wants to channel the ETS auction revenues - which, according to Commission estimates could amount to around €50 billion annually by 2020 - to pay for climate change protection measures. They say that at least 50% of these revenues should be paid into a dedicated international fund, which invests in projects in developing countries to help, for example, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or to reverse deforestation. The remaining auction revenues should also be used to fund climate change projects inside the EU, say MEPs, thus helping Member States to adapt to climate change or to fund research and development.
Carbon capture and storage: demonstration projects to be financed through allowances
The Environment Committee wants to use the ETS to support large-scale commercial demonstration projects undertaken in the capture and geological storage of carbon dioxide (CCS). MEPs therefore introduced the possibility of awarding up to 500 million allowances to such projects in the EU or in third countries. It also asks the Commission to strive to ensure that contracts for the construction of 12 large-scale demonstration facilities are let before the UN meeting in Copenhagen in November 2009 (as promised by the EU Council in March 2007).
MEPs want aviation to be treated like other sectors
Until now, Council has not wished to reopen the question of how to deal with the aviation sector in the ETS directive. The Environment Committee has asked for the aviation sector to be treated like other manufacturing sectors, meaning that from 2013, the sector shall receive 85% of the allowances for free, and this quota would decrease by equal amounts each year, resulting in no free allocation in 2020. Council on the other hand wants to leave the situation as it is, meaning that the aviation sector would receive 85 % of the allowances for free, for the whole period.
Points agreed with the Council (subject to overall agreement and approval by the Parliament in plenary session and Council)
Include shipping in emissions trading if no international IMO agreement
MEPs and Council representatives have agreed that if an International Maritime Organisation agreement to include international maritime emissions in IMO reduction targets has not been approved by 31.12.2011, the Commission should propose that these emissions be included in the Community reduction commitment, to take effect by 2013.
Exclusion of small installations supported but widened
The compromise supports the Commission's proposal that Member States be allowed to exclude small installations from the scope of the system, provided they are subject to equivalent emission reduction measures. However, it raises the proposed thresholds, as proposed by the Environment Committee: Member States should be able to exclude installations with a rated thermal input below 35 MW (as opposed to 25 MW) and reported emissions of less than 25,000 tonnes of CO 2 equivalent (as opposed to 10,000 tonnes) in each of the three years + preceding the entry into force of the revised ETS.

4. Equipping power plants to store CO2 underground (CCS - Davies report)
Informal negotiations between a Parliament delegation led by rapporteur Chris Davies (ALDE, UK) and the Council's Presidency have not yet brought about an agreement on a draft directive providing the legal framework for the new carbon dioxide capture and storage technology (CCS).
Emissions from power plants - especially from those fired by oil, coal and natural gas - account for around 40 percent of all CO2 emissions in the EU, estimates the European Commission. To cut their CO2 emissions, industrial installations and power plants could in future use new technology to capture CO2 and store it "permanently and safely underground" in geological formations.
"Schwarzenegger clause": future power plants with capture technology
One of the issues in dispute concerns a new provision, which the rapporteur had termed the "Schwarzenegger clause". Parliament's Environment Committee had introduced this new provision into the draft directive setting an "emission performance standard" for new power plants with a capacity of more than 300 MegaWatts. The committee wants those large power plants to emit from 2015 onwards a maximum of 500 gram CO2 per kilowatt hour on an annual average basis. Thus, future power stations would be required to store carbon dioxide underground instead of emitting it to air. (Davies report amendment 126: art 32)
Secure financing of 12 demonstration projects by emission trading allowances
The European Council in March 2007 spoke out for constructing at least 12 large-scale commercial demonstration facilities by 2015 to test the permanent underground storage of CO2. As the financing of these projects is not yet secured, Environment Committee MEPs proposed in their vote on the revised EU Emission Trading System to award up to 500 million ETS allowances in the new entrance reserve to large-scale CCS projects in the EU or in third countries. (Doyle report amendment 56: art 1 point 8) The value of this support mechanism will depend on the price of CO2 when the gas is eventually buried underground, but according to the rapporteur it could easily exceed €10 billion.
However, no agreement with Council has been reached on this issue so far. The Council proposed to reserve only 100 to 200 million allowances for CCS projects - an offer which would provide for only up to 6 demonstration projects.
Furthermore, the Environment Committee wants the Commission to ensure that contracts for the construction of the 12 large-scale demonstration facilities are let before the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in November 2009.

5. Satu HASSI (Greens/EFA, FI) on efforts of Member States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions: Member States should face strict fines and sanctions if they fail to meet national reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions from sources that are not covered by the EU Emissions Trading System says the Environment Committee. MEPs backed national targets proposed by the Commission for 2013-2020. In addition, they set new EU long-term (post-2020) reduction targets of at least 50% by 2035 and of 60% to 80% percent by 2050 compared to 1990 levels. Member States whose greenhouse gas emissions are below its limit should be able to transfer, sell or lend part of its entitlement to another Member State, to help it meet its target. The transfer revenues should then be invested in energy efficiency, renewable energy or climate-friendly modes of transport, says the amended text. MEPs want the EU to provide grant-based financial assistance for developing countries to help them adapt to climate change. This assistance should increase from €5 billion in 2013 to at least €10 billion in 2020.
Member State greenhouse gas emission UK and Ireland
Member State greenhouse gas emission limits by 2020 compared to 2005 greenhouse gas emission levels for sources not covered under Directive 2003/87/EC - UK -16%, Ireland - 20%.

6. Cutting greenhouse gas emissions from transport fuels by 10% (Corbey report)
The revised fuel quality directive sets technical specifications on health and environmental grounds, as well as a target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions produced throughout the life cycle of transport fuels - that is of fossil fuels like petrol, diesel and gas-oil as well as of biofuels, blends, electricity and hydrogen.
Up to 10% reduction by 2020
In informal talks Parliament negotiators and the Council Presidency agreed that suppliers should by 2020 reduce "as gradually as possible" the greenhouse gas emissions caused by the extraction or cultivation, including land-use changes, transport and distribution, processing and combustion of fuels by up to 10%:
A binding 6% reduction compared to 2010 levels is to be reached by the end of 2020: Member States can set interim targets of 2% by the end of 2014 and a further 4% by the end of 2017.
An indicative additional 2% shall be obtained through the use of electric vehicles - such as cars, excavators, bulldozers or inland water vessels but not trains - or greenhouse gas saving technologies such as carbon capture and storage in the production process.
Credits purchased under the United Nations' Clean Development Mechanism shall achieve a further indicative 2% cut.
In its vote on the proposal on 27 November 2007, Parliament's Environment Committee had backed the Commission's binding obligation for fuel suppliers to cut emissions by 10 % by 2020. The compromise reached with Council, however, sets a binding 6% reduction and asks the Commission to submit a review by 2012 before the directive might be amended to make the indicative 4% reduction mandatory, too.
The cuts in greenhouse gas emissions could, for example, be achieved by using more biofuels, alternative fuels or by reducing "gas flaring and venting" at production sites, says the revised text. The World Bank estimates that gas flaring and venting - the burning off or releasing of natural gas wastes in oil wells and refineries - causes about 400 million tons of carbon dioxide in annual emissions.
Sustainable biofuels
To ensure that the CO2 reduction obligation does not lead to unsustainable production of biofuels, the production sustainability criteria of the revised renewables directive will be inserted into the fuel quality directive as well.
Introduce low-sulphur fuels to improve air quality
The updated fuel quality directive will limit the sulphur content of diesel to a maximum of 10 mg/kg. Furthermore, from 2011 gas oil (for example, used by inland water vessels, excavators, bulldozers, agricultural and forestry tractors) may contain no more than 20 mg/kg of sulphur.
Prevent health risks due to metallic additives
The amended directive will also require the Commission to assess the health and environmental risks from the use of metallic additives in fuel and to develop a test methodology. As long as such a test methodology is not yet established, fuels may not contain more than 6 mg of the metallic additive methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT) per litre from 1 January 2011. The limit will be lowered to 2 mg from 1 January 2014. Council & Commission statements + reports by Turmes, Doyle, Hassi, Davies, Corbey and Sacconi

Cleaning up heavy vehicle exhaust emissions: new Euro VI standards
2008-12-11 - 11:29
Proposed tougher limits on harmful exhaust emissions from trucks, lorries and buses, including ozone precursors such as nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons as well as particles were backed in a compromise adopted between Parliament and Council representatives. If the Plenary adopts this compromise, the new "Euro VI" regulation emission limits will apply de facto from 1.1.2014 for new vehicles, nine months earlier than the Commission proposed. The proposal concerns the so-called Euro VI regulation, laying down harmonized technical rules for trucks, lorries and buses (heavy vehicles over 2,610 kg), which all new vehicles will have to comply with in order to get the necessary type approval.
The new tougher emission limits (on harmful exhaust emissions, including ozone precursors such as nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons as well as particles) are to replace both the "Euro IV" limits (which have applied since November 2006), and the "Euro V" emission limits, which will apply from October 2008.
A first reading agreement has been achieved with Council which will be put to the vote - probably as one amendment.
The proposed Euro VI regulation, lays down harmonized technical rules for heavy vehicles over 2,610 kg, which all new vehicles will have to comply with in order to get the necessary type approval. The new emission limits are eventually to replace both the "Euro IV" limits (which have applied since November 2006), and the Euro V emission limits, which will apply from October 2008. The compromise broadens the scope of the regulation for certain cases if the manufacturer requests so.
Stricter limits of pollutants, no changes of Commission Proposal
The Compromise backs the Commission's proposed lower limit values for damaging emissions of several pollutants (CO, THC, NMHC, CH4, NOx, NH3). For example the limit value for total Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx), will be 400 mg/kWh (80 % less compared with EURO V), and the agreed particle mass limit will be 10 mg/kWh - a 66% reduction compared with the Euro V stage limits.
According to Commissions information the new limits will also be a step forward towards global harmonisation since the limit values are similar to those of the USA.
The Commission is asked to specify - if appropriate - in addition to the limit value for total Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) a specific limit value for Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) . If the Commission concludes that it is appropriate to regulate the emissions of additional pollutants it shall submit a proposal to the EP and Council.
All new vehicles to comply with Euro VI standards from 1.1.2014 at the latest
The compromise will in practice require all new heavy goods vehicles to comply with the standards from 1.1.2014, nine months earlier than the Commission's proposal. Thereafter, the registration, sale and putting into service of vehicles that do not comply with the standards will be prohibited. New types of vehicles must meet the standards one year earlier. The Commission is asked to adopt the associated technical regulation by the 1 April 2010, after which manufacturers will have time to make the necessary technical changes to the vehicles.
Access to vehicle repair information and financial incentives
The compromise backs the Commission's proposal to include measures relating to access to repair information in the regulation, so as to ensure effective competition on the market in repair and maintenance services. Similar measures already exist for the relevant legislation on passenger cars (Euro 5). The compromise foresees an adaptation of those provisions to the particularities of heavy goods vehicles.
Finally, the compromise also follows the Commission's proposal to enable Member States to provide for financial incentives to accelerate the placing on the market of vehicles meeting the new requirements.

Working Time Directive: MEPs to vote on opt-out
2008-12-11 - 11:29
At its next plenary session in Strasbourg, the European Parliament will vote at second reading on the working time directive. The directive is being revised in order to strike a balance between protecting workers and the flexible organisation of work, and to take account of rulings by the European Court of Justice. The debate will take place in Strasbourg on Monday 15 December and the vote on Wednesday 17 December. An absolute majority of MEPs (393) is needed in plenary to confirm the Employment Committee's amendments or to adopt any other amendment to the Council's common position.
The 1993 directive on the organisation of working time lays down basic principles concerning maximum weekly working hours, daily rest time, breaks, weekly rest time, annual holidays and the duration of night work. It also lists various derogations that Member States may allow for certain categories of worker (for example senior executives) or certain sectors.
Some articles of the directive were due to be reviewed after ten years. The review must also take account of rulings of the Court of Justice regarding on-call time. The Court has delivered two judgments - in the SIMAP and Jaeger cases - which define as working time doctors' on-call periods taken as a whole, in the light of the rules requiring their physical presence in a health care establishment.
Against this background, the Commission in September 2004 put forward a proposal to amend the directive. Parliament voted at first reading in May 2005. After three years of deadlock, the Council reached an agreement in June 2008 (Belgium, Cyprus, Greece, Spain and Hungary did not support the compromise). The EP Committee on Employment and Social Affairs voted at second reading on 5 November 2008 (rapporteur: Alejandro Cercas, PES, ES) and restated its first-reading position, notably on the two controversial points: opt-outs and on-call time. The full Parliament now has to give its verdict.
The future of the opt-out clause
In 1993 the United Kingdom won an opt-out clause allowing it not to apply the maximum 48-hour working week if a worker agrees to work longer.
At first reading, Parliament proposed the abolition of this clause, which is used in some Member States (generally in the UK and in certain sectors in other States), three years after the revised directive enters into force.
In June this year, EU employment and social affairs ministers reached an agreement. Under their common position of 15 September 2008, working time in the EU must be limited to 48 hours maximum unless a Member State introduces an opt-out clause and a worker decides to use that clause. For workers who opt for the derogation, the legislative text lays down a maximum of 60 hours of work a week on average over a three-month period. This can be increased to 65 hours a week on average over three months where there is no collective bargaining agreement and where the inactive period of on-call time is regarded as working time. The text also stipulates various safeguards for workers who use the opt-out clause.
At second reading the EP Employment and Social Affairs Committee restated its position calling for the abolition of the opt-out within 36 months of the revised directive's entry into force. Most MEPs felt that an annualisation of the reference period for calculating weekly working hours would allow a sufficiently flexible organisation of working time.
UK government position - support for common position
The Council Common Position amending the Working Time Directive solves the problems of on-call time and the timing of compensatory rest caused by the original directive, which pose particular problems for health sectors in most EU Member States. It also offers a balanced outcome on the opt-out, retaining the possibility for Member States to allow individuals to work longer hours if they wish (used by 14 Member States); but introducing additional safeguards to ensure the individual's decision to do so remains an entirely free choice. The UK government consequently hopes the EP will not re-open the delicate compromise struck by Council. This took over four years to deliver and was only reached after considerable compromises were made by all sides as part of a package, that also included agreement of the Temporary Agency Work Directive.
Annualisation of the reference period
In May 2005, at first reading, Parliament proposed extending the reference period for calculating weekly working hours from four to twelve months (known as "annualisation of the reference period") under certain conditions, in order to prevent any risk to workers' health and safety. The aim was to strike a balance between health and safety and the need for work to be organised flexibly, as well as to simplify the existing directive, which allowed various derogations and exceptions.
The text approved by the Council allows Member States to provide for a twelve month reference period in the legislation following consultations with employers' and employees' organisations. However, the maximum reference period will be six months in Member States which decide not to use the opt-out clause.
Definition of on-call time as working time
The Council and Commission introduced the ideas of "active" on-call time (a period during which the worker must be available at the workplace in order to work when required by the employer) and "inactive" on-call time (a period when the worker is on call but is not required by his employer to work).
In its common position the Council says that inactive on-call time should not count as working time unless otherwise decided by national law or by agreement between employers' and employees' representatives in accordance with national law.
At its vote on 5 November 2008 the Employment and Social Affairs Committee reiterated its position that any period of on-call time, including inactive time, is to count as working time. However, inactive on-call periods can be calculated in a specific way for the purposes of complying with maximum weekly average working time.
Reconciling work and family life
The existing directive contains no specific provisions on reconciling work and family life. The Council has accepted Parliament's first-reading amendments on the need to reconcile work and family life better. The Member States urge employers' and employees' representatives to reach an agreement on this. In addition, Member States must ensure that employers inform workers in good time of any planned major changes in the organisation of working hours.
In its second-reading amendments, the Employment and Social Affairs Committee beefed up this provision, so that employers will have to inform workers well in advance of any changes in working hours. In addition, workers will be entitled to request changes in their working hours, and employers will have to take account of such requests in a fair manner and can only refuse them for valid reasons.
Other provisions
Regarding rest periods, the general principle is that, where normal rest periods cannot be taken, workers should be given periods of compensatory rest. The Council's common position states that it shall be up to Member States to determine the length of a "reasonable period" within which compensatory rest is to be granted. The EP committee believes that compensatory rest periods should be granted "following periods of time spent on duty", in accordance with the relevant law or an agreement between the two sides of industry.
The committee proposes other amendments clarifying the situation of workers bound by more than one contract. Here it says that working time is to be defined as the sum of the periods of time worked under each contract.
It also stipulates the categories of senior executive exempted from the directive: chief executive officers, senior managers directly subordinate to them and persons directly appointed by a board of directors.

European Works Council - better information and consultation for workers
2008-12-11 - 11:29
Members of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee are proposing amendments to the recast directive on the European works councils, which was unveiled by the European Commission in July as part of the new social agenda. Around 820 European works councils are currently operating, representing some 14.5 million workers. Parliament and Council have agreed a first-reading agreement on this topic. The updates to Directive 94/45/EC proposed by the Commission are designed to tighten up the definitions of information and consultation of workers, define the powers of European works councils, require employees' representatives to report to the employees they represent and enable them to receive the training they require without loss of wages.
Other changes include clarifying the rules for setting up new works councils, recognising the role of trade unions and adapting the works councils if firms are restructured.
Amendments by social partners
The Employment Committee adopted amendments to the report, which is drafted by Philip Bushill-Matthews (EPP-ED, UK), taking up proposals from the two sides of industry sent in a letter of 29 August to French minister Xavier Bertrand, who currently chairs the EU Employment and Social Affairs Council.
MEPs propose to alter the definitions of the terms "information" and "consultation" to make it clear that information for workers' representatives must enable them to "undertake an in-depth assessment" of the proposals and "prepare consultations with the competent body" of the firm. Works council must also have "the means required to apply the rights stemming from the directive" and "to collectively represent" workers' interests, say MEPs.
Article 13, as amended, now states that the directive shall not apply to firms in which there was already an agreement on 22 September 1996. An exemption is also applied to firms in which "an agreement is signed or an existing agreement is revised during the two years following the adoption" of the directive.
Other provisions
Following the court judgments in the Vilvoorde, British Airways and Marks and Spencer cases, MEPs also adopted amendments to clarify where a situation is "transnational". They decided that where a decision of closure or restructuring is taken in one Member State but affects the workers in another, it must be considered transnational.
They also abolished the threshold of 50 employees for setting up special negotiating bodies (as a first step to constituting European works councils) so as not to discriminate against small Member States which would have difficulty reaching this threshold.
Lastly, Member States must ensure that any measures taken ensure compliance with the directive are "adequate, proportional and dissuasive". MEPs also propose a full review of the directive three years after it is implemented.
Background
The directive is being recast in order to ensure that employees’ transnational information and consultation rights are effective, increase the proportion of European works councils set up (they currently exist in only 36% of firms to which the directive applies), increase legal certainty and ensure better linkage between the directives on information and consultation of employees.

EU credit system for vocational training to ease cross-border mobility
2008-12-11 - 11:29
The planned European Credit System for Vocational Education and Training (ECVET) will help ease cross‑border mobility of workers and create transparency for professional qualifications gained abroad, says the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. However, participating in the initiative should be voluntary and "variations between national qualifications must not be erased". ECVET is a European-level educational initiative aimed at creating a link between vocational training and university training. There are two reports drafted on behalf of the Employment Committee, which introduce amendments to the Commission proposal on establishing ECVET.
Gradual implementation that respects national characteristics
Thomas MANN (EPP-ED, DE) recommends that the initiative be introduced gradually and according to experience, with the voluntary participation of Member States. "A framework for implementation should be created by consensus and with respect for national characteristics."
To ensure relevance, transparency, comparability and mutual trust, a set of clear criteria must be established, while a "Europe-wide, uniform quantitative basis for the assigning of credits is desirable".
Further recommendations to ease implementation
The report by Thomas Mann also recommends that:
- overall qualifications should not be achievable only by means of accumulating the requisite units in Member States where a qualification, to be considered complete, requires a final examination.
- the deadline of 2012 put forward by the Commission for the introduction of ECVET be extended to allow for a test period.
- a "practical" ECVET users’ guide be prepared immediately.
- the administrative burden of ECVET be kept as low as possible by avoiding setting up a large‑scale European platform and by structuring the reporting system simply and clearly, so that it can be negotiated by SMEs and small establishments.
- the ECVET system must be available to, and useful for, other systems outside the EU, in order to fulfil the Lisbon objectives of a flexible, knowledge‑based economic area.
Second report
The report by Jan ANDERSSON (PES, SE) asks that a framework for the identification, support and exchange of best practices be provided at national, local and regional levels.
ECVET should be implemented in accordance with national legislation and practice, says the report, and a review of the implementation process should be undertaken every four years.
If used and further developed by the Member States, the report states, ECVET "could help them to further improve and develop their VET systems, support lifelong learning strategies, further European labour market integration and the implementation of the EQF and promote a culture of quality improvement at all levels, while respecting the rich diversity of national education systems."

Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought: 20th anniversary and 2008 winner Chinese political activist Hu Jia
2008-12-11 - 11:29
This year's Sakharov Prize ceremonies in Strasbourg have a dual character. To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the award, Parliament has invited a number of former winners of the Prize to Strasbourg. However, the winner of the Prize for 2008, Chinese dissident Hu Jia, will be unable to receive his award as he is imprisoned in China. Instead, a special ceremony will be held in Parliament's Plenary Chamber in his honour. Designed to honour those who dedicate their lives to defending human rights, democratic values and freedom of speech, the Sakharov Prize was first awarded in 1988. The winners have come from different parts of the world and have fought for different causes but all have one thing in common: their courage in the face of persecution. The European Parliament believes such individuals merit recognition and support, human rights and democracy being among the core values of the European Union.
The various facets of this year's ceremonies are described below.
* * *
Round table debate with former Sakharov Prize winners: Tuesday 16 December
All former Sakharov Prize winners still living have been invited to come to the EP to commemorate the 20th anniversary. Of these, most have accepted (see list below) and will take part in a special conference from 5-7pm on Tuesday 16 December. The discussions, to be moderated by Belgian journalist Jean-Paul Marthoz, will take place in room LOW N1.3, will be open to the press and will cover two themes:
- The role of the Sakharov Prize in supporting human rights campaigners
- The role of the Sakharov Prize winners in the development of European human rights policy
Launch of Sakharov Network: Tuesday 16 December
At the end of Tuesday evening's debates, EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering will officially launch the 'Sakharov Network'. The aim of this project is to link up past winners of the prize in the form of a network, thereby enabling the EP to support any campaigns being conducted by the laureates, who would in their turn play a role as ambassadors for human rights and more specifically for 'freedom of thought'. The launch is scheduled to take place at around 7pm.
Ceremony to honour 2008 prize winner Hu Jia: Wednesday 17 December
In the absence of Hu Jia, Wednesday's ceremony, at 12 noon , will include an official address by EP President Pöttering and an address by Elena Bonner, widow of Andrei Sakharov.
The ceremony will be followed at 12.30pm by a press conference with Mr Pöttering, accompanied by Elena Bonner.

A new directive to improve the safety of toys just before the festive season
2008-12-11 - 11:29
The European Parliament and Council have reached agreement on legislation aimed at making toys safer which will be debated and voted on in Strasbourg just before the festive season. The new legislation will beef up safety regulations and restrict the use of certain chemicals and heavy metals. The report on the safety of toys, drafted by Marianne Thyssen ( EPP-ED, BE) aims to strengthen and update the rules on toy safety. The existing directive has given good service but needs replacing. New types of toy have appeared on the market, with new materials and technologies being used for their manufacture. In addition, cases of toxic or dangerous toys being placed on the market, such as Mattel in 2007, have shown the need for tighter safety rules. Lastly, new horizontal rules, such as those on the "goods package", are about to enter into force and the toys directive needed to be brought into line with these. MEPs gave their backing to the Commission's draft legislation but propose amendments tightening restrictions on the use of chemicals and perfumes, clarifying the rules on warnings and totally banning the use of heavy metals in toy manufacture. Is this a toy which I see before me? A toy is defined under the directive as a product intended to be used for playing by children under 14 years of age. A list of products not regarded as toys is annexed to the text. It includes party decorations, collectors' items clearly intended for people aged fourteen or over (including reproductions of real firearms or faithful scale models), puzzles with more than 500 pieces, fireworks and new products such as video games and game consoles. Safety first Manufacturers will have to ensure that toys are not harmful or toxic to children's health. MEPs want Member States to apply the precautionary principle when enacting the legislation, especially if scientific evidence cannot determine whether a toy poses a risk. Any toy placed on the EU market must meet general safety standards. MEPs backed a clause proposed by the Commission which requires manufacturers and importers to keep the technical documentation and the EC declaration of conformity for a period of 10 years after the toy has been placed on the market. "Not suitable for under-threes" MEPs also clarified and strengthened the rules regarding warnings on packaging and on toys themselves: to make them more visible, they must be preceded by the word "Warning". Toys for children under 36 months must meet higher safety standards. Some toys bearing the warning "Not suitable for children under three years" are clearly intended for such children (e.g. rattles). If a toy is obviously intended for the under-threes, it will no longer be possible to use this misleading claim. Allergenic fragrances The Commission proposal bans the use of some allergenic fragrances. MEPs did not back a total ban but reached a compromise expanding considerably the list of banned substances, traces of which must not exceed a certain limit. This will affect toys such as play dough and dolls. A limited number of substances listed will be allowed in educational toys designed to develop the senses, such as "olfactory, gustative and cosmetic games". The Internal Market Committee also tightened up the restrictions on substances that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction (CMR), saying these should be almost completely banned. The conditions for exemption were clarified and made stricter. The EP has also restricted the use of heavy metals such as arsenic, cadmium, chromium (VI), lead, mercury and organic tin. Do not swallow Other amendments toughened up the clauses seeking to reduce the risk of suffocation or strangling by small detachable parts or toys contained in food such as chocolate eggs.
No more deafening toys
New provisions on noise emitted by toys will be established. The aim is to protect children from the risk of impairment of hearing caused by sound emitting toys. New standards will be stronger and more comprehensive, they will limit the peak values for both impulse noise and prolonged noise emitted by toys.
Legal update The broad legal framework governing the sale of goods in the EU has recently been updated. The toy safety directive is the first to reflect the requirements of the new framework. The old directive "is not sufficient to deal with the risks from imported toys, since 95% of toys in Britain and 80% in the EU are imported from China", said Arlene McCarthy (PES, UK), chair of the Internal Market Committee. The new legislation will require Member States to carry out stricter checks under Directive 2001/95/EC on general product safety.
Entry into force and implementation
The directive shall enter into force twenty days after its publication inn the Official Journal. However, in order to allow toy manufacturers and other economic operators sufficient time to adapt to the new requirements, it is necessary to provide for a transitional period of two years after the entry into force of this Directive during which toys which comply with the current legislation (Directive 88/378/EEC) may be placed on the market. In the case of chemical requirements, this period should be set at four years so as to allow the development of the harmonized standards which are necessary for compliance with those requirements.

Transport
Traffic offences: effective cross-border enforcement
2008-12-11 - 11:29
At present, drivers committing an offence under the Highway Code in a Member State other than their own often avoid paying the penalty imposed on local drivers. The Transport Committee recommends approving legislation to ensure that drivers will be able to be identified and fined for offences they commit anywhere in the EU. Speeding, drink-driving, not wearing a seat belt and failing to stop at a red light will all be covered by the proposal. The rapporteur is now working with the Commission, the French Presidency and the Member States concerned on an agreement on the proposal
The committee unanimously agrees that the current situation where drivers can often avoid penalties not only jeopardises road safety, but is also discriminatory with respect to local residents committing similar offences, who do face penalties. This unequal treatment of two groups of road users should, therefore, be stopped, argues rapporteur Inez Ayala SENDER (PES, ES) on behalf of the Transport Committee.
A ticket from abroad on your doormat which you will have to pay
The proposal establishes an electronic system for exchange of information between Member States on offences committed. The vehicle registration number and other personal data will be transmitted to be checked once an offence is spotted. After this verification by the Member States where the vehicle is registered, the relevant national authority will send an offence notification to the owner of the vehicle, asking for the payment of the penalty. Authorities will be designated in each Member State to assist them with the application of the directive. The committee makes proposals to ensure the protection of personal data that will be exchanged.
What if you do not pay?
If an offender receives an offence notification, this should, as a minimum, contain the name of the authority responsible for enforcing the sanctions. It should specify the amount of the fine, possible payments procedures, by when it must be paid, the possibilities for contesting the grounds of the offence and for appealing against a decision imposing a financial penalty. The committee also says that the notification should inform the holder that, if he refuses to pay, his refusal will be communicated to the authorities of his Member State for enforcement. Such enforcement will be governed by the law in the same way as for similar fines within the home Member State.
A further evaluation
The Commission was asked to submit, two years after the directive has entered into force, a report on its implementation. On the basis of that report, it should be considered whether the scope of the rules might be extended to other road traffic infringements.
EU-wide road safety guidelines
Members in the committee also insert in the Commission proposal a range of EU-wide road safety guidelines. As regards speed, they asked for increase by 30% of the numbers of speed checks in those Member States where the number of fatalities is above the EU average. As far as blood alcohol testing in concerned, Member States should, says MEPs in the committee, ensure that at least 30% of the drivers can be tested annually. As regards seat belt operations, intensive checks should be conducted at least for six weeks a year by Member States where less than 70% of the population wear seat belts, in particular where at times the non-compliance is frequent.
Information for European drivers
The committee feels that, if this proposal is to be effective, road users should be informed about its rules. This information should be passed on to drivers by, for example, road safety bodies and automobile clubs.
More safety on our roads
Members in the committee believe that, by adopting these measures, a contribution will be made to more safety on our roads. The EU has set itself the ambitious objective of reducing by 50% the number of persons killed on the roads by 2010. The four offences covered by this proposal are the leading causes of road deaths: almost 75%.

Budget
Budget 2009: Budgets Committee backs deal with Council but restates EP priorities
2008-12-11 - 11:29
Parliament's Budgets Committee is proposing its second reading on the draft EU budget for 2009. MEPs endorse the agreement concluded with the Council on the level of payments (€116.1 billion) while increasing some expenditure on the EP's priorities (growth, cohesion, employment) above the level of the preliminary draft budget. The agreement on the "food facility" for developing countries was also approved. The committee, voting on the report by Jutta HAUG (PES, DE), confirmed the overall level of payments for the 2009 budget at €116,096,062,329, the figure agreed with Council on 21 November. MEPs believe this amount will enable Parliament to preserve the policy priorities it identified at first reading, in particular the funding for Heading 1 (employment, growth, cohesion, competitiveness). Thus, for a number of measures and programmes, including research and the Galileo programme, MEPs voted for spending levels higher than those in the preliminary draft budget and the Commission's amendments thereto.
They also restored the spending increases adopted at first reading for Frontex (the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the EU Member States), the European Refugee Fund (Heading 3 - Citizenship, Freedom, Security, Justice) and climate change and energy-related measures and policies.
Implementing the budget better
The Budgets Committee also confirmed the overall figure for commitments (€133,778,879,246) at the level set by Parliament at first reading. MEPs are still concerned at the widening gap, year after year, between maximum expenditure levels (commitments) and expenditure that can actually be used (payments). In addition, they want the Commission and the Member States to improve the utilisation of cohesion funding and take steps to improve the implementability of the EU budget. The resolution accompanying the second reading of the budget in plenary on 18 December is likely to include these matters.
"Food facility" for developing countries
In addition, MEPs in the committe recommend approving the agreement with Council that will allow the payment of around €1 billion in farm aid to developing countries. Parliament successfully pressed for this instrument, known as the "food facility", to be financed mainly from €760 million of new money, with transfers from Heading 4 (external relations) being limited as far as possible. It was on this condition that MEPs agreed to spread the programme, originally earmarked for 2008/2009, into 2010.
For 2009, the Budgets Committee has created a special budget heading of €568 million in commitments and rectified the structure of the expenditure, to take account of the amounts needed to finance this aid.
133.777.879.273 (commitments); as percentage of GNI: 1,03%
( The EP will maintain the level on non-obligatory expenditure in commitments adopted at the first reading)
116.096.062.329 (payments); as percentage of GNI: 0,894%
(agreed with the Council on 21.11.2008)

Non-obligatory expenditure = other expenses (e.g., personnel). The EP decides in co-operation with the Council. At first reading, Parliament may vote, by an absolute majority, for amendments to non-compulsory expenditure.
The second reading procedure: the Council of the European Union adopts compulsory expenditure and can modify non-compulsory expenditure. The draft is returned to Parliament, which adopts the non-compulsory expenditure. Parliament may reject the budget by an absolute majority of its members and two thirds of the votes cast.

Fundamental rights
Too many violations of fundamental rights in the EU, says the Civil Liberties Committee
2008-12-11 - 11:29
MEPs in the Civil Liberties Committee express their concern over the "high number of fundamental rights violations in the EU", pointing to instances of serious discrimination against minorities and threats to privacy. They also urge EU Institutions and Member States to cooperate in the field of immigration and asylum. The vote on this report will take place in January 2009. In a report drafted by Giusto CATANIA (GUE/NGL, IT), the committee proposes its overview of the situation of fundamental rights in the EU. A previous report on this issue was rejected by the plenary session in 2004 and the committee has aimed for a broad compromise.
MEPs in the committee address fundamental rights in its various aspects, voicing recommendations on a broad range of issues like discrimination, immigration, social rights or gender equality.
Excesses in the fight against terrorism
MEPs in the committee point out that over these last few years, the fight against terrorism has often served to diminish the level of protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, notably the right to privacy, data protection and freedom from discrimination. They call on the EU and Member States to ensure full compliance with international standards in this matter.
CIA activities in Europe : Member States deaf to EPs recommendations
Concerning Parliament's report on CIA activities in the EU adopted in February 2007, MEPs in the committee stress that their recommendations have not been followed so far by Member States and EU institutions. However, they welcome the statement by US President-elect Barack Obama that he intends to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, and call on Member States to "find solutions" for the inmates who cannot be put on trial.
Discrimination against Roma people: Members oppose fingerprinting
MEPs in the committee point to the "segregation" faced by Roma people in Member States and the "widespread anti-Roma sentiments" leading to "frequent denial of their rights by public authorities and their political under-representation". Moreover, they suffer "discrimination by the police, in particular deliberate shootings, arson, assault or other violent acts (...) inter alia by taking fingerprints or other forms of data collection", MEPs in the committee say. They call on the Member States to "take measures to put an end to the practice of unofficial marriage of minors, often at a very young age, existing in some Roma communities".
Same-sex couples: partnerships should be recognised
The committee calls on Member States to take legislative action to overcome discrimination experienced by same-sex couples by recognising such relationships. Member States with legislation on same-sex partnerships are invited to recognise provisions with similar effects adopted by others.
Immigration and integration: the need to avoid exclusion
"Rather than focusing all their efforts on preventing illegal immigration", which led to "deploying a growing range of frontier checks" MEPs say, EU Institutions and Member States should introduce "effective, long term and legal migration policies" and "more flexible and coordinated rules" for asylum seekers. The committee also condemns "the lack of effective integration policies", causing "the exclusion of hundreds of thousands of non-nationals", putting them "in a vulnerable position, opening the way to radicalisation, trafficking and other forms of exploitation".
Regional languages
The Civil Liberties Committee wants to promote regional or minority languages, as "the right to speak and to be educated in one's mother tongue is one of the most basic fundamental rights", MEPs say.

Fundamental rights
European area of freedom, security and justice (FSJA) - questions to Council
2008-12-11 - 11:29
At the end of 2009 the European Council should adopt the new multiannual programme for the FSJA. Ten years after Tampere, the European Union ‘acquis’ is now substantial, even if its overall balance seems to be more oriented to cooperation between administrations, especially in security matters, than to the protection and promotion at European level of citizens’ fundamental rights. Bearing this in mind, Gérard DEPREZ (ALDE, BE), on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs will be asking the Council the following questions on progress in 2008 of the European area of freedom, security and justice (FSJA)
1. Could the Council agree with Parliament’s first recommendations adopted on 25 September 2008?
2. Does the Council also agree that:
(a) protection of fundamental rights inside the European Union should become a permanent issue of the FSJA by: re-launching the proposal for procedural rights in judicial proceedings, taking regular stock of the implementation of EU measures such as the EAW and the anti-terrorism strategy, systematically asking the Fundamental Rights Agency to evaluate the impact of new EU measures, creating a specialised Council Working Group and widening the relevant chapter of the Council annual report on Fundamental Rights.
(b) Since the European Council Immigration Pact will give rise to a number of new core policies in the areas of immigration, asylum and integration, a Council meeting of the relevant Ministers should be set up for the purposes of implementing the necessary measures and policies in a coherent manner.
(c) Police cooperation being more and more grounded at European level (with the Schengen and Prüm cooperation, the Swedish Initiative on exchange of intelligence data, the Europol OCTA regular reports, the Framework Decision on Data Protection), the time has come to establish a fully-fledged European Internal Security Strategy under the control of the European and national parliaments.
(d) A coherent Judicial space should be established by improving the mutual understanding of the national judiciary systems, strengthening mutual recognition measures (such as the European Evidence Warrant) and the interoperability of networks and services (as is happening for criminal records interconnection) and by reinforcing the European Judicial Training Network (EJTN).
(e) A more transparent and coherent external policy, compliant with fundamental rights, should be established with third countries such as USA, Russia, etc., while negotiating Prüm-like agreements, as well as extradition and mutual legal assistance, and readmission agreements, notably when it comes to countries which are not parties to the Geneva Conventions.
3. Does the Council agree that by implementing the National Parliaments Protocol and
– for the sake of common standards of transparency for European citizens and their representatives, and
– the need for loyal cooperation between the institutions at European and national level, the national parliaments should be directly informed by the Council of its own legislative proposals and amendments falling in the FSJA area (as the Commission has already been doing for its own proposals since 2006)?

Economic and monetary affairs
Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee recommends approving increase in bank deposit guarantee
2008-12-11 - 11:29
If a European bank fails, citizens' savings should be guaranteed up to €100,000, says the Economic and Monetary Affairs, endorsing a Commission proposal to raise the deposit guarantee to this amount. The committee also proposed that holders be given faster access to their deposits in emergencies and that a mechanism be established for cross-border cooperation in the event of another economic crisis. The committee is proposing a report by Christian EHLER (EPP-ED, DE), which, if approved by Parliament in plenary session, would amend existing legislation on deposit guarantee schemes and raise the guarantee level in the event of deposits being unavailable. The report also modifies the deadline for payouts and proposes setting up an emergency fund.
Agreement to raise the deposit guarantee level
Committee members approve the Commission proposal to raise the level of guarantee to at least €50,000 when the new legislation enters into force and to €100,000 by the end of 2009. They considered the current level of protection, set at €20,000, to be inadequate for a large number of deposits in the EU.
The committee nonetheless proposed to amend the proposal so that the increase will take effect unless a Commission impact assessment, to be ready by April 2009, suggests it is not financially viable for all Member States.
Faster payouts and an early warning system for future crisis
The committee also agrees to reduce the payout period, in the event of deposits being unavailable, from three months to 14 days. MEPs in the committee also call for a payment of at least €1,000 to be made available to the depositor for emergency needs within three days.
MEPs in the committee ask the European Commission to propose, by the end of 2009, a series of measures and procedures to ensure co-ordination among all Member States in the event of another cross-border financial crisis. This proposal should include provisions for a more effective early warning system for risks, they add.
If the new legislation is endorsed at Parliament's Strasbourg plenary session and subsequently by the Council, Member States will be required to bring it into force by 31 December 2008 at the latest.

Reducing administrative burden for EU's mid-sized companies
2008-12-11 - 11:29
Aimed at reducing administrative burden for EU companies, the Commission is proposing legislative measures in the areas of company law, accounting and auditing as part of a second fast track package. Ieke van den BURG (PES, NL) will be tabling a report, on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee, which introduces five amendments to the Commission proposal. Small and medium-sized companies are often subject to the same rules as larger companies, but their specific accounting needs have rarely been assessed. Extensive reporting rules create a cost burden and can hinder efficient use of capital for productive purposes.
Commission proposal good for reducing reporting burden for SMEs
Ieke van den BURG supports the Commission's proposal for targeted changes to the Accounting Directives, aimed at reducing administrative burden for medium-sized companies, but warns that these changes "should not lead to less transparency and to a significant loss of information for the users of accounts".
The rapporteur also supports the proposed removal of disclosure requirements for formation expenses because "extending the scope of the exemptions for small companies, which are already widely used by most of the Member States, also for medium sized companies, would lead to a reduction of reporting burden for these companies".
Review of the 4th and 7th Company Law Directives
The proposed amendment to the 7th Company Law Directive is welcome, says the report, because the relationship between the IAS Regulation and the 7th Company Law Directive is not clear in cases where parent companies have no material subsidiaries. "It has to be considered excessive to require the preparation of consolidated accounts in the situation where a parent company only has immaterial subsidiaries."
The report urges the Commission to continue its efforts on reviewing the 4th and 7th Company Law Directives and to present a European and uniform accountancy framework, including those which now maybe excluded from the scope of the directive, before the end of 2009.
Exchanging financial information through the Internet would also simplify things
Simplification should also be "very much stimulated by a European and structured introduction of XBRL", a computer language for financial reporting that allows companies to publish, extract, and exchange financial information through the Internet and other electronic means, the report concludes. Rapporteur Ieke VAN DEN BURG PES NL A6-0462/2008 Company law: disclosure requirements for medium-sized companies and obligation to draw up consolidated accounts (amend. 4th and 7th Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC) Procedure : Codecision (1st reading)

Financial services rules: clearing and settlement and credit claims
2008-12-11 - 11:29
MEPs are to vote on proposals to update European rules relating to two aspects of the “plumbing” of the financial system: the aim, on the one hand, is to reflect in law the increasingly interconnected operation of clearing and settlement systems, and, on the other hand, to create a level playing field for central banks in Europe regarding the rules on accepting credit claims (receivable assets resulting from bank loans) as collateral from commercial banks. Key points
Clearing and settlement is the process by which, after trades are made in financial markets, ownership of the shares, financial instruments or other products is actually transferred to the buyer and the funds for the sale actually transferred to the seller. The EU has been encouraging competition and choice between the systems involved. There are also increasing links between different systems, enabling more efficient operation, but the law needs to be updated to provide a framework for such interlinked operation, to make it clear, for example, how supervisory arrangements work in these cases, and where liabilities lie in case of insolvencies of some of the actors concerned. MEPs in the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee are proposing a number of amendments to improve definitions and clarity in the text.
Credit claims (i.e. the fact that a bank has a loan outstanding with an individual or company) have been able to be used as collateral for commercial banks in their arrangements with the ECB since 2007; some central banks already accepted them, but with differing rules applying. The proposal seeks to harmonise the rules on their acceptance. MEPs in the committee are proposing a number of changes, notably regarding exceptions for consumer loans and to small enterprises and regarding formal notification arrangements.

New employment and payment system for MEPs' assistants
2008-12-11 - 11:29
The Legal Affairs committee endorses legislation to add-on contracts of Brussels-based MEPs' assistants to the statute for European civil servants. This new scheme, of which the outlines were set out by the European Parliament in July, is part of a larger package of measures taken by the Parliament to overhaul the entire system of employing and paying MEPs' assistants. The proposal is due for a vote in Parliament's plenary in December in Strasbourg. The committee’s report, drafted by Giuseppe GARGANI (EPP-ED, IT) aims at ensuring transparency and non-discrimination through a set of common rules on the system for hiring MEPs' assistants. The new regulation, once approved by the Council, will replace 27 different national systems on contractual relationships, taxation and social security with a single scheme.
Common rules for all Brussels-based assistants
Assistants based in Brussels will constitute a specific category of staff, taking into account their specific task of supporting Members in carrying out their duties.
The present proposal means assistants' employment contracts will be concluded for a specific period, although all contracts will end automatically at the end of a legislature. Assistants will have similar social benefits to those of EU civil servants. Their salaries will be dependent on their grade.
The contracts of, and salary payments to, the assistants will be handled by the Parliament's financial services, but the MEPs will be entirely free in their choice of assistants, the tasks to be assigned to them and the duration of the labour contracts.
New rules also for assistants working in Member States
The larger package of measures includes not only a European statute for assistants working in Brussels but also the handling of contracts of and payments to assistants working in the Member States by qualified and duly recognised payroll organisations in those countries.
In addition, the approved text sets out that a maximum of 25% of the parliamentary assistance allowance may be used for services such as research studies or other advisory work.
The legislative procedure
As the statute for Brussels-based assistants entails an adaptation of the regulations covering EU civil servants and other staff, a formal legislative procedure was required. After the plenary vote in December, the changes will need the final approval of the Council. The aim is to have the new assistants' statute enter into force in July next year, right after the European elections, at the same time as the new statute for Members of the European Parliament.

Operational solidarity between Member States essential in the fight against illegal immigration, say MEPs
2008-12-11 - 11:29
All Member States should meet their obligations with regard to the fight against illegal immigration, and should make available the material and human resources to enable FRONTEX, the agency responsible for managing operational cooperation at the external borders of the EU, to "function effectively", says Javier Moreno SÁNCHEZ on behalf of the Civil Liberties Committee. The Committee's own-initiative report on the evaluation and future development of the FRONTEX agency and of the European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR) considers the agency to be an "essential instrument" in the EU's global strategy on immigration and calls on the Commission to "present proposals to review the mandate of the Agency in order to strengthen its role and make it more effective".
Member States should meet their obligations
According to the report, participation of the Member States in FRONTEX operations has been "patchy". On average, seven Member States took part in operations at sea borders, nine at land borders and 11 at air borders, the report states.
MEPs urge Member States to commit themselves to giving "concrete expression" as soon as possible to the principle of "compulsory solidarity" as set out in the rules of the Rapid Border Intervention Teams (RABIT), by increasing the material resources they make available to the Agency, and by guaranteeing that they will be unconditionally available in practice in a timely manner.
To this end, MEPs ask that FRONTEX send a report to Parliament and the Council highlighting any difficulties encountered and providing full information on which Member States are providing assets and which are not.
Noting that "democratic oversight of FRONTEX's activities would, among other things, enhance its legitimacy", the report calls for "the strengthening of democratic control of FRONTEX by the European Parliament".
Challenges of the Border Surveillance Scheme
Finally, MEPs welcome the Council's discussion on setting up the EUROSUR border surveillance scheme, observing that the main challenge is to improve coordination of the existing surveillance infrastructures and extend their cover, which currently reaches only part of the areas where operations need to be carried out. "The success of EUROSUR requires the full involvement of the third countries concerned, particularly those of the southern shore of the Mediterranean, from which the greatest migratory pressure on the EU comes."
Agency operations - the facts
According to figures in the report, the Agency has already carried out 28 joint operations in 2006 and 2007: nine at sea borders, 12 at land borders and seven at air borders, plus ten pilot projects to supplement these operations. In the course of two years, more than 53 000 people have been apprehended or refused entry at borders, more than 2900 forged travel documents detected and 58 smugglers of illegal immigrants arrested.

e-Justice portals give citizens and businesses improved access to justice
2008-12-11 - 11:29
e-Justice portals should be created to provide citizens and businesses with improved access to justice, says the Committee on Legal Affairs. In its own-initiative report, the Committee calls on the European Commission to put forward a legislative proposal on e-Justice that would not only improve access to justice, but would facilitate a cross-border judicial system and contribute to an efficient single market. The report, drafted by Diana WALLIS (ALDE, UK), recommends the creation of two separate e-Justice portals - one would be the European e-Justice portal for citizens, and the other would be a secure system designed specifically for judicial authorities.
Future legislation available online
The Committee suggests that the proposed legislation would ensure that all future legislation in the field of civil law "is designed in such a way that it can be used in online applications".
It also suggests that the Commission audit existing legislation to make it compatible with the requirements of e-Justice. More specifically, citizens and businesses should have direct access to the European small-claims procedure, the European enforcement order and the alternative dispute resolution (ADR). "The aim should be to provide a panoply of effective, simple instruments which are useful to and useable by ordinary citizens and small businesses, not a system which only favours commercial litigants processing bulk claims."
Terms and conditions for e-commerce
The Committee asks that the Commission "get to work on" standard terms and conditions for electronic commerce so that consumers can access the application of standard European contract law to their transactions. Rapporteur Diana WALLIS ALDE UK A6-0467/2008 E-Justice Procedure : own-initiative

Fighting counterfeited goods is a priority, says the International Trade Committee
2008-12-11 - 11:29
To fight the burgeoning counterfeiting market, worth approximately €500, the Committee on International Trade is calling for specialised anti-counterfeiting teams to be set up in Member States. The business sector also has an important role in raising consumer awareness of the consequences of buying counterfeit goods, say MEPs, goods which are no longer confined to luxury and high-quality goods but also include commonly used products such as toys, medicines, cosmetics and food. The own-initiative report by Gianluca SUSTA (ALDE, IT) states that the European Union is the second world importer of goods and services and while "the extreme openness and transparency of its single market offers huge opportunities, it also poses serious risks of an invasion of counterfeit products."
Noting that 60% of counterfeit goods seized by EU customs authorities are produced in China, Parliament calls on the Commission, "together with the Chinese authorities, to present an action plan to fight counterfeiting as soon as possible", and encourages the Commission and Member States to "promote in the Euro-Mediterranean region a common approach to legislation".
MEPs in the committee also point out that the GSP regulation provides for the possibility of temporarily suspending preferences for those partners which implement unfair trading practices.
Parliament believes that efforts should be made to include emerging economies such as China, India, Brazil as well as regional trade blocs such as Mercosur, CARICOM and ASEAN, in order for them to take part in the negotiations of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreements (ACTA).
Raising consumer awareness
In light of the considerable health and safety risks which counterfeit products, including medicines, pose to consumers, Member States are asked to provide consumers with sufficient information on the dangers of counterfeiting and piracy.
Similarly, in view of the serious implications for the competitiveness of the EU and its businesses, Parliament asks the Commission to set up or facilitate a helpdesk for SMEs, preferably integrated with other helpdesk facilities, to give technical assistance to SMEs on the procedures for dealing with counterfeit goods.
Parliament also recommends "further improvement and better coordination of customs procedures in the European Union", stressing the need to develop appropriate ongoing training courses for customs staff, magistrates and other professionals.
MEPs call on the Commission to make all efforts to agree minimum sanctions in European criminal law for serious infringements of intellectual property rights.
Counterfeiting - the figures
According to the committee's report, the counterfeiting market accounts for some 7-10% of global trade, causing an estimated 200,000 in job losses for skilled workers in the EU. Counterfeited goods can endanger consumers' health, fund criminal and terrorist organisations and cause serious damage to the environment.
In 2007, the amount of goods seized by the customs authorities of the European Union that were in breach of Intellectual Property Rights increased by 17% against the previous year, with an increase of 264% for cosmetics and personal hygiene products, 98% for toys and 51% for medicines.

MEPs question the Commission on counterfeit goods just before the festive season
2008-12-11 - 11:29
Counterfeiting and piracy have developed at an increasing rate in recent years. In 2007, customs registered over 43 000 cases of fake goods seized at the EU's external border, compared to 37 000 in 2006, an increase of almost 17%. Counterfeiting is increasingly about fake medicines, fake food products, fake cosmetics, fake toys and fake electronic equipment. In addition to the serious economic damage to businesses in the internal market, these products can cause serious harm to consumers. Arlene McCARTHY (PSE, GB), on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection will be asking the Commission the following questions on consumer protection aspects of counterfeiting
1. What action can the Commission take to improve the administrative structure of the Commission's work in this field? Will the Commission set up an internal coordination unit in order to bring together the relevant teams of the different DGs and develop a joint action programme?
2. Can the Commission produce statistics on how many people have been harmed as a result of the market in counterfeit goods (especially in relation to health and safety)? Does the Commission consider current data collection in relation to consumer detriment adequate? Can the RAPEX system be improved to provide essential information on consumer harm as a result of counterfeit products?
3. What steps will the Commission take to ensure consumers´ trust and confidence in products on sale in the internal market? What further measures will the Commission take for stronger enforcement and (customs) controls inside and outside the EU?
4. What action will the Commission take to inform consumers of the threats to their health and safety presented by counterfeit goods? How will the Commission involve Member States in such action? Would the Commission support the idea of creating an EU observatory for counterfeiting goods and piracy? Arlene MCCARTHY PES UK Oral question to Commission

Free movement of goods
Building a genuine and transparent EU arms market
2008-12-11 - 11:29
The European Union should create a genuine single market for defence equipment. This is the aim of a directive on the transfer of defence-related products. MEPs and Council have reached a first-reading deal on this. In spite of coordinating efforts being undertaken between a limited number of Member States, the European defence market remains fragmented and divided. Twenty seven national licensing regimes currently exist. These regimes diverge widely in terms of procedure scope and required delays. Further, in all EU Member States, the export of defence related products (including comprehensive military equipments as well as sub-systems, components, spare parts, technologies) are subject to national licensing schemes.
This patchwork of schemes not only imposes a significant administrative burden on companies, it also includes significant lead times – up to several months. These burdens are out of proportion with actual control needs: license applications for intra-Community transfers are rarely rejected. Such divergences constitute a major impediment to industrial competitiveness, and a considerable obstacle to the emergence of a European Defence Equipment Market (EDEM) as well as the functioning of the Internal Market. According to a study carried out for the European Commission in 2005, the direct and indirect cost of obstacles to intra-community transfers amounts to EUR 3.16 billion per year. The processing of licences has a direct cost of EUR 434 million per year while indirect costs have been estimated at EUR 2.73 billion/year.
The purpose of this proposal, therefore, is to reduce existing obstacles to the circulation of defence-related goods and services (products) within the Internal Market, and to diminish the resulting distortions of competition
Defence-related products: simplifying transfer conditions
Heide Rhüle's report focuses on simplifying and harmonising the rules for granting licences to transfer military equipment from one country to another. There are currently 27 different regimes. This patchwork of rules prevents the free movement of equipment within the EU, whether for trade, repairs, modernisation or simply for trade fairs. The new proposal creates a European system of licences which will be uniform and applicable throughout the EU. Licences will nonetheless be granted by Member States, which will be free to impose sanctions if party to whom the licence is granted fails to observe the licensing conditions. Treaty Article 296 will continue to apply. The draft also stipulates that the directive shall apply without prejudice to Treaty articles 296 and 30.
The text proposed by MEPs strengthens provisions to guarantee the security of transfers, notably with respect to the final recipients of products or components, inter alia to ensure that arms and other defence-related products do not reach conflict zones.
Prior authorisation
The transfer of defence-related products between Member States shall be subject to prior authorisation. No further authorisation by other Member States shall be required for the passage through Member States or for the entrance on the territory of the Member State where the recipient is located of defence-related products without prejudice to the application of provisions necessary for the protection of public security or public policy such as, inter alia, the safety of transport.
Public policy or public security
Member States may revoke withdraw, suspend or limit the use of transfer licences they have issued at any time, for reasons of protection of their essential security interests, of public policy or public security or for non-compliance with the terms and conditions attached to the licence.

Regional policy
Reducing the bureaucratic burden on small and innovative regional development projects
2008-12-11 - 11:29
The report recommends that Parliament give its assent to a Commission proposal to revise Council Regulation 1083/2006 Article 55 (EU contributions to "revenue-generating" projects), so as to reduce the bureaucratic burden on small projects co-funded by the European Social fund (ESF), the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) or the Cohesion Fund, facilitate more innovative projects, especially in the environmental, social, energy and research fields, and accelerate funding decisions. Key points
Difficulties with existing Article 55
• administrative burden for small projects is disproportionate compared to the amounts of funding involved. Member States say that the Article 55 methodology, designed mainly for large projects (e.g. follow-up procedures that entail accounting for revenue for up to three years after an operational programme is wound up), would create an excessive burden if applied equally to all small projects.
• interpretation - how to achieve "proportionality" when calculating "maximum eligible expenditure" for small operations and monitoring it?
Proposed changes
• Article 55 exemption for projects co-funded by the European Social Fund (most Social Fund contributions are for non-physical operations, and few projects generate revenue).
• Article 55 exemption for projects costing under €1,000,000 that are co-funded by the ERDF or the Cohesion Fund. This exemption would replace current provision on "proportionality in monitoring small operations" (projects costing less than €200,000).
• Revised Article 55 will apply retroactively from 1 August 2006, to ensure common implementing rules for projects throughout the 2007-2013 programming period.
Expected results
• No discrimination - the revision should avoid any discrimination among Member States in the structural funds' contributions to projects.
• Medium-sized operations - the amended Article 55 will also "facilitate implementation and monitoring of medium-sized operations in sensitive fields such as the environment, social inclusion, energy and research".
NB - "Revenue-generating projects" have always been treated as a special case among candidates for structural funding, due to the risk of "over-financing" them. In 2000-2006, if infrastructure projects generated "substantial net revenue", this led to a uniform and automatic reduction in the maximum rate of Community co-financing (e.g. from 75% to 40%). However, there was no ceiling on EU support below the "substantial revenue" threshold.
For 2007-2013, the Council adopted a more "precise and stringent" approach: Article 55 applies to a wide range of "revenue-generating" projects, rather than to infrastructure investment projects generating "substantial net revenue", as in 2000-2006.

Judicial cooperation
Measures to enhance the role of the European Judicial Network
2008-12-11 - 11:29
The European Judicial Network, set up in 2002 to simplify judicial co-operation between Member States and facilitate citizens' access to justice in litigation with cross-border impact, is still far from achieving its full potential. A report drafted by Ona JUKNEVIČIENĖ (ALDE, LT) on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, introduces 17 amendments to the Commission proposal aimed at enhancing the role of the Network.
According to figures in the report, at the beginning of 2008, the Network had 437 members falling into four categories: 102 contact points, 140 central authorities, 21 liaison magistrates and 181 other judicial authorities active in judicial co-operation.
The report asks Member States to ensure that the contact point has sufficient and appropriate facilities in terms of staff, resources and modern means of communication to adequately fulfil its tasks as a contact point.
In terms of the activities of contact points, the report states that "professional associations shall not request information from contact points relating to individual cases", "the contact points of the Network shall meet at least once every six month", and Member States will be able to send six representatives, instead of four, to contact point meetings.
Furthermore, contact points should reply to all requests within 30 days, promote their activities to the public, exchange best practice, and liaise with professional organisations.
In cases where there is more than one association representing a legal profession in a Member State, "it shall be the responsibility of that Member State to provide for appropriate representation of that profession on the Network", the report says.
Network's website will be main source of information
The report calls for the "establishment, maintenance and promotion of an information system for the public on judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters in the European Union, relevant Community and international instruments and the domestic law of the Member States, with particular reference to access to justice".
"The main source of information shall be the Network’s website containing up to date information in all official languages of the institutions of the Union," the report says. MEPs ask that the Network, including the website of the Network, be "better known to the local judicial authorities".
€1 million to be devoted to improving the Network
The 2007 work programme for the "Civil Justice" programme provided €3.25 million for Network management and operation. The 2008 work programme provides for €3.15 million. Of an indicative budget of €3.5 million for grants to actions in 2007, €1 million can be devoted to co-financing national projects for improving the operation of the Judicial Network.
