One of the many projects co-funded by the EU in Ireland
A delegation from the European Parliament's Committee on Regional Development, led by its Chairman, Spanish MEP Gerardo Galeote (EPP-ED), travelled to Northern Ireland and Ireland on 9-12 October, to examine the impact of EU funding for regional development. The emphasis during the visit was on cross-border cooperation and on the future of regions on both sides of the border under the new EU funding period 2007-2013.
During the visit, the delegation met community groups receiving funding and political leaders on both sides of the border including Dick Roche TD, Minister of State for European Affairs and Martin McGuinness, Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland.
The pitfalls of Irish terminology puzzled MEPs visiting the Northern Ireland Parliament buildings (Stormont) in Belfast - Northern Ireland sometimes being referred to as "here" and the northernmost of the 26 counties sometimes being referred to as "the rest of Ireland". The delegation skirted the infamous city known as Derry or Londonderry (depending on the political inclinations of the speaker) and observed the lengths that speakers went to deal with or avoid the issues of nomenclature.
During their visit, MEPs remarked on the continual reference to the recent conflict and were impressed at the penetration of EU funds, reaching very basic cross-community projects - one project, for instance, brought young people from Protestant/Unionist enclaves in Belfast to meet Catholic/Nationalist counterparts in the Republic and vice versa. Their objective was to overcome existing prejudices among the young people.
Overall, MEPs agreed that EU funds were being used in novel and interesting ways to deal with cross-community issues which could perhaps provide useful models for facing problems of community and identity elsewhere in the EU.
The Chairman of the delegation, Spanish MEP Gerardo Galeote remarked on what they had observed of "the social impact of the European funds in practice." He went on to say that the delegation wished "to reassert the European Parliament's commitment to the 'Peace Programme' based on the renunciation of violence."
