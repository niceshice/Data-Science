The executive directors of the EU's three new financial watchdogs received on Wednesday the final confirmation needed for them to take up their posts when Parliament's plenary gave the green light, following a positive recommendation given by the EP Economics Committee on Tuesday 22 March.
Parliament endorsed Verena Ross of Germany as executive director for the European Securities and Markets Authority by 506 votes to 77, with 60 abstentions.
Carlos Montalvo of Spain was confirmed for the post at the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority by 539 votes to 44, with 65 abstentions.
Adam Farkas of Hungary was approved for post at the European Banking Authority by 540 votes to 44, with 61 abstentions.
The Economics Committee had previously quizzed all three candidates, showing particular interest in how they intended to exercise their authority over national regulators and how they would develop the authorities into truly independent bodies.
The executive directors are expected to wield considerable influence, particularly through their direct control over all the administrative staff of the watchdogs.
