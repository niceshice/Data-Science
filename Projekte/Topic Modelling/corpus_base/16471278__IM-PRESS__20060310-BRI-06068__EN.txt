International Women's Day and European Day for the Victims of Terrorism
2006-03-20 - 13:23
Opening the session, EP President Josep Borrell commented on International Women's Day and European Day for the Victims of Terrorism, 8 and 10 March respectively. President Borrell stated:
" Last Wednesday (8 March) was International Women's Day - and I want to express, on behalf of the whole Parliament, our rejection of the violence used by police in Tehran against peaceful groups of women protesters. We express our solidarity with women throughout the world who campaign peacefully for their rights." The President congratulated the Women's Rights and Gender Equality Committee for the seminar it held last week on the issue of forced prostitution around major sporting events.
" Friday (10 March) was the second European Day for the Victims of Terrorism. Parliament again marked the occasion with a ceremony, which was attended by 600 pupils from schools in London and Brussels. Two years have now gone by since the attacks which killed 192 people in Spain - and we think also about the deaths in London last July. We must continue to fight terrorism in whatever form it takes. The European Parliament has always supported the dignity of human beings. No country can deal with this alone - it is only European democrats united who can stand up to this thr eat," he said.

Address by the President of the Republic of Germany
2006-03-20 - 13:23
Introducing the German President, Mr Horst KÖHLER, EP President Josep BORRELL recalled President Köhler's personal commitment to the building of Europe. Noting that the situation in Europe is perplexing to its citizens, he stated that President Köhler has displayed real conviction and commitment to pursuing initiatives to resolve this.
He talked of the President's practical strategies that have helped widen and deepen the debate on the Union. He said " everyday you work on practical points that are on the agenda " and called him " a paradigm of a European citizen ".
The puzzle of Europe
President Köhler opened his speech by commenting that the European Parliament is the centre of public politics and democratic opinion for the EU, and that correspondingly, he was grateful to have the opportunity to have it as his platform. He echoed President Borrell's notion of the EU as a " bit of puzzle ", and asked why, given all the advantages, strengths and economic success it has had, it shows such a degree of despondency. He mentioned that, after having looked at Europe from the outside, he was in a position to see the unbelievable achievements it has made, but warned that outsiders mix their admiration for these achievements with impatience: " Europe, if you're tired, step aside, we want to move forward ". Nevertheless, President Köhler reassured Europe that due to its creative ferment, it will always have the capacity to move forward and keep pace with the rest. He considered European history as a vital factor in the unification of Europeans now. He noted that the value of inalienable human rights is at the core of European thinking, that the constant process of enlightenment the Europeans pursue and their understanding of self-autonomy and social cohesion all ensure a united mentality that strengthens the potential for the future of the Union. He also praised the Europeans' active love of their neighbours and their striving for social justice, their love of freedom and truth, their creative restlessness and their solidarity.
The challenges and Europe's capacity to face them
However, President Köhler also referred to the major challenges that the Union faces today: the many new regions of growth; new conditions of competition; unbearably high levels of unemployment in some areas; the intangible alienation of citizens; and the recent rejection of the proposed constitution by the members of two European States. Nevertheless, the President considered pessimism as unnecessary when it comes to these challenges. He cited the example of the Dutch Foreign Minister Van Stoel, thirty tears ago, claiming that the European motto "completion, involvement and expansion" had been replaced by " standstill, setback and flight “. He noted that thirty years ago Europe was in a deep economic crisis with many obstacles apparent against the free movement of goods, people, services and capital. However, by the mid 90s, the goal of an internal market had been realised. " Now ", President Köhler noted, " the EU countries produce for a domestic market of 450 million ". He gave his support for the adoption of a single currency, remarking that it allows consumers to make price comparisons, relieving them of the expense of converting currency and gives businesses - as well as the Union as a whole - the stability and security to pursue successful economic transactions.
The conditions needed
President Köhler considered there to be certain conditions under which the Union must act if it is to " change its challenges into opportunities ": it must not " water-down its policies ", and it needs to "put into order that which needs ordering". He asserted that Europe needs structural reform and called for this to be pursued at a local level as well as at the EU level: " the principle of subsidiary must be respected ". He said that bureaucracy must be kept to a limit, that there is "a need to reduce the red-tape of legislation", and commended the EU programme designed to reduce this red-tape. He postulated that " citizens would appreciate more transparency ", as "many citizens cannot understand who is responsible for what", causing a distrust of the Union. The resulting principles of democracy, participation and transparency that are needed, were all, President Köhler noted, contained in the proposed constitution. He therefore advised that "it should not be given-up on lightly ". He recommended that Europeans use this " period of reflection " to consider what Europe stands for, and what needs to be done in order to strengthen it. He expressed his confidence in the European citizens' capacity to do this.
President Köhler noted that it was important to have a Union for political clout - "one voice is stronger". He talked of his belief that European citizens would welcome new goals and new measures, and expressed his support for the Commission's green paper on energy. In addition, he noted that, if we want to help the youth of Europe and remedy the high unemployment levels of some areas, we need an EU to do this, but we also need to reorganise the EU budget to prioritise research and education. He commended the Erasmus exchange programme and the impressive ideology displayed by many young Europeans. He urged Europe to learn from the example of these idealists, "let us be influenced by creative turmoil…turn challenges into opportunities". He closed with the notion that the EU should be " a place of good, where we want to live…a force of good in this one world we live in. "

MEPs react to latest violence in the Middle East
2006-03-20 - 13:23
Parliament President Josep BORRELL told MEPs that Palestinian President Mahmoud ABBAS would not be able to address Parliament as planned. However, the leaders of the political groups made statements on the latest violence in the Middle East.
President Borrell said: “ Soon after his arrival in Strasbourg yesterday, Mr Abbas had to return to Ramallah after the terrible and deplorable events in Jericho had created a violent and dangerous situation. I met him last night and told him that Parliament understood that he needed to return to his country and take control of the situation. That he had to go home without speaking to the House has elements of a Greek tragedy about it, since he represents the majority of Palestinians who still support a negotiated solution to the conflict. He is a man who has tried to achieve peace through negotiations since the 1970s. His visit would have been an opportunity for us to support this. That opportunity was lost because of an unnecessary and illegal military operation and the unacceptable violence that operation provoked. We have to ask how this can contribute to the security of Israel. We Europeans will now have to pay for a new prison, as we have had to pay for so many other things which have been destroyed. The violence following that attack is deeply worrying. Three western hostages have been taken, including two French citizens. There are unconfirmed rumours of more.
When I spoke to Mahmoud Abbas last night he told me about the efforts he had made all day to stop military operations and prevent a spiral of violence before it went out of control. The EU staff monitoring the border between Gaza and Egypt also have also had security problems. The Palestinian President undertook to return to Strasbourg – probably at April session. If that is so, we will be able to hear how he will tackle the situation .”
Political group leaders
For the EPP-ED group, Hans-Gert POETTERING (DE) said: “ We are all very concerned about events in the Middle East. My group greatly laments that the Palestinian President was unable to speak to us today. The group leaders have already decided to invite him back. He is a moderate person aiming for balance and peace. We are deeply concerned with the present situation. What should we do? First, we should warn against precipitous conclusions – we must not do anything to fuel the violence. The storming of the prison should be investigated. We need to get answers as to why this has happened, and they must be convincing answers. But it is good to remind people of the basic principles. We want an Israeli state with safe borders and a Palestinian state with safe borders. The dignity of Israelis and Palestinians is of the same value. On both sides majority wants to move towards a settlement. We call for the release of all hostages whether European or not. We hope the EU will take a fair and non-partisan approach to peace in the Middle East. We also hope the time will soon come for Mahmoud Abbas to give his speech to the European Parliam ent.”
For the Socialist group, Martin SCHULZ (DE) said he agreed with all that had been said by Mr Poettering and by the President. “ We all lament the recent events, and regret that President Abbas cannot speak to us. The fact that he was due to be here was already an encouraging sign, that the elected President of the Palestinians, representative of their freedom and sovereignty was hear, giving us the opportunity to help ensure that this Head of State was viewed as an equal partner by all others in the region. That should be our ultimate goal. Every peaceful contribution we can make is good. We hope he will soon be able to come to Parliament again. As for the Jericho events, we must always ask questions of who does what to whom... what purpose does this serve? We can only speculate. Is it of value to anyone to storm this prison? The answers we have seen in the Israeli media are not appropriate. It is not for a state to storm a prison. If people were to be released, there must be ways of stopping this without storming a prison. There had been international observers present – why was this not stuck to? I hope that there were no domestic Israeli issues behind this – that would help no-one .”
Graham WATSON (UK) spoke for the ALDE group: “ We also regret the fact that President Abbas had to return home in such circumstances. When the tectonic plates of the three great monotheistic religions rub against each other, causing sparks in the Middle East we should proceed with extreme caution. We should not risk a serious threat to continued peace in our world. As European diplomacy with Iran is undermined by George Bush's deal with India ignoring the non-proliferation treaty, our work in the Middle East should not be undermined by unilateral Israeli actions. There are questions to be asked about whether there was a conspiracy with the British and American troops who left shortly before the Israelis came in. Nothing can justify attack or the hostage taking which followed it. We hope that we are able to move quickly to restore calm and confidence – and we hope to see Mr Abbas back in this Chamber in more serene circumstances to hear how he can work with all sides to create peace in that region .”
For the Greens/EFA group, Daniel COHN-BENDIT (DE) said that the fact that Mr Abbas had had to return home was not tragic or dramatic, but was politically hard to accept. “ Unilateral policy on either side leads to disaster. Mutual contempt leads to breakdown in negotiations. The EU must insist that there should be no more unilateralism: Israel cannot decide alone what a Palestinian state should look like, the Palestinian government of Hamas alone cannot decide who can use violence against Israel. If each believes that they can turn their back on the other side, then the international community cannot turn its back. Israel cannot decide alone even if there is a security problem in the West Bank. Of course it is clear there are domestic political choices at work. The Olmert government has scored on the left by withdrawing some settlements, now it wants points on the right. The future of the region has been sacrificed to the next elections. What the Israelis did was wrong – though this prison was no longer a prison, since prisoners were holding press conferences with 500 journalists. If you want to let or get people out there are legal ways which the Palestinians should have followed, but Israel does not have right to react by destroying the prison. We must be against the unilateral exercise of power on either side .”
Francis WURTZ, leader of the GUE/NGL group, said it was a serious decision for Mr Abbas to hasten back. “ The situation with this new and deliberately humiliating exercise and with the unacceptable but inevitable reaction of kidnappings, is very serious. An EU country, the UK, had an agreement with the US, Israel and Palestine. This was flagrantly violated by Israel despite no prisoner having got away. If Israel thought there was a problem, Abbas had already proposed the transfer of prisoners to the Mukata under international supervision. The EU has turned a systematic blind eye to the Sharon government and its successors. We have a Prime Minister-designate who runs the mad risk of inflaming a situation which is already explosive, simply in order to show the most extreme part of his electorate what he can do for them. He knows the US always gives Israel a Carte Blanche. The European authorities have got Israel used to their acceptance. Are we to accept without reaction that peace can be torpedoed and those keenest on peace, like Abbas, undermined ?”
Non-attached MEP Irena BELOHORSKÁ (SK) said this was further proof of intolerance between two countries we respect but which do not respect each other. “ This attack on a prison and on political prisoners – who all have rights to proper process – reminds us of arbitrary rule. On both sides, there are more reactions, it is a never ending story. I was looking forward to Mr Abbas's presentation today, to hearing his visions of Palestine and for the negotiating table. I wanted to hear what they plan to give for peace. Parliament should play a role as a mediator, to give a helping hand to both parties who want peace .”
Other speakers
Elmar BROK (EPP-ED, DE), Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee said: “ This is one of those moments when it entirely uncertain what will happen; it could be a starting point for a spiral of worsening developments. President Abbas, who was directly elected by his citizens, was in a mediating position between those in favour of recognising Israel and Hamas, who do not recognise Israel but who nevertheless won an election. It would be dreadful if that role is lost. We do not know what will happen next. This will heighten emotions on the Palestinian side. The withdrawal of UK and US observers means that a platform for stability has been lost. The attacks in Gaza seem to show Abbas's supporters abandoning their renunciation of violence now they have lost the elections. This is what happens in a situation where Abbas has lost credibility .”
The Chief EU Observer for the recent Palestinian legislative elections was the MEP Veronique DE KEYSER (PES, BE). She said she and Edward McMillan-Scott (EPP-ED, UK), the leader of the Parliamentary election observers, had met Mr Abbas the previous night. “ We are shocked and angry at latest events. This is neither fate nor chance. An attack on a prison just when the President was coming to Europe accompanied by the local Jericho strongman is not a matter of chance. Parading half naked prisoners with their eyes covered and their arms tied owes nothing to chance. Now anything can cause violence. The cartoon business is not yet behind us – this is very serious. An attempt is being made to undermine the person who could lead Hamas towards the peace process. That is the person being attacked today. I don't know who will benefit from this crime, but I don't want us in the EU to be dupes. It is true that negotiations were going on about the prison and that one of the prisoners was implicated in the murder of an Israeli minister, but we should not begin a new cycle of violence. We must stay calm and denounce what happened yesterday .”
Edward McMILLAN-SCOTT (EPP-ED, UK) said: “ Mahmoud Abbas was elected freely and fairly last year. The legislative elections were controversial but also free and fair. Abbas's presence in this assembly, which represents the values of democracy, pluralism and freedom which we hope to have accepted in the Middle East, would have been important. It is paradoxical, ironic and tragic that two countries who speak so much about the need for democracy in the Middle East – the US and the UK – have abandoned their international responsibility. Instead of dealing with a problem, they walked away. When the Euro Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly meets in Brussels next week, I hope we will have a statement from the Commission and Council about what happened and who gave the orders.”
EU Council
For the Council, Austrian Deputy Foreign Minister Hans WINKLER said the cancellation on Mr Abbas's visit raised serious concerns regarding the ongoing and escalating violence in Middle East. He pointed out that Foreign Minister Ursula PLASSNIK had already condemned the radical Palestinian attacks, and had called for the United Nations to take action. The priority, he said, was to restore peace and protect human life. “ We all bear responsibility for that and will work to ensure the immediate release of hostages. The Council will have to consider carefully what steps to take. All institutions, Parliament, Council and Commission should react in a responsible manner to ensure the peace process is not destroyed. The Presidency calls on Israel and the Palestinian Authority to hold back and prevent further violence. They should avoid unilateral measures. Not correct path. The attacks on EU and Member State institutions, and the taking of hostages are to be condemned, they only upset efforts for peace .”
European Commission
Commission President Jose Manuel BARROSO added his voice to the general expression of regret that Mahmoud Abbas was unable to address Parliament. “ Commissioner FERRERO WALDNER met him yesterday and offered our support in the search for a peaceful solution in the Middle East. We condemn unambiguously all forms of violence which have occurred in that region, from wherever they come. We appeal to a sense of responsibility of all parties for restraint. We are concerned at the very worrying situation for the region and for the Europeans taken hostage, and EU buildings attacked. No-one has helped the Palestinian people more than the EU and wish to continue as donor to the Palestinian people. We appeal to all sides for restraint and for all sides to live together in peace .”
EP President
President Borrell closed the debate by calling for a high level Commission and Council presence at the Euro Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly due to meet in Brussels in ten days time: “ We hope to hear measured and useful proposals to encourage dialogue and assist the Middle East situation ,” he said.

European Council
Preparations for the Spring Council and the Lisbon Strategy
2006-03-20 - 13:23
Parliament adopted a resolution concerning the input to the Spring 2006 European Council of 23-24 March in relation to the Lisbon Strategy. The resolution, put forward by the three main political groups of the Parliament - the EPP-ED, PES and ALDE - was adopted by 431 votes to 118, with 55 abstentions. MEPs outline the priorities and strategies that the Spring Council should concern itself with regarding the realisation of the revised Lisbon Strategy.
General Observations
The resolution opens by expressing satisfaction that the revised "Lisbon Strategy... has led to the presentation of national action plans proposed by all Member States, focusing on priority areas such as R&D, Innovation and Education". It also "reiterates its satisfaction at the fact that this has led to a clarification of responsibilities at European and national level". MEPs emphasise however that "effective and rapid implementation of the National Reform Programmes is necessary" and that "economic growth requires, inter alia, a supportive economic framework".
National Action Plans and European Growth and Employment Strategy
MEPs "note the diverse national approaches to the integrated guidelines taken in national action plans" and "believe in the need to set a common structure as the basis for the national action plans" in hope of "allowing a better comparative analysis of the impact of the proposed actions" at both the Member State and European level. Parliament also outlines the importance of "freeing Europe's competitive potential, economic growth and job creation". To do this, Parliament "calls for a well-functioning internal market, as well as a well-functioning labour market, within the 25 Member States". Parliament therefore "calls upon the Member States to move as fast as possible towards total freedom of movement for citizens and workers within the EU together with determined action to promote quality of work in all its aspects".
Ageing Population / Demographic Challenges
The resolution discusses the imperative nature of "modernising the social state across the EU" and putting "the social dimension of our economies – social rights, protection and social dialogue – at the core of how we ensure that people can face up to economic change with self-confidence and ease". Furthermore, it confirms that reforms must promote a dynamic and adaptable economy while safeguarding employment security (flexicurity)". MEPs also "consider that, in order to attain the Lisbon Strategy goals, suitable measures should be taken for the elderly generations to be able to cope with technological innovations."
In relation to immigration, the resolution states a belief that "immigration policies should promote successful economic, social and legal integration of migrants, with a view to alleviating Europe’s demographic challenge." However, Parliament "recognises that this in itself will not resolve all the questions related to demographic change". Moreover, the resolution asserts that "a successful policy of legal immigration also depends on the implementation of a comprehensive and pro-active strategy to achieve full integration, covering a range of social, economic and civic measures, induction programmes and language training".
Innovation and Research / Life-Long Learning
The necessity of lifelong learning is underlined by the resolution when it considers
"that, to ensure that European industry is competitive, the quality of education and training systems must be reinforced at various stages in life and access to higher education facilitated". MEPs "believe that education and training systems must target those areas where Europe is lacking skilled people and respond to the requirements and gaps of a rapidly changing labour market and technological society." The joint resolution also expresses the desire for Europeans to "master electronic tools", and thus "calls on the Member States to ensure that, by 2010 at the latest, a computer is available to every pupil in the European Union".
MEPs highlight the importance of encouraging innovation through the delineation of proper financial provisions in the EU's financial perspective, Parliament "believes that innovation is one of the main cornerstones of wealth creation, growth and jobs, strengthens Europe’s competitiveness and contributes to achieving the overall policy of sustainable development". The House also "believes that the EU and Member State budgets should give effect to and fully translate the Lisbon strategic priorities by significantly reinforcing Europe’s innovation and research capacity and expanding life-long learning, including the use of new financial instruments". However, MEPs insist "on focusing such policies on areas of general interest".
Energy Policies
The resolution broadly states the need for coherent energy policies that allow for the variation that exists among Member States. Parliament considers that "a coherent and efficient energy policy is essential for economic growth in Europe and the durable prosperity of European citizens". Moreover, MEPs "agree with the Council conclusion that a shared view on a strategy for security of supply should respect Member States’ geographical, economic, regional, climate and structural differences". Correspondingly, the group looks forward "to the Spring European Council discussions on energy issues".
Parliament also covers both renewable and nuclear energy policies. In relation to renewable energy, the House acknowledges an awareness that "long-term energy security is not possible without an economically and ecologically meaningful development of renewable energies". MEPs therefore call on the Commission "to establish market-based incentives in order to make renewable energies economic as rapidly as possible" and "to help expand the use of hydrogen as an environment-friendly and sustainable energy source".
Regarding nuclear energy, the House states that it "recognises the role that nuclear energy currently plays in maintaining security of electricity supply, as a significant part of the energy mix and for avoiding an estimated 312 million tonnes of CO2 emissions per year (7% of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the EU)." Parliament also" points out that current estimates project a 12% increase in EU CO2 emissions by 2020, well short of the Kyoto target 8% reduction". Furthermore, it "recalls that Europe possesses globally acknowledged expertise in the area of nuclear energy, which is one possible response to energy dependence and climate change" and that "this expertise relates inter alia to the efficiency and quality of production installations, and to decommissioning processes.

Enlargement: EU must keep its promises but take account of absorption capacity
2006-03-20 - 13:23
The European Union should keep its promises to candidate countries and possible candidate countries but also take the EU's absorption capacity fully into account, said MEPs when they approved a resolution by 397 votes in favour, 95 against with 37 abstentions.
If necessary, the Commission should propose a close multilateral relationship to all European countries which currently have no recognised "membership perspective". Countries which do have such a perspective should be free to join this multilateral framework as an intermediate step towards full membership.
Parliament asks the Commission to submit a report by the end of this year setting out the principles defining the EU's absorption capacity. In order to do so "the nature of the EU, including its geographical borders", should be defined. It also asks the Commission to draw up a communication strategy "so as to meet the legitimate concerns of the European public regarding European enlargement and integration". MEPs add that the stalemate in the ratification of a constitutional treaty is preventing the EU from increasing its absorption capacity and that no new Member States should be allowed in before the necessary budgetary resources are available.
MEPs support the Commission's emphasis on "fair and rigorous conditionality", whereby it will lay down clear requirements for each phase of the negotiations with accession countries and suspend negotiations when relevant conditions are not met. They remind candidates and potential candidate countries that they should not only adopt laws to comply with the accession conditions, but should also rigorously implement and enforce them.
With regard to Turkey, MEPs say that the pace of change slowed in 2005 but they express the hope that the opening of negotiations will stimulate further reforms. They welcome the decision not to prosecute Turkish author Orhan Pamuk, but denounce the further prosecution of others for the non-violent expression of their opinion, even on the basis of the newly adopted penal code. Turkey is urged once more to remove all restrictions on Cypriot ships and airplanes, but MEPs also urge the Council to move ahead on the financial aid and trade package for northern Cyprus. MEPs voice concern at the increase in violence in south-eastern Turkey after the resumption of terrorist attacks.
The decision to open accession negotiations with Croatia is welcomed, as is the decision to grant the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia the status of candidate country. Croatia is urged to allow all EU nationals, without discrimination, to have access to the housing property market. With regard to other countries in the Western Balkans, MEPs point out that these countries were given a European "perspective" at the Thessaloniki summit of 2003. They welcome the fact that Albania is close to finalising negotiations for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement, as well as the Council decision to start such negotiations with Bosnia-Herzegovina. MEPs regret the stalemate in the negotiations on constitutional reform in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The international intervention in the government of Bosnia-Herzegovina should be further reduced.
MEPs recognise the "significant progress" made by the Belgrade authorities in their cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, but support the UN Chief Procecutor's call for Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadczic to be handed over without delay. On the upcoming referendum in Montenegro on a possible separation from Serbia, MEPs are confident that the government and the opposition will find an agreement on the terms and procedures for this referendum.
They also welcome the start of negotiations on the final status of Kosovo but are concerned that the UN Special Envoy has described inter-ethnic relations, especially with regard to Serbs and Roma, as "grim". They conclude that the only solution to the status question may be a multi-ethnic Kosovo .

Initiatives to end sex trafficking: MEPs call for a launch of an Anti-Trafficking Day
2006-03-20 - 13:23
MEPs reaffirm their firm condemnation of trafficking in human beings, in particular of women and children for sexual purposes. Following the EP's recent seminar on forced prostitution during sports events, Parliament adopted a resolution proposing strategies to combat this ghastly problem.
The European Parliament calls for a European wide campaign to inform the general public and to reduce the demand. MEPs also propose an Anti-Trafficking Day to raise awareness on the issue of trafficking in all its aspects.
The European Parliament urges the European Commission and the Member States to launch a European-wide campaign to inform and educate the general public and particularly sports people, sports fans and supporters about the growing problem of forced prostitution during big sports events. The campaign should provide the necessary information, counselling, safe housing and legal aid to women and children and other victims forced into prostitution. MEPs agree that media and famous people from the sports world also have to be involved in the awareness raising campaign to positively influence the changes in public mentality and behaviour. They also appeal for a prevention campaign targeted at potential victims providing them with information as to their rights and where they can obtain assistance in countries of destination.
In light of the forthcoming World Football Cup, MEPs call on Member States to set up a multilingual telephone hotline and visible communication campaign to help women forced into prostitution and other victims who are isolated and unable to speak the language of the country of transit or destination. They also urge the International Olympic Committee, FIFA, UEFA, the German Football Association and others as well as sportsmen to express support for the campaign launched by the German National Council of Women.
MEPs request the launch of an Anti-Trafficking Day starting from this year. Its aim would be to raise awareness on the issue of trafficking in all its aspects. They urge all Member States to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human beings which sets out minimum standards for the protection of the victims of trafficking in human beings for the purposes of sexual exploitation. The European Parliament also calls on the Member States which have not respected the deadline of 1 August 2004 for the implementation of Council Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA on combating trafficking in human beings to take immediate action. Furthermore, MEPs urge the Commission and the Council to urgently produce the assessment report as foreseen by the Framework Decision. Text adopted

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
New European Institute for Gender Equality
2006-03-20 - 13:23
The European Parliament adopted a first reading report on plans to set up an independent European Institute for Gender Equality. While strongly supporting the creation of this new Community body, MEPs wish to make it more effective by sharpening the focus of its work. They also want guarantees about the management board's gender balance. It is hoped the Institute will be able to start work next year.
The report, drafted by Lissy Gröner (PES, DE) and Amalia Sartori (EPP-ED, IT), was adopted by 362 votes in favour, to 263 against, with 18 abstentions.
The European Parliament wants the Institute to be operational "as soon as possible" and certainly no later than twelve months after the regulation establishing it enters into force. EU governments have not yet decided where the Institute is to be located.
The Parliament wants to make the institute more proactive by shifting the focus of its work away from the mere collection and recording of data on gender equality and towards the analysis of such data, so as to enable the EU to "effectively promote and implement gender equality policy". MEPs believe that what is lacking at EU and national level is a capacity to pool analysis and come up with innovative solutions on, for example, gender mainstreaming.
Regarding the Institute's Management Board, the nine members should, according to MEPs, be appointed by the Council, in consultation with the European Parliament, from a list drawn up by the Commission and should as well have three representatives from NGOs, employers' and worker organisations. MEPs say the aim must be to achieve an equal representation between women and men and that there should at least be a "guarantee that the representation of both sexes is not below 40%."
If approved, the Institute will be funded with a proposed budget of €52.5 million for the period 2007 to 2013. The setting up of the Gender Equality Institute beginning of 2007 is one of the key actions put forward in the Commission's Road Map for equality between women and men 2006-2010, presented 1 March 2006.

Regional policy
MEPs concerned about EU funding for company relocations
2006-03-20 - 13:23
In adopting a report on relocation in the context of regional development, MEPs call on the Commission to penalise companies which, having received European Union aid, relocate their activity within seven years after the granting of the aid. Parliament demands that practices that are not conducive to the achievement of economic cohesion and the strategic goal of full employment, such as unjustified relocation likely to cause job losses, should not be financially supported by the EU.
The own-initiative report was adopted by a large majority. Speaking during the debate in Strasbourg plenary, rapporteur Alain HUTCHINSON (PES, BE) said: " We call on the Commission to take all the necessary measures in order to avoid that EU regional policy could be constituted as an encouragement to relocation. We support the Commission proposal which aims at penalising companies who have benefited from EU aid and relocated their activities within seven years ."
In the context of regional state-aid, MEPs call on the Commission to take measures with a view to the repayment of aid granted to companies which relocate their plants within or, in particular, outside the EU. The House backs the idea of penalising companies which, having received European Union aid, relocate their activity within seven years.
Parliament also wants the Dublin based European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions with the remit of studying, assessing and monitoring the issue of relocation, in order to objectivise its social and economic impact and effect on cohesion policy, spatial planning and regional development, and of submitting the findings obtained and putting forward specific proposals to Parliament in the form of regular reports. (amendment 13)
Lastly, the House calls on the Commission and the Member States to monitor the effective and targeted use of European funds, which, says the report, should be focussed on vocational training and the retraining of workers in regions affected by restructuring or relocation and, in particular, of those workers who have been directly affected by a job loss as a result of the relocation of their former employer.
A recent study on industrial relocation calculated that between 1995 and 2001 some 95,000 industrial jobs were lost in France and relocated abroad, an average of 13,500 a year, a little over half of them lost to the developing countries. Countries where wages are low represent slightly under half of relocation destinations, China being the main destination, far ahead of Eastern Europe, North Africa, South America and other Asian countries.

EU mercury strategy - MEPs want an export ban by 2010
2006-03-20 - 13:23
Parliament adopted an own-initiative report on the EU's future approach to the hazards of mercury. Parliament says it is "an economic, political and moral imperative" for the EU to take the lead in dealing with global mercury problems.
While welcoming the Commission's strategy on mercury, MEPs want the EU to take a series of specific measures to tackle the problems caused by the substance, of which the EU is the world's largest exporter. They want an export ban in place by 2010 at the latest and for measures to enforce safe storage of mercury produced by the chlor-alkali industry. The report says the Commission should apply the 'polluter pays' principle, in particular when it comes to the costs of storage.
MEPs recommend that compensation should be offered to the Almadén area in Spain, to tackle the environmental and social problems arising from the closure of the long established mercury mines there.
Parliament also wants to establish emission limit values for mercury released through burning coal, and restrictions on the use of mercury in measuring and control equipment. Among other points, they call for the issue of mercury use in vaccine production to be addressed and for information campaigns to increase awareness of the risks associated with mercury. Text adopted

Civil protection
MEPs want a broader approach to disaster reaction
2006-03-20 - 13:23
In adopting a resolution on the Commission's plans for a "rapid response and preparedness instrument" Parliament wants to widen the scope of EU action to prepare for and respond to major emergencies in the aftermath of natural disasters.
A series of natural disasters in 2004-5, including the tsunami in Asia, the cyclone in Louisiana, floods in Central Europe and drought and fires in Spain and Portugal have led to calls for a more efficient European Union response to such crises, whether within the EU or elsewhere.
This new 'instrument' will be the legal basis for EU funding to support civil protection measures after natural disasters. It brings together a number of existing instruments, widening and setting out more detail on what can be funded. The Committee is seeking three sets of changes: to the legal base for the legislation, to the scope of the activity involved and to the budget.
On the legal base, the Parliament wants the measure adopted as public heath and environment legislation (under the codecision procedure) rather than the Commission's plan to use article 308 of the Treaty, which allows for action at community level not specifically provided for elsewhere in the Treaty, but only with unanimity in the Council and just consultation of Parliament.
The original proposal did not address prevention, but the House believes preventive measures are essential in this field and proposes amending the title and objectives accordingly. It also extended the scope of the proposal in other ways, so as to include a rapid response to emergencies, not only inside but also outside the Community, which have or may have "adverse impact on people, public health and safety, property, cultural heritage or the environment caused by natural, industrial or technological disasters, including marine pollution, or acts of terrorism".
As a result of the amendments extending the scope to include prevention and financing of actions outside the Community, the House calls for the budget initially proposed by the Commission (€173 million for the period 2007-2013) to be increased by €105 million, bringing it up to €278 m. These budgetary provisions remain indicative, pending an agreement on the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013.
A report on the related European Union Solidarity Fund proposal has been drawn up by the Regional Development Committee and is due for debate at the April plenary session in Strasbourg. On 20 March, the Environment, Agriculture and Regional Development Committees will be holding a joint public hearing on natural disasters. Text adopted

Development and cooperation
Call for better EU coordination at the IMF
2006-03-20 - 13:23
MEPs are calling for better coordination of EU representation within the International Monetary Fund, working towards a single voting constituency. By 529 votes in favour to 76 against with 31 abstentions, Parliament adopted an own-initiative report from Benoît Hamon (PES, FR) which is Parliament's contribution to the strategic review currently underway at the IMF.
The report says the IMF continues to play an important role, while supporting a re-orientation of IMF policies towards emphasising its core mandate of stabilising global exchange rate fluctuations and as a lender of last resort for countries experiencing serious balance of payment problems.
MEPs believe that, in the interests of its own legitimacy, the IMF should aim to make the distribution of quotas and voting rights more representative of the international economic situation, enabling more appropriate weightings to be given to developing and emerging countries. When it comes to the representation of the EU, they insist that European positions in the EU representation within the IMF must be better coordinated. They call on the Member States to work towards a single voting constituency, possible starting as a euro constituency, with a view, in the longer term, to securing consistent European representation, involving the Ecofin Council Presidency and the Commission, subject to Parliament's scrutiny.
The report says the loan conditions imposed by the IMF have in some cases been too rigid and not always consistent with local circumstances. It recommends a priority reference to poverty reduction as the goal of all IMF lending to low income countries. MEPs say the liberalisation of developing countries financial systems should be "gradual, sequential and stable," adjusted to take account of their institutional capacities. They strongly urge that "developing countries should not have to open up their markets fully and without restrictions to foreign imports"; instead they should be able to establish protection for certain industries for a limited period so as to permit a steady development - though they say eventually full integration into the world market offers considerable growth opportunities for developing, newly industrialised and industrialised countries alike. MEPs welcome the IMF's emphasis on improving the levels of education and health in developing countries, while stressing that improving governance, combating corruption and efficient use of resources, remain the surest ways to reduce inequality of access to goods and to fundamental rights such as health and education.

Free movement of capital
Amendment of the 2nd Company Law Directive: maintenance of capital for public limited companies (PLLCs)
2006-03-20 - 13:23
By approving the report by Piia-Noora Kauppi (EPP-ED, FI), Parliament supports the Commission initiative to improve European companies' competitiveness without hampering creditors' rights. By amending the 2nd Company Law Directive, in fact, MEPs want to reduce the regulatory burden imposed to public limited liability companies (PLLCs), particularly with regard to external reporting and shareholders' consultation.
The aim is to give the European PLLCs the possibility to react in a more flexible way to market developments that require a change both in capital and in the ownership of the company.
The directive, dating from 1976, provides rules on the maintenance of companies' capital and on the way shares must be acquired and sold. Moreover, it provides for the obligation to inform and report on these activities to shareholders and creditors. Nevertheless, the 2nd Company Law Directive has proven, according to Company Law SLIM group (Simpler Legislation for the Internal Market), to have brought unnecessary administrative obligations to PLLCs. The Commission therefore proposed to amend the Directive without weakening the right of shareholders and creditors to receive full disclosure on the companies' decisions in the field of capital maintenance.
MEPs decided to follow the rapporteur's opinion and to further decrease bureaucracy and reporting duties. Particularly, MEPs eliminate the sell-out and squeeze-out rights from the scope of the directive. Those rights are designed to protect minority shareholders in case of a successful bid and the consequent change in the ownership of the company's capital. In fact, squeeze-out rights oblige the successful bidder to acquire the shares of minority shareholders who have not accepted the bid. Sell-out rights enable minority shareholders to force majority shareholder to purchase their shares, after such a successful bid. Nevertheless, MEPs thought that these rights did not reduce the regulatory burden, as the scope of the proposal requires.
The Commission proposal is part of the Company Law Action Plan for modernising the EU company law. At present, consultations with stakeholders for further improvements are on the way. Text adopted

Tackling racism in football: MEPs want matches stopped in serious cases
2006-03-20 - 13:23
Parliament adopted a resolution strongly condemning all forms of racism at football matches, both on and off the field. Parliament calls on the UEFA and all other competition organisers in Europe to ensure that referees have the option, according to clear and strict guidelines, to stop or abandon matches in the event of serious racist abuse.
The House commends the excellent work that organisations, including UEFA and FARE (Football Against Racism in Europe) have done in tackling these problems. MEPs call on all those with a high profile in football to speak out regularly against racism. The House calls on national football associations, leagues, clubs, players’ unions and supporters’ groups to apply UEFA best practice, such as the UEFA Ten-Point Plan of Action. Finally, the House calls on UEFA and all other competition organisers in Europe to consider the option of imposing sporting sanctions on national football associations and clubs whose supporters or players commit serious racist offences, including the option to remove persistent offenders from their competitions.
The written declaration was adopted in Strasbourg by over half (423 out of 732 MEPs as on 1 March 2006) of all MEPs having signed the declaration. The declaration was originally drafted by the following MEPs: Emine BOZKURT (PES, NL), Claude MORAES (PES, UK), Christopher HEATON-HARRIS (EPP-ED, UK), Cem ÖZDEMIR (Greens/EFA, DE) and Alexander Nuno ALVARO (ALDE, DE).

Social policy
Restructuring can be made socially acceptable if all concerned act together
2006-03-20 - 13:23
Parliament adopted a report on "restructuring and employment" by 463 votes in favour to 142 against and 58 abstentions. The report stresses the importance of preventing social hardship following restructuring. MEPs set out how the EU can achieve better financial and human support in these cases.
MEPs point out that "social decline and loss of economic substance" is not necessarily a consequence of restructuring provided that the collaboration of affected firms, trade unions and public action works effectively. Nevertheless they underline that these conditions are not often present. They consider that business restructuring should only take place if warranted by the circumstances, namely in order to save jobs or improve competitiveness and the economic development of firms. Since the EU opened up the market, it has to assume the responsibility for the support of restructuring measures by proposing measures and financial resources to anticipate better and accompany restructuring and mitigate its social consequences. SMEs, in particular, have to be supported in this context mainly via structural funds. Furthermore, MEPs propose that the financial programs under discussion for 2007-2013 should be geared more closely to anticipating and managing restructuring.
The report stresses the enormous disadvantages that dismissed employees suffer: "Priority aid should be given to them in all cases". Members of Parliament speak of the "hidden effects" such as medical and psychological problems affecting workers' health when restructuring takes place. Furthermore, measures such as more regional employment pacts, as well as aid for training and re-training for workers who are made redundant should be taken.
Calling "for better monitoring and better traceability of the use of Community funds" the report underlines that funds are sometimes diverted to related, speculative or administrative purposes. To prevent "subsidy tourism", Parliament claims that firms subsidised from EU funds should not receive any further Community aid for a period of 7 years if they relocate. In addition, they could be required to reimburse aid.
According to MEPs, criteria for EU aid should not only be the size of an undertaking or its geographical location but also whether a firm includes provisions for adjustment processes as part of its business planning in particular whether it is committed to initial and further training.
Members call on the Commission to work towards a Community framework for the protection of workers rights in the event of restructuring and to submit a proposal for a directive if the social partners do not find a solution.
The Commission should also propose a European one-stop Internet shop for citizens, local authorities, social partners and businesses affected to enable them to find information on the problems related to restructuring . Text adopted

Budget
Parliament's guidelines for its 2007 budget
2006-03-20 - 13:23
MEPs adopted a resolution on the priorities for Parliament's own budget for 2007 which presents guidelines for the budget setting process for Parliament - and the other EU institutions with the exception of the Commission. The report was adopted by 621 votes in favour to 29 against and 12 abstentions.
The report stresses the importance of information policy noting that over the years European institutions have failed to convince European citizens that they truly represent their interests and aspirations. It says insufficient knowledge coupled with a poor perception makes understanding of EU policies difficult and takes the view that the existing information services have to be improved and that an effective strategy, accessible to all European citizens, should be implemented as a matter of priority for all institutions.
MEPs invite all European institutions to study the feasibility of setting up a Centre of European Houses in Brussels, using existing resources without incurring any significant additional expenditure. This would be a place for citizens to participate freely in various areas, including cultural and technical events, training seminars and exhibitions on specific topics.
The report affirms Parliament's commitment to deliver on promises to the EU citizens in an efficient, tangible and accountable manner and in so doing strengthen the image and credibility of the European Institutions. It commits Parliament to fulfil its responsibilities as the only democratically elected representation of the people of the EU. One practical suggestion is to re-examine the structure of debates during the plenary sessions.
Among other points, the report calls for the Council to make progress on the issue of a statute for MEPs' assistants and insists on the need to re-address the "unnecessary and exorbitant costs" of Parliament having to work in three locations. Text adopted

EP calls for more environmentally-friendly fishing methods
2006-03-20 - 13:23
Parliament adopted, without amendment, an own-initiative report by Sean Ó NEACHTAIN (UEN, IE) on more environmentally-friendly fishing methods.
The report calls on the Commission to "simplify the overall regulatory system," to "consider the application of environmentally-friendly fishing technical measures as a complement to existing effort limitations in relation to stock recovery plans," and to "develop and implement the satellite technology for detecting the presence of unauthorised fishing vessels in closed areas." In addition, MEPs highlighted "the necessity to reduce discards," and the importance of achieving "a balance between socio-economic exigencies and environmental sustainability." Text adopted

Competition
Mergers: Kroes promises firm but fair application of EU rules
2006-03-20 - 13:23
In the light of a series of recent controversial takeover bids and the reaction of various European governments to them, MEPs debated merger policy in the internal market with the Austrian presidency and with the Competition Commissioner, Neelie Kroes. She promised to be tough on Member States who break European rules.
Hans Winkler , State Secretary in the Austrian Foreign Ministry, spoke for the Council: “As the Commission applies the new competition rules, it bears a heavy responsibility. We trust they will implement them in a way which helps the Lisbon strategy. When it comes to mergers, we need to bear in mind the medium and long term effects. An economy is a dynamic thing: there are 23 million companies in EU, every day new ones and opened and other close. 99 per cent of our companies are SMEs, they account for some 80 per cent of employees. Our competitive edge has an enormous effect on labour market. Competition on internal market must not be distorted. The completion of the internal market, economic and monetary union can all mean company restructuring and concentration, which can be welcome if it helps meet the challenge of a dynamic economy and improves the conditions for growth and raises living standards. This subject is topical, especially in energy sector: consumers are most concerned about price trends and also job security. Competition is the only way to avoid unjustified price increases. Long term job protection means having competitive companies. We need a policy based on the four freedoms. Concentration must not cause lasting damage to competition, which is why community law has provisions on concentration which interferes with internal market. What is critical for European industry is rule of law and predictability of legal decisions, so we do need more economic based approach. We cannot cover every case in regulation; there is always a degree of abstraction. The Commission, we assume, will leave some discretion in the rules and will exercise it with care.”
Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: “Europe thrives from breaking down barriers between Member States and not erecting them. Open markets are the key. Companies which are successful in the internal market are better placed to compete globally. The Commission is always concerned at governments interfering, whether directly or indirectly in cross border restructuring. The treaties say there should be no unjustified impediment to the four freedoms, notably including free movement of capital and freedom of establishment. Companies have the fundamental freedom to restructure, including by change of ownership. To deny this to companies on principle or by failing to implement EC legislation would amount to a serious restriction on the chance to adapt to the challenges presented by the integration of markets, rapid advances in technology and generally to evolve the dynamics of doing business in Europe today. European industry is rising to these challenges including by creating more cross-border businesses. Mergers must be decided on an individual basis, case by case, but mergers between Member States are likely to increase competition in Member States concerned, they can lead to concrete benefits for consumers, through greater choice and lower prices. On the energy market, last week the Commission's paper said we needed a sustainable, competitive and secure energy supply. This cannot be done without open and competitive energy markets based on competition between companies looking to be Europe wide competitors rather than dominant local players. Cross border restructuring enhances the prospects of EU business. Any unjustified and non-legitimate interference by governments would risk serious damage of the prospects of benefiting from market integration and globalisation. To deal with such situations we have single market rules and Article 21 of the merger regulations. We have a duty to enforce rules wherever appropriate. As the guardian of treaty and as the institution responsible for EU level merger controls on competition grounds we are determined to see EU companies benefiting from the Internal Market. The enforcement of these provisions is and will remain one of the Commission's central preoccupations.”
Klause-Heiner Lehne (DE) opened the debate for the EPP-ED group: “The Internal Market is being tested: in the energy sector it is endangered. Promoting national champions means creating national monopolies with no competition – so not competition across the Internal Market for all consumers. A company which cannot compete at European level cannot compete on the world stage either. It also makes life worse for other companies who have high energy bills. I appreciate the Commission's efforts, but the Commission's possibilities are limited. Any change to the two thirds rule would need unanimity in Council. Member States must implement EU legislation – this has nothing to do with political influence. EU competition decisions are not on political grounds.”
Ieke van den Burg (NL) spoke for the Socialist group: “Let's imagine next weekend Mr Barroso holding a press conference to announce the merger of Deutsche Borse, Euronext and the London Stock Exchange. That is rather improbable isn't it?" Addressing the Commissioner, she said, "Barroso, you and your colleagues should not be sleeping when it comes to mergers and acquisitions, whether in energy or other sectors. We in the Socialist group believe the state has a role to play as a facilitator and as a defender of the public interest. There is a political role in silent diplomacy, creating the right conditions in dialogue with companies and anticipating as well as reacting to what is happening. We don't like your exclusively negative approach of just preventing authorities interfering – they should also have proactive approach. We need a debate on industrial policy – not just on shareholder democracy but other aspects and the balance between the European and national approaches more aspects.”
For the ALDE group, Vittorio Prodi (IT) said Europe was faced with a crucial issue. “Member States continue to give the impression that the national domain is the most important and should always prevail, when in fact we should be steering towards more European cooperation. I don't understand the problems with mergers of banks in Poland; we in Italy have accepted the takeover of BNL. There is a conflict of interest, especially regarding companies in the public sector. Immediate political benefits are put ahead of long term interests of consumers and of Europe. There is just this conflict of interest in the ENEL/SUEZ case. We need to rationalise and restructure our companies into big groups, able to withstand world level competition. These efforts are being thwarted for short term political interest"
For the Greens/EFA group, Claude Turmes (LU) said he fully understood the anger of Italy and Spain facing German and French energy imperialism. “It is Germany and France that are the greatest victims of this, though. Austrian power prices are lower than in Germany because of lower grid costs and more competition. The answer is not European energy champions squeezing out ever more money from consumers and businesses. The only answer is competitive markets enforced by strong competition and competition authorities.”
Roberto Musacchio (IT) spoke for the GUE/NGL group. He said we did not need liberalisation but valid and shared policies: “The world has had wars for oil in the past and now these conflicts are moving into Europe. The solution is not protectionism. We need a fairer sharing out of energy and energy saving - and to avoid nuclear power. Reducing everything to a mercantile approach is a mistake. We want an energy policy shared across Europe.”
Adam Bielan (PL), for the UEN group, denounced the merger involving a Polish bank which had created a group four times larger then before: “This will not help more investment in Polish economy. The takeover has violated Polish sovereignty. Poland should have prohibited it; it should defend its interests better. I know I will be accused of economic nationalism or protectionism but that is not our concern: the banking sector still has an important national role.”
Response to the debate
In his response to the debate Austrian Minister Winkler added that the Austrian and Finnish Presidencies were organising an event on competition law and merger control in Vienna on 19 July, European Competition Day.
Commissioner Kroes said she was grateful for those speakers who had backed Commission policy, though she accepted that not all agreed. “Open and competitive markets are, I hope, seen by all as key for growth and jobs in Europe. The Internal Market has enormous potential and we must let our businesses and industries employ it to the full – and this includes corporate restructuring. We must look beyond the Internal Market to global competitiveness,” she said. “The Commission will uphold single market rules on free movement of capital and we will be tough on Member States who fail properly to apply EU legislation on sectors like energy telecoms and banking.... We test mergers on competition grounds only and this is the basis on which the Court reviews our decisions. Article 21 also gives us a tool to deal with any undue interference by national authorities on corporate restructuring. We will not hesitate to use it if needed.” On the two thirds rule, she said there was a risk of inconsistent decisions being taken by different authorities but any changes were only at the consultation stage. “My goal is fair and equal treatment. The Commission has a duty to enforce the rules wherever appropriate. We will do our job firmly and fairly. We need to do our job as quickly as possible – it is quite hectic in merger country."

Public health
What price for the health of Europe's citizens?
2006-03-20 - 13:23
The European Parliament, adopted a legislative report allocating €1,500 million over seven years to the new Community action programme on health. Although healthcare services are run entirely by the individual Member States, the European Union has a complementary role in health issues. The Parliament wants the EU to play this role to the fullest.
The EP had already expressed opposition to the figures proposed by the December European Council for the 2007-2013 financial perspective, which MEPs regard as too low. The Environment and Health Committee, for its part, had no intention of scaling down the EU's ambitions in areas closely affecting the welfare of its people, one of them being health. According to rapporteur Antonios Trakatellis (EPP-ED, EL), "objectives must always be matched by the resources available to achieve them. In my view, there is no guaranteed match between these two in the proposed programme. I therefore propose that the funding be increased, in the certainty that the Council and the Commission will realise that this proposal is perfectly reasonable."
The European Commission had originally suggested a single action programme for health and consumer protection, with an overall budget of €1,203 million, of which €969 million were earmarked for health. The Commission had hoped to achieve more efficiency by combining the two areas but Parliament, while in favour of pooling administrative resources, had decided that the two areas, which come under different legal bases (Articles 152 and 153 of the EC Treaty) in which the EU has different powers, should be split into two separate programmes. The Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) thus dealt only with consumer protection, while the Environment and Public Health Committee (ENVI) was left to address the health component.
The European Parliament sees health as an extremely important area, one where the public has much to gain from an ambitious European policy, even if the organisation of healthcare and the funding thereof lies in the hands of the individual Member States. The new EU programme is designed to protect the public against threats to health, to make national healthcare systems more effective and to encourage healthy lifestyles. Noting major differences between new and old Member States in terms of the average lifespan of citizens, their state of health and their access to healthcare, members also highlighted the need for measures to reduce such inequalities.
MEPs also believe that a higher standard of health protection should be a goal of all EU policies. They wish to reduce inequality between and within Member States by guaranteeing access to healthcare for all according to comparable standards and without discrimination, and they wish to facilitate patient mobility. To achieve this, transparency between national healthcare systems must be improved. MEPs want to see greater cross-border cooperation, in particular for the treatment of rare diseases, plus exchanges of information on the services and treatments available and on reimbursements. The programme also includes special measures on risk prevention, information for practitioners and the public and the exchange of best practice. MEPs also backed an amendment calling for support for "complementary and alternative medicine" to be included in the actions supported by the Programme.
It is now up to the Council of Ministers, as joint legislator with Parliament, to decide its position on the amendments adopted by MEPs. If all of Parliament's amendments are acceptable to the Council, the legislation will be adopted in its modified form. If the Council rejects any of Parliament's amendments or adds any of its own, the text will return to Parliament for a second reading .

Agriculture
Parliament supports more stringent labelling for foodstuffs with quality indications
2006-03-20 - 13:23
European regional specialties and traditional products should be more clearly labelled as originating in the Union, say MEPs in two reports adopted in Strasbourg. MEPs also argued for a clearer distinction between different types of quality indications, and stricter enforcement of the origin of all raw materials used in production. Parliament approved two consultation reports by Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf (Greens-EFA, DE) on protected designation of origin (PDO), protected geographical indication (PGI), and traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) agricultural products and foodstuffs. Parliament approved the Commission proposal to amend the relevant regulations, but insisted that high standards be maintained for these products.
PDOs (such as Roquefort cheese) must be produced, processed and prepared in a given geographical area using a recognised, specified method. PGIs (such as Newcastle Brown Ale) require a link between at least one stage of production, processing or preparation and the region, place or country of origin. TSGs (such as the Belgian cherry-flavoured beer Kriek) highlight the traditional composition or a traditional method of processing or preparation of a product.
A recent ruling by the WTO required the Commission to improve access by non-EU nationals to the Community system of granting these protected labels. Under the terms of this ruling, third country producers can apply for protected designations from the Commission -- although logically only for regions that lie outside of the Union. The EU's PDO, PGI and TSG labels, however, can cause consumers to think that these products in question were produced in the Community.
MEPs therefore suggest changing the labelling system of PDOs, PGIs and TSGs to reflect the actual origin of the product, arguing for "the places of origin and processing of each agricultural product or foodstuff marketed" under Community protection to "be clearly and visibly indicated on the label." They also suggest a better differentiation between the respective labels for PDOs, PGIs and TSGs, which at present look confusingly similar, "by means of colour codes specific to each symbol."
Parliament demanded that after at most 10 years of a transitional period, all raw materials used in a PGI be produced in the designated region, with only very stringently controlled exceptions to be granted to this rule. For TSGs, the EP suggested that only products that have been on the market "since before the Second World War" should be eligible for the appropriate label. MEPs also called on the Commission to publish the registry on the Internet.

Human rights
MEPs adopt human rights resolutions on Transnistria, Impunity in Africa and the situation in Kazakhstan
2006-03-20 - 13:23
As is customary at the end of each Strasbourg plenary session, MEPs adopted three separate resolutions on human rights in the world. This time Parliament focused on Transnistria, Impunity in Africa and the situation in Kazakhstan.
MEPs strongly condemn Transnistrian regime
Parliament adopted a joint resolution by 77 votes in favour to 1 against, and no abstentions, strongly condemning the repression, harassment and intimidation of representatives of the independent media, citizens criticising the self-proclaimed Transnistrian authorities, and members of NGOs and of the opposition by the Transnistrian regime. The House condemns the prohibition of funding of NGOs by foreign donors. MEPs deplore the unwillingness of this regime to engage fully in efforts to reach a peaceful and comprehensive solution to the Transnistria conflict. Parliament welcomes, therefore, the extension of the EU visa ban on members of the Transnistrian regime.
MEPs deeply deplore the fact that the self-proclaimed Transnistrian authorities, more than one-and-a-half years after the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Ilascu and others was delivered, continue to keep two applicants imprisoned. The House calls on the Moldovan authorities to continue their efforts towards putting an end to the unlawful and arbitrary detention of Mr Andrei Ivantoc and Mr Tudor Petrov-Popa and securing their immediate release. The House strongly urges the Russian authorities to actively pursue all effective avenues capable of putting an end to the unlawful and arbitrary detention of both prisoners and of securing their immediate release. Parliament calls on the Council, the Commission and the Member States to plea for the immediate release of these prisoners.
MEPs are convinced that reforms in Moldova will only be successful when they are carried out with respect for the rule of law and fundamental freedoms. The House urges that all the parties concerned, including members of civil society, work together to foster the further development of the country's democracy.
MEPs call on Russia to immediately stop its support for the Transnistrian regime, to reaffirm its commitment to Moldova's territorial integrity as defined by the Moldovan Constitution and to withdraw its troops, including their heavy weaponry and munitions, unconditionally. The House stresses that the troops, under the decision taken at the 1999 OSCE Summit in Istanbul, should have been withdrawn by the end of 2002. Finally, Parliament calls on the Council to include this item on the agenda of the next EU-Russia summit.
Impunity in Africa and in particular the case of Hissène Habré
In adopting a joint resolution on impunity in Africa and in particular the case of Hissène Habré by 85 votes in favour to 0 against with 1 abstention, MEPs recall that without an International Criminal Court to establish individual responsibility as an enforcement mechanism, acts of genocide and egregious violations of human rights would often go unpunished. The House stresses that it has become customary international law that, irrespective of their status, perpetrators will not enjoy amnesty or immunity for human rights violations, and strongly supports bringing to justice those responsible for crimes and atrocities. MEPs urge Member States of the African Union that have not yet done so to ratify the Rome Statute and to adopt a national action plan for the effective implementation of the Rome Statute at the national level.
The House calls on the African Union to take practical measures which would contribute to regional efforts in the fight against impunity.
MEPs call on Senegal to guarantee Hissène Habré a fair trial, through his extradition to Belgium if there is not an African alternative, in accordance with the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The House calls on the African Union, within the framework of the case against Hissène Habré, to ensure that Senegal respects its international commitments as a State Party to the Convention against Torture.
MEPs call on the Government of Nigeria to act in the continued interests of the Liberian peace process and in support of the rule of law by surrendering Charles Ghankay Taylor forthwith to the jurisdiction of the Special Court for Sierra Leone.
Finally, the House calls on Member States to do whatever they can to ensure that nationals of European countries who have committed crimes or acted as accomplices to crimes in Africa and in developing countries elsewhere are likewise prosecuted and that the victims of such crimes receive compensation.
Situation in Kazakhstan
In adopting a joint resolution on the situation in Kazakhstan, MEPs condemn the murder of Mr Altynbek Sarsenbayev, and extends their condolences to the families of the victims. The House expresses its great concern at the fact that within a time-frame of three months two prominent opposition politicians were killed. MEPs call on the Kazakhstan authorities to carry out the ongoing investigation into the circumstances of the death of Mr Altynbek Sarsenbayev and the two persons who accompanied him in a full, independent and transparent manner.
The House welcomes President Nazarbayev's statement of 21 February condemning the murders and promising severe punishment for those involved. MEPs also welcome the release of Mr Galymzhan Zhakianov from his internal exile. The House condemns the jailing of opposition activists and journalists for five to fifteen days for taking part in the peaceful rally following the death of Mr Altynbek Sarsenbayev. MEPs urge the Kazakhstan government to honour its commitments under the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, in particular to respect democracy, the principles of international law and human rights, and to move towards democratisation, guarantees of greater freedom for citizens, and liberalisation.
Parliament calls on the Council and Commission to place the issue of respect for human rights at the core of the next Cooperation Council meeting, linking progress in this field to the further implementation of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, and to strengthen the TACIS democracy programmes for Kazakhstan, aiming, in particular, at strengthening and developing democratic institutions, independent media and the fight against corruption. The House calls for the inclusion of these topics on the agenda for the next meeting of the EU-Kazakhstan Parliamentary Cooperation Committee, which is due to take place on 29 and 30 March.
Finally, MEPs stress that respect for the principles of democracy, the rule of law and human rights, as clearly laid down in the Partnership and Co-operation Agreement, is a prerequisite if Kazakhstan is to chair the OSCE as it intends from 2009. Text adopted
