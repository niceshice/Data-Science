Intergovernmental Conference
2007-08-29 - 09:58
Parliament will work closely with the Commission successfully to conclude the drafting of the EU Reform Treaty by October, even though some issues still need to be properly discussed. This was the outcome of an informal meeting on Tuesday evening between Parliament’s three representatives for the Inter-Governmental Conference and the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso.
Elmar Brok (EPP-ED, DE), Enrique Barón Crespo (PES, ES) and Andrew Duff (ALDE, UK) said: "We had a fruitful exchange of views over a wide range of topics concerning the draft Reform Treaty. We discussed with Mr Barroso the complexity of transforming the mandate of the European Council into proper treaty form. We were able to identify together certain points which, in our opinion, need further legal clarification, political explanation, or both."
"The Commission and Parliament remain jointly committed to bringing the IGC to a successful conclusion at the meeting of the heads of government on 18-19 October. We agreed to keep in close touch for the duration of the Conference", they concluded.
The three MEPs will participate in an informal meeting of EU Foreign Affairs Ministers in Viana do Castelo, Portugal, on 7 September to continue the discussion on the new treaty.
