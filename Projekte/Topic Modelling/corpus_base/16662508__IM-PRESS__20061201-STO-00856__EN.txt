MEPs plead for more funding to fight HIV/AIDS
Thursday's plenary paved the way for the next generation of the EU’s research programme, increasing EU funding for collaboration on science and research to € 54.58 billion over a period of seven years. MEPs also adopted the last reports on the accession of Bulgaria and Romania in January 2007. Safety standards for fireworks and HIV/AIDS also figured prominently on the agenda.
Europe lags behind the US and Asia in its investment in research and development and the aim of the €54.58 billion seventh research framework programme is to redress the balance. The European Parliament has repeatedly pressed for the EU and Member States as well as companies to invest much more in science and technological innovation. The aim is to move towards a E uropean Research Area, which would be a sort of "common market" for research. The long-term goal is for the EU to become the world’s leading research area.
Parliament got funding for some of its priorities including research on renewable energy and energy efficiency as well research on children's health and respiratory diseases.
MEPs plead for more funding to fight HIV/AIDS
Just ahead of World AIDS Day on Friday 1 December, the Parliament adopted a resolution calling on the European Commission to increase to €1 billion its contribution to the Global Fund against HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. MEPs stressed the need for investments into research, preventive campaigns, healthcare professionals, education and developing the AIDS vaccines.
There are about 40 million HIV sufferers worldwide and around 4.3 million adults and children were infected this year. While some 95% live in developing countries, the rate of infection is rising in most EU countries.
EP welcomes Accession of Bulgaria and Romania
The Parliament adopted the final resolutions welcoming the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the EU on 1 January. Two separate reports said the countries should continue with the reforms they have begun but should focus attention on the following areas:
Bulgaria
Creating greater transparency
Expanding specialised police units to fight organised crime, corruption, drugs and human trafficking
Improving the climate for foreign investments
Romania
Improving protection of minorities
Strengthening the fight against corruption
Applying EU legislation on food safety
Better preparation for receiving agricultural funds
Fireworks: Better EU Safety regulations
The Parliament Thursday overwhelmingly adopted new standards for fireworks aimed at cutting back on the 45,000 accidents which injure EU citizens every year, many of them children and young people.
The new rules will set common EU standards and create a transparent EU-wide classification of fireworks, based on age and how dangerous the product is. There will be four categories ranging from 1, which is very safe and can be handled by children aged 12 and above, to category 3, only for adults and 4, only to be handled by pyrotechnic experts.
