The award recognises excellence in European journalism The annual prize for excellence in journalism will be awarded by the European Parliament next Thursday, 15 October. There are four prizes up for grabs divided between the print media, radio, TV and the internet. They will be picked from over 65 national award winners, who were themselves selected from over 250 entries. The prize is awarded annually to recognise those journalists who have contributed to the understanding of European issues and debates.
Below are the nominations for the UK and Ireland.
Internet
The UK nomination for the internet section is an entry on Mark Mardell's BBC blog entitled 'German identity angst'. Published in November 2008, it looks at perceptions of modern Germany and what it means to be German today.
Based in Brussels until recently, Mark Mardell's blog developed a wide audience - this entry received 487 comments - and is not only well-written, but engaging and insightful.
Written
Justin Stares' piece for Lloyd's List won the UK nomination for the written press category, beating off entries from national, local and other specialist trade publications. His article 'The human factor' looked at the impact of EU maritime safety legislation on the ship breaking industry both in the EU and the rest of the world, with a particular focus on South Asia.
Lloyd's List is a daily newspaper for the shipping industry which has been running continuously since 1734. Justin Stares' article was accessible, avoiding the use of jargon, even though written for a specialist audience and raised an important ethical dimension to issues arising from the unforeseen consequences of EU legislation.
The Irish nominees are as follows:
Stephen Carroll , from RTÉ television , submitted an innovative news piece explaining the Lisbon Treaty to children/teenagers as part of the News 2 Day programme on RTÉ 2. All members of the Jury were extremely enthusiastic about this entry.
The winner of the print category was Jamie Smyth , European Correspondent with the Irish Times , whose series of articles entitled 'Lisbon Explained', were deemed to be interesting, understandable and informative.
Teresa O'Malley , from local radio station Midwest Radio , submitted a lively and entertaining report on former European Commissioner Padraig Flynn. Among the entries in that category, hers was deemed to be the most informative and entertaining.
Award and discussion on the media and democracy
The winners will be announced on Thursday 15 October at 9:00 am sharp by the European Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek. Each winner in the four categories will receive € 5 000.
The speeches of the winners will be followed by a panel discussion 'The role of new media: an opportunity for democratic participation?' to be moderated by Vice-President Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, with the participation of the jury members Morten Løkkegaard MEP and Letizia Gambini who is a Member of the European Youth Press.
