Agnese KRIVADE BXL (+32) 2 28 43562 STR (+33) 3 881 74794 PORT (+32) 498 98 39 83 EMAIL inta-press@europarl.europa.eu The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) will be discussed in public in the European Parliament Committee for International Trade for the first time on 29 February. It is this committee which will make a formal recommendation to the full house on whether or not to approve ACTA. Parliament cannot amend the agreement, but only approve or reject it. If it does not give its consent, then the agreement falls as far as the EU is concerned.
Under EU Treaty articles 207 and 218, most international agreements need Parliament's consent to enter into force. Equally, all EU countries need to ratify them.

What are Parliament’s options?
Parliament previously asked the Commission to make ACTA documents public and enhance MEPs’ role in negotiating the contents. Now that the final version of ACTA has been agreed, Parliament cannot alter it, but only approve or block it. Four scenarios are possible:
1. Parliament gives its consent. The Council would then take a decision to conclude the agreement. In this case all member states would still have to ratify for the agreement to come into force.
2. Parliament declines to give its consent. This would mean the entire EU staying out of the agreement.
3. Parliament does not reply. Legally, there is no deadline for a response.
4. Parliament decides to refer ACTA to the European Court of Justice (ECJ). In this case, the vote on Parliament's consent would be postponed until the Court has delivered its opinion.
The European Commission announced on 22 February that it intended to refer ACTA to the ECJ, in order "to assess whether ACTA is incompatible - in any way - with the EU's fundamental rights and freedoms".
The Commission's statement was welcomed by Parliament's rapporteur David Martin (S&D, UK), who will steer the dossier through Parliament. He described the possible ECJ ruling as a "good guarantee for the impact on fundamental rights".
What is ACTA?
The stated aim of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) is to combat Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) infringements, namely counterfeiting and piracy, by enhancing international cooperation and enforcement.
ACTA is intended to accelerate IPR enforcement, and make it more effective, so as to counter growth in counterfeiting and piracy. In 2005, the OECD estimated that international trade in counterfeit/pirated products amounts to USD 200 billion, excluding digital products.
ACTA was negotiated between the EU and its Member States, the US, Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and Switzerland. Once the agreement has entered in force, any member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) may apply to join.
What does ACTA say?
ACTA lays down an international legal framework for enforcing existing IPRs, targeting counterfeit goods and copyright infringements on the Internet. It lays down obligatory and voluntary enforcement measures to be adopted by countries that have joined the agreement. In this regard it can be compared to an EU directive — it has to be "transposed" into national/EU legislation. As far as the EU is concerned, ACTA is a mixed agreement — it contains different sets of provisions, which fall partly under EU exclusive competence and partly under shared EU/member state competence.
How will ACTA come into force?
ACTA was signed on 1 October 2011 by Australia, Canada, Japan, Morocco, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and the United States. They were joined on 26 January 2012 in Tokyo by representatives of 22 EU member states (Cyprus, Estonia, Slovakia, Germany and the Netherlands were “expected to do so on the completion of their respective domestic procedures”) and representatives of the EU as such. However, the signatures need to be followed by ratification for ACTA to enter into force.
Ratification by six parties to the negotiations is sufficient for the agreement to come into force. The EU is considered to be a single negotiating party.
As of 14 February 2012, none of the 27 EU member states had ratified the agreement.
Next steps on ACTA in the EP
The International Trade Committee is to recommend whether Parliament as a whole should give its consent to ACTA or reject it.
Four other committees will deliver their opinions on ACTA: the Industry, Research and Energy Committee (rapporteur Amelia Andersdotter Greens, SE), the Legal Affairs Committee (rapporteur Marielle Gallo EPP, FR), the Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs Committee (rapporteur Dimitrios Droutsas S&D, EL) and the Development Committee (rapporteur Jan Zahradil, ECR, CZ).
On 28 February a petition on ACTA, signed by almost over 2.5 million people from all over the world, will be handed to the European Parliament's Petitions Committee. The event will be web streamed on EP Live.
On 29 February the International Trade Committee will hold a first exchange of views on ACTA with the European Commission.
On 1 March, there will be a public workshop in which MEPs, academic experts, civil society organisations and EU officials will discuss ACTA's possible merits and disadvantages.
What will happen after these opening debates is not yet certain. The International Trade Committee will debate the pros and cons of the agreement and the rapporteur will in the end make a proposal to the other committee members to either approve or reject ACTA.
There will also be a resolution in which the committee sets out its opinion on the agreement in greater detail. The committee might recommend asking the European Court of Justice for a ruling on whether the agreement is compatible with the EU Treaty.
