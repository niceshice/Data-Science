The High Level Contact Group of the European Parliament for relations with the Turkish Cypriot community inaugurated its Internet site on 1st December. The content of the site is available in Greek, Turkish and English with extensive reference to the activities of the group which mainly consist of meetings in Strasbourg or Brussels and visits to Cyprus.
The link to the site is: http://www.europarl.europa.eu/cytr/
The Group was set up to respond to the pressing need to strengthen relations with the Turkish Cypriot community in the northern part of the island after the accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union. The Group also contributes, in a manner which is constructive and respectful to all sensitivities, to defining a modus operandi for Parliament vis-à-vis the Turkish Cypriot community, until such time as the question of reunification of Cyprus has been resolved. The Group will therefore update the Conference of Presidents and, where appropriate, the parliamentary committees, on how the situation develops.
Members of the Group
Coordinator of the Group is Mme Françoise GROSSETÊTE (EPP-ED, FR) and Deputy Coordinator is Mme Mechtild ROTHE (PES, DE). The other members of the Group are Mme Karin RESETARITS (ALDE, AT), Mr Seán Ó NEACHTAIN (UEN, IE), Cem ÖZDEMIR (GREENS/ΕFA, DE), Mr Francis WURTZ (GUE/NGL, FR), Mr Georgios GEORGIOU ΓΕΩΡΓΙΟΥ (IND/DEM) and Ashley MOTE (NI, UK).
