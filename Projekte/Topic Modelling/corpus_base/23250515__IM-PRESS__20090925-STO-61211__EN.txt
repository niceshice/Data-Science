Pooling Europe's resources to tackle Alzheimer's

Philippe Lamberts 'invest enough resources and we get the best return' There are currently over 7 million people in Europe suffering from Alzheimer’s and related disorders and this will double in 20 years. New plans to pool resources between countries to maximise investment, good practice and coordinate research were outlined Tuesday (29 September) to MEPs. We spoke to Philippe Lamberts, the Belgian Green Member who has been asked by Parliament to draw up a report on the issue.
He gave us his initial thoughts and began by telling us that the aim of the exercise was to "ensure that the research and development resources of European Union countries are focused and harnessed".
"Threat to millions of Europeans"
He went on to stress the danger that Alzheimer's and related conditions pose for many in our society: "Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, are an increasing threat to millions of Europeans and their families. We need to ensure that we invest enough resources and we get the best return on the money we pump into research.".
The Parliament's role will be consultative and Mr Lamberts was keen to ensure that the issue does not get bogged down in wrangling between EU Institutions and European governments.
Patenting issues must not slow progress
Explaining some of the points made by his fellow Members this morning (Tuesday, 29 September), when the European Commission outlined its proposals in Parliament, he told us that MEPs raised several concerns particularly about prevention and ensuring that funds aren't shifted away from real research. The possibility that intellectual property, such as patenting issues, may prove to be an obstacle to the speed of the results was also raised.
He went on to say that it was crucial that "work isn't being duplicated and ensuring that enough resources are efficiently allocated".
"Of course with research one never knows when results will be obtained, but we should be careful to avoid spending money on things that do not bring any real value to the project" he said.
Money for research or helping families?
The need for a balance between more medical research or help for families was raised at the meeting by several Members. As Mr Lamberts, a father of four, explained, "some MEPs suggested that research efforts be aimed at families and relatives of people suffering from this condition".
He went on to say that "the main question with this is - is this a matter for research or for more social initiatives? We should make sure that we do not mix things up here. I have no preconceptions on this matter - it is something which we'll have to look into".
Background
Alzheimer's disease and other dementias are part of the broader neurodegenerative diseases. Last year the 27 States of the EU asked the European Commission to draw up proposals to coordinate research into Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. Funding for research comes through the 7th Research Framework Programme. The Lamberts report is expected early in the new year.
