Maternity leave directive: paid paternity leave plan creates controversy among MEPs

Maternity leave should be extended from 14 to 20 weeks, says MEP Edite Estrela (S&amp;D, PT) in a report, debated by Womens' Rights Committee MEPs on Tuesday, on proposals to update the EU "maternity leave" directive. The idea of introducing paid paternity leave also gave rise to heated debate.
"We are living in difficult times, it's true. This proposal will replace a directive that dates back 17 years. We need to set the bar high for the next couples of decades", said rapporteur Edite Estrela (S&D, Portugal).
A first report on the directive on the improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers was referred back to the committee by the plenary on 6 May 2009.
Extend maternity leave from 14 weeks to 20 weeks
In her second draft report, Mrs Estrela proposes that maternity leave be extended from 14 to 20 weeks. The worker would be paid 100% of her salary for the first six first weeks of the leave period, and not less than 85% for the rest. The rapporteur also wants to introduce new provisions on paid paternity leave.
On 3 October 2008 the European Commission proposed increasing maternity leave to 18 weeks, of which six would have to be taken after the birth, and also a payment equivalent to 100% of the last monthly salary or the average salary, but the latter would not be compulsory.
Paid paternity leave
Anna Záborská (EPP, SK) argued that maternity leave, paternity leave and parental leave should not be muddled. The maternity leave directive "is about mother's health", she said. The social partners agreed on parental leave in June 2009 and the Commission is currently drafting a directive, she stressed.
Other MEPs, including Siiri Oviir (ALDE, ET) and Caroline Lucas (Greens/EFA, UK), backed the idea of paid paternity leave as a means to protect the health of the mothers at a time when it is important to protect the family. "Paternity leave might cause a problem. This issue is also a question of money and employers and Member States will have to give their support", said Tadeusz Cymański (ECR, PL).
The Commission representative announced that the EU Council of Ministers had reached an agreement on parental leave on 30 November. This extends parental leave from three to four months for each parent, of which one month would be non-transferable. "Concerning paternity leave, there is no current proposal in the pipeline", he added.
"I want to make it clear that I am not talking about parental leave but about maternity and paternity leave", concluded Edite Estrela.
Next Steps
The committee vote is scheduled for 23 February 2010 and the plenary vote for the March II session in Brussels.
In the Chair: Eva-Britt Svensson (GUE/NGL, SV)
Procedure: co-decision, first reading
With the Lisbon Treaty, in force as of 1 December 2009, the European Parliament has important new lawmaking powers. Virtually all EU legislation is now decided by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers together - including agriculture, immigration, energy and the EU budget. As the only directly elected EU institution, Parliament's position in making sure the EU is accountable to its citizens is also strengthened, for example by MEPs having a bigger say in appointments to many of the EU's top jobs. 20091130IPR65557 Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality Draft report Profile of Rapporteur Edite ESTRELA (S&D, PT)
