Over 64,000 visitors interested in how the EU and Parliament work have experienced the Parlamentarium since Europe's largest parliamentary visitors centre opened 100 days ago. The European Parliament's visitors centre allows children and adults to discover Europe's history and how the decisions that influence our daily lives are made in a modern and interactive way.
Parlamentarium opened to the public on 14 October and has gained popularity as a Brussels attraction. It is ranked among the top things to do in Brussels on the "Tripadvisor" travel information site.
The visit is accessible in the 23 official EU languages, with sign language in English, French, German and Dutch. Admission is free, it is open seven days a week and the centre is fully accessible to visitors with special needs. It also offers a role play game in which students can step into an MEP's shoes.
