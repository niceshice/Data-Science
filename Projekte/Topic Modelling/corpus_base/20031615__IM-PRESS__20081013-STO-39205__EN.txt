1 set of migration rules to replace 27 national ones is the aim A Blue Card scheme to attract highly qualified migrants to the EU came closer on Tuesday 4 November. MEPs on the Civil Liberties Committee backed the measure as a way to help address Europe's skills shortage which is estimated at 20 million people. Prior to the vote on 4 November we spoke to the MEP who is guiding the legislation through Parliament - German Christian Democrat Ewa Klamt.
Last October the Commission proposed the Blue Card scheme to make it easier for skilled migrants to come to Europe. At present there are 27 different visa regimes in place.
MEPs in the Civil Liberties Committee want the card to be a work and residency permit for 3 years which can also be renewed. Family members will also be allowed into the EU whilst individual countries would be able decide for themselves how many skilled migrants to admit.
By way of comparison the US Green Card allows permanent residency for 10 years and allows people to work and travel freely in America.
Speaking to us ahead of the committee vote Ewa Klamt stressed the need for skilled migrants. She said that in her native Germany "there is a lack of 95 thousand engineers" and that "the education system had only produced twenty thousand."
She also warned of the need for Europe not to lose out on skilled labour saying that "50% of skilled migrants from Maghreb states go to the US or Canada, only 5.5 % come to EU."
Defining "highly qualified"
On the wider political need for the measures she was emphatic: "we have always said we need the possibility of a legal migration. If you want to stop illegal migration, you can only close the door if you open up the door for legal migration."
How to define a "highly skilled" individual is a key issue. MEPs on the Civil Liberties Committee support Ms Klamt's view that there should be two possibilities. It could either a higher education qualification - meaning at least 3 years of studies - or higher professional qualification, attested by evidence of at least five years of professional experience.
The report also rules out an upper age limit for migrants.
How to avert a brain drain
Many have voiced a fear that Europe will take the best and brightest from Africa and other parts of the developing world in a modern day "brain drain". Ewa Klamt told us that "we say that in areas and sectors vital to achieving the UN millennium goals - like health and education - which are vital to developing countries we must restrict ourselves from plundering their essential workers."
A possible compromise that could emerge is that EU countries may reject a Blue Card application to avoid brain-drain in sectors suffering from a lack of qualified personnel in the countries of origin.
Regarding the salaries to be paid to migrants, Ms Klamt told us that "we have put down that it has to be 1.7 times of the gross monthly or annual average wages under national law which is different in each country."
For this directive the parliament is involved under the Consultation procedure. The parliament will later vote on the agreement reached in the committee.
