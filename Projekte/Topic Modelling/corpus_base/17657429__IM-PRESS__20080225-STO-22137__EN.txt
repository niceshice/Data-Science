The new €2 coin (middle) with other entries
A Europe-wide online poll to select a design for a commemorative €2 coin has chosen a design by Greek sculptor George Stamatopoulos. His design symbolises the currency as the latest step in a long history of trade within and outside Europe. The winning design will be on 90 million coins minted and put into circulation next year to mark the 10th anniversary of the completion of economic and monetary union (EMU).
The winning design got 40% of the 141,000 votes cast between 31 January and 22 February.
2nd Europe wide €2 special coin
The new coin will be the second commemorative coin to be issued across the whole euro zone. The first, also a €2 coin, marked the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome in 2007.
Each member of the 15-member euro zone can issue one commemorative €2 coin a year. So far nine countries have done so.
The euro is also used in Vatican City, San Marino and Monaco. Given their relative scarcity coins from these states are much sought after by collectors.
Slovakia next in line
Slovakia is expected to join the euro next, as the beginning of 2009. A new country will bring new euros to be collected.
