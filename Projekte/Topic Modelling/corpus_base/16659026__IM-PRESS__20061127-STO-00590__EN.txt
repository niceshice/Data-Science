Leonard Orban and Meglena Kuneva
Will Meglena Kuneva and Leonard Orban be the two new European Commissioners from January 2007? The European Parliament can say yes...or no, so on Monday 27 November, the two Commissioners-designate were in Brussels to make statements and answer MEPs' and observers' questions. The Parliament will take a final vote in December.
The candidates spoke in hearings organised by the parliamentary committees dealing with the areas for which they will be responsible. Leonard Orban, the Commissioner-designate for Romania, has been assigned the multilingualism and inter-cultural dialogue portfolio so he answered questions from the Culture and Constitutional Affairs Committees. The Bulgarian Commissioner-designate, Meglena Kuneva, who is slated to take over consumer protection faced the Committees for Internal Market and Environment.
Leonard Orban, Romanian candidate
During Mr Orban's hearing MEPs asked about the following issues:
multilingualism inside the European institutions and resources for translations and interpreting
intercultural cooperation
minority languages
the limits of the portfolio
Mr Orban said that multilingualism is a must in the EU and forms part of its identity. "English is not enough... Multilingualism is good for business and competitiveness ." He said he has two main objectives: the quality of the EU translation, interpreting and publishing to ensure good communication inside the institutions and with the citizens; and keeping the costs of multilingualism at an acceptable level. He will be responsible for the work of around 3,400 Commission officials.
He also said that he will promote language learning in schools and aims to establish a dialogue with minorities. The aim is to "protect all languages within the EU, including the languages of minorities. "

Leaders of political groups give positive assessment
The Conference of Presidents gave a positive assessment of the hearings Tuesday, 28 November , but asked for clarification of Mr Orban's portfolio. It c onfirmed the vote on the approval of the two new Commissioners is scheduled for Tuesday 12 December.
EP hearings - an important step in the investiture procedure
Before the Commissioners designate can take up their places they must get EP approval, and while its opinion is not legally binding, it is more than just a formality. For example, in 2004 two commissioners designate were withdrawn after the parliament threatened to withhold its approval of the whole Commission.
The EP usually votes on the Commission as a whole, but in this case it will vote only on the two new Commissioners and not on the enlarged Commission.
The Parliament has been holding hearings for incoming Commissioners since 1994, after legislation that required its approval before the Commission's appointment by the Council of Ministers.
What happens next?
The EP takes a vote of approval on the two Commissioners designate during the December plenary session in Strasbourg
The two Commissioners will be formally appointed by the Council
After their appointment, the Commissioners will take an oath before the Court of Justice
Their mandates will expire at the end of October 2009, at the same time as the Commissioners already in office.
