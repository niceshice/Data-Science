Parliament adopted a written declaration calling on the Council to agree on an EU-wide commitment to end street homelessness by 2015. The declaration calls on the Commission to develop a European framework definition of homelessness, gather comparable and reliable statistical data, and provide annual updates on action taken and progress made in EU Member States towards ending homelessness.
MEPs urge Member States to devise ‘winter emergency plans’ as part of a wider homelessness strategy in the written declaration initially put forward by Mary Lou McDonald, Jacek Protasiewicz, Claude Moraes, Gérard Onesta, Jean Marie Beaupuy and signed by 405 MEPs so far. In order for a written declaration to be adopted it must be signed by more than half of all MEPs (393 out of 785)
Parliament points out that homelessness was identified as a priority by the EPSCO Council in 2005, and is a priority under the 'active inclusion' strand of the EU social protection and inclusion strategy. MEPs says access to adequate housing is a fundamental human right and access to shelter often the first step towards adequate and sustainable housing solutions for people experiencing extreme poverty and exclusion.
Every winter people freeze to death across the EU because of lack of emergency accommodation and outreach services catering for their needs. Street homelessness, says the written declaration, is the most visible form of homelessness, which can only be addressed effectively as part of a wider holistic strategy.
