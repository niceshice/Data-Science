In adopting the report of Gay Mitchell (EPP-ED, IE), the plenary proposed that the European Parliament should maintain its co-decision power for decisions on priority policies, threatened by the creation of a single instrument for the co-operation of development and industrialised countries. Without restructuring the Commission's proposition, Parliament would have lost its co-decision power in 16 existing areas of regulation on 1 January 2007.
Parliament is determined to maintain its powers as co-legislator in strategic priorities, geographical and thematic aid programmes, which the European Commission desires to be determined by the comitology procedure. Co-decision also applies to multi-annual financial framework.
In line with the Millennium Development Goals, Parliament has limited the scope of the instrument to the developing countries. Cooperation with industrialised countries will be dealt with in a separate agreement. At the time of yesterday's debate the European Commission had accepted this claim.
On the question of aid funding, MEPs stated that budgetary support should receive the support of the Court of Auditors and the parliament of the partner country. Any suspension of aid must be decided by the Council of Ministers by a qualified majority after the European Parliament has been consulted.
During the debate, the rapportuer Gay Mitchell and the President of the Commission of development, Luisa Morgantini (GUE/NGL IT) announced the setting up of a new working group which will determine Parliament's position even before the Council agrees on its common position.
