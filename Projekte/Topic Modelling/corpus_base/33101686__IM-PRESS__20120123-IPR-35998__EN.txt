The deadline for the submission of applications for the Charlemagne Youth Prize has been postponed to 13th February. This will give more candidates the opportunity to participate in the fifth edition of the Prize. The procedure for the submission of applications is simple and straightforward.
Role models for young Europeans
The Charlemagne Youth Prize, which is jointly organised by the European Parliament and the Foundation of the International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen, is awarded to projects undertaken by people between 16 and 30 years old and helping to promote understanding between peoples of different European countries. The winning projects should serve as role models for young people living in Europe and offer practical examples of Europeans living together as one community. Youth exchange programmes, artistic and Internet projects with a European dimension are amongst the projects selected.
Total prize money of 10,000 Euros
The three winning projects will be awarded funding of €5,000, €3,000, and €2,000 respectively. They will also be invited to visit the European Parliament. Representatives of the best projects from each of the 27 EU Member States will be invited to Aachen, in Germany, on 15th May 2012, to participate in the award ceremony.
2011 winners
In 2011, the UK online lifestyle magazine "Europe & Me" created by young Europeans for young Europeans in 2007 was awarded the first prize in the European Charlemagne Youth Prize competition. The second and third prize went to "Balkans Beyond Borders", a short-film project from Greece, and to the "Escena Erasmus Project" (Spain), a project addressed mainly to Erasmus students, encouraging cultural and linguistic exchanges, respectively.
