©BELGA DEBATE ABOUT PUBLIC BROADCASTING NON-LEGISLATIVE REPORT DRAFTED BY BELGIAN LIBERAL IVO BELET Public Service Broadcasters (PSB) suffer from mounting politicisation and flawed funding models in several EU member states. Parliaments, governments and regulators should start a public debate about the future of public broadcasting with an emphasis on depoliticised governing structures, independent public funding and a stronger focus on young people, says a new initiative report drafted by Belgian MEP Ivo Belet (centre right European People's Party). We asked him what’s at stake.
What are the "major problems jeopardising the political independence" of PSB?
The independence of public service broadcasters can be endangered in two ways.
First through the politicisation of the governance structures - for instance appointments to the management board, the supervisory board, the council and appointment of the director-general. Therefore we ask in the report that the members of the board should be appointed on the basis of their “competence and acquaintance” with the media sector.
Secondly public service broadcasters' independence is threatened when there is no long-term stable financing. If governments decide on budgets on an annual basis, public service broadcasters are vulnerable to political interference.
How can public service broadcasters reach out to young people?
The traditional way of watching television is in decline, especially among younger viewers. In order to reach these audiences, public service broadcasters have to be able to diversify their offer. They should be free to offer new services and to offer their content on new platforms.
Public service broadcasters should be structured in such a way, that they are able to offer attractive quality online content to reach young people, who access the media almost exclusively via the internet.
What can be done at EU level to secure PSB's economic and political independence?
All EU countries have signed up to recommendations and declarations from the Council of Europe adhering to the principles of economic and political independence for their public service broadcasters. We ask the European Audiovisual Observatory to gather data and carry out research on the application of these standards and we ask that Member States are held accountable when failing to fulfil these commitments.
We also ask that the Media Pluralism Monitor ( an instrument developed at the Commission’s request with indicators on the status of the public service broadcasters) is implemented.
