Parliament must be more involved in the process of monitoring the EU-Comoros fisheries agreement, stressed MEPs on Wednesday as they backed the renewal of a fisheries protocol which expired on 31 December. The new arrangements redefine fishing opportunities for EU vessels and provide additional funding of €300,000 annually for the Comoros to build essential infrastructure.
In other votes today Parliament also approved new rules on imports of fishery products from Greenland, authorised the prolongation of transitional technical measures until 2013 and adapted a regulation on financial measures for the EU fisheries policy.
The agreement with the Comoros in numbers
The resolution on the partnership agreement with the Comoros, drafted by Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos (S&D, PT) and adopted by show of hands, calls on the Commission to provide regular, detailed information on implementation of the protocol.
The new protocol allocates fishing opportunities to 70 vessels - 45 tuna seiners and 25 surface longliners from France, Italy, Portugal and Spain - compared to 57 under the previous arrangements.
With the annual reference tonnage cut from 6,000 to 4,850 tonnes, the financial contribution to the Union of the Comoros will fall from €390,000 to €315,250 per year.
The EU will provide additional funding of €300,000 annually, primarily to build or extend existing infrastructure to enable EU vessels to land their catches in Comorian ports rather than transporting them as far as to Seychelles, which, apart from being costly, has proved dangerous due to the activity of pirates in the Western Indian Ocean.
The new protocol includes human rights clauses, following Parliament's insistence that such clauses be included in all fisheries agreements.
Imports from Greenland
Parliament also gave its approval to new rules on imports of fishery products and by-products from Greenland. This legislation will enable Greenland to trade its fishery products and by-products within the EU under internal market rules provided it complies with EU sanitary, animal health and food safety standards. Parliament's resolution, approved by 652 votes to 19 with 2 abstentions, was drafted by Carmen Fraga Estévez (EPP, ES). She stressed that Parliament should not simply be consulted on this matter but enjoy shared legislative power with the Council under the co-decision procedure.
Transitional technical measures and finances
MEPs also approved a regulation extending existing transitional technical measures with regard to conservation of fishery resources until the end of 2012. By then the Commission is expected to present its proposal for a new, permanent regulation. The resolution was drafted by Estelle Grelier (S&D, FR) and adopted in plenary by 622 votes to 40 with 21 abstentions.
Finally, Parliament backed changes to a regulation on financial measures for the implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy designed to ensure its coherence with other relevant legislation. In addition, the new regulation will ensure that international bodies in charge of stock assessments can receive proper EU funding. The report, drafted by João Ferreira (GUE/NGL, PT) was adopted by 633 votes to 26 with 13 abstentions.
