Hubert Weber, President of the Court of Auditors
The EU's chief auditor Hubert Weber was in Parliament on the second and final day of the session to discuss his report on EU spending in 2006 with MEPs. His report says that budget management has improved but that too many "errors" are still in the system. MEPs also backed the financing of Europe-wide political parties from the EU budget. This could lead to the creation of more European political think tanks. MEPs also added their support to the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
EU Audit: No "Statement of Assurance"
Mr Weber told MEPs that though the Commission has made considerable efforts to address the weaknesses in management of EU funds, the Court's audit still picked up too many "errors" in the chain of expenditure linking the Commission, Member State administrations and final beneficiaries.
The Head of the Court of Auditors then told MEPs these errors would make it impossible for him to issue a "Statement of Assurance" for the 2006 budget - the Court's certificate of a problem-free budget.
The Auditors report the main problem areas are in agriculture, structural policies and internal policies. The presumed reason - according to the report - is a combination of "neglect, poor knowledge of the rules (and) presumed attempts to defraud EU budget by claimants".
However, the report is clear in saying that "errors" should not be confused with "fraud".
The next step is that MEPs must look at the Court's conclusions and decide whether the European Commission merits a "discharge" for the budget. This is the Parliament's way of giving its approval for the spending of taxpayers' money.
In a separate but related move MEPs approved the appointment of seven members of Court of Auditors for the period of 2008 - 2013.
Reaction of Parliament's two largest groups
Javier Pomés of the European People's Party and European Democrats told Hubert Weber that "every year your work is better and that helps the EP, it helps the citizens to ensure that EU spending has credibility".
For the Socialist PSE Group Danish MEP Dan Jørgensen (who, like Mr Pomés acted as a co-rapporteur on the issue) said "we need some clear responses; we need some clear explanations if we are going to recommend a discharge".
Financing of European political parties
MEPs also backed a report by German Socialist Jo Leinen on the financing of European political parties.
The new regulation will mean:
European political parties can use money from the EU budget for European election campaigns.
No funding of national parties permitted (funds cannot serve for financing of other parties and particularly of national parties and candidates).
Improved financial stability of the European parties.
The creation of European political foundations.
European political parties are not the same as the political groups in the European Parliament. The issue will now go to EU Ministers. If approved it could come into effect by January 2008.

Tighter gun control
Charter of Fundamental Rights - A large majority of MEPs urged Poland and the UK to make every effort to apply the Charter - The UK and Poland have a special legal protocol on its application whereby the Charter will not extend the powers of any court – national or European – to strike down national legislation in these countries. The Charter will be officially proclaimed by the Parliament, the Commission and the Council on 12 December in Strasbourg
