MEPs defend the immunity of MEP Marek Siwiec
MEPs: immunity and statute
2009-10-20 - 13:18
Parliament voted on Tuesday to preserve the parliamentary immunity of Polish MEP Marek Siwiec through a resolution which argues that "the charges against Mr Siwiec have been brought by a political opponent, with the principal aim of undermining his activity as MEP".
The resolution was adopted with 639 votes in favour, 17 against and 15 abstentions.
In 2004 a Polish citizen brought charges against Mr Siwiec for "offending his religious feelings". This followed a party-political broadcast in October 2000 which showed Mr Siwiec making the sign of the cross and then kissing the ground upon leaving a helicopter (gestures commonly associated with the late Pope John Paul II).
