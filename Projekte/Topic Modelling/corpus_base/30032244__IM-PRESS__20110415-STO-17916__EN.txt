Young, bright…unemployed?

Aim for more youngsters to stay in school ©BELGA_Illustra_Amy Bertrand It is glorious to be young, no doubt about it and, in Europe, inter-railing used to be a great reason (to pick just one). However, not everything in the garden is rosy and being young can be very tough if you are looking for a job. With its "Youth on the Move" initiative, the EU wants to improve opportunities for young job-seekers throughout the Union.
Unemployment is rife among the under 30s, who make up a fifth of the EU population. Around 20% of those under 25 are unemployed and 40% of those who do have jobs are on temporary contracts. Even more worrying 14% don't have a high school diploma, while less than a third of Europeans have a university degree.
Benchmarks to improve these figures exist but specific measures are essential. So what's the plan? Read on and discover some of the 28 proposals approved last week by Parliament's Education and Culture Committee.
Reduce early school leaving : Abandoning school is always a bad idea and the Commission will ask member states to do everything necessary to ensure that no one is left behind. The aim is to reduce the number of people without at secondary school diplomas from 15% to 10% by 2020.
Promote vocational training and traineeships . University doesn't suit everyone, but that shouldn’t mean you are condemned to life as an unskilled labourer. Apprenticeships and traineeships can "build bridges" to the labour market for those with no other qualifications, if they are made more attractive to companies and trainees.
Make higher education more attractive . The aim is to get 40% of all Europeans to graduate from higher education by 2020. To this end, it is proposed that curricula, university governance and funding are modernised. It is estimated that by 2020 one third of all jobs in the EU "will require high level qualifications".
Youth on the Move Card : Learn your trade where it is taught best. By making learning abroad easier, the card aims "to speed up the integration process". It will also offer advantages like those afforded to holders of national student cards.
European Skills Passport : Regular passports say who you are. The skills passport will say what you can do. It will build on the "Europass" and aims to make everyone's skills and competences, whether formal or not, comparable in every member state, improving employment opportunities abroad.
"Your First Job" : Can’t find a job at home? Try abroad...This is a pilot project to help young job-seekers get a start abroad, in a different member state where their particular skills are more in demand.
Youth Guarantee : Everyone has been told at some point that they can’t work because they have no work experience. To break the vicious circle, the EU will propose that public employment services ensure that all under 25s are either in education or employed.
European Vacancy Monitor : Vacancies exist but matching them with job seekers is not easy, especially across 27 countries. The Monitor will try to do just that by monitoring trends in member states to enhance the work of employment agencies.
Funding : Last but not least, funding is crucial to the success of Youth On The Move. Existing programmes such as Erasmus, Leonardo da Vinci and Comenius will be mobilised alongside other EU funds and, hopefully, member states and private sector financing.
Slovenian EPP member, Milan Zver is steering the proposals through Parliament. It is scheduled to come to plenary in May.
