2008-06-03 - 18:43
On 7 June, the European Parliament and other institutions will hold the Festival of Europe to celebrate the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. As in the past, the aim of this event is to bring the EU closer to citizens and to inform them of how it touches upon their daily lives.
On the open days, the general public is invited to visit the institutions' premises and take the opportunity to discuss Europe with EU and national decision-makers and officials. Various fun activities will be offered both inside Parliament and outside, in the European quarter.
Parliament will also hold three debates in its plenary chamber, open to all visitors, throughout the day. These will focus on climate change, the future of Europe and intercultural dialogue. All Parliament's political groups and several of its directorates-general will be pleased to welcome all visitors at their information stands.
Parliament will open its doors from 10.00h to 18.00h. More information can be found at: http://www.fetedeleurope.eu/
