Europe should exploit more of its free capacity on inland waterways as part of the multi-modal transport links across the EU and neighbouring countries, says the European Parliament. MEPs are asking the European Commission to draw up a European Development Plan for the sector which should include an up-to-date inventory of the European inland waterway infrastructure.
The House adopted an own-initiative report on NAIADES with 464 votes in favour, 5 against and 2 abstentions, the Commission's proposals for an integrated Inland Waterway Transport sector, Parliament stresses that the Commission should designate as soon as possible - and not later than the end of 2006 - a European Trans European Transport Network coordinator for inland waterway transport to support the implementation of priority projects, drawing on experience with existing coordinators.
MEPs say the reliability of the waterway network and the availability of multi-functional inland ports are the most important conditions for this vital transport sector. Improving infrastructure and the fleet is also crucial, so, in 2007, the Commission should submit a proposal for a European Waterway Transport Innovation Fund. MEPs also stress the need for the development of clean and efficient vessels under the 7th Framework Programme on Research and Development.
Finally, the House asks the Commission and Member States to provide incentives to accelerate the introduction and use of fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly engines in order to respect stricter limits for SOx, PM, NOx and CO2 emissions.
