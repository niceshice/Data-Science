If I go home he will kill me The upcoming International Women's Day has thrown attention towards what can be done to help women who suffer domestic violence. As leftwing Swedish MEP Eva-Britt Svensson knows only too well, the violence can often be perpetrated by partners in a relationship or marriage. However, to those living in fear she has a strong message, "it is possible to leave this bad relationship and make your own life". Here she talks about what can be done Europe wide to deal with this problem.
What has the European Union and the European Parliament done so far to eliminate violence against women?
First of all I think we haven’t done enough because we still have a lot of gender based violence and violence against women. But we have really started to inform people about violence. We have campaigned and we have a special programme called the Daphne programme to tackle violence. Some of our member states have very good legislation concerning violence towards women. Now is the time to have legislation at an EU level.
If you had to choose only three tools that EU should adopt in the future to help victims, what would they be?
Firstly, support for the victims. You must have legislation so that women in all member states know that it (violence) is a crime. And you must have the possibility to get support from social authorities, from police and from judges.
Secondly, the Spanish EU presidency has proposed a common telephone number - this is good because if you have telephone number in your head and it is the same wherever you are, it could be easier for victims to call for help.
Number three is to have a good data from all countries about violence: how many victims we have and analyse why we have this violence.
Statistics say that every 4th or 5th women in her lifetime suffers physical violence and every 10th suffers sexual violence. You personally also have an experience with violence. What would you say to the victims?
I want to say to all women living today in violent relationship: it is possible to leave this bad relationship and make your own life. I know how it is like. You blame yourself, he has control of everything and you are afraid every moment of the day and night.
Imagine living and every moment of your life being afraid of the person you have a relationship with, you have been in love with, you have children with. He is the most important person in your life but he is your threat. So realize that you cannot accept it, you can leave this relationship and build a new life.
Do you see in few months any EU legislation that could help the victims?
Yes, we have a proposal concerning a European protection order. For example I come from Sweden. When I had experience with violence, I went to the police and they denied the perpetrator the right to be close to my apartment and working place. I even had a panic button that I could use if he came to my apartment. Thanks to this European protection order, if you have a decision from your home country and if you travel to other countries, you can show to local police authorities that you have the right to protection wherever you are in EU.
