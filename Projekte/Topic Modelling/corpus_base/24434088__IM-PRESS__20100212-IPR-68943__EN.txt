12.02.2010: The European Parliament, the European Commission, the Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, the Court of Justice and the Council will all take part in the Italian-based awareness-raising campaign on energy saving 'M'illumino di meno' (I'm using less light) on 12 February.
Staff in the different institutions is being encouraged to participate by turning off all non-essential lighting and electronic equipment between 18.00 and 19.30.
In addition, the Institutions will participate as follows in a symbolic act of support:
As in previous years, the European Parliament will switch off all the outside lights and the maximum possible number of inside lights in the buildings in Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg between 18.00 and 19.30.
The exterior lights of the Berlaymont, the Commission's flagship building in Brussels, will be switched off for 10 minutes between 18.00 and 18.10. In addition, all non-emergency lighting in the entrance halls of the Commission's buildings in Luxembourg will be switched off at the same time.
The European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions will switch off all external lights and all non-essential lights in all of their buildings from 18.00 to 19.30.
The Court of justice will switch off the maximum possible number of both outside and inside lights of its main building in Luxemburg between 18.00 and 19.00.
The 'M'illumino di meno' campaign was launched by the Italian radio programme Caterpillar in 2005 and seeks to reduce private and public energy use. During its annual awareness-raising day, individuals and organisations are asked to make a symbolic gesture of support by switching off lights and all other non-vital electrical devices powered by non-renewable energy sources. This year, the campaign also encourages switching on lights from renewable sources.
