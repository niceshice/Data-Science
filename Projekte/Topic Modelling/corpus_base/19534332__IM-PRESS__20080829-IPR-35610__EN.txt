The President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering, opened this week's session with some comments on the situation of the EP's damaged building in Strasbourg, which had forced the session to be held - exceptionally - in Brussels. He also expressed the Institution's condolences at the deaths during the summer of three sitting or former MEPs as well as the deaths of many passengers in two plane crashes.
Following the partial collapse of the ceiling of the plenary chamber in Strasbourg, Mr Pöttering said it was hoped that investigations and repair work would be completed in time for the EP to hold its next session in Strasbourg.
The president then turned to the deaths of MEPs that had occurred during the summer. He spoke first of Bronisław Geremek (ALDE, PL), whom he described as "a great Polish patriot and a major European", who had been one of the founding fathers of the new Poland. Mr Pöttering then expressed his "great sorrow" at the death of Willi Piecyk (PES, DE), a leading figure in the Transport and Tourism Committee. Lastly, he spoke of former Italian Christian-Democrat MEP Maria Luisa Cassanmagnago Cerretti , who had joined the European Parliament at the same time as Mr Pöttering in 1979 and had been "an inspiration" and a woman of "intellectual courage and compassion".
Turning to this summer's air disasters, Mr Pöttering reiterated the message of solidarity and support to the families and friends of the deceased that he had made the day after the crash in Madrid on 20 August which left 154 people dead. He also expressed sorrow at the crash on 24 August at Kyrgyzstan's capital, Bishkek, which killed 68 of the 90 passengers and crew. "I would like to speak for everyone in this House in expressing our most heartfelt condolences to the victims of these and other tragic events", said Mr Pöttering. The House rose for a minute’s silence in memory of the dead.
