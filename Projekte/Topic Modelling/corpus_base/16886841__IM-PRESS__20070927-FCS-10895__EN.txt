Last Sunday, Ukraine, one of the European Union's most important neighbours, went to the polls and a delegation from the European Parliament was there to confirm that, aside from a few minor problems, the elections were up to international standards.
The three main parties were led by President Viktor Yushchenko, Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych and Yulia Tymoshenko, former prime minister and an ally of the President during the 2004 "Orange Revolution". The President and Prime Minister agreed to hold early parliamentary elections in May after a mounting political crisis.
Recent political developments In 2004 Ukraine underwent the " Orange Revolution", when large-scale popular protests broke out after the presidential elections, which were officially won by Viktor Yanukovych, who was backed by the outgoing president. The result of the unrest was a re-run of the presidential election sweeping Mr Yushchenko to victory in early 2005. Yulia Tymoshenko, his close ally became prime minister. However their alliance soon fell apart and the President sacked the Tymoshenko government in September 2005. In March 2006 Mr Yanukovych´s party won the new parliamentary elections and he eventually took office in August. He has since built a majority in the Parliament. Amid concerns that an increased majority would allow Mr Yanukovych to reject presidential vetoes, make changes to the constitution, and impeach the president, President Yushchenko dissolved parliament on 2 April and called early elections. Initially Parliament rejected his authority do so, but eventually the President and Prime Minister agreed to hold elections on 30 September. EU focus on Ukraine After the EU-Ukraine Summit in September, EU leaders said that Ukraine's move towards strengthening democracy, the rule of law and the respect of human rights will reinforce political and economic links between the two. If elections are free and fair, it’s the best evidence of the country’s ability to accomplish the goal, they said. In a July resolution, the Parliament called for the adoption of political reforms, a fight against corruption and a reform of the civil service. It has closely followed political developments in Ukraine. It was among those denouncing irregularities in the 2004 election and a Parliament delegation was in Independence Square in Kiev, which was at the epicentre of the Orange Revolution. It subsequently sent an observation team to monitor the re-run election. The EP was among the first of President Yushchenko's foreign trips.

Ukrainian elections in line with international standards - EP Delegation
Turnout around 63% Ukraine's elections on Sunday attracted around 63% of the population and were mostly in line with international standards, according to the European Parliament and other parliamentary delegations observing the elections. Exit polls showed that the race was very tight and with no party dominating, the EP delegation stressed the need for cooperation among the different political forces.
On Friday, according to the latest figures from the Central Election Commission of Ukraine, after 99.98% of the ballots have been counted, the results are as follows: Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych's Party of Regions has 34.36%, Yulia Tymoshenko's "Tymoshenko Block" 30.72%, President Viktor Yushchenko's Our Ukraine/Self Defence Block has 14.16% and the Communist Party 5.39%.
Results to trust? The elections are seen as mainly in line with international standards, which could help create a stable environment for building a new government. However, the head of the EP delegation Adrian Severin said: "The results show that the society is dramatically split therefore cooperation between majority and opposition is extremely important to avoid a new crisis." He encouraged a constructive post­-electoral approach and urged the main political parties to recognize the outcome of the elections and to agree to a national political agenda. "E-day" The 14 MEPs were deployed to different regions and visited a number polling stations to check voting conditions. Mr Severin visited the House of Trade Unions where he saw President Yushchenko vote, Kyiv's Music Academy and even a remand prison - prisoners have the right to vote in Ukraine. He met Ukrainian ombudsman Nina Karpachova there who explained the voting system in detention centres. Commenting on polling, Mr Severin said the "atmosphere was relaxed and de-dramatized...good cooperation between different observers and voting committees" However, there were a few problems. Laima Andrikienė, a Lithuanian member of the EPP-ED group, noted that a chair of a voting commission was not aware that the polling station was open, while German Green Milan Horáček reported some language problems in Crimea, where many elderly residents speak Russian, rather than Ukrainian, and had problems understanding the voting instructions. Polish liberal Grażyna Staniszewska expressed concern over the political neutrality of cars driving around encouraging citizens to vote in Donetsk. In addition, some non-governmental monitoring organisations reported that voting lists might not be completely reliable. They said Ukrainian citizens could be missing from official voting lists, while reports from some towns had deceased voters on the lists. President had predicted tight result Mr Severin and the heads of 3 other parliamentary delegations met President Yushchenko ahead of the election. The President predicted a tight result and said that cooperation between the major political forces would be essential. He said it was a good sign that the tone of the campaigns had been constructive. Final results are expected on 15 October.

Adrian Severin: "We want evolution - not revolution in Ukraine"
Romanian Socialist Adrian Severin led the 14-member election observation team from the European Parliament to Ukraine from 27 September to 1 October. The Chairman of the Delegation to the EU-Ukraine Parliamentary Cooperation Committee spoke to us about the main concerns of the election observation mission as well as the way he sees the long-term EU-Ukraine relationship.
What can an EP election observation mission such as yours achieve? As the political controversies in Ukraine are very hot, the solution chosen was to hold early elections. I believe that these early elections per se cannot solve the major political problems of the country. If the elections are not free and fair and if they are not able to produce a Parliament which reflects society in terms of aspirations and political orientations, then this might complicate the already difficult situation. We hope that the presence of international neutral and unbiased observers will ensure the fairness and the freedom of these elections. Ukraine some years ago experienced very problematic elections - that were annulled - and we hope that this will not be repeated this time. How important are these elections for Ukraine and for the EU? These elections could pave the way to a strong and representative government supported by a legitimate Parliament and for internal reforms in the economic and social fields. The new political context could allow the country to adopt the necessary constitutional reforms so as to build up an appropriate system of checks and balances. Ukraine is the most immediate strategic neighbour of the EU, so we cannot be indifferent to the political life in that country. In 2004, what many have called Orange Revolution took place. This is a very nice word, but real revolutions happen quite seldom. We would like to have more evolution than revolution. What will be the main focus of your attention in carrying out the observation mission? One is the list of people allowed to vote. If these lists are not accurate, there are possibilities for fraud as same people might be voting several times in different places. Thus, people voting from home should be allowed to do so only if they have good reason. It’s the same with people who do not vote at their constituency, but are travelling and ask to vote far from their homes. Another possibility to watch for is that some of the ballot papers are annulled, for example by putting a second stamp, very quickly in the confusion that accompanies the opening of the ballot boxes, when people are trying to put the ballot papers in order. We have to be sure that the process is done in an appropriate way. There are also quite sensitive moments, when the results of the count are transmitted from an electoral bureau to the central election committee. During this process, it is possible that papers are lost, that figures are changed. Moreover, because some less objective observers may be present, in addition to neutral observers, we must be sure that they do not disturb, influence or pressure voters. What will be the key factors determining the EU-Ukraine relationship in the future? I would start with an objective factor: the strategic position of Ukraine but also its resources, which are extremely important, and recommend a strong relationship between the EU and Ukraine. And if the desire, very often heard, of the Ukrainians to one day be full members of the EU is true, then certainly we have to take it seriously and see what should be done in order to reach that target in the most profitable way for all sides. This depends on whether this potentially attractive integration of Ukraine into the EU is supported by efforts to modernise the country and develop democracy and a market economy, at a political level but also at a societal level. I am optimistic, but on the other hand I think that the road will be long, we should not let ourselves be led by wishful thinking. More about Adrian Severin
