Briefing - 11-14 December 2006 - Strasbourg
2006-12-07 - 09:32
The last Strasbourg plenary of the year will be one the busiest for MEPs. Parliament will vote in second-reading on a compromise between MEPs and the Council on REACH . Parliament will also vote on the approval of Romanian and Bulgarian Commissioners-designate before the two countries join the EU on 1 January 2007. Belarus opposition leader Alexander Milinkevich will be awarded the 2006 Sakharov Prize for "Freedom of Thought" by the outgoing European Parliament President Josep BORRELL . Parliament will also debate and vote on the €115.5 billion EU budget for 2007 in a final second-reading . The House will debate the forthcoming European Council (14 and 15 December in Brussels under the Finnish Presidency) which will focus on further enlargement and justice and home affairs. MEPs will also focus on new rules on TV commercials and product placement under the revision of the Television Without Frontiers Directive and standard EU-wide format for driving licences.
Monday 11 December
The session starts off with one of the largest pieces of legislation ever to face the European Parliament - REACH. Delegations from the European Parliament and the Council have hammered out a deal on REACH , the draft regulation on chemical products, at their sixth set of informal negotiations. REACH proposes replacing the current 40 legislative texts with a single regulation establishing a single system called REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of CHemicals). The compromise will be put to the vote by the full Parliament at the plenary session – if approved, following the compromise, REACH is due to enter into force progressively from 1 June 2007. The vote is scheduled for Wednesday 13 December.
Also on Monday evening, the House will debate a report on continuing to link compensatory aid for banana growers to banana production. It will also urge keeping current rules on producers' organizations, as well as the current system of advance payments. The committee nonetheless wishes the Commission to review the policy in 2009, especially if third-country import tariffs change in the meantime.
Tuesday 12 December
Tuesday starts off with a joint debate on the financing of development co-operation . After two years of negotiations with the Council, Parliament's Development Committee is recommending approving an agreement on the financing instrument for development co-operation for 2007-2013, which reflects Parliament's main demands on the structure and priorities of Community aid. Another key point for MEPs is that Parliament preserved its co-decision powers, which the Commission had sought to bring into question.
This debate is followed by a conciliation agreement discussion on improving the cleanliness standards of groundwater . During the conciliation talks, Parliament's negotiating team successfully pushed for stricter measures by Member States to prevent inputs into groundwater of hazardous substances. As MEPs had wanted, the scope of the directive was broadened so that its aim will now be to protect groundwater "against pollution and deterioration" and not only "against pollution" as Council had proposed in its common position.
Parliament will vote (by simple majority) on the approval of the Romanian (Leonard ORBAN - mulitlingualism) and Bulgarian ( Meglena KUNEVA Bulgaria, consumer protection) Commissioners-designate on the basis of a motion for a resolution to be tabled by the political groups.
At midday on Tuesday, President Borrell will award the 2006 Sakharov Prize to Belarus Opposition leader Alexander Milinkevich. Milinkevich stood in presidential elections last March, the results of which were condemned by the EU and the US. At an opposition rally protesting the results, Milinkevich was arrested and held for 15 days. The prize comes with a certificate and a cheque for €50 000.
Tuesday afternoon starts with the House debating a proposed overhaul of the advertising rules for TV channels in Europe , including a new approach to product placement. However, the committee is also suggesting a number of substantial amendments to the draft directive revising the Television without Frontiers (TWF) directive. The new legislation aims to update the 1997 TWF directive, now to be dubbed the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, to bring it into line with new developments in audiovisual technology and advertising.
Later on Tuesday afternoon, MEP debate the EU budget for 2007 totalling €115.5 billion in payment appropriations, the vote will take place on Thursday.
On Tuesday evening, the European Parliament debates an agreement between the Employment Committee and Council on the Commission's proposal to establish a European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), the Fund which will provide up to €500 million each year to help reintegrate into the labour market workers made redundant due to changes in global trade patterns, will be able to become operational as of 1 January 2007, if the plenary follows the recommendations of the Employment Committee.
Wednesday 13 December
Wednesday starts off with a joint debate on the enlargement process . Elmar BROK (EPP-ED, DE) for the Foreign Affairs Committee will be putting forward a report concerning EU enlargement notably to Turkey, Croatia and the Western Balkan countries. In a separate report, the Constitutional Affairs Committee says the European Union needs to develop its institutional, financial and policy structure before any further enlargement can take place. This comes in a report on the institutional reforms required to improve the EU's capacity to integrate new Member States.
The key debate of the week is on the preparation for the forthcoming European Council to be held in Brussels on 14 and 15 December under the Finnish Presidency. Enlargement and Justice and Home Affairs are the main topics on the table for EU Heads of State and government.
On Wednesday evening, MEPs turn their attention to a legislative report at second-reading on the introduction of a standard EU-wide format for driving licences comes before the House . As from 2013, all newly issued or replacement driving licences will be in a single EU-wide credit card format, which will replace the over 110 different models currently existing in the Member States.
Thursday 14 December
On Thursday, Eluned MORGAN (PES, UK) for the Industry and Energy Committee will be tabling a report which says there should be binding targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions and on increasing the use of renewable energy sources . These views are set out in a wide ranging report on the Commission's energy strategy proposals. Parliament will also debate the establishment of an Instrument for Nuclear Safety and Security Assistance for third countries.
As is customary, the session ends on Thursday afternoon with debates and votes on three human rights issues around the world. The topics are: the situation in Fiji, the implication of UN forces in sexual abuse in Liberia and Haiti and the freeing of medical personnel held in Libya.

REACH: wide-ranging deal between MEPs and Council on chemicals legislation to be voted
2006-12-07 - 09:32
After three years of discussion with the Commission and Member States, the European Parliament is about to put the finishing touches to REACH, one of the biggest pieces of legislation in its history. MEPs will vote on this draft regulation on the registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals on Wednesday 13 December with the debate on Monday 11 December. On 30 November, delegations from the European Parliament and the Council hammered out a deal on REACH , the draft regulation on chemical products, at their sixth set of informal negotiations. The compromise will be put to the vote by the full Parliament on Wednesday 13 December.
REACH is one of the most complex issues the Parliament has ever been asked to consider. Following the compromise, REACH is due to enter into force progressively from 1 June 2007.
Parliament fought with the Council up to the last minute on key points such as mandatory substitution of the most hazardous substances where alternatives exist, recognition of a duty of care by manufacturers and the promotion of alternatives to animal testing. The REACH project, which seeks to improve protection of human health and the environment while making Europe's chemicals industry more competitive, is the fruit of many years of negotiations between the European Parliament, the Member States represented by the Council, and the European Commission. It has also been the focus of intense lobbying on behalf of the industry's economic and commercial interests on the one hand, and NGOs battling for consumers and the environment on the other. The main point of disagreement was the authorisation of the most hazardous substances.
What is REACH?
On 29 October 2003 the Commission unveiled its plans to overhaul Community policy on chemicals. It proposed replacing the current 40 legislative texts with a single regulation establishing a single system called REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of CHemicals).
REACH is intended to replace the current dual system which differentiates between:
- "new" chemicals, i.e. the roughly 3,000 substances placed on the market after 1981, the year since which formal authorisation has been required by Community legislation,
- "existing" substances, placed on the market before 1981 and numbering around 100,000.
According to the Commission, information on the safety of 99% of the substances placed on the market before 1981 is inadequate. The regulation it proposed would therefore have required safety assessments of products manufactured or imported in quantities of over one tonne per year, i.e. around 30,000 substances.
Another key point of the draft regulation was that the burden of proof regarding testing and evaluation of the risks of chemicals would be transferred from the authorities to industry.
The issues at second reading
The Council's common position was officially forwarded to Parliament on 7 September 2006. Under the co-decision procedure, Parliament has a maximum of 3 months + 1 month to amend the text at second reading. Given the calendar, this means the mid-December plenary is the last opportunity to make amendments.
The EP Environment Committee, voting on 10 October, adopted a very firm position by 42 votes to 12 with six abstentions. Essentially following the recommendations of its rapporteur Guido Sacconi, it made no less than 172 amendments to the Council text, seeking to reinstate several points from first reading which had not been accepted by the Member States. Apart from the substitution of the most hazardous substances, the amendments related to the operators' "duty of care", a compulsory chemical safety report for chemicals in amounts of less than 10 tonnes and the promotion of alternatives to animal testing.
A series of trialogues - EP, Council and Commission - was then held to narrow the gap between the different institutions and, if possible, clinch an agreement on REACH at second reading so that it can be implemented swiftly. The talks concluded successfully on 30 November after the sixth trialogue, less than a week before the deadline (6 December at 6pm) for tabling amendments for the plenary vote.
If the amendments adopted on 13 December reflect the compromise thrashed out with representatives of the Member States, the REACH regulation, once rubber-stamped by the Council, will enter into force in spring 2007. It should be noted that, at second reading, an absolute majority of Members of the European Parliament (367 votes) is needed to amend the Council's position. Without such a majority, the Council text will be deemed to have been approved.
The main features of the compromise struck between Parliament and the Council on 30 November:
- Authorisation of hazardous substances
For the most dangerous substances, there will be an obligation for producers to submit a substitution plan to replace them with safer alternatives. Where no alternative exists, producers will have to present a research and development plan aimed at finding one. Under a review clause, it will be decided after six years, on the basis of the latest scientific data, whether endocrine disruptors should be included in a list of substances which can only be authorised in the light of an analysis of their socio-economic costs and benefits . A clause was agreed to review after six years, on the basis of the latest scientific data, the inclusion of these substances among those which can only be authorised in the light of an analysis of the socio-economic costs and benefits.
- Registration of substances
The Commission must decide in 12 years' time whether or not to recommend extending the requirement for chemical safety reports for substances produced or imported in amounts of less than 10 tonnes per year. This deadline was shortened to seven years for cancerous or mutagenic substances or those toxic to reproduction. The intellectual property provisions were strengthened, with data protection extended from three to six years.
- Duty of care
As MEPs wanted, the "duty of care" principle will be enshrined in the regulation. It will be in a recital stipulating that the manufacturing, import or placing on the market of substances must be done prudently and responsibly, to ensure that, under reasonably foreseeable circumstances, human health or the environment are not adversely affected. This will involve collecting all necessary information on the substances in question and relaying all recommendations about risk management along the distribution chain.
- Animal welfare
The promotion of alternatives to the animal testing of chemicals, an issue of prime concern to MEPs, is now included among the goals of REACH. To avoid duplication of animal testing, interested parties will have 45 days to state their views before each new plan for animal tests. Information on toxicity to human beings should if possible be discovered using means other than tests on vertebrate animals, through alternative methods such as in vivo procedures. These alternative methods must be validated by the Commission, once recognised by the agency, or international institutions. The Commission will submit a report every three years on the use of alternative tests and, if necessary, bring forward fresh legislative proposals .
- Evaluation of substances
Parliament will appoint two members of the Helsinki-based European Chemicals Agency and the Executive Director will have to undergo a hearing with MEPs before his/her appointment is confirmed. However, Parliament's demands for guarantees of the independence of the agency's members vis-à-vis industry and the publication of declarations of interest were not accepted.
- Communication of information
A clause was added on the duty to inform the public about dangerous substances contained in products. The distribution chain, including consumers who request it, must be informed of the presence of any chemical in an amount greater than 0.1% of the total product weight. The Commission must consider the possibility of establishing a European quality mark for chemical products.
- Comitology
The Council accepted a number of amendments bringing REACH into line with the new comitology provisions, which give the EP a right of scrutiny over certain Commission decisions.
Entry into force
Following the compromise, REACH is due to enter into force progressively from 1 June 2007. Rapporteur Guido SACCONI PES IT A6-0352/2006 European Chemicals Agency A6-0345/2006 Amendment of Directive 67/548/EEC on dangerous substances (REACH) Procedure : Codecision (2nd reading)

Cleaner groundwater on the way
2006-12-07 - 09:32
Parliament's plenary will be asked to approve an agreement reached in conciliation with the Council in October on legislation to improve the cleanliness standards of groundwater. During the conciliation talks, Parliament's negotiating team successfully pushed for stricter measures by Member States to prevent inputs into groundwater of hazardous substances. As MEPs had wanted, the scope of the directive was broadened so that its aim will now be to protect groundwater "against pollution and deterioration" and not only "against pollution" as Council had proposed in its common position. This point was important to Parliament, as groundwater is the most sensitive and, in many regions, the largest source of public drinking water.
In another key point of the agreement, Parliament successfully demanded that Member States be required to take "all measures necessary to prevent inputs into groundwater of any hazardous substances" and not merely "all measures necessary to aim to prevent" this type of pollution, as the Council wanted. These "hazardous substances" include cyanide, arsenic, biocides and phytopharmaceutical substances, which are listed in an annex to the framework directive on water adopted on 23 October 2000. Any change to the list of hazardous substances will henceforth have to be decided under codecision, as laid down in the new decision on comitology.
To ensure consistency with other Community directives which deal with water, pollution by nitrates used in farming will not be covered by the groundwater directive. The limit value of 50mg/l for nitrate pollution, as laid down in the 1991 directive on nitrates, will therefore continue to apply. However, since protecting groundwater, especially against pesticides, will require changes in some farming practices which could entail a loss of income, MEPs successfully pushed for the CAP regulation on rural development to provide special aid in such cases.
With the exception of pesticides, the text approved by the Parliament delegation does not impose single standards at EU level but seeks to harmonise methods for measuring potential pollutants. The regulation will not prevent Member States keeping or introducing stricter protection measures, especially in safeguard zones, which could be extended to the entire territory of a Member State.
The conciliation agreement reached with the Council was approved by Parliament's delegation by an overwhelming majority (16 votes for, none against and 4 abstentions) and can therefore be expected to sail through the plenary.
Environment Committee rapporteur Christa Klass (EPP-ED, DE), who piloted the legislation through Parliament, said "Groundwater is our most important natural resource but over half the bodies of freshwater in the EU are polluted and can never be cleaned up again. This is why we must protect them better".
The rules will have to be reviewed six years after the directive enters into force (i.e. in 2013 if the legislative procedure is completed in 2007) then again every six years. Member States will have two years to transpose the directive into national law. It should therefore take effect from early 2009.

Cutting car emissions: Euro 5 standards
2006-12-07 - 09:32
The Environment Committee is in favour of revising the current emission limits for motor vehicles (the Euro 4 standards, which have applied since 1 January 2005), including ozone precursors such as nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons as well as particles emitted by diesel engines. The new standards (known as Euro 5) will apply from 1 September 2009. The new legislation also requires information on vehicle repairs to be easily available to independent repairers. Members of the committee, adopted by a large majority, a report by Matthias GROOTE (PES, DE) which amends the draft regulation put forward by the Commission under the Clean air for Europe programme (CAFE). They called for the new Euro 5 standard to apply from 1 September 2009 for private cars (M1). Vehicles with a maximum laden weight of more than 2,500 kg and designed to meet specific social needs - to take wheelchairs or to seat seven or more people - and light commercial vehicles (N1) will have until 1 September 2010 to comply. - The transition period for "vehicles designed for specific social needs" (ambulances, transport for disabled persons etc.) is until 2012.
Following transition periods extending up to 1 January 2011 (M1) and 1 January 2012 (N1) respectively, national authorities must refuse to grant EC or national type approval to new vehicles which do not comply with the rules on emissions or fuel consumption. MEPs regarded the 18-month implementation deadline suggested by the Commission - which wanted to introduce Euro 5 standards in mid-2008 - as too early.
Euro 6 standards on the way?
In addition, MEPs in the committee are already urging that starting dates be set for the next stage, i.e. Euro 6 standards, something not envisaged in the Commission text. They suggest 1 September 2014 for private cars (M1) and 1 September 2015 for light commercial vehicles (N1). Transition periods would run up to 1 September 2015 and 1 September 2016 respectively; after which date national authorities would refuse to grant type approval and would ban the sale of such vehicles.
Access to vehicle repair information
A contentious point of the regulation is access to information on car repairs. MEPs agreed a compromise stating that manufacturers must give independent operators access to information equivalent to that available to their authorised dealers and repair shops by means of databases. And to promote competition, MEPs say manufacturers should make training manuals available to independent repairers.

MEPs debate upcoming EU summit: enlargement, justice and home affairs the key topics
2006-12-07 - 09:32
The centrepiece of this Strasbourg session will be a debate on Wednesday 13 December on the forthcoming European Council meeting being held on 14 and 15 December in Brussels under Finland's EU Presidency. Just before the summit, which will be chaired by Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen, Parliament's President Josep Borrell will address the assembled Heads of State or Government. The main topic at the summit will be EU enlargement. The EU leaders will base their discussions on the enlargement strategy, approved by the European Commission on 8 November, and the special report annexed to it on the Union's capacity to integrate new members. The objective will be to consolidate the consensus among the Member States on how to proceed with the enlargement process.
The European Council will also focus on justice and home affairs as the second main theme. The EU leaders will discuss ways of improving EU decision-making and action in the area of freedom, security and justice. The goal will be to enhance the Member States' commitment to more effective decision-making on justice and home affairs.
The EU's immigration policy is also on the agenda for the summit. The aim here is to strengthen the overall approach to immigration and agree on concrete measures to be taken in 2007.
The Finnish Presidency will present its assessment of the discussions it held this autumn with the Member States on the future of the Constitutional Treaty.
The European Council will take stock of the accession negotiations with Turkey and Croatia, on the basis of the outcome of the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 11 December. Other items on the agenda include policies on innovation and energy, climate change and key external relations issues.
In addition, the EU leaders will welcome Romania and Bulgaria as new members of the EU with effect from 1 January 2007. Their accession will conclude the Union's fifth round of enlargement. Council and Commission statements on preparation for the European Council (14-15 December 2006)

Belarus Opposition leader Alexander Milinkevich to be awarded 2006 Sakharov Prize
2006-12-07 - 09:32
At midday on Tuesday 12 December, European Parliament President Joseph Borrell will award the 2006 Sakharov Prize to Alexander Milinkevich. In October, the Conference of Presidents - the political groups' leaders of the European Parliament - decided to award the prize for freedom of thought to the leader of the opposition in Belarus. Milinkevich stood in presidential elections last March, the results of which were condemned by the EU and the US. At an opposition rally protesting the results, Milinkevich was arrested and held for 15 days. In February, the Belarus opposition leader visited the European Parliament and asked MEPs for their support, but a delegation of MEPs wishing to monitor the elections were refused entry by the Belarus authorities. Milinkevich is 59 years old and studied physics and mathematics in France, Germany and the US. He was deputy mayor of his home town Hrodna in the early nineties.
The prize comes with a certificate and a cheque for €50,000.
What is the Sakharov Prize
Every year, the European Parliament awards the Sakharov Prize for "Freedom of Thought" to exceptional individuals or organisations fighting against oppression, intolerance and injustice. Nelson Mandela, Kofi Annan and the UN are among former winners. The award is a visible means for Parliament to honour and support those who have put themselves at risk in the cause of liberty.
The prize is named after Andrei Sakharov (1921-1989), one of the leading scientists who developed the hydrogen bomb for the Soviet Union, and who later became an outspoken critic of the nuclear arms race. In 1970 he founded a committee on human rights. His activities did not go unnoticed, in the Soviet Union he was jailed, while in the West he received the Nobel Peace prize in 1975.
The award founded in 1988 that bears his name is to recognise achievement in the following fields:
- defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms, particularly the right to free expression
- safeguarding the right of minorities
- respect for international law
- development of democracy and implementation on the rule of law
The prize is awarded to persons, associations or organisations irrespective of their nationality, place of residence or seat.
Why does the European Parliament support the prize?
The promotion and protection of human rights, democracy and the rule of law is one of the most fundamental of the European Parliament's roles. It has a number of "tools" to help this aim, they include:
A Subcommittee on human rights to monitor the situation internationally. There is also a yearly report on the human rights situation in countries both inside and outside the European Union. The reports list breaches of human rights and make practical suggestions for improving matters.
During Parliament's monthly plenary sessions, Thursday afternoon is reserved for debates on human rights.
Who selects the winner?
Every year Political Groups in the Parliament and MEPs nominate potential candidates. From this list, the Committees on Foreign Affairs and Development jointly select three "finalists". The chairpersons of the political groups (the "Conference of Presidents") then select a winner. The prize is formally awarded by the President of the Parliament during the December Plenary session, on or around 10 December, which is also the day on which the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights was signed in 1948.
The winner receives a certificate and a cheque for €50,000. One of last year's winners, Hauwa Ibrahim, used the prize money to fund children's education in her native Nigeria. Award of Sakharov Prize 2006

Funding to support democracy and human rights
2006-12-07 - 09:32
Following the debate held on 29 November in Brussels on a report drawn up by Hélène FLAUTRE (Greens/EFA, FR) and Edward McMILLAN-SCOTT (EPP-ED, UK), and compromise amendments which have emerged from negotiations with the Council on the legislative proposal aimed at updating the EU's financial mechanism for supporting human rights and democracy around the world, Parliament will vote on a report during the December session in Strasbourg. After a year of pressure from the European Parliament, in July the Commission finally presented a proposal for a financial instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights. MEPs want to adjust its aims and scope. They are also proposing changes to make it faster and more efficient in responding to urgent developments. This is the only instrument which allows funds to be allocated direct to civil society organisations without the agreement of the government of the third country concerned.
According to the EU Treaty, developing and strengthening democracy and the rule of law, as well as respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, are among the goals of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. The co-rapporteurs believed it was essential for the EU to have an effective instrument to further these goals, one which would be both strategic and flexible and which would complement other funding mechanisms, such as the Stability Instrument and the geographic funding programmes.
In order to work effectively, the new mechanism need to be more flexible than that which it is replacing. It needs in particular to avoid excessively bureaucratic procedures which placed severe constraints on the capacity to reach to difficult situations.
The two co-rapporteurs have therefore tried to refocus the objectives and scope of the instrument so it is centred on support for non-state players promoting democracy and human rights. They have insisted on new measures to allow the EU to respond quickly and effectively to emergency situations which often face human rights defenders. They therefore introduced ad-hoc measure to allow funding to protect and support human rights defenders in urgent cases with going through a tendering process.
In parallel, changes to the Financial Regulation, aimed at allowing funding of unregistered organisations, should allow more flexibility in the operation of the mechanism better to support independent players active in defending freedom in third countries. This should overcome some of the weaknesses in the existing system for which the Commission has been criticised in the past.
The promotion of political pluralism and parliamentary democracy, and support for parliamentary projects in favour of democracy and human rights, were also added to the mechanism by MEPs in the committee.
Parliament's role in the setting of strategic priorities and in the operation of the instrument was one of the main issues subject to negotiations between the EP, Council and Commission. The co-rapporteurs succeeded in getting agreement on the setting up of a dialogue on these issues, though the Council has refused to make a formal commitment to take part. It is proposed that Parliament should receive an annual report, evaluation reports and the minutes of the Human Rights and Democracy Committee. It is also proposed that there should be a Commission/Parliament working group.
If the compromise texts are approved, the legislation can be adopted at this first reading stage, and the instrument will enter into force by the end of the year, thereby preventing a break in EU funding for human rights and democracy, notably the inclusion of electoral observation missions.

Council annual report on human rights
2006-12-07 - 09:32
MEPs will debate with the Council and the Commission the former's eighth annual report on human rights, covering the period 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006. The report highlights human rights issues, both inside and outside the European Union, and describes what the EU has done to address them. This year's report ranges across thematic issues such as the death penalty, torture and the rights of women, minorities and indigenous peoples, while also looking at the situation in particular countries and regions of the world. It reviews EU actions in international fora and the use of EU instruments and policies to influence governments accused of not respecting human rights. This year the report includes a section on the European Parliament's activities to promote human rights and democracy. The Council's report is one element which will feed into Parliament's own annual report on human rights in the world. Debate: 12 December

Parliament to vote on approving Romanian and Bulgarian Commissioners-designate
2006-12-07 - 09:32
On Tuesday 12 December, MEPs will vote on the approval of the Romanian and Bulgarian Commissioners-designate on the basis of a motion for a resolution to be tabled by the political groups. Group leaders will make brief statements before the vote. On 28 November, the Conference of Presidents gave a positive assessment of the hearings of the Commissioners-designate, while asking for clarification of Leonard ORBAN 's (Romania) portfolio. Parliament's political group leaders held an exchange of views on the conclusions of the hearings.
The Conference was informed by the relevant committees that:
Meglena KUNEVA (Bulgaria) fully meets the personal requirements of integrity, independence and competence. She has the requisite professional experience. During her hearing, she demonstrated a strong commitment to consumer protection on behalf of EU citizens, a high level of competence on technical issues and a political conviction to implement and communicate the benefits of EU consumer policy.
Mr Orban showed highly developed political skills, as well as great ability, capacity and ambition to learn and acquire expert knowledge into his portfolio. He seems particularly qualified to handle such a difficult portfolio with true professionalism.
However on the portfolio itself, the mandate of the Commissioner-designate remains unclear. Concerns have been raised about the relative vagueness of the portfolio and explanations given by President BARROSO did not clarify sufficiently the division of labour between Mr Figel, Mr Orban and the President himself. Vote : 12.12.2006 Summary of hearing of Meglena Kuneva, Commissioner-designate for Consumer Protection (Bulgaria) Summary of hearing of Leonard Orban, Commissioner-designate for Multilingualism More information on the Hearings held for the two Commissioners-designate

Enlargement: Turkey, Croatia and the Western Balkans
2006-12-07 - 09:32
Elmar BROK (EPP-ED, DE) for the Foreign Affairs Committee will be putting forward a report concerning EU enlargement notably to Turkey, Croatia and the Western Balkan countries. Future enlargements of the European Union should take more account of the performance of candidate countries than they did in the past and will, in any event, require changes in the EU Treaty, the Foreign Affairs Committee said. A date for final accession should not be given too soon and accession negotiations should follow a timetable based on "effective compliance" with the political criteria. Compliance with these criteria should be given greater priority in accession negotiations.
MEPs in the committee urge the EU governments to "conclude the constitutional process by the end of 2008", pointing out that "the Treaty of Nice does not provide an adequate basis for future enlargements". They want the necessary treaty reforms to be ready before the next European elections "so as to avoid a delay in current accession negotiations", notably in those with Croatia.
Turkey
With regard to Turkey, the Foreign Affairs Committee noted the European Commission report which says that the pace of reform has slowed and stressed that Turkey ratify and fully implement the so-called Ankara Protocol, which extends the EC-Turkey association agreement to all new Member States, including Cyprus. The EU governments stated in September 2005 that implementation of the protocol would be evaluated in 2006 and that failure to implement it would "affect the overall progress in the negotiations". MEPs in the committee hope that the Finnish Presidency would find a solution to "the current stalemate" and called on Turkey "to work together in a constructive way to ensure full implementation (...) by the end of the year".
Croatia
Croatia 's continued progress "towards EU integration" was welcomed by the MEPs in the committee, who called on "the negotiators on both sides to maintain the momentum reached in these negotiations with a view to their early conclusion".
Western Balkans
The "clear European membership prospects" offered to the Western Balkan countries, needs to be maintained, the Foreign Affairs Committee said, in order to consolidate peace and prosperity in the region, but MEPs reminded these countries that it is the pace of reform that will determine the pace of their integration in the EU.
Integration capacity
The integration capacity of the EU was a subject of more general concern to MEPs in the committee and the Constitutional Affairs Committee is drawing up a report on this. The Foreign Affairs Committee MEPs in the committee regret that the Commission had failed to provide a "sufficiently in-depth analysis" of the issues to be resolved before any further enlargements and termed the relevant part in the Commission enlargement report "an unsatisfactory answer to Parliament's request".

Constitutional Affairs Committee says EU must reform before enlarging further
2006-12-07 - 09:32
The Constitutional Affairs Committee says the European Union needs to develop its institutional, financial and policy structure before any further enlargement can take place. This comes in a report on the institutional reforms required to improve the EU's capacity to integrate new Member States. The report by Alexander STUBB (EPP-ED, FI) acknowledges that the Union is currently confronted with "difficulties to honour its commitments towards South-East European countries" and calls for a series of institutional changes to improve its "integration capacity".
The notion of "integration capacity" implies that, after any new accession, the EU institutions are able to function properly and democratically, to adequately finance their activities and to attain their political objectives. Therefore, MEPs in the committee say that the Union should decide on which reforms are needed to proceed with a new enlargement by taking into consideration the impact of the new Member State on its institutional and decision-making structure. The Nice Treaty, says the report, does not provide "an adequate basis for further enlargements."
MEPs in the committee stress that the "integration capacity" should not be seen as a new criterion for candidate countries, since it is up to the EU to improve its ability to accept new countries and deepen its integration process. MEPs also say that all past enlargements have "tended to strengthen the Union, foster its economic growth, reinforce its role in the world and stimulate the development of new EU policies."
As far as the reforms are concerned, MEPs' proposals include: the adoption of a new qualified majority voting system at the Council to simplify decision making; a clear definition of the EU's values, objectives and competences; more transparency in Council's operations; increased powers of scrutiny for national parliaments and the adoption of a clause setting out how Member States could leave the EU. MEPs in the committee also propose an amendment calling for reinforcement of the European Neighbourhood Policy to provide a framework for relations with those countries with no prospect of accession.
MEPs in the committee reiterate their conviction that a constitutional settlement must be achieved before the next European Parliamentary elections in 2009. They reaffirm that the Constitutional Treaty would enhance the Union's integration capacity if ratified.

New rules on TV commercials and product placement
2006-12-07 - 09:32
The Culture Committee will recommend that Parliament back a proposed overhaul of the advertising rules for TV channels in Europe, including a new approach to product placement. However, the committee is also suggesting a number of substantial amendments to the draft directive revising the Television without Frontiers (TWF) directive. The new legislation aims to update the 1997 TWF directive, now to be dubbed the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, to bring it into line with new developments in audiovisual technology and advertising. The Commission's proposal is intended to create a level playing field for public and private broadcasters and independent producers. It also aims to widen the scope of the rules to include new media.
Strict limits on product placement
The Culture Committee's first reading report, drafted by Ruth HIERONYMI (EPP-ED, DE), was adopted by 26 votes to 1 with no abstentions.
In one of the most controversial areas of the directive, a majority of MEPs in the committee backed a compromise amendment brokered by Ms Hieronymi which would see product placement prohibited except in a limited range of programmes, and then only under strict rules.
Product placement would be banned in "news and current affairs programmes, programmes for children, documentaries [and] advisory programmes." Member States could still permit it "in cinematographic works, films and series made for television and sports broadcasts", as well as in "cases of production aid where there is no payment but only provision of certain goods or services for free with a view to their inclusion in a programme."
Even where they are allowed, however, programmes that feature product placement should, say MEPs, never affect "the responsibility and editorial independence" of the broadcaster; nor should they "directly encourage the purchase or rental of goods or services" or give "undue prominence to the product in question". Lastly, viewers should be clearly notified of the existence of product placement in such programmes. MEPs agreed with the Commission that product placement for tobacco products or cigarettes (or producers whose principal activity is the manufacture or sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products) should be completely banned.
New rules on advertising
The committee voted to limit advertising breaks in "films made for television, cinematographic works, concerts, theatre plays and operas" to "once for each period of 45 minutes" - and not, as the Commission had proposed, every 35 minutes. Children's programming and news programmes, MEPs decided, should be interrupted for advertising only once for each period of 30 minutes -- provided that such programmes exceed 30 minutes to begin with.
Television advertising and teleshopping will have be "readily recognisable and distinguishable from editorial content". Television advertising and teleshopping will also have to be kept "quite distinct from other parts of the programme service by optical and/or acoustic and/or spatial means". And the proportion of short forms of advertising such as advertising spots and teleshopping spots within a given clock hour must not exceed 20%.
Ethical and fairness issues
Under the Commission's proposal, Member States would have to ensure that commercials aired by providers under their jurisdiction do not include or incite prejudice or discrimination. The Culture Committee proposes additional conditions, saying commercials should not offend on the basis of gender, disability, age or sexual orientation, nor "violate human dignity."
Member States will have to ensure that programmes broadcast by media service providers under their jurisdiction do not contain "anything which might seriously impair the physical, psychological and moral development of minors, particularly programmes showing pornography or senseless violence".
Member States must ensure that audio-visual media services are gradually made accessible to people with a visual or hearing disability, and must submit a bi-annual report to the Commission on the progress they have made.
Member States must also establish a right of reply or equivalent remedies for "any natural or legal person, regardless of nationality, whose legitimate interests, in particular but not limited to reputation and good name, have been affected by an assertion of facts in a transmission".
Definitions and next steps
The Culture Committee did not wholly endorse the Commission's suggested definition of audiovisual media services, opting instead to modify the concepts of "linear services" and "on demand services" in the draft legislation. The former refers to traditional television broadcasting "transmitted... according to a fixed programming schedule", while the latter comprises services such as web TV or video-on-demand -- where the user requests the transmission of a given programme "on an individual basis".
Member States will have two years to transpose the new directive into national law. Rapporteur Ruth HIERONYMI EPP-ED DE A6-0399/2006 Television broadcasting services: simplify the regulatory framework for broadcasting or linear services, introduce minimum rules for non-linear audiovisual media services (amend. direct. 89/552/EEC, règl. 2006/2004/EC) Procedure : Codecision (1st reading)

Newly issued driving licences in credit-card format from 2013
2006-12-07 - 09:32
A report by the Transport Committee on the introduction of a standard EU-wide format for driving licences comes before the House for second reading. As from 2013, all newly issued or replacement driving licences will be in a single EU-wide credit card format, which will replace the over 110 different models currently existing in the Member States. Member States will be able to incorporate a storage medium or microchip into the driving licences. Limited validity will mean the data and photos they contain are updated and new security features can be added periodically.
Ten year administrative validity
The new licenses will have a limited administrative validity of ten years, which Member States are free to increase to up to fifteen years. For trucks and buses the license is valid for five years. Member States can choose whether to introduce regular medical exams for drivers. The new directive will harmonise the existing classes of vehicles. For motorcycles a "step-up approach" will become obligatory in all Member States.
A large majority in the Transport Committee backed the recommendation drafted by Mathieu GROSCH (EPP-ED, BE) which is the fruit of a consensus reached in talks with the Council and is seen as a fair compromise between the differing traditions around the EU.
The new directive also seeks to combat "driving licence tourism": it says Member States must refuse to issue a driving licence to an applicant whose permit has been restricted, suspended or withdrawn in another Member State.
Turning to trailers/caravans, the European Commission had originally proposed that a B+E driving licence should be required for all trailers over 750kg. During the negotiations, Parliament successfully argued that category B licence holders should be allowed to drive combinations of vehicle plus trailer which do not exceed 4250 kg.
MEPs also successfully fought for the principle of "progressive access" for riding motorcycles. This means that riders must accumulate experience on smaller motorcycles before moving up to larger engines. To improve safety for the youngest riders, a theory test for moped drivers will become compulsory.
There will also be EU-wide harmonisation of the rules for training and retraining of driving examiners, setting out basic qualifications, quality assurance and regular retraining programmes.
Finally, Member States will have to ensure that the new format replaces every licence in circulation within 26 years of its introduction in 2013, i.e. by 2039. Mr Grosch said "I regret the length of this period, but I am confident that the changeover will in practice take place sooner".

Closing a loophole on oil tankers
2006-12-07 - 09:32
In a report drafted by Fernand LE RACHINEL (NI, FR), the Transport Committee is backing a Commission proposal that Regulation 417/2002 on the accelerated phasing-in of double-hull tankers be amended. This regulation currently allows single-hull tankers to be used even if they are flying the flag of an EU Member State provided they are operating outside EU ports. The Commission proposes that this loophole be closed by adding the following clause: “No oil tanker carrying grade oil products, shall be allowed to fly the flag of a Member State unless such a tanker is a double-hull oil tanker.” Parliament is expected to approve this amendment overwhelmingly.

Parliament votes on second reading of 2007 budget
2006-12-07 - 09:32
Parliament will debate in plenary on Tuesday 12 December and vote on Thursday 14 December on the Budgets Committee's second-reading proposal of a draft EU budget for 2007 totalling €115.5 billion in payment appropriations. Aside from the figures, MEPs have won two victories: a firm commitment by the Council to provide Parliament with adequate and regular information on the CFSP and an agreement on the Financial Regulation. The Budgets Committee is recommending that the idea of placing part of the Commission's administrative budget in reserve be dropped.
The figure of €115.5 billion being recommended by the committee is equivalent to 0.9877% of gross national income of the EU27 and represents an increase of around €3.6 billion over the 2006 budget.
In the run-up to the committee's second-reading vote, MEPs agreed not to put part of the Commission's administrative expenditure in the reserve. The Commission undertook in a letter to take account of Parliament's concerns in connection with the "screening" exercise, or assessment, to be conducted by the Commission, the results of which are expected by 30 April 2007. The Commission will also respond to the proposals contained in the annual policy strategy to be adopted by Parliament in February 2007.
Breakdown of payment appropriations
In the wake of the EP-Council accord on the total figure for payments in 2007, the Budgets Committee voted on the allocation to be made among the different budget lines remaining "open" at second reading. €195 million had to be distributed among lines regarded as priorities by Parliament.
The most important increases in payments include: a combined total of +29 million for competitiveness and innovation (final amount 130 million); +20 million for the Lifelong Learning programme (583.6 million) and +17 million for the external frontiers fund (95 million).
Breakthrough on CFSP
A breakthrough in the negotiations had been achieved on 28 November by an exchange of letters between the Council Presidency and the EP which, speaking of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP), states that Parliament will be provided with "timely information on planned individual CFSP/ESDP actions". This would straightaway cover the "proposed ESDP mission to Kosovo" regarding which the EP would be given information on the objectives and financial implications.
In response to this undertaking, the Budgets Committee proposes restoring the level of funding for the CFSP to €159.2 million by using the unspent funds in heading 4 and a new breakdown of funds in that same heading, with the result that there will be no need to use the flexibility instrument under the 2007 budget.
Financial Regulation: what Parliament gained
An integral part of the package deal with the Council is an agreement between the two arms of the budgetary authority on the Financial Regulation. Although this matter was dealt with under a consultation procedure, Parliament's rapporteur, Ingeborg GRÄßLE (EPP-ED, DE) reached agreement with the Council on a number of points regarded as crucial by MEPs.
One of the key points of the deal relates to the creation of a database designed to exclude contractors who are "in situations of exclusion". This tool will shared by the EU institutions and agencies, and in it the Commission will list companies which, for example, are bankrupt, subject to court judgements or conflicts of interest. This will mean they are excluded from calls for tender issued by the Institutions.
Life+
Lastly, a declaration states that the potential legal vacuum threatening the environmental protection programme Life+ between the start of 2007 and the adoption of the corresponding legal basis will be addressed by allocating €15 million to "transitional measures".

Employment policy
Green Light for European Globalisation Fund
2006-12-07 - 09:32
An agreement between the Employment Committee and Council has been reached in informal negotiations on the Commission's proposal to establish a European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) This Fund will provide up to €500 million each year to help reintegrate into the labour market workers made redundant due to changes in global trade patterns, and will be able to become operational as of 1 January 2007, if the plenary follows the recommendations of the Employment Committee (EMPL). In the informal negotiations, Council accepted most of the EMPL positions, expressed in the report by Roselyne BACHELOT-NARQUIN (EPP-ED, FR), adopted in October by 34 votes in favour to 3 against with 2 abstentions. On the controversial issues, a compromise has been reached, which will be brought to the plenary in form of compromise amendments put forward by the EMPL committee.
The committee stresses that, notwithstanding the positive effects of globalisation on growth and jobs, it may also have negative consequences for the most vulnerable and least qualified workers in some sectors. Assistance from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) should therefore provide solidarity and support for individual workers made redundant as a result of structural changes in world trade patterns. It should not finance the restructuring of companies or sectors - only active labour market measures shall be supported and not passive social protection measures, says the committee. The EGF should also have the aim of stimulating economic growth and creating more jobs in the European Union.
Who is eligible for funding from the EGF?
MEPs in the committee want to guarantee that more cases can be supported via the EGF, a view which is included in the final compromise: Assistance should be concentrated on workers made redundant in those areas most adversely affected by economic dislocation due to changes in world trade patterns leading to a serious economic disruption, notably a substantial increase of imports into the EU or a rapid decline of the EU market share in a given sector or a delocalisation to third countries which results in:
- at least 1,000 workers lose their job in a company, its suppliers or downstream producers over a period of 4 months (covers the whole EU territory, not only specific regions as foreseen in the original COM proposal)
- at least 1,000 workers in different SMEs lose their jobs, over a period of 9 months due to a sectoral crisis in a region (for example textile to the automobile sector...)
-in small labour markets or in exceptional circumstances an intervention is possible if the redundancies have a serious impact on employment and the local economy, even if the above mentioned conditions are not met.
15 % of the fund's provision will be earmarked for these exceptional circumstances and small labour markets mentioned in point number three, an important point for MEPs who wanted to guarantee more flexibility.
Since economic dislocations are not necessarily concentrated in a single Member State, in exceptional circumstances, Member States may submit joint requests for assistance from the EGF.
Where does the money come from?
No specific financial provision for the EGF has been made in the EU's financial framework for 2007-2013. The Commission proposal says a maximum amount of €500 million per year will be financed through funds that have been under-spent against the other budget ceilings. The Compromise set out some detail on how this should operate.
When will the EGF be up and running?
The EGF can start as soon as the new regulation enters into force, at the end of the present co-decision procedure. If the informal compromise is adopted by the Parliament, and then by the Council, the procedure can be ended at first reading and the fund can become operational as of January 2007.
Where will more Information be available?
Following a demand by MEPs, the compromise states, that the Commission will set up an Internet site, available in all community languages, to provide information on the EGF, guidance on the submission of applications and updated information on accepted and refused applications.

Prevention of injury and promotion of safety recommendations
2006-12-07 - 09:32
Kathy SINNOTT (IND/DEM, IE) for the Environment Committee will be tabling a non-binding report on a list of recommendations addressed to the Member States on the prevention of injuries and to set out Commission tasks supporting the prevention of injuries as well as the promotion of safety. Approximately 235,000 citizens in the European Union die every year as a result of an accident or violence-related injuries. This amounts to more than 600 fatalities caused by injury per day. Injuries also contribute to social and economic burdens, accounting for about seven million hospital admissions and 65 million medical treatments every year. In order to reduce these burdens, the committee highlights the issues of data collection and data quality, and stresses the importance of promoting safety as well as raising awareness of cost reductions from injury prevention measures.
This recommendation is being proposed in order to help reduce the amount of injuries across the EU, which after cardiovascular diseases, cancer and respiratory diseases, is the fourth most common cause of death in the Member States. Unlike other diseases, however, injuries are preventable and experience shows that when proper measures are introduced the number of accidents and injuries can be reduced considerably.
The Environment Committee calls for the Commission to submit a legislative proposal for the establishment of a Community-wide injury surveillance system, for the exchange of information on good practice and for the dissemination of information including precise details of financial implications.
The committee points out that People over 65 years of age represent 16% of the total population in the EU, but suffer a disproportionate 40% of fatal injuries; thus the elderly run more than double the risk of encountering a fatal accident, and long bone fractures are the main cause of hospitalisation among the elderly.
The Environment Committee says that Member States should pay particular attention to the social determinants that provoke injuries and insecurity: the biggest difference in injury, mortality and morbidity rates is between poorer and wealthier countries, and between social classes within countries. The gap is growing, due to factors such as increased road traffic, worsening inequalities in terms of income, higher unemployment, decreasing social support, market liberalisation and increased availability of alcohol, and poor regulatory and enforcement mechanisms. The unemployed, ethnic minority groups, migrant workers, refugees, and disabled and homeless people are particularly at risk.
The committee also says that Member States should ensure that insurance companies that have access to injury data provide all relevant data to the Member States in order to facilitate the definition of the mechanisms and places where accidents most frequently occur and use this information to improve prevention.

Development and cooperation
Development cooperation: priority to the Millennium Development Goals
2006-12-07 - 09:32
After two years of negotiations with the Council, Parliament's Development Committee is recommending approving an agreement on the financing instrument for development co-operation for 2007-2013, which reflects Parliament's main demands on the structure and priorities of Community aid. Another key point for MEPs is that Parliament preserved its co-decision powers, which the Commission had sought to bring into question. In a report drafted by Gay MITCHELL (EPP-ED, IE), the Development Committee agrees to renew what is one of the EU's most important instruments for funding its development cooperation, with a budget of nearly €17 billion for 2007-2013.
Following pressure from MEPs, the instrument's scope will be restricted to developing countries. The Commission had wanted to extend it to industrialised countries which have pre-accession, neighbourhood or partnership agreements with the EU. MEPs, however, insist that development policy must focus on the developing countries, in line with the Millennium Goals.
Parliament also battled for, and won, a separate instrument for human rights. In addition, the Commission promised to allocate 20% of the geographical programmes to primary and secondary education as well as basic healthcare.
Parliament's powers safeguarded
Development policy is the only external relations area in which Parliament has co-decision powers with the Council. It was important for MEPs to safeguard these powers for the purpose of deciding on the geographical programmes and thematic areas of aid. The Commission had wanted to decide on its own after receiving the opinion of a committee of experts (the "comitology" procedure) but the accord reached with the Council preserves Parliament's co-decision rights.
The Commission must also inform Parliament regularly of the work done by the above committee. Parliament will receive, at the same time as members of that committee, the meeting agendas, the strategy plans for each country and the minutes of the meetings.
Lastly, the Development Committee emphasises that the funding provided must be approved by the national auditing body and the parliament of each partner country concerned. Any suspension of aid will be decided by the EU Council of Ministers by a qualified majority, after Parliament has delivered an opinion.

Financing Instrument for cooperation and the industrialised countries
2006-12-07 - 09:32
David MARTIN (PES, UK) for the International Trade Committee ,will be tabling a non-binding report on the financing instrument for co-operation with the industrialised countries. The Beneficiary countries are: Australia, Bahrain; Brunei, Canada, Chinese Taipei, Hong-Kong, Japan, Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Macao, New Zealand, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, United Arab Emirates and the United States. The amendments tabled by committee can be summarised along three main headlines:
First to clarify and simplify the drafting of the proposal; second, to bring the proposal in line with other external instruments for financial assistance; and third, to improve Parliament's scrutiny of this instrument and involvement in programming.
1. Tightening and clarifying the proposal
A number of amendments are introduced in order to bring clarity and consistency to some aspects of the wording of the proposal. Most notably, the committee finds the notion of EU "strategic interest" problematic in a legal text. The committee agrees in principle with the Commission's views on the nature of this instrument which, unlike other "assistance" instruments, should also reflect the needs and interests of the EU. However, the notion of "strategic" interests is unnecessarily political or even geopolitical.
2. Bringing ICI into line with other external instruments
The committee has included a number of highly relevant articles/clauses/recitals which are included in other instruments for external assistance:
Review Clause
Given the substantial changes introduced in the new proposal, with the extension from 6 to 17 countries, there is no reason to forget the "review clause" included in the other instruments for external assistance. This proposal is a new departure, involving new countries and activities. The Commission itself may want to propose adjustments for the mid-term review.
Human Rights/Democracy Clause
With the extension of the geographical coverage of the instrument, it is necessary, as in other instruments, to introduce a Human Rights/Democracy Clause. The wording in the proposed new recital mirrors the wording of article 181a itself.
The committee sees no reason not to include it here, particularly given the heterogeneous group of countries with whom the EU intends to develop cooperation: NICs from Asia like Singapore, Brunei, Hon Kong, Taipei, Macao or Gulf Cooperation Council Countries like UAE, Kuwait, Oman and Bahrain or Saudi Arabia.
General Principles
The section on general principles is incomplete: Complementarity and Coherence of cooperation are two important principles which should be included.
The new regulation will bring together a highly heterogeneous group of countries and set of activities. Henceforth the need to also introduce the "principle of differentiation" in both the recitals and the article on general principles: an assessment of the specific situation of the partner countries and the specific interests of the Community in a given country should be the first step to decide on the exact type of cooperation to be developed with a partner country.
Protecting the Community’s financial interests
The specific article on the protection of the Community’s financial interests should be included as in other instruments for external assistance.
3. The role of Parliament
The committee believes that the role of the European Parliament should be strengthened with regard to the evaluation, reporting mechanisms and its involvement in a structured dialogue over multi-annual cooperation programmes.

Agriculture
Call to keep support for EU banana production
2006-12-07 - 09:32
The Agriculture Committee will ask Parliament to vote in favour of continuing to link compensatory aid for banana growers to banana production. It will also urge keeping current rules on producers' organizations, as well as the current system of advance payments. The committee nonetheless wishes the Commission to review the policy in 2009, especially if third-country import tariffs change in the meantime. The Agriculture Committee's opinion on the Commission's plans to reform the existing compensatory aid scheme for the banana sector are set out in a consultation report by Jean-Claude FRUTEAU (PES, FR). This scheme is especially important for the Union's outermost regions, which face growing competition from Central and South American banana producers.
The Commission had proposed shifting aid towards producer support by using the Single Payment Scheme (SPS), which would decouple payments from banana production. The committee would prefer 40 per cent of the national aid to be dispersed through a crop specific payment, and only 60 per cent to be available through the SPS, so as to keep incentives for producers to continue cultivation.
For the same reason, committee members also wish to maintain the Community-level rules on producers' organizations, which play a key role in the management of crop-specific aid. Mr Fruteau's report suggests that affiliation to a recognised organisation be made mandatory for EU payment recipients, unless their geographical circumstances make this impossible.
The committee would also like the system of advance payments to be maintained, which helps tide producers over the period until October, when the first payments are made. Finally, the report argues that any changes in tariffs against third countries would necessitate a review of the aid scheme, since a fall in tariffs would need to be compensated for by a larger compensatory aid envelope.

Compound feedingstuffs for animals
2006-12-07 - 09:32
The House will vote on a first-reading report drafted by Friedrich Graefe zu Baringdorf (Greens/EFA, DE), on behalf of the Agriculture Committee, concerning a Commission proposal to delete a provision in Directive 2002/2/EC by which manufacturers of feedingstuffs are required to provide, upon a customer’s request, the exact percentages, by weight, of feed materials used in compound feeding stuffs. The Commission's proposal was approved by the Agriculture Committee with just one substantive amendment, which calls for the competent authorities to have the right to obtain the exact percentages used in feedstuffs in the event of calamities.

Brussels to tackle brucellosis?
2006-12-07 - 09:32
Ilda FIGUEIREDO (GUE/NGL, PT) for the Agriculture Committee will table a consultation report on national and EU plans for control, monitoring and eradication measures for animal diseases such as foot and mouth. The Commission proposal is mainly a technical update of existing rules, intended to bridge a gap until new legislation is drafted in 2008. Under the proposal, Member States would be able to apply for funding for multi-annual plans rather than just annual ones. Some diseases would be removed from the list of those eligible for funding.
The Agriculture Committee broadly approves the Commission's text but would like a stronger guarantee for emergency aid if there is an outbreak of a disease. It also wishes to reinstate four diseases that the Commission had taken out of the programme: Bovine leucosis, Newcastle disease, Aujeszky's disease and Swine brucellosis.

External relations
Vote on EU-Russia relations
2006-12-07 - 09:32
MEPs will vote on a resolution on EU-Russia relations following the debate held on Wednesday 29 November in Brussels during the last plenary session. This follows the EU-Russia summit held on 24 November under the Finnish Presidency. Amid discord over Russia's ban on Polish food exports, the summit failed to reach a decision to launch negotiations for a new framework agreement between the EU and Russia to replace the current partnership and cooperation agreement, which expires in 2007. The two sides endorsed the outcome of the negotiations on the phasing-out of charges for overflying Siberia. Among other issues discussed were energy policy and the situations in Iran, the Middle East and North Korea. The House may also choose to focus on the recent apparent murder of a former Russian spy in the UK. Motions for resolutions: Russia-EU Summit

Customs
Security, competitiveness and efficiency through e-Customs
2006-12-07 - 09:32
Parliament will debate and vote on three co-decision reports by the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, all of which aim to revamp the EU customs framework to meet evolving challenges in trade, technology and security.
The three reports -- on a modernised EU Customs Code, on a paperless environment for customs and trade, and on the launch of the Customs 2013 action programme -- all share one common denominator (and objective): the development of pan-European electronic customs. The number of messages handled through the secure network between customs administrations is expected to increase from 120 million per year in 2005 to 1.27 billion in 2013 -- a major argument for introducing e-customs.
New Customs Code and paperless customs
As the European Commission has put it, the present Customs Code "is out of date". An entirely new code must be drafted to accommodate the new electronic environment for customs and trade -- and to address emerging safety threats on the territory of the EU. The modernised code aims, therefore, to do away with outdated procedures developed for a paper-based environment -- procedures, which, as the Commission argues, "increase the risk of fraud, [and] compromise safety and security at the external border".
With that in mind, the new code introduces the principle of electronic declarations and electronic data exchange between customs administrations: with certain exceptions, electronic declarations would become the rule wherever a customs declaration is required. Under a "centralised clearance" system, an authorized economic operator can lodge an electronic declaration from his or her premises prior to the arrival of the goods in question -- and irrespective of the Member State at whose border the goods are entering into or leaving the Union.
In a report by Janelly FOURTOU (ALDE, FR), the Internal Market Committee, aside from a number of technical changes to the draft code, is proposing an amendment outlining the criteria necessary to meet the status of "customs representative" (a person designated to deal with customs authorities on behalf of others).
Christopher HEATON-HARRIS (EPP-ED, UK), the rapporteur on a paperless environment for customs and trade, sounded a pessimistic note when he said that his report -- which backs the adoption of the Commission proposal without any amendments -- is likely to be "stuck" at the Council for a long time. Member States, he noted, are unlikely to put up the money needed to finance its provisions (which are themselves meant to be symbiotic with the Customs Code).
Customs 2013
In another report by Janelly Fourtou, the Internal Market Committee proposes that Parliament approve the Customs 2013 programme -- the successor of Customs 2007 -- which provides, among other things, for the development of pan-European electronic customs and the expansion of international customs cooperation with third-country administrations (candidate countries and ENP countries). The six-year programme, aligned with the duration of the financial perspective, carries a budget of €323.8 million, a large increase from the 157.4 million assigned for Customs 2007. It is expected to finance, among other things, benchmarking activities, seminars, communication and information-exchange systems, and other activities in line with the main objective of the programme -- the creation of an electronic, paper-free customs environment.

Youth
Keep children safe while browsing the Internet, says MEPs
2006-12-07 - 09:32
The EP Committee on Culture and Education and the Council have reached an agreement on actions to protect children from inappropriate content on the Internet. The Committee is putting forward a second reading report by Marielle De Sarnez (ALDE, FR), on a proposed recommendation on the protection of minors and human dignity, and the right of reply in relation to the competitiveness of the European audiovisual and information service industry. The Internet has become one of the most popular means of communication among young people, who have access to it at school, in cybercafés and on third-generation mobile telephones. As, for example, there are currently an estimated 260 million Internet pages containing pornographic content, it was considered urgently necessary for the European Union to propose a set of measures at European level to provide at least a minimum degree of protection for the most vulnerable and for minors. So the Committee welcomed a Commission proposal on the possible creation of a new top-level domain named ".KID.eu" (like .com or .org), with content designed for children. MEPs felt that the domain could provide a secure Internet area regularly monitored by an independent authority.
EU Member States are called upon to launch information campaigns to increase public awareness of the potential dangers of Internet and to distribute information packs concerning tips on "safe surfing", protective filter systems and the use of free hotlines to be introduced in each Member State for registering complaints or reporting harmful content. Ongoing training should be provided for teachers and educators concerning the use of Internet and the dangers of online discussion groups such as forums and chatlines.
The Committee and Council also agree on the need to instil a greater sense of responsibility into those working in this sector, who should do everything possible to avoid any form of discrimination, prevent the circulation of illegal or harmful content, ensure that it can reported when this occurs and introduce a quality label for service providers.
Finally, the proposal seeks to facilitate exercise of the right of reply in all online media, a system which already works satisfactorily in the written press and audiovisual services. Minimum guidelines should therefore be established at European level concerning exercise of the right of reply in respect of Internet and mobile phones, it says.

New financial instrument for nuclear safety and security assistance in non-EU countries
2006-12-07 - 09:32
The Industry Committee is proposing a report under the consultation procedure on a proposed regulation establishing an Instrument for Nuclear Safety and Security Assistance. The proposed Regulation is aimed at supporting efforts to enhance nuclear safety, radiation protection and the application of efficient and effective safeguards of nuclear materials in third countries. The substance of the proposal is to provide financial, economic and technical assistance complementary to any assistance that is normally provided for under the other external cooperation instruments for the years 2007 - 2013.
In the report by Esko SEPPÄNEN (GUE/NGL, FI) the Industry Committee proposes a number of non-binding amendments, where is recommended to the Council that "priority should be given to nuclear installations and activities which are likely to have significant effects on the Member States" and financial assistance should only be given to existing nuclear power plants or other nuclear installations.
MEPs underline the importance of the "polluter pays" principle. The financial instrument should not be used "for paying taxes, customs duties or other fiscal charges in beneficiary countries". Considering that the large amounts of money involved and the mediocre past record of nuclear assistance programs in the East, MEPs reinforced the need for more frequent reporting by the Commission to the EP
Background :
Community assistance under this regulation shall be implemented on the basis of multi-annual strategy papers and indicative programmes and shall be established for a period of up to seven years. They shall set out the Community’s strategy for the provision of assistance under this Regulation, having regard to the needs of the countries concerned, the Community’s priorities, the international situation and the activities of the main partners.
The financial, economic and technical assistance provided under this Regulation shall be complementary to any assistance that is provided by the European Community under the Humanitarian Aid instrument, the Pre-accession instrument, the European Neighbourhood and Partnership instrument, the Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation instrument, and the instrument for Stability.

Energy
Cleaner, greener future for EU energy policy?
2006-12-07 - 09:32
The Industry and Energy Committee says there should be binding targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions and on increasing the use of renewable energy sources. These views are set out in a wide ranging report on the Commission's energy strategy proposals. In its report, drawn up by Eluned MORGAN (PES, UK), the committee welcomes the Commission's green paper on a European strategy for sustainable, competitive and secure energy, but stresses that changing conditions in the broader global energy market need to be taken into account. MEPs in the committee want a systematic approach considering production, distribution and consumption in order to develop a policy which secures affordable energy.
A binding CO2 target for 2020 and changes in Emissions Trading Scheme
To tackle climate change, MEPs in the committee say EU leaders should agree within the next year on a binding CO2 target for 2020 and an indicative one for 2050. They say the existing Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) needs to be changed, to include a move towards auctioning or benchmarking based on output - and also to bring in further emitting sectors including all types of freight transport.
Energy Efficiency to be a priority across the board
The report asks the Council and Commission to make the EU the most energy efficient economy in the world by 2020 and to set energy efficiency measures as cross-cutting priority for all EU policy areas. It supports an EU target for energy efficiency improvements of at least 20 per cent by 2020. MEPs call for an EU strategy on transport energy use, aiming at the phasing out of fossil fuel, a reduction in oil dependency and the gradual introduction of clean energy.
Targets for renewables supported - nuclear power is up to Member States
In order to help diversify energy sources, the committee says the EU needs a stable long-term policy framework, with binding sectoral targets for renewables to reach 25 per cent in primary energy by 2020 - and a route map to reach 50 per cent by 2040. The committee recognises the role that nuclear energy plays in some Member States as part of the energy mix and as a way of avoiding CO2 emissions, but says decisions on the future of nuclear power must be taken by the Member States individually.
Consumers at the centre of energy policies
MEPs in the committee stress that consumers must be placed at the centre of all future energy policies and that energy poverty should feature more clearly in the Commission's proposals. Consumers should have easy access to price and choice information, to an easy method of switching energy provider and a right to be heard by the regulators in each Member State.
EU should speak with one voice with third countries
The committee says a common stance vis-à-vis third countries is needed to increase the EU's ability to negotiate with energy producing and consuming countries. The Commissioner responsible for energy should, say MEPs, work to a well defined mandate with a long-term energy planning vision. MEPs urge the Commission and the Member States to take very seriously the real danger of a deficit in gas supplies from Russia after 2010. They insist on the ratification of the Transit Protocol and the Energy Charter Treaty, which are instrumental in ensuring much needed foreign investment in Russia’s energy infrastructure and to assure sufficient gas supply to the EU.

Hague Convention on securities
2006-12-07 - 09:32
A number of MEPs will be asking the Commission questions on the implications of signing the Hague Securities Convention. Following the release by the European Commission of its Legal Assessment, the Council is currently in the process of deciding if the European Union should or should not decide to sign the Hague Securities Convention. Given the major importance of the Convention for European investors and market participants, the European Parliament considers that it is insufficiently involved in the debate on this decision.
The European Parliament, on this issue, has one major goal: that the efficiency and the clarity of the current European rule relating to the conflict of law on securities holdings can be protected.
Indeed, the codecision process, in recent years, succeeded in creating one unified rule on conflict of law for Europe, which determines the applicable law as the law of the Member State where the account is located. Market participants, Member States and the European Commission all recognise that the ‘location of account’ formula works efficiently in the internal market.
Not recognising the validity of such a basic rule and advocating its replacement by a free choice of applicable laws by the parties of a securities account would certainly open the ‘Pandora's box’ of free choice of the applicable law for cash accounts as well. Moreover, while any country is asked to implement more and more strict legislation relating to money laundering, market abuses, transparency and corporate governance, establishing a rule on the alleged impossibility to localise securities accounts may be almost considered as rather provocative.
 Does the Commission share this objective of the Parliament to try to fully protect the application of the ‘location of account’ formula?
 Before committing the EU to signing the Convention, has the Commission actually tried to find a means to continue to apply the ‘location of account’ formula for European accounts while reserving the Convention's free choice of applicable law for accounts held outside the EU?
 Could the Commission explain how it could commit the EU to signing the Convention without having carried out a true economic and business impact assessment of it? Oral question to the Commission on the implications of signing the Hague Securities Convention
