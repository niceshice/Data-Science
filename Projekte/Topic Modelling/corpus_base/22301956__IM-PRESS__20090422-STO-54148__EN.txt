08:30, 25 May 1953, Nevada, US. The first and last atomic weapon fired by artillery. MEPs will discuss non-proliferation steps Thursday afternoon Â©Belga The spread of Weapons of Mass Destruction and their means of delivery is one of the most serious international threats according to Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee. On Thursday afternoon MEPs will debate strengthening the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. We want your opinion: what can be done to halt nuclear proliferation or is a world without nuclear weapons a utopian impossibility? Comment using the first link below.
Since the last review of the NPT in 2005 proliferation concerns have been heightened by issues such as North Korea's decision to launch a nuclear test and Iran's alleged intention to develop an enhanced uranium enrichment program. The UK, France and Germany have been leading the EU's negotiations with Iran for the last few years.
However, the Foreign Affairs Committee sees an excellent opportunity for progress given the changed international situation since the new US Administration took office. Speaking in Prague in beginning of April President Barack Obama said the US will take concrete steps towards a world without nuclear weapons. There are also initiatives from the French and British governments to reduce their nuclear arsenals.
Time for real EU commitment
Parliament's rapporteur on the issue is German Green Angelika Beer, she says that "leaders around the world are calling for nuclear disarmament" and that it is now time for a "real commitment of the EU" to show that it is "ready to take the lead in disarmament issues". She is in favour of adopting and promoting a Nuclear Weapons Convention - a model for a strong disarmament treaty.
Ms Beer however deplores the fact that "some Members don't have such a strong view on abolishing nuclear weapons" and that the whole report therefore "is on the verge to turn into a spiritless report on vague and ineffectual disarmament steps".
Recommendations
The report recalls EU's commitments in the Strategy against Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction from 2003 and gives a number of recommendations to the Council in view of the NPT Review Conference, for example:
Reinforcement and improvement of means of verification.
Put the production, use and reprocessing of all nuclear fuel under the International Atomic Energy Agency control
End the production of fissile materials for military purposes.
The report also mentions the importance of dialogue. A point as well made by Members of the US Congress and the European Parliament who recently met in Prague (18-20 April) for the "Legislators Dialogue". They agreed that "joint action is the most effective way to approach problems", and raise, among other issues, in their conclusions Iran stating that "a nuclear armed Iran is unacceptable".
"Nuclear weapon always puts a danger"
Angelika Beer says that a world without nuclear weapons is "certainly achievable and desirable. The use of nuclear energy let alone the stockpiling and availability of nuclear weapons always puts a danger to all of us, intentionally or by accident."
