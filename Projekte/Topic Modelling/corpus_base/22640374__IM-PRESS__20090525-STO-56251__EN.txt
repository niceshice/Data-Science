A call to protect Europe's history and more money for science are among the demands Last week our choice boxes from around Europe filled up with messages from people across Europe. The main purpose of the choice boxes is for people to record their worries, aspirations and initiatives which are then shown to a wider public. In this week's selection there are messages left by Belgians, French, Hungarians and Czechs.
Every week, there will be a selection of the messages which will be posted on the EP web channel - EuroparlTV, YouTube and on screens outside in Brussels. This week's selection comprises a diversity of ideas and concerns such as;
migration
freedom of choice
education
environment
food industry and GMOs
Besides the choice box, the EP election campaign focuses on other instruments such as: the elections website: www.elections2009.eu and the use of social media - Parliament on MySpace, Facebook and Flickr and YouTube.
There have also been billboards highlighting key themes for the elections, street installations TV ads and radio adverts.
