President Pöttering welcomes new members of the European Parliament from Romania
Following the first European election in Romania, the President of the European Parliament Hans-Gert Pöttering stated:
"We have witnessed an important day for Romania. On 1st January it became a member of the European Union. Yesterday the Romanian citizens have elected for the first time their representatives in the European Parliament. After the fall of communism Romania is thereby fully integrated again in the European family.
The 35 Romanian members will be the voice of the Romanian citizens and will represent their interests in the European Parliament. As President of the European Parliament, I warmly welcome the new colleagues and wish them every success in the coming one-and-a-half year of the mandate.
This is also a good opportunity to thank all the members of the Romanian parliament who since September 2005 were observer members of the European Parliament and since 1st January this year, full members. I thank them for their hard work and dedication to the European project.
I hope that the new members of the Parliament will soon be integrated in full in the work of the House and be able to contribute with their experience and knowledge for the benefit of their voters and the European project.
The President of Parliament regretted the low turn-out and further said:" I feel that their positive contribution of the Romanian members will help improve voter participation in future elections".

President Pöttering visited Romania on 15-16 October on his official trip. In Bucharest he met with leading political personalities and civil society. In an address to the two chambers of the Romanian parliament he spoke about the importance of decisions taken by the European Parliament for the citizens of member states. The President also visited Sibiu the 2007 European Capital of Culture.

What does a Member of the European Parliament do?
There are 785 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) and they have a decisive voice in most EU legislation. While the Council represents the individual member states and the Commission seeks to uphold the interests of the Union as a whole, the European Parliament represents the EU’s 490 million citizens and is directly elected by them. Decisions that MEPs make have direct impact on people's lives in all EU countries, which is a good reason for citizens to vote in the European elections. MEPs can approve, amend or reject most of the European laws. The European Parliament does not have the final say alone on the European laws; if a law is to pass, Parliament must find agreement with the Council, representing the Member States. Increasingly it is the MEPs, whose job it is to represent citizens rather than Member States, who find the solutions determining the shape of EU law. Improving bathing water standards, safer use of the internet, maximum working hours, ban on animal testing for cosmetics and better food labelling are just some issue MEPs have recently legislated on. MEPs also decide on the EU's annual budget, and supervise expenditure. Parliamentarians also oversee the European Commission by asking questions, giving the budget "discharge" (verifying that the EU budget money was spent properly) and conducting hearings of the Commissioners-designate. The European Parliament can also force the Commission to resign. How do MEPs work? MEPs spend four days per month in parliamentary sessions in Strasbourg - additional sessions are held in Brussels. During these sittings all MEPs meet in public and take the most important decisions by voting on legislative issues. Most of the work, however, is done in committees, where all proposed legislation is first discussed before being submitted, debated and voted on in plenary session. In committees, MEPs amend proposals from the Commission and Council and adopt legislative proposals and own-initiative reports. There are 20 committees and each specialises in a particular field (such as the environment, public health and food safety, industry, research and energy, transport and agriculture). MEPs can also sit in sub-committees, temporary committees and committees of inquiry, to focus on a particular issue (for example the existence of secret CIA detention centres in Europe for suspected terrorists or the crisis of the Equitable Life Assurance Society). One week per month is usually devoted to meetings of the political groups, where Parliament’s members discuss proposed legislation which will come up at the plenary session. MEPs are grouped together on the basis of political affiliation rather than nationality. There are eight groups at the European Parliament and MEPs cannot belong to more than one political group. Apart from plenary sessions, committees and political groups, MEPs meet in delegations (which interact with the parliaments of countries that are not members of the European Union) and cross-party intergroups (where they focus on specific subjects of common interest). MEPs also have the responsibility to spend time in their constituencies, so that they can represent local concerns at European level. All MEPs make as much time as possible to talk with their constituents, local business and organisations, Parliament set aside a number of short recess periods to facilitate this.

So, just what is an EP political group?
Is the term political group confusing? Would you like to get it straight once and for all? Below you can find a series of articles looking at the eight political groups in the European Parliament. We will consider their history, leaders and programmes. But let's start at the beginning by looking at the political groups and what role they play within the EU. The political group system in the European Parliament is a very specific and special one. Instead of sticking with national interests, MEPs from political parties across the EU come together in supranational groupings, representing common interests. For example, the largest grouping - the European People's Party - European Democrats, or EPP-ED - brings together 277 MEPs from all 27 EU countries. At the moment there are eight political groupings in the European Parliament and 13 non-attached MEPs. To set up a new political group there must be a minimum of 20 members elected in at least one fifth of EU countries. Power House of the Parliament The political groups are vital to the running of the European Parliament: they decide what issues will be dealt with at the plenary, they can also table amendments to reports that will be voted on during the plenary and before the session they decide which position the political group will take. However, no member can be forced to vote in a particular way. "Group co-ordinators" play an important role, providing a point of contact within their political groups for specific policy issues and organising support within committees when it comes to voting on reports. Each political group appoints a chairman, or in some cases two. The influence of the groups is reflected in the fact that they put forward the candidates for all the important posts including the EP president, vice-presidents, committee chairmen and the quaestors.

An overview of the European Parliament in action at the midway point of the legislature July 2004-December 2006
The European Parliament changed dramatically in 2004. Following the historic enlargement of the EU from 15 to 25 Member States on 1 May 2004, European Parliament elections were held in June 2004 in all 25 Member States. The number of MEPs increased from 626 to 732. As a consequence, the number of official working languages increased from 11 to 20 with a mind-boggling possible 380 different language combinations for interpretation. From 1 January 2007, the number of MEPs rises temporarily to 785 with the addition of 35 Romanian 18 Bulgarian MEPs . After the European elections in 2009, the total number reduces to 736 MEPs. Also from 1 January 2007, the number of official languages rises from 20 to 23 with the addition of Romanian, Bulgarian and Irish. One of Parliament's first duties after the 2004 European elections was to vote on the new European Commission, made up of 25 Commissioners then to be 27 Commissioner. MEPs proved decisive with the House rejecting the first Italian candidate Rocco Buttiglione, before the House finally voted in favour of José Manuel Barroso's team in November 2004. In May 2005, Parliament also had to face the "no" votes on the Constitution in France and the Netherlands, MEPs had voted 500 votes to 137 with 40 abstentions in favour of the Constitutional Treaty in January 2005. From a legislative point of view, Parliament's position on the much debated Services Directive which aims to facilitate the provision of cross-border services by removing obstacles to the free movement of services in the internal was taken up by EU government and eventually adopted by MEPs in November 2006. In December 2006, the European Parliament adopted the compromise it negotiated with Council on the new regulation for chemicals, REACH, which will oblige producers to register all those chemical substances produced or imported above a total quantity of 1 tonne per year. Registration will affect about 30,000 substances. As for Parliament budgetary powers , in May 2006, Parliament adopted a report on the EU financial perspective for 2007-2013. After two years of hard negotiations with the EU Council of Ministers, the European Parliament managed to obtain €4 billion more than the EU Member States had originally been prepared to spend. MEPs had long sought to increase the EU budget substantially, to match the EU's growing ambitions. However, faced with the inflexibility of some Member States and the risk of a major crisis if the financial perspectives were not adopted on schedule, they opted for a "realistic" agreement, focusing their efforts on those policy areas that they deemed most important. Below are selected headlines showing the European Parliament in action, exercising its supervisory, legislative and budgetary powers during the plenary sessions held in Strasbourg and Brussels. Parliament's mid-term review 2004-2006 round-up. Here are 20 briefing notes on Parliament's growing role, legislative battles and initiatives so far.

Parliament's role in the EU accession of Bulgaria and Romania
The EU Accession Treaty of Bulgaria and Romania, signed in 2005, was ratified by all Member States before entering into force on 1 January 2007. The accession of Bulgaria (18 MEPs) and Romania (35) increased the total number of MEPs from 732 to 785 for a 27-Member State EU.
In a resolution adopted in April 2005, Parliament gave its assent for Bulgaria and Romania to join the EU on 1 January 2007, but also pointed out that they had work to do in order to be ready by that date. With a 27-member EU just around the corner, MEPs stressed the need for both sides to stick to their commitments. Bulgaria and Romania must pursue their reforms, including those of their judicial systems, even after accession. The negotiations to bring Romania and Bulgaria into the EU on 1 January 2007 were completed in December 2004. The accession treaty, signed on 25 April 2005, lays down conditions similar to those for the ten new Member States that joined on 1 May 2004, apart from an extra clause that would have allowed for their accession to be postponed if they had clearly not been ready. Romania had lodged its membership application on 22 June 1995 and Bulgaria on 14 December 1995.
