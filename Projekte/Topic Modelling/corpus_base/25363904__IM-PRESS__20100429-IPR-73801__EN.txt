On Thursday 29 April European Parliament President Jerzy Buzek will formally open the European Parliament's new Liaison Office with the US Congress, designed to help forge closer links between European parliamentarians and lawmakers on Capitol Hill. The Liaison Office is the first office of the European Parliament in a country outside the EU. The office will be opened by President Buzek at midday (US, East Coast time) on Thursday.
EP President Jerzy Buzek said:
"We have many ideas for deepening our relations. The main purpose of the office is to build a much closer partnership between the European Parliament and Congress as the European Parliament is more powerful after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty.
The EU and the US need to be more coherent and well informed on legislation and political activity. If we work together in advance of legislation we can improve the outcome for citizens and business in a huge transatlantic market.
Together, we must face the challenges that confront us across the Atlantic, from climate change to energy security, from maintaining free trade to improving global governance."
