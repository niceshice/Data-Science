Parliament wants the Council of EU Ministers to present a clear proposal on the sending of a peace-keeping mission to Congo and to limit the duration of such a mission very clearly to the duration of the parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for June.
In a resolution adopted by 455 votes in favour 139 against with 15 abstentions , MEPs describe the mission as " complex and potentially risky ", while they pointed out that the EU has " only a limited number of deployable troops at its disposa l" and that priority should be given to the Balkans. Therefore, they list a number of conditions to be met with for such a mission to be sent.
First of all, the Council should develop a clear concept of how to deploy the necessary military or police forces. The military operation would have to be limited to the election period and there should be a clear strategy for transferring the tasks to the UN and/or Congolese afterwards. The geographical scope of the mission should be determined taking the number of available troops and the security and operational requirements of the mission into account. The mission should be closely linked with efforts for the reconstruction of the Democratic Republic of Congo. And under no circumstances should the operation consist of troops from only one EU Member State.
