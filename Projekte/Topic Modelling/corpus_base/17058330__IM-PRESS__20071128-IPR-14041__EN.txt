MEPs adopted a report on "Advancing African Agriculture - Proposal for agricultural development and food security in Africa" which emphasises the important role the EU should play, in international institutions such as the WTO, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, defending vigorously the right of African states to protect national and regional markets on the African continent against imports threatening the survival of local producers of essential agricultural products.
A paragraph which expressed great regret at the prospect of the attendance of international outcast Robert Mugabe at the Lisbon EU-Africa Summit 8-9 December, whose presence will do much to discredit the good work of the Summit on democratic governance was deleted from the report by the vote in plenary.
