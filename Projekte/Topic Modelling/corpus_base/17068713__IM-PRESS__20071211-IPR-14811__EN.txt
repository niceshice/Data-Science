In adopting a joint resolution on MEPs call on the Council and the Commission to monitor closely the situation in the Black Sea and to take concrete action to help to reduce the ecological impact of the disaster. MEPs express their solidarity and reiterate their support for the victims of this disaster.
10 vessels (tankers and cargo carriers) sank or ran aground in the strait and the northern Black Sea region during a severe storm, including the Volganeft-139, which was not designed to withstand severe weather. According to provisional information, six seafarers died and more than 2000 tonnes of fuel oil and sulphur were spilt into the sea, causing an environmental disaster and killing over 15 000 birds .Violent storms dispersed oil pollutants, affecting communities in the region as well as the environment, and the oil and sulphur pollution, in addition to causing human casualties, also directly affected fauna and flora, with possible long-term impacts on the ecological quality of the natural habitats affected,
MEPs call on the Member States to ensure the rigorous application of existing Community legislation, especially legislation on ship standards, for example on Port State Control.
Parliament stresses that the strictest observation of maritime navigation rules is an essential feature of maritime safety and urges the Member States and the EU's neighbouring countries to ensure that vessel crews and maritime administrations under no circumstances ignore alerts or storm warnings.
MEPs underline the fact that the Black Sea disaster should draw the attention of the EU's neighbouring countries - principally Russia, which has announced plans for a several - fold increase in its oil transhipment and export capacities on the Black Sea coast - to the issues of modernising maritime fleets and banning the use of obsolete single-hull tankers.
Parliament stresses that accidents such as occurred in the Black Sea region should speed up the Council's deliberations and calls on the Council to adopt common positions on all seven legislative proposals immediately.
The House calls on the Council and the Commission to step up cooperation with non-EU riparian states on the implementation of measures to lessen the threat of environmental pollution from shipping accidents, including through action taken in the context of the International Maritime Organisation and the Paris Memorandum of Understanding.
