Will the 2009 elections shift the balance again? The gender balance among Members of the European Parliament has evolved in the thirty years of its directly-elected existence. In 1979, 16.3% of MEPs were women. In the outgoing Parliament, that percentage has increased to 31%. However, only two of the twelve presidents in those thirty years were women, the first, Simone Veil (1979-1982) and her compatriot Nicole Fontaine (1999-2002). Will the 2009 elections shift the balance again?
In any case, it seems likely that Parliament will continue to devote enormous political energy to the promotion of equal opportunities and the reconciliation of work and private life for both men and women.
