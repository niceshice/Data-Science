Parliament adopted a report with a few non-binding amendments on a draft directive laying down a Community system for monitoring crossborder shipments of radioactive waste and spent fuel.
The Commission proposal would amend the existing Directive 92/3 Euratom. It seeks to modify terms and definitions, address new situations and ensure consistency with other Community and international texts.
It does not significantly alter the existing prior authorisation system but clarifies procedures, for example for Member States to consent to, or refuse to allow, shipments of waste and fuel into their territory.
Parliament's amendments seek to improve the new procedure for acknowledging receipt of applications for shipments. It wants to tackle the issue of liability for costs arising when the shipment cannot be completed. And it wishes to make it absolutely clear that any country has the right to ban imports both of radioactive waste for final treatment (except in the case of reshipment) and foreign spent fuel for final disposal.
