Helmut Kuhne MEP and Annika Flaake
Around 50 million Europeans - almost 10% of the population - have some form of disability and 1 in 4 have a disabled family member. A recent parliamentary report said that improving access to public transport and making websites more usable are 2 vital steps in tackling unemployment among disabled people. The European Parliament is playing an active role - both as a legislator and an employer.
Traineeships are very popular in the Parliament. A recently-launched scheme has earmarked resources to recruit more trainees with disabilities. Annike Flaake from Germany is one of the first. She is blind and using a specially designed Braille keyboard means "I can do the work that sighted people can do." Although she gets lost in Parliament's corridors - something all new staff can relate to - she enjoys the experience. She says "it would help if the lifts were labelled with braille." Her local MEP Helmut Kuhne helped arrange her traineeship - and the Parliament's Secretary General Julian Priestley described Annika as "a symbol of a new policy" for recruiting disabled trainees.
Access to public transport, websites vital
In its role as legislator, the Parliament has always tried to raise awareness of disability issues. In 2003 - the "European Year of people with disabilities" it hosted a Parliament of people with disabilities from all over Europe. The aim was to discuss ways in which improvements at a local, national and European level could be made. They adopted a manifesto for the 2004 EP elections.
The report adopted by Parliament's Employment Committee this month calls for more opportunities for disabled people in education and the job market. As well as improving access to public transport it wants better websites - 80% of public websites, including those of the EU institutions, are not accessible to disabled people - a vital tool in finding a job.
According to British Liberal Liz Lynne who drafted the report: "non-discrimination in access to goods and services must be guaranteed for every EU citizen..." She called for a specific European disability directive. The vote will be discussed in the November plenary session.
This report builds on one by Italian People's Party MEP Mario Mantovani in 2004.
Last year marked the 25th anniversary of the Parliament's all party intergroup on disability, which has forged close links with the European Disability Forum - an NGO working to promote disability issues at a European level.
In House: "breaking the barriers"
As well as the scheme to increase the numbers of disabled trainees it takes on, the EP last year updated its 2000 "Code of Good Practice" for employing people with disabilities. The Code offers practical steps on the modification of equipment and buildings, flexible working arrangements and "job redesign" for those who have disabilities. Parliament also has a "breaking the barriers" guide to help its staff communicate more easily with disabled colleagues.
