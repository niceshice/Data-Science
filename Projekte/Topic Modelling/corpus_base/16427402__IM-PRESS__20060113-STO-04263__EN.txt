EP at the centre of budget talks
The Parliament's Budget Committee was unified Wednesday in rejecting the agreement reached on the EU's 2007-2013 budget by heads of government in December. MEPs were particularly critical about the level of provisions agreed by the summit.
The Budgets Committee approved a report by German Christian Democrat Reimer Böge, which rejects the leaders' position on the future budget "in its current form because it does not guarantee an EU budget enhancing prosperity, competitiveness, solidarity and cohesion in the future." MEPs will vote on the report January 18 during the plenary session.
Most of the MEPs welcomed the fact that government leaders had eventually reached an accord, but criticised ministers for taking so long to reach an agreement, as well as the content of the accord. They were particularly critical of the €862 billion (1.045% of gross national income) in funding agreed by the summit, which compares unfavourably with the €975 billion (1.18% of GNI) proposed by the Parliament in June.
Nevertheless, MEPs are eager to get into negotiations so that a solution can be reached. "We are not happy...but we are happy to talk," commented Alain Lamassoure, French MEP for the European People's Party. However, the Böge report makes it a necessary pre-condition for negotiations that the Austrian Presidency has a "real negotiating mandate".
Talks could begin next week when Parliament President Josep Borrell, Commission President José Barroso and Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel meet during the Parliament's plenary session in Strasbourg.
