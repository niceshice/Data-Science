The first ever Parliamentary Youth Intergroup meets for the first time. It's Chair Damien Abad MEP (right) opens the meeting on 11 February. Informal cross-party cooperation in the European Parliament is through the 27 "Intergroups" formed by MEPs. They bring together groups of MEPs on specific issues such as animal welfare, water access and climate change. The latest to be formed is on youth issues and the vice-chair of the group, Romanian Liberal Ramona Mănescu, told us that "social inclusion, active citizenship, education and mobility" will be its priorities.
"Intergroups are not just a discussion platform, but a framework where MEPs from different committees can tackle one subject and integrate it within their work," she explained.
Identifying urgent needs of youth
On the new Youth Intergroup she said, "we have already planned our first event where we would like to invite not only MEPs, but also representatives of international and national youth organisations and Commission representatives; we would like to identify the most urgent needs youth have in this crisis period and try to find solutions for them."
She is confident that the work of the Intergroup will materialise into a legislative proposal, a new EU programme for youth or for the European Commission to devote more resources to it.
The Youth intergroup had its first meeting in Strasbourg on 11 February and was the joint cross party initiative of French MEP Damien Abad (EPP), Ramona Manescu, Spanish Socialist Eider Gardiazábal and British Green MEP Jean Lambert.
One of its priorities will be in involving young people as its Chair Damien Abad commented: “We should not limit ourselves to a policy for youth but develop a policy with young people."
Linking stakeholders with MEPs
Unlike parliamentary committees or official delegations to third countries, Intergroups are not an official part of Parliament's structure. One of their main characteristics is that they bring together so many different groups.
As Irish MEP Jim Higgins explains, "Intergroups are extremely valuable, especially from the point of view of establishing collaboration between particular stakeholders in different organisations and politicians; they have a positive insight into particular problems which effect individuals or communications".
Mr Higgins holds the Office of Parliamentary "Quaestor" - who look after MEPs' administrative affairs. His brief is also to overlook the rules covering Intergroups.
Urban Intergroup seen as a model
In terms of the added value they bring to Parliament, Ms Mănescu points to the work of the Urban Intergroup. "There have been many legislative initiatives around urban issues, the urban authorities in small and medium cities and the needs of these communities in the previous term."
Intergroups generally meeting during the Parliamentary sessions held in Strasbourg and are open to the public.
