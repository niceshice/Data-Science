Monday in plenary: flu, maternity leave, primates in science
Opening the session Hans-Gert Pöttering expressed his condolences to the Dutch people after the tragedy of Apeldoorn. The flu epidemic, the 5th anniversary of EU enlargement, maternity leave and animal welfare were all debated Monday in Strasbourg. In opening the session, Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering expressed his condolences to the Dutch people after the tragedy of Apeldoorn after the attack on the royal parade on a national holiday.
The President also called for Iran to release US-Iranian journalist Roxana Saberi and deplored the recent execution of another young woman, Delara Darabi.
Flu epidemic: seed stocks for new vaccine by 11 May
Europe's Health Commissioner Androula Vassiliou briefed the House on Europe's response and preparedness for the flu epidemic. She expressed her hope that "on 11 May we shall have the seed stocks to give to the industry in order for it to begin production of the new vaccine" and called on people not to panic.
MEPs voiced their concern about the disparities between vaccine stocks in different EU countries. The World Health Organisation has raised the alert over the flu epidemic to level five - indicating human-to-human transmission in at least two countries.
Maternity leave
Debating a report on maternity leave which varies enormous across the EU many MEPs called for it to be extended to 20 weeks with at least 6 weeks being paid. Some Members on the right however argued that it would discourage companies, especially smaller ones, from hiring women.
Animals in science
The rights of animals - especially primates - to protection during scientific research was discussed. Based on a report by British Conservative Neil Parish many MEPs want testing to be allowed on some primates but under strict ethical guidelines.
A vote on these two issues will take place from 1200 CET Tuesday.

Tuesday : telecoms, unemployment, rosé wine
MEPs debated an overhaul of Europe's communications network Tuesday morning. Measures such as making it easier to change phone companies and the right to access the internet are part of the plans being put to the vote Wednesday from noon. MEPs also debated a forthcoming employment summit in Prague aimed at tackling the growing the growing problem of Europe's jobless. MEPs also approved an almost total ban on the trade in seal products.
British Conservative Malcolm Harbour has steered one of the reports on the telecoms package through parliament. Speaking in the debate he commended it to the House saying the reforms would mean "an enabling and empowering of consumers." He dismissed fears that the reform can prevent access to the internet by telling fellow Members that "this reform is not restrictive in any way."
His counterpart, Socialist MEP Catherine Trautmann, who dealt with Electronic communications networks and services, said that "this is about giving consumers better services at better prices" and "this is a regulatory framework which will benefit everyone."
Ms Pilar del Castillo for the EPP-ED drafted the report on the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications: She told the House that "if there is one industry which can help us out of this economic crisis, than it's the one of information and communication technologies."
Socialist MEP Francisca Pleguezuelos who wrote Parliament's report on Frequency bands for mobile communications said: "We shouldn't forget in the EU electronic communications produce a turnover of EUR300 billion."
Rising unemployment in Europe
MEPs also debated the rising unemployment levels in Europe ahead of an intended employment summit in Prague next week. There was great concern for the rising levels.
Gabriele Stauner of the EPP-ED group - who drafted a report on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund explained that until 2012 the Fund will be reoriented to help address the problems of jobless workers hit by the economic crisis.
José Albino Silva Peneda - also for the EPP-ED group said that "unemployment is the most visible face of the crisis." He went on to tell the House that "the crisis cannot be an excuse to reduce our social protection levels."
Rosé wine saved
Late on Tuesday night the House debated controversial steps to overhaul the parts of the common agriculture policy relating to wine. In particular they were worried that at the end of April the ban on mixing white and red wine. It was deemed that this could destroy the rosé wine market and MEPs therefore asked the Commission to "postpone the contested decision."

Wednesday: Pöttering urges people to vote, maternity leave, telecoms
President Hans-Gert Pöttering got a warm reception from the House after his farewell speech In his farewell speech, President Pöttering urged people to vote in the June elections. Parliament backed new legislation aimed at avoiding future financial crises, but rejected new rules regulating telecommunications and internet use. It also sent proposals for minimum maternity leave back to committee.
n the last plenary of this term Hans-Gert Pöttering speaking after two and a half years as Parliament's President, highlighted the 2004 enlargement, legislation, internal reform, support for the Middle East peace process and cultural exchange. On the coming elections, he said, the campaign is the chance to "speak with citizens about why the EU is necessary. I should like to call upon all citizens to vote in the elections."
New rules to avoid future financial crisis
The European Parliament adopted a report by Austrian Christian Democrat Othmar Karas amending the "Capital Requirements" directives to improve risk management and avoid a repetition of the current banking crisis, where bank failures have put pressure on other banks and left the whole financial system at risk.
The legislation aims to enhance both the efficiency and effectiveness of bank supervision and crisis management by facilitating cooperation among national authorities dealing with cross-border financial institutions.
No agreement on telecoms regulation
MEPs don't want users’ internet access to be restricted without a prior ruling by the courts, so they overturned an informal agreement reached with ministers, meaning the telecom package will be delayed. The a reform of the regulatory framework for electronic communications, including mobile and fixed telephones, broadcasting, wireless and fixed internet is likely to be subject of fresh negotiations between MEPs and EU Ministers in the next Parliament's legislative term after the European elections.
Also on Wednesday
Among the many significant votes on Wednesday, MEPs:
- Adopted new rules on animal welfare at the time of slaughter
- Introduced new provisions protecting the rights of “assisting spouses”
- Decided not to proceed with new legislation on EU-wide minimum maternity leave and other provisions concerning pregnant women at work, until political disagreements can be overcome.
- Voted on new energy consumption rating labels for domestic appliances, sending the Commission back to the drawing board on labels for TV sets
- Extended the scope of the EU “Globalisation Adjustment Fund” to improve support for recession-hit workers

Thursday: human rights dominates last plenary
Thursday marked the last day of debates of the 2004-2009 European Parliamentary term before June's elections As the gavel came down at 1615 on Thursday, it marked the end of the final session of the 2005-2009 European Parliamentary term before elections in June. The parliament's annual human rights report was discussed and MEPs approved funding for a programme to boost the European and International film industry.
Parliament's annual human rights report welcomed the retreat of the death penalty around the world and the progress made on women's and children's rights.
It criticised the fact that the EU does not promote human rights effectively and that the Union often does not live up to its own principles - for example on terrorism and immigration.
In relation to human rights, MEPs also discussed Turkey's EU aspirations. It has been a candidate for EU membership since 2005 and has undertaken many reforms. In particular MEPs welcomed improvements in the freedom of speech.
Many Members called on Turkey to prove that is it still committed to the reform process. They also called for the Kurdish question to be settled and said that institutional reforms thus far were insufficient to warrant full membership.
With regard to Iran MEPs expressed concern at the general deterioration of the human rights situation there. MEPs also condemned the "unfounded sentences" handed down against the American-Iranian journalist Roxana Saberi which was condemned in a resolution by MEPs. Members were concerned about the treatment of trade unionists and the execution of juvenile offenders.
MEPs gave the European and international film industry a boost by approving €15 million in funding for the Media Mundus programme which pays for international productions, training programmes and professional scholarships.
