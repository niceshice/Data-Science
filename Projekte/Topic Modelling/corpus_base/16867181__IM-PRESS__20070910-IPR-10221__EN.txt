Civil Liberties Committee substantially amends proposal on forced return of illegal immigrants

The Civil Liberties Committee on Wednesday voted over 200 binding amendments to a Commission proposal laying down common rules on the temporary custody and removal of illegal immigrants. . MEPs fixed a maximum "retention" (custody) period of 18 months and backed the use of coercive measures, case-by-case, to remove illegal immigrants or rejected asylum seekers. Returned immigrants may also be subject to an EU-wide re-entry ban.
The aim of the draft directive, which will be the first serious attempt to create an EU common policy on return, is to eliminate marked differences in how Member States deal with the expulsion of immigrants and establish "fair and transparent" common rules on voluntary return, removal orders, use of coercive measures, temporary custody and a re-entry ban, whilst ensuring respect for the human rights of the persons concerned. The rapporteur was Manfred Weber (EPP-ED, DE). The future directive promotes the principle of voluntary return by establishing a general rule that a "period for departure" should normally be granted. MEPs stressed that such period should be of "at least 4 weeks", unless a competent authority has objective reasons to believe the person will abscond. A longer retention period While individual decisions are taken on each removal case and the removal arrangements are in progress, the people concerned may be retained by authorities "in specialised temporary custody facilities". Following tough negotiations, MEPs finally agreed to fix "a period of three months after which temporary custody shall cease to be justified". Yet Member States may shorten or extend this period by "up to 18 months in cases in which in spite of all reasonable efforts, the removal operation is likely to last longer due to lack of co-operation on the part of the third-country national concerned or due to delays in obtaining the necessary documentation from third countries or if the person concerned represents a proven threat to public security". This paragraph amends the Commission's initial proposal, which was for a fixed maximum period of 6 months. The directive also deals with the living conditions of people in temporary custody, and several of the amendments seek to ensure their right to medical assistance, family unity and education for children. Unaccompanied minors should not be detained MEPs decided that "unaccompanied minors should not be removed or detained" and also added new paragraphs to ensure that families accompanied by one or more minors will be given separate accommodation and "only be detained as a measure of last resort". Re-entry ban A key innovation of the directive is that forced removal orders might include an EU-wide re-entry ban valid for up to five years. MEPs stressed that such a ban should be provided for only as a possibility, to be decided upon by the Member State case by case, rather than mandatory, as the Commission had suggested. Return and removal The directive will also establish a harmonised two-step procedure which involves a return decision as a first step and, if necessary, the issuing of a removal order as a second step, thus to some extent aligning Member States' currently divergent systems. MEPs adopted several measures to establish minimum safeguards for the conduct of forced removal and to prevent collective expulsions. Ombudsman for return Finally, the Civil Liberties Committee added a provision for the appointment of a "European Parliament Ombudsman for Return" who will be entitled to conduct unannounced inspections, collect information on joint removals and ask Member States for clarifications. Once the directive is adopted, Member States will have 18 months to bring it into effect.
