Parliament will be able to step up its scrutiny of how EU financial instruments for external co-operation are implemented if proposals approved by the Foreign Affairs and Development committees on Wednesday are backed by Parliament in a plenary vote on 16 June.
With the Lisbon Treaty in force, MEPs want to strengthen Parliament's democratic scrutiny, not only of EU legislation passed via the ordinary legislative procedure (co-decision with the Council), but also for the purpose of monitoring the Commission's implementation of the EU financial instruments for external co-operation .
Delegated acts
Country strategy papers for thematic programmes and multiannual indicative programmes drafted by the Commission for the external co-operation instruments "shall be adopted by means of delegated acts", say amendments approved by the committees.
De facto veto
Delegated acts are a streamlined system, introduced by the Lisbon Treaty, for delegating to the European Commission the power to make minor changes to EU laws when needed. This would give the European Parliament a de facto veto, by enabling it to block these papers and programmes and require the Commission to present amended proposals.
In the context of the mid-term review of EU's external financial instruments - the Development Co-operation Instrument (DCI) and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) - the Foreign Affairs and Development committees included the amendments in two reports, drafted by Gay Mitchell (EPP, IE) and Barbara Lochbihler (Greens/EFA, DE), together with Kinga Gal (EPP, HU), so to enable Parliament to exercise its new prerogatives under the Lisbon Treaty.
Background
Before the Lisbon Treaty's entry into force, the rapporteurs proposed introducing the regulatory procedure with scrutiny (RPS) to approve strategy papers under the DCI and EIDHR. Since this procedure no longer exists under the Lisbon Treaty, these amendments were withdrawn and replaced by amendments introducing the procedure for delegated acts.
Next Steps
These reports will be put to a first-reading plenary vote in Strasbourg, Wednesday, 16 June, together with two others, which make similar amendments to the Instrument for Stability and the Financing instrument for co-operation with industrialised countries, by Franzsika Brantner (Greens/EFA, DE), and Helmut Scholz (GUE/NGL, DE), respectively.
