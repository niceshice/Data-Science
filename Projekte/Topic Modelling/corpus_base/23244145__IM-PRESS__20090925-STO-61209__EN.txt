Textile and clothing labelling will be looked at by MEPs this autumn Â©Belga The level of regulation of Europe's vast financial markets will be a crucial issue on Parliament's agenda this autumn. Other key issues are proposals to make new buildings energy neutral within a decade and a scheme to label tyres to show how fuel efficient they are. These are just some of the economic and employment proposals coming before Parliament in the last few months of 2009.
Hedge funds facing "supervision"?
Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee members will pour over a package of measures designed to regulate Europe's financial markets. The " Financial Supervision Package" will cover hedge funds and other investment products, blamed by many for the economic crisis.
New buildings - carbon neutral by 2018 some people hope
Energy efficiency for both buildings and tyres will be the focus of debate this autumn by the Industry Committee, as MEPs work towards a final agreement that all new and renovated buildings consume only as much energy as they can produce themselves, from 2018. They will also consider a labelling system for tyre efficiency. To improve fuel-efficiency, tyres will be rated from a healthy A to a polluting G class. The label will also rate the tyre's wet grip and noise performance.
The telecoms package with proposals for clearer contracts for consumers, privacy protection and investment in new communications infrastructure will probably to through the Industry and Internal Market Committee in November and the full Parliament in December.
Late payments
MEPs on the Internal Market Committee will also turn the spotlight on textiles and what information should be given to consumers when buying clothes.
They will also start looking at new rules to ensure that the public sector and businesses pay their bills to other businesses on time, as late payments often cause problems.
Lorry drivers - working time limits?
The Employment Committee will look at how long lorry drivers can spend behind the wheel on 29 September and the full Parliament will discuss the issue in October.
MEPs will also consider measures to help small business access finance (micro-finance).
Finally, in the run up to the Copenhagen climate change conference in December, MEPs will debate the issues. An EP delegation will attend the conference.
