Ukraine's Speaker Arseniy Yatsenyuk
Ukraine may not be ready to apply for member of the European Union, but it does expect support from MEPs when the time comes. That was the message Ukraine's speaker Arseniy Yatsenyuk delivered to us in a brief interview on Tuesday, ahead of a meeting of the EU-Ukraine Parliamentary Cooperation Committee. The young politician - just 33 - has already served as Ukraine's Foreign Minister. He became speaker last December.
During her visit to Parliament, Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said that European integration is the first priority for Ukraine. How do you “sell” Europe to the voters?
In Ukraine, we have an enormous amount of discrepancies in society, for example on the question of whether to join NATO or the language issue (the opposition is pushing for a referendum on granting Russian official status as a national language, in addition to Ukrainian). But regarding European aspirations, no difference at all exists. More than 60% of the Ukrainian people are Europe oriented, so there is no division about this in our society.
Right now the main target for the government and the politicians should therefore be to bring Ukraine closer to the European Union. We do not ask for membership yet, it is clear this is a long and complicated process. But let's be more cooperative with the EU; let's find political associations and economic integration.
The opposition is currently employing blocking tactics in the Ukrainian parliament. Is forward movement possible in such an atmosphere?
This is how democracy works. It takes time to get political maturity. These temporal turbulences will be overcome. The opposition will not be a physical but an intellectual one. We will tackle it.
What do you expect from this visit and from cooperation with the European Parliament in general?
The Treaty of Lisbon will give increased powers to the European Parliament. I strongly believe the EP will give strong support to Ukrainian EU aspirations. It will I think also be very active in terms of approval of enhanced agreements with the Ukraine such as for visa facilitation agreements, on which there is already a consent with the EP. A free trade area between the EU and Ukraine is also at stake.
