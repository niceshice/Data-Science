Strict rules on hazardous chemical substances, targets for re-use and recycling of waste, protecting groundwater, collection rates for batteries and accumulators are some of the environmental topics on which the European Parliament adopted EU legislation in this legislature. MEPs also pushed for tighter control of pesticides.

REACH: New EU chemicals legislation
The chemicals regulation, known as REACH, is meant to protect public health and the environment without threatening European competitiveness. It obliges producers to register all chemical substances produced or imported above 1 tonne per year. Registration affects about 30,000 substances. For more hazardous substances, producers have to submit a plan to replace them with safer alternatives or, if no alternative exists, a research plan aimed at finding one. Promotion of alternatives to animal testing of chemicals was an issue of prime concern to MEPs.
Regulation adopted by EP: 13.12.2006
Applicable progressively from: 1.06.2007 Parliament adopts REACH - new EU chemicals legislation and new chemicals agency
Safety first for pesticides
A new regulation on pesticides adopted by Parliament will phase out the use of certain highly toxic chemicals in the manufacture of these products. O ther risky substances will have to be replaced with safer alternatives. However, m anufacturers will gain speedier approval for new pesticides that meet the safety rules. A directive adopted at the same time will reduce the amount of pesticides used, by prohibiting most aerial crop spraying with pesticides as well as the use of these products near parks and playgrounds and in buffer zones around rivers and lakes.
Directive and regulation adopted by EP: 13.1.2009 (2nd reading agreement with Council)
Date of directive transposition: about beginning 2011 (24 months following entry into force, not yet published)
Regulation fully applicable: 18 months following entry into force European Parliament votes at first reading on pesticides package MEPs approve pesticides legislation Background note on pesticides
New EU waste legislation with binding 2020 targets
The EU will have new waste legislation which includes targets for re-use and recycling of waste to be attained by 2020. The directive sets out rules on recycling and waste prevention. Recycling targets by 2020 are 50% for paper, metal and glass from households and 70% for non-hazardous construction and demolition waste. Only the most energy efficient incinerators can be classified as ‘recovery’ operations.
Directive adopted by EP: 17.06.2008
Deadline for transposition: end December 2010 (24 months from entry into force) MEPs give green light for new EU waste legislation with binding 2020 targets
New schemes for recycling batteries
The European Parliament approved a directive setting up schemes for collecting spent portable batteries and accumulators throughout Europe by 2008. Minimum collection rates to be reached by all Member States are 25% by 2012 and 45 % by 2016. Collected batteries will be recycled. Strict limits to the content of cadmium and mercury in batteries have also been fixed. The UK recycles about 2% of domestic batteries at the moment.
Directive adopted by EP: 4.07.2006 Batteries to be collected and recycled, nature protected
EU criminal law to protect the environment
Criminal sanctions will be employed to punish all severe offences committed against EU environmental legislation. Member States can apply criminal measures to punish any illegal behaviour likely seriously to injure people or damage air, soil, waters, plants and animals, when committed intentionally or with serious negligence.
Directive adopted by EP: 21.05.2008
Deadline for transposition: end December 2010 (24 months after entry into force) EU criminal law to protect the environment
Improved standards to protect groundwater against pollution and deterioration
Rules to protect groundwater from pollution have been in place at European level since 1980. A new directive sets out criteria for assessing chemical levels in groundwater and lays down measures to prevent hazardous substances include cyanide, arsenic, biocides and phytopharmaceutical substances from entering groundwater.
Directive adopted by EP: 12.12.2006
Deadline for transposition: 16.01.2009 Cleaner groundwater on the way - conciliation approved
Water pollutants to be more strictly controlled
MEPs adopted a new directive aimed at reducing or ending use of 33 pollutants - mainly pesticides and heavy metals - likely to be found in rivers, lakes and coastal waters, depending on the level of risk involved. By 2018 Member States will have to cease or phase out emissions, discharges and losses of hazardous substances. This is the final piece in the jigsaw of legislation under the Water Framework Directive.
Directive adopted by EP: 17.06.2008
Date of transposition: 18 months following entry into force (1st reading agreement reached, not yet published, Council formally adopted 18 September 2008) Water pollutants to be more strictly controlled as MEPs adopt legislation
