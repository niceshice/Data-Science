"Wealth inequalities and severe poverty are matters of growing concern across the Union", says the European Parliament backing a first-reading compromise negotiated with the Council beforehand which designates 2010 as the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. The EU will provide €17 million for events, information campaigns and studies. 78 million EU citizens live at risk of poverty, 19 million of them are children, stresses the co-decision report.
The report drafted by Marie PANAYOTOPOULOS-CASSIOTOU (EPP-ED, EL) was adopted with 635 votes in favour 29 against and 10 abstentions. In amending the priorities for the European Year, MEPs therefore want initiatives to focus on fighting child poverty and the intergenerational transmission of poverty. Special attention should also be paid to large families, single parents, families caring for a dependent person, and children in institutions.
Budget: Highest amount ever granted to a European Year
The EU will provide €17 million for events, information campaigns and studies in the course of the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion - the highest amount ever granted to a European Year. Actions on a European scale can receive benefits of up to 80%, whereas actions at local, regional or national level can be co-financed up to 50% from EU funds.
The events should inter alia address in-work poverty, homelessness as well as the needs of people with disabilities and their families. Initiatives should aim at facilitating access to culture and leisure opportunities and at overcoming discrimination of immigrants and ethnic minorities, stresses the text.
Support less-favoured regions
The compromise text equally says that more support is needed for less-favoured regions, for areas with permanent structural disadvantages, for outermost regions, for certain islands and island Member States and for areas that have been affected by recent deindustrialisation or industrial conversion.
The compromise carried over the Employment Committee's suggestion to promote studies on the relation between severe poverty and fundamental rights.
Use synergies with UN International Day for the Eradication of Poverty
The European Year should make use of the synergies arising from the activities organised for the UN International Day for the Eradication of Poverty on 17 October, says the text.
