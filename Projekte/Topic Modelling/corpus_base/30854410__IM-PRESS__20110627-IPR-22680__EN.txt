MEPs will debate the outcome of last week's EU summit with European Council President Herman Van Rompuy at a meeting of group leaders open to all MEPs on Tuesday from 13.30h to 15.00h in the plenary chamber. President Barroso will also take part in this meeting.
The leaders of Parliament's political groups, or their representatives, will take the floor after the statements by the European Council and the European Commission. After that initial round, individual MEPs will be allowed to put questions to Mr Von Rompuy and Mr Barroso on a "catch-the-eye" basis.
The meeting will be web-streamed on EP Live and can also be followed on EBS+ (see links below).
