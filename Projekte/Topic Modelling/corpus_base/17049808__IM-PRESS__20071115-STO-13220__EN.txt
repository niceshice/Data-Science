Kosovo Albanians vote in 17 November
As negotiations over the future of Kosovo move into a delicate phase, the UN-administered province held elections for members of the Kosovo Assembly. The 17 November poll was boycotted by the minority Serbs in Kosovo. MEPs were among a team of observers at the elections. They report that the election met international standards but described the turnout among Albanian Kosovars (who are 90% of the population) as "alarmingly low". December sees a deadline for negotiations over the province.
In total across the province 1.5 million people were entitled to vote. The December deadline for negotiations is between representatives of Serbia and the ethnic-Albanian Kosovars. Belgrade considers these elections as a step towards independence, and asked the Serbs (around 100.000-120.000) living in Kosovo to boycott the elections.
The team of MEPs was led by German Christian Democrat Doris Pack. After observing polling stations and talking to officials and voters she declared that "the election met all the international standards". The only problem was that "the Serbs were not allowed to go and even refused to give public space for polling stations in the regions where they are the majority". Ms Pack also said that some of the polling stations "were in a very poor state".
However, the main issue for the MEPs was the "alarmingly low" turnout. Ms Pack put this down to the daily struggle people face "raising their families and finding jobs". She also highlighted corruption which she described "as a cancer in the region". The unsettled statue of Kosovo may also have deterred voters, she said.
Turnout 40-45% of electorate
Inititial results put Hashim Thaci's Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) first with 34% of the vote, ahead of President Fatmir Sejdiu's Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) on 22%. Turnout was put at between 40% to 45% of those eligible. Both parties are striving to get as a many of the 100 seats available as possible in the Kosovo Assembly.
The remaining 20 seats are reserved for members of the minorities (Serb and non-Albanian), 10 for Serbs and 10 for the other minority communities. The final results will be declared by the end of November. MEPs on the delegation urged all parties and political leaders to respect the results of the elections.
Close to a final settlement of the province’s status?
Ms Pack declares herself "optimistic about a settlement in Kosovo", although she regrets that "many people have the false belief that on 10 December everything will be decided in one sense or the other". However, she feels confident that "at least after the Presidential election in Serbia next January there should be a solution as regards the final status".
Ms Pack sees the plan drawn up by UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari as the "only way" forward. This all but gives the Albanian Kosovars the independence they crave but with certain caveats. The European Parliament backed the plan in March this year. She noted that the EU would have to stay united and involved in the region long into the future.
The other MEPs in the delegation were Ryszard Czarnecki (UEN), Goran Färm (PES), Gisela Kallenbach (Greens/EFA), Hannes Swoboda (PES), and Csaba Tabajdi (PES). They were among the roughly 150 short-term observers under the umbrella of the Council of Europe.
