2009-11-17 - 12:24
Parliament's LUX prize is awarded annually to help European films reach a wider audience through help with sub-titles and distribution. The annual LUX film prize was awarded this year to a French-made production which looked at the experiences of a Kurdish immigrant trying to reach Britain by swimming the English channel. Unusually the film also deals with the unlikely friendship the protagonist strikes up with a swimming teacher.
The other contenders this year were "Sturm" and "Eastern Plays", films which looked at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunals and Neo-Nazism respectively.
This feature includes interviews with winning director Philippe Lioret as well as Kamen Kalev who directed the Bulgarian film "Eastern Plays" and "Sturm" director Hans Christian Schmid. It also contains some background on the prize as a whole.
Raising "relevant" questions
Prior to awarding the prize on Wednesday 25 November EP President Jerzy Buzek said that "the LUX prize is a young and forward-looking initiative. We want the medium of film to spark debate on subjects that attract public attention in the EU Members, and give rise to questions that can be of relevance to us all, questions that are also relevant to this Parliament".
Accepting the award Philippe Lioret said, "the impact the film had on French society made me change. We started as filmmakers and then turned into citizens".
The winner was chosen by MEPs who had watched all three films.
23 languages, 27 prints
The €87,000 prize will finance the subtitling of the winning film in the 23 official EU languages and the production of a 35 mm print per EU country or a contribution to the DVD release. The hope is that it will make the film more accessible to viewers throughout the Union.

Winning LUX prize film maker Philippe Lioret interviewed
Director Philippe Lioret hopes his film will move forward the debate on immigration both in his native France but also in Europe. Speaking to us after receiving the LUX prize for his film "Welcome", French director Philippe Lioret was keen to highlight how the three shortlisted films dealt with immigration to some degree. In this interview Mr Lioret is sharply critical of a current French law that penalises those who help immigrants. He describes his film about "thwarted love and the "absurdity of the world".
What does the LUX prize mean for you? One and a half kilos of extra luggage! It is truly an honour because I know where it comes from, I know the work that has been done by everyone here on the promotion of European film, which delights me and surprises me a little. That the three shortlisted films talk about respect and immigration reassures me a little. Policies began to disappoint me at a national level but at European level they generally comfort me. Your film "Welcome" has launched a debate in France. Do you think this debate could spread to Europe more generally? Yes, I hope so, because in fact the film is about, among other things, a French law which says that to aid a person who is illegal is punishable by 5 years in prison and a €30,000 fine. But this French law is in opposition to an EU directive. It might therefore be time to get our act together and for Europe to move forward in harmonising immigration laws. What will be your next film?
We are currently starting with Emmanuel Courcol a film on a book inspired by Emmanuel Carrère called "other lives than mine," which is a story of fatherhood, love around the indebtedness. For those who have not yet seen "Welcome", could you describe in one sentence?
It is two stories of thwarted love that come up against the absurdity of the world. Trailer and synopsis of the film More photos on Flickr
Philippe Boëffard , Producer of "Welcome"
Philippe Boëffard , Associate Producer of "Welcome" (Directed by Philippe Lioret) The nomination for the LUX prize means to me ...proud of being selected, so that the film can be shown to broader audience.
I made this film because ...of the story.
What surprised me most about the reactions to my film so far was .....no surprises, because people were touched by the film, many were crying.
Real inspiration comes to me from ....I am just the producer, the author has inspiration.
The best film ever made is ... "The deer hunter" by Michael Cimino (1978).
Apart from funding what could help the development of the European Cinema is ....To ease and help the distribution and the use of films in European countries.
The main differences between the European and Hollywood cinema in my opinion are ...We are free, free of choices, more alternative.
The person in the world of cinema I most admire is ...My partner (Christophe Rossignon - producer of "Welcome").

Kamen Kalev director of "Eastern Plays"
Kamen Kalev, director of "Eastern Plays" What the nomination for the LUX prize means to me ....an opportunity for my film to get to a foreign film audience, a chance for a wider distribution of the film.
I made this film because ...its time has come
What surprised me most about the reaction to my film so far was .....the fact that despite the different cultures people are touched by the film and the main character.
My next film will be ...again an attempt to speak about freedom - the internal, personal freedom.
Real inspiration comes to me from ... many things, from life in general.
Apart from funding what could help the development of European Cinema is ....distribution. Each country has to support European authored films, to provide a location for them to be shown.
The main differences between the European and Hollywood cinema in my opinion are .....that European cinema poses open questions, there is a clash of elements that enable people to think. While in American movies, if we are generalizing, there is no need to seek something, they work more on emotional level, not so much on an intellectual level.
The best film ever made is… there are many. One of the most important films for me is "Tales of Ordinary Madness" by Marco Ferreri.
The person in the world of cinema I most admire is ...There are many, but some of them are Fatih Akin (2007 LUX winner), Alejandro González Iñárritus and Andrea Arnold.

Hans Christian Schmid, director of "Sturm"
Hans Christian Schmid, director of "Sturm" The nomination for the LUX prize means ...an honour for me as the film has been selected with two others by a jury from a number of great films.
I made this film because ...I had the strong wish to see an unusual hero like Hannah confronted with the question of integrity.
What surprised me most about reactions to my film so far is .....the Bosnian premiere at the festival in Sarajevo. It was overwhelming to present the film at an open air theatre in the middle of the city that was under siege for four years.
My next film will be ....something completely different.
Real inspiration comes to me from ...everything that surrounds me. People I talk to, things I observe, thoughts I have.
Apart from funding what could help the development of the European Cinema is.... awareness that we are Europeans and curiosity to see the stories our neighbours have to tell on the screen.
The main differences between the European and Hollywood cinema in my opinion are ...I think we should not generalise. Some of my favourite films were made in Hollywood, even if that was some decades ago. What I think is definitely great about European cinema is its diversity and the important role that art house films play.
The best film ever made is ....I don't believe in a "best film ever". In different times of my life I found different films best films.
The person in the world of cinema I most admire is... There are many different persons that have influenced me and still do - but no single one. If I need to name one then maybe Cassavetes.
