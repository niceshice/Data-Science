Sun setting over a darkened landscape Climate change and energy security are high on the European agenda. Fluctuating oil prices, uncertain energy supplies and fears of global warming have reinforced the fact that secure and safe supplies of energy can no longer be taken for granted. This spring MEPs backed 3 proposals aimed at making energy use more efficiently.
In December 2008 the European-Parliament gave its backing to the EU’s Climate Package after nearly one year of legislative work. The aim of the package is to ensure that the EU will achieve its ambitious objectives of cutting greenhouse-gas emissions and boosting renewables (20% energy saving, 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and 20% share of renewables in overall EU energy consumption by 2020).
The objective of The Energy Efficiency Package is to mobilise EU policy makers and market actors to make buildings, appliances, means of transport and energy systems more energy efficient in order to achieve the ambitious energy targets set for 2020.
Read on to find out more.
The three energy saving measures are:
A regulation on Tyre Labelling to promote fuel efficiency
An update of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive
Changes to the Energy Labelling Directive
Parliament has approved the draft regulation on tyre labelling (25 November 2009), the energy performance of buildings directive (18 May 2010) and the Energy Labelling Directive (19 May 2010).

MEPs back efficient road tyres to cut fuel bills and CO2 emissions
Tyres can affect the fuel consumption of a car or lorry by 25% ©Belga If the tyres on your car are under inflated or of poor quality then you may be filling up with fuel more often than you should be. With tyres making up a quarter of the fuel consumption of a vehicle good tyres are vital to reducing fuel and CO2 emissions. New rules backed by MEPs call for a tyre-labelling system to allow drivers to see how fuel efficient tyres are.
From November 2012 all new tyres on sale in Europe will be classified and labelled for fuel efficiency, wet grip and noise performance. The labelling will be similar to that required for household appliances and potential buyers will be able to compare tyre characteristics before making a purchase.
The Belgian MEP who drafted the report, Ivo Belet, believes the fuel savings could equal taking 1.3 million cars off the roads (see section 4 for our interview with him).
With a quarter of all CO2 emissions in the European Union coming from road transport, Members believe the urgency of reducing this is compelling. Just having a perfectly good set of tyres on a vehicle at the wrong pressure can cause an increase in fuel consumption. When this is multiplied across millions of cars the effects can be enormous.
Noise levels and wet grip also labelled
Like the European energy label, the tyre label will use classes ranging from best-performance (green “A” class) to worst (red “G” class). As well as fuel efficiency labels information about tyres would also have to show levels of wet grip and rolling resistance. There would also be a "low noise mark" showing a tyre with earmuffs if it is below 68 decibels (C1), 69 decibels (C2 tyres) or 70 decibels (C3 tyres).
The reason the Committee and Ivo Belet of the centre-right EPP-ED group were so keen on labelling is that 78% of all tyres sold in Europe are replacements for older ones and they want drivers to be informed of their choices.
Mr Belet is confident it will cause no hassle to drivers: "Opting for eco-friendly tyres will become very straightforward thanks to a European-wide consumer-friendly and easy to read labelling system." He went on to tell us the measure has "substantial environmental and consumer benefits".
The Parliament approved the draft regulation on Wednesday 25 November 2009.

Energy MEPs back more energy efficient buildings
A thermogram showing heat and energy use in buildings. The hotter parts show where heat is lost ©Belga Unless you are lucky enough to be sitting in a park with a laptop, if you are reading this you are probably in one of the 160 million buildings in the European Union. In total they account for 40% of Europe's energy use and the room for savings is extensive. MEPs on the Energy Committee recently backed proposals that should see all buildings constructed after 2018 having to produce their own energy. The plans relate to proposed changes to the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive.
On Tuesday 18 May, MEPs approved the changes to Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. This will help consumers to cut their energy bills and the EU as a whole to hit its climate targets set for 2020. Member States will have to alter their building codes so that all new buildings constructed from the end of 2020 meet high energy-saving standards. Existing buildings will have to be upgraded where possible.
Higher standards for new buildings
All buildings put up from the end of 2020 must have high energy-saving standards and, to a large extent, use renewable energy. Public authorities' building projects are to lead the way two years earlier. Part of the funding for these changes will come from the EU budget.
Upgrading of existing buildings
Where feasible the energy performance of existing buildings will have to be improved through major renovations. When renovating, owners will be encouraged to install "smart meters" and replace heating, hot-water plumbing and air-conditioning systems with high-efficiency alternatives such as heat pumps. Regular inspections of boilers and air conditioning systems will be required.
The Parliament approved the directive on Tuesday 18 May 2010. The EP's report was drafted by Romanian Socialist MEP Silvia-Adriana Ţicău.

MEPs back shake up of energy labelling directive
MEPs debated extending energy labelling to industrial products ©Belga Any advertisement promoting technical specifications of household goods such as fridges, washing machines or ovens should indicate the product's energy consumption, said the European Parliament as it amended the Energy Labelling Directive on Wednesday 19 May.
Manufacturers are currently obliged to indicate the annual energy consumption irrespective of whether the product performs well (dark green “A” class) or poorly (red “G” class) on this measure.
Under the new legislation, the layout of the energy efficiency label will allow for up to three new energy classes, to reflect technological progress, but will still limit the total number of classes to seven. (ex. given in press release) The energy classes and the specific products that must be labelled will be determined by a Commission working group.
Advertisement to include labelling The agreement between Parliament and Council states, that any advert mentioning the energy consumption or price of a specific model of household appliance will have to show the product's energy class. Advertising with additional information should help consumers make a choice based on the energy savings potential of products to reduce their energy bill in the long run. This mandatory reference was agreed for the first time, taking on board Parliament's first reading position.
Public Procurement
Parliament wants public authorities to take a lead and use their procurement procedures to always select energy efficient products. In addition, national authorities can encourage consumers and industry to make energy efficient choices by setting specific incentives.
The Parliament approved the directive on Wednesday 19 May. The EP's report was drafted by Anni Podimata (S&D, GR) Once published in the EU Official Journal, Member States will have one year to adapt their national laws to the new rules on energy labelling. Adopted text 19 May 2010 Press release
Ivo Belet interview on energy efficient tyres
Making the choice easier? Eco label for tyres coming. ©Belga What impact will the new rules on fuel efficient tyres have on the EU´s ambitions to reduce climate change?
Choosing better-quality tyres will contribute a lot to reaching our CO2 targets. Road transport is responsible for 25% of all CO2 emissions in Europe. Tyres can play an important role in reducing CO2 emissions because they are responsible for 20-30% of the total energy use of vehicles. For passenger cars, more energy efficient tires can save up to 10% on fuel costs.
The European car industry has been struggling to survive the financial crisis. Is it really the time to impose additional obligations on the car parts industry?
The new system is simple and clear. It provides the industry with no significant additional costs. We believe that the label will be picked up early by quality manufacturers; it works in their case as a recommendation.
How will the new rules affect the everyday lives of ordinary European citizens in practical terms?
The replacement of used tyres is good for 78% of tyres sold in Europe. Each of us thus has the possibility and responsibility to choose economical tyres. These are good for the environment and for your wallet.
