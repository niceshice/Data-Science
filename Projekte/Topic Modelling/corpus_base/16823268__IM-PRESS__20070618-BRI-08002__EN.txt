Briefing - 9-12 July 2007 - Strasbourg
2007-07-04 - 18:29
Selected highlights include:
The key debate of the July Strasbourg plenary is the presentation of the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency to MEPs by Portuguese Prime Minister José Sócrates on Wednesday at 9am. Commission President and compatriot José Manuel Barroso will respond. The House will also debate and vote on the final stage of the postal services liberalisation. Parliament will hear from ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet on the activities of the ECB in 2006 and from Jean-Claude Juncker Chairman on the Eurogroup on prospects for the euro area. Parliament will also tackle the transparency of airplane tickets with a call for full disclosure of taxes, charges and fees on the initial ticket price. MEPs will also turn their attention to measuring devices containing mercury including the issue of the use of mercury in barometers.
Monday 9 July 2007
EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering will make a statement at 5pm at the opening of the plenary session on the recent attempted terrorist attacks in London and Glasgow and on the seven Spanish tourists and two Yemeni nationals killed in Yemen when a bomber drove an explosives-laden car into a tourist convoy.
The session opens with a joint debate on food additives . Parliament will be asked to approve with amendment a set of four regulations aimed at updating procedures for authorising food additives, flavourings and enzymes.
The House will debate an own-initiative report in the internal gas and electricity market. The internal energy market should allow "consumer choice of supplier in an open competitive environment", and also be able to guarantee security of supply given that "it is essential for every citizen of the [EU] to have affordable access to energy", according to a report by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.
Later on Monday evening, the House will debate the issue of measuring devices containing mercury . A key issue for the UK, Parliament will be asked to approve a ban on non-electrical mercury thermometers and other mercury instruments for general sale to the public when it votes on a second-reading recommendation by the Environment Committee. The committee unanimously approved the Council's common position without amendment, thereby dropping the EP's earlier call for an open-ended derogation for barometer manufacturers and accepting Council's proposal for a two-year exemption instead.
On Monday evening, the House will debate the latest developments on passenger name records (PNR) and the EU-US agreement. MEPs will vote on a resolution on Tuesday.
The House will be asked to approve a conciliation agreement on Rome II. After almost four years of negotiations, Parliament and Council representatives struck a deal on the regulation on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations, known as Rome II. The Conciliation Committee agreed to introduce rules on road traffic accidents and environmental damages and delete the controversial provision on defamation by media. Diana WALLIS (ALDE, UK) is the Parliament's rapporteur.
Tuesday 10 July 2007
MEPs will debate and vote on a first reading report on postal services . Remaining postal service monopolies in EU Member States should expire by 31 December 2010, two years later than the 1 January 2009 deadline proposed by the European Commission, according to a report being put forward by the Transport Committee. Full market opening should mean that national operators will no longer have a monopoly on mail below the maximum weight of 50 grams, known as the "reserved area". The vote will take place on Wednesday 11 July.
The House will also debate air transport services. In order to avoid the current practice of some air carriers, i.e. publishing air fares without any taxes and charges, the Transport Committee says that passengers should be provided with a full breakdown of any taxes, fees and charges added to the ticket price. Air passengers must be treated like other consumers and thus have a right on clear and full information of the price they finally should pay, the Committee argues.
Wednesday 11 July 2007
The centre-piece of the July Strasbourg plenary is the presentation of the Portuguese EU Presidency programme . Portugal took over the presidency of the European Union from Germany on 1 July. At 9am, on Wednesday 11 July in Strasbourg the Portuguese Prime Minister, José Sócrates , will discuss with MEPs the EU's policy priorities for the next six months. These will include finalising the reform treaty, relaunching the Lisbon economic agenda and a fresh focus on Africa, the Mediterranean and Brazil. Mr Sócrates' compatriot, Commission President José Manuel Barroso, will take part in the debate .
Before formally launching an Intergovernmental Conference (IGC), the European Parliament must be consulted. The European Parliament will give its opinion through a vote on a report on the issue.
The House will also vote on the European Parliament's calendar for 2008 . The dates for Brussels and Strasbourg plenary sessions will be decided.
MEPs will also vote on Wednesday on a resolution on the situation in Darfur . A delegation of five MEPs from the EP Development Committee are in Darfur from 30 June to 6 July, where they visit camps of displaced people in Darfur as well as camps of Sudanese refugees in eastern Chad. The delegation is led by Josep BORRELL (PES, ES), chair of the Development Committee and former EP President. A press conference will take place in Strasbourg on Tuesday, 10 July at 11.30am to report on the findings.
On economic and monetary affairs, MEPs will debate the policies of the European Central Bank and the Eurogroup – and the prospects for the euro area with ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, Eurogroup chair and Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker and Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia . They will then vote on two reports from the Economics Committee on the ECB and the euro area. The report on the activities of the European Central Bank is drafted by Gay Mitchell (EPP-ED, IE).
Wednesday afternoon is dedicated to foreign affairs with debates on Palestine, Pakistan, Kosovo and FYROM.
On Palestine , MEPs will vote on a resolution given the heightened tension in the territories.
MEPs will also vote on a resolution on the situation in Pakistan after hearing statements from the Council and the Commission.
On Kosovo , on 29 March, Parliament gave its full support to the Ahtisaari proposal for a status settlement, stating that "sovereignty supervised by the international community is the best option" for securing the objectives of a peaceful, self-sustaining Kosovo.
On FYROM, progress towards EU membership by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , including reforms and recent agreements between the government and opposition on the use of Albanian in public institutions and the protection of ethnic minorities in decision-making, is welcomed in a Foreign Affairs Committee report.
Thursday 12 July 2007
On Thursday, in an own-initiative report on Ukraine , the Foreign Affairs Committee calls on Ukraine's politicians to resolve the current crisis peacefully, unravel political from economic powers, weed out corruption and ensure an independent judiciary, as well as further integrating Ukraine's energy markets with those of the European Union.
As is usual, the session ends with three debates and votes on human rights around the world. On this occasion, the topics are: the humanitarian situation of Iraqi refugees, human rights violations in Transnistria (Moldova) and human rights in Vietnam.
A pre-session briefing will be held at the European Parliament in Brussels at 11am on Friday 5 July 2007 - PHS 0A50 A last minute pre-session press briefing will be held in Strasbourg on Monday 9 July 2007 at 4.30pm - Room LOW N-1/201.

EU presidency: Portugal takes up the baton
2007-07-04 - 18:29
Portugal took over the presidency of the European Union from Germany on 1 July. On Wednesday 11 July in Strasbourg the Portuguese prime minister, José Sócrates, will discuss with MEPs the EU's policy priorities for the next six months. These will include finalising the reform treaty, relaunching the Lisbon economic agenda and a fresh focus on Africa, the Mediterranean and Brazil. Mr Sócrates' compatriot, Commission President José Manuel Barroso, will take part in the debate. Future of the Union
The Portuguese presidency will convene an Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) starting on 23-24 July, with a mandate to draft the future European Treaty on the basis of the agreement reached between EU governments at the Brussels summit in June. Mr Sócrates has said the aim will be for the Treaty to be adopted at the informal EU summit in Lisbon in October. Cyprus and Malta are due to join the eurozone in December.
Internal policies
The Lisbon Agenda, designed to make the EU more economically dynamic and competitive, was launched under the last Portuguese presidency in 2000. The current presidency will relaunch the strategy, focusing on the internal market in financial services, postal services, the fight against tax fraud as well as the definition of a European Maritime Policy and the negotiation of the Third Maritime Safety Package. In agriculture, reform of the wine sector is a key issue. Another priority is the implementation of an EU strategy on counter-terrorism, especially as regards "bio-preparation".
Europe and the world
A major summit between the European Union and Africa in Lisbon in December is due to endorse a joint EU-Africa strategy, the aims of which include closer political ties, ensuring that all the Millennium Development Goals are met in all African countries by 2015, involving non-state actors in development and addressing global challenges such as human rights, trade, disease and climate change.
Europe's relations with Brazil were expected to receive boost at the first EU-Brazil summit on 4 July in Lisbon. Relations with the Mediterranean will enjoy a higher profile, and the presidency will also continue preparing for the UN Bali Conference on climate change.
Continuity ensured by joint work programme
The 18-month work programme in force since January 2007, drawn up with Germany and Slovenia (which takes over in January 2008) and endorsed by the General Affairs and External Relations Council, forms the operational basis for the Portuguese presidency.

Conciliation agreement on Rome II - law on non-contractual obligations
2007-07-04 - 18:29
The House will be asked to approve a conciliation agreement on Rome II. After almost four years of negotiations, Parliament and Council representatives struck a deal on the regulation on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations, known as Rome II. The Conciliation Committee agreed to introduce rules on road traffic accidents and environmental damages and delete the controversial provision on defamation by media. Diana WALLIS (ALDE, UK) is the Parliament's rapporteur. The so-called "Rome II" Regulation aims to facilitate litigation between citizens from different European countries on matters such as traffic accidents, accidents caused by defective products and environmental damage by harmonising national legal provisions.
The regulation sets out the general rule that the law applicable to a non-contractual obligation arising out of a tort (roughly speaking, an action or inaction which causes damage or injury for which there can be recourse to civil law proceedings) is the law of the country in which the damage occurs, irrespective of the country in which the event giving rise to the damage took place. Nevertheless, for situations where the tort is manifestly more connected with another country, the regulation provides for specific rules to allow courts to treat individual cases in the most appropriate way. Finally, the involved parties are also free to agree on the law applicable to their circumstances, if the choice is demonstrated "with reasonable certainty".
Traffic accidents represent the majority of cross-border disputes involving EU citizens. Non-contractual obligations arising out of family relationships, matrimonial property issues and succession rights are excluded from the regulation.
After two readings by Parliament and Council under the co-decision procedure, the main points of disagreement remaining between MEPs and EU governments concerned violation of privacy, including defamation, road traffic accidents, the definitions of environmental damage and of unfair competition, and the review clause. All these points were settled at a formal conciliation meeting on 15 May, with the outcome being described as "historic" by Diana Wallis (ALDE, UK), who piloted the legislation through Parliament. "It is the first time Parliament has dealt with such an instrument in codecision. The first, but not the last", she said.
Road traffic accidents
At Parliament's insistence, the provisions on personal injuries and related compensation are, in the end, to be included in the regulation. This issue turned out to be particularly complex, due to the different practices followed in the Member States regarding the level of compensation awarded to victims of road traffic accidents.
According to the approved text, in a case of personal injury caused by a car accident where the victim is not in his or her home state, the court concerned should take into account the actual losses and costs incurred by the victim. Moreover, the Commission is asked to present, before the end of 2008, a study on all options for improving the position of cross-border victims, including insurance aspects and, if appropriate, a Green Paper.
Defamation by the media
At second reading, MEPs had approved an amendment to regulate the violation of privacy by print or audiovisual media. According to that text, the law applicable in case of defamation by media would have been the one of the country to which the publication or broadcasting service is principally directed or, if this is not apparent, the country in which editorial control is exercised. However, national governments strongly opposed the Parliament’s position and the Conciliation Committee agreed to leave this matter to be discussed in the future under the review clause.
Unfair competition and environmental damage
MEPs insisted and obtained a definition of environmental damage to be introduced in the Regulation. According to the approved article, "environmental damage" will cover any damage of natural resources, such as water, land or air, or any damage to a natural resource service, as well as to the diversity of living organisms. On unfair competition, Parliament successfully insisted on having a clear rule to ensure courts apply one single law and thus to avoid "forum-shopping". The agreed text says that, in case of restriction of competition, the applicable law is the law of the country where the market is, or is likely to be, affected.
The review clause
MEPs obtained two review clauses: a special review clause with a shorter timetable (by 2008) to address the issue of defamation and road traffic accident and a general one, whereby the Commission will present a study on the application of Rome II 4 years after its entry into force. This report will also provide a study on the extent to which national courts apply foreign law.
The agreement reached by the Conciliation Committee, made up of an equal number of representatives of Parliament and Council, has now to be endorsed by the two Institutions before entering into force. In both cases, at this third reading stage, no amendments can be tabled, the agreed text is either approved or rejected, in Parliament’s case by a simple majority. If approved, the Regulation will be applicable in all Member States 18 months after the date of adoption.

Intergovernmental Conference
Next step towards the reform treaty: Parliament to deliver opinion
2007-07-04 - 18:29
A major item this week in Strasbourg is Parliament's opinion on the convening of an intergovernmental conference (IGC) to draft the "reform treaty" following the agreement reached between the EU Member States at the June summit. Under Article 48 of the current treaty, the IGC cannot start work until Parliament has delivered an opinion. The matter will come before the Constitutional Affairs Committee on Monday and then for a final debate and vote before the plenary on Wednesday. Parliament's opinion is being drafted by the chair of the Constitutional Affairs Committee, Jo Leinen (PES, DE).
MEPs have already held two discussions on the summit deal, one at the Constitutional Affairs Committee on 25 June and the other in plenary on 27 June (see links below). On both those occasions, most MEPs broadly welcomed the agreement, albeit with reservations.
Article 48 of the current Treaty on forming an intergovernmental conference reads : "The government of any Member State or the Commission may submit to the Council proposals for the amendment of the Treaties on which the Union is founded.
If the Council, after consulting the European Parliament and, where appropriate, the Commission, delivers an opinion in favour of calling a conference of representatives of the governments of the Member States, the conference shall be convened by the President of the Council for the purpose of determining by common accord the amendments to be made to those Treaties. The European Central Bank shall also be consulted in the case of institutional changes in the monetary area. The amendments shall enter into force after being ratified by all the Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements."

Ban on sale of mercury measuring instruments
2007-07-04 - 18:29
Parliament will be asked to approve a ban on non-electrical mercury thermometers and other mercury instruments for general sale to the public when it votes on a second-reading recommendation by the Environment Committee. The committee approved the Council's common position without amendment, by 40 votes to 2 with 14 abstentions, thereby dropping the EP's earlier call for an open-ended derogation for barometer manufacturers and accepting Council's proposal for a two-year exemption instead. The draft directive prohibiting the sale on the EU market of these devices is part of a broad strategy on mercury, a metal which is highly toxic to humans, ecosystems and wildlife. Only last month Parliament adopted another report - on the export, import and storage or mercury - which is also part of the strategy.
Non-electrical devices not banned until now
Electrical measuring devices containing mercury are already covered by existing EU legislation (the RoHS directive). The main product group not yet dealt with by Community law was non-electrical or non-electronic measuring and control equipment, hence this latest directive.
The instruments to be covered by the ban are listed as "fever thermometers" and "other measuring devices intended for sale to the general public (e.g. manometers, barometers, sphygmomanometers, thermometers other than fever thermometers)".
Devices for consumer use are the prime target, for health and environmental reasons. There will be some exemptions for the healthcare sector. The ban in any case applies only to the sale of new devices. Existing instruments can still be repaired or bought and sold second-hand.
Antiques exempted but barometer makers must switch to non-mercury devices
Parliament - whose rapporteur is María Sornosa Martínez (PES, ES) - is highly supportive of the ban on the whole, although it suggested a number of improvements at first reading.
The Council accepted most of Parliament's first-reading amendments, including a demand that the Commission carry out a review of safer alternatives for mercury-containing sphygmomanometers (blood pressure measuring instruments) and other devices in healthcare and other professional and industrial uses.
Another Parliament amendment accepted by Council lays down that mercury measuring devices may be imported if they are more than 50 years old, since they are to be classified as antiques or cultural goods.
However, a further amendment calling for a complete exemption for traditional barometer manufacturers - which Parliament adopted after hearing that such producers constitute a valuable craft industry - was rejected by Council. The Environment Committee now proposes that Parliament agree instead to the two-year exemption proposed by the Council.
Dangers of mercury
Mercury pollution was once regarded as an acute, albeit local, problem but is now understood to be a diffuse, global and chronic phenomenon. Mercury can change in the environment into methylmercury, the most toxic form, exposure to which occurs mostly via diet. It concentrates particularly in the aquatic food chain, making populations with a high intake of fish and seafood especially vulnerable. Direct exposure to mercury via inhalation of vapour and absorption through the skin is also a health risk.
Around 80-90% of all mercury used in measuring devices is used in medical and other thermometers for household use. Many consumer products containing mercury will end up being landfilled, which may lead to slow but long term leaching. Mercury instruments pose a particular risk if they break in the home.
Safer non-mercury alternatives exist for virtually all the instruments covered by the ban. Most mercury measuring devices for consumer use (around two thirds) are imported into the EU, so these producers will be the hardest hit.
When does the ban take effect?
The legislation has to be enacted in national law no later than one year after the date the directive enters into force. It must take effect no later than 18 months after that point, or two years in the case of barometer manufacturers. Rapporteur María SORNOSA MARTÍNEZ PES ES A6-0218/2007 Environment and health: restrictions on the marketing of certain non-electrical measuring devices containing mercury (amend.

Free movement of services
Postal services should be opened up to competition by 2011, subject to strict conditions
2007-07-04 - 18:29
Remaining postal service monopolies in EU Member States should expire by 31 December 2010, two years later than the 1 January 2009 deadline proposed by the European Commission, according to a report being put forward by the Transport Committee. Full market opening should mean that national operators will no longer have a monopoly on mail below the maximum weight of 50 grams, known as the "reserved area". The two-year postponement was a compromise agreed in committee, backed by rapporteur Markus Ferber (EPP - ED), to get the proposal through. Some MEPs in the committee had argued that in parts of the EU, more time is needed to create a stable regulatory framework for ensuring that post continues to be delivered EU-wide at an affordable cost, and to enable postal operators to adapt to new market conditions.
MEPs in the committee nonetheless stress that the directive's implementation must remain subject to important conditions, including a "universal service" (full territorial coverage at an affordable cost) and rules on working conditions and collective bargaining.
Letters to be collected and delivered at least five days a week, for all EU citizens
Letters should go on being both delivered and collected at least once a day, five days a week, for every EU citizen, not just in Athens or London, but also in Crete or the Shetlands. This "universal service" (full territorial coverage) obligation should be retained, said the committee.
Funding universal service
If market players prove unable to provide such services profitably, then Member States may set up compensation funds, financed by service providers and/or user fees, to cover universal service costs. Alternatively, universal service providers could be compensated by the state. To ensure affordability, Member States may themselves decide upon the choice of financing mechanisms to be used.
No authorisation for "reserved area" monopolies to operate in liberalised markets abroad
To prevent any distortion of competition until markets are opened up to competition, the committee said that postal service providers from countries with a reserved area must not meanwhile be granted an authorisation to operate in countries, such as Sweden, Germany, Finland, the Netherlands and the UK, where the postal market has already been fully opened.
Some Member States have until 2013
New Member States and those with a particularly difficult topography or with numerous islands, the deadline for liberalising markets will be two years later, i.e. 31 December 2012, to allow extra time to find ways to a maintain universal service.
Collective bargaining and other conditions
The directive will not affect terms and conditions of employment, nor will it affect relations between social partners, including the right to strike and to take industrial action, said the committee.
MEPs in the committee also acknowledge Member States could impose conditions on the supply of postal services for non-economic reasons, such as ensuring the confidentiality of correspondence, the security of the network when transporting dangerous goods and complying with conditions of employment and social security schemes laid down by law and/or by collective agreement negotiated between national partners.
Background
The Postal Services Directive (97/67/EC), which guarantees the citizen EU-wide postal services, originally set a target of opening up postal markets to competition by 2009, but required the Commission to come forward with new legislation to confirm or modify this date in 2006. It is this further legislation which is now being considered by Parliament. Under the existing Directive, the scope of the "reserved area" has been reduced from mail under 350 grams at the outset, to 100 grams in 2002, and is now 50 grams.

Economic and monetary affairs
Trichet, Juncker and Almunia to debate ECB and euro with MEPs
2007-07-04 - 18:29
MEPs will debate the policies of the European Central Bank and the Eurogroup – and the prospects for the euro area with ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, Eurogroup chair and Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker and Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia. They will then vote on two reports from the Economics Committee on the ECB and the euro area. The two own-initiative reports are intended as Parliament’s response to the 2006 ECB Annual Report and the 2007 annual report on the euro area from the Commission.
European Central Bank should exercise caution on interest rates
In their report on the European Central Bank, drawn up by Gay Mitchell (EPP-ED, IE) in response to the ECB’s annual report for 2006, MEPs in the committee note that the economic recovery in the euro zone has become self sustaining, but emphasise that any further raising of interest rates should be undertaken with caution so as not to endanger growth.
They say it is crucial that wages increase in line with developments in productivity in order to allow for job creation in a non-inflationary environment. Fiscal consolidation, especially in good times, is key to achieving long term growth, they argue.
Exchange rates and house prices
The report expresses concern about the ongoing appreciation of the euro against most major currencies and calls on the Eurogroup, the Council and the ECB to exercise their competences in full, coordinating more closely their actions in the field of exchange rate policy.
Mr Mitchell’s report calls on the ECB to monitor closely developments on the real estate market which have potential consequences for the real economy.
ECB governance issues
The committee reiterates its support for the independence of the ECB and for its aim of maintaining price stability and protecting its anti-inflation credentials.
Regarding the ECB’s role in providing central bank services such as Target and the Target 2 Securities project, the committee recognises the value these can have in fostering financial market integration, but warns that the presentation of an appropriate governance structure for the Bank’s activities as an active market operator is overdue.
The report says that accountability and transparency would be improved if several candidates were evaluated by the Council when vacancies arise on the ECB Executive Board and if the chosen candidate were subject to a vote of approval in Parliament.
MEPs in the committee repeat their call for the Bank to publish summary minutes of Governing Council meetings, including the arguments in favour and against policy decisions and an indication of whether they were taken unanimously.
The report also repeats Parliament’s call the ECB to examine the reasons for the substantial increase in circulation of 500 euro notes with a view to identifying any attendant risks.
Report on the euro zone
In a report drawn up by Dariusz Rosati (PES, PL), in response to the Commission’s 2007 annual report on the euro area, the committee adopted a position coherent with that of the ECB report, since the issues were closely related. Here though the recommendations were mainly addressed to the Member States and the Eurogroup.
MEPs in the committee call on Member States to use the current economic upswing to reduce deficits and accumulate surpluses, as well as to improve the quality of public finance with more investment in education, vocational training research and innovation.
This report argues that the national legislators and regulators too should evaluate carefully developments in the real estate market, with asset price increases being a further reason for fiscal caution.
Wage moderation starts at the top...
Regarding wage developments, the committee argues for a fairer distribution of the fruits of growth, calling on shareholders and corporate executives to maintain a responsible policy of remuneration packages at top executive levels, “which tend to grow disproportionately compared to ordinary salary levels and thus give the wrong signals and discourage support for a responsible wage policy”.
MEPs in the committee regret that the definition of price stability used for the assessment of convergence criteria is not always in conformity with the price stability criterion adopted by the ECB in its monetary policy. They call for further analysis and policy debate on the application of the convergence criteria to prospective new members of the euro area.
The committee also argues that in the interests of stronger economic coordination, the Eurogroup should move to a more formal institutional framework, with proper infrastructure.

Excise duty on alcohol: minimum levels should rise by 4.5 per cent
2007-07-04 - 18:29
MEPs will vote on whether to support a rise in the EU-wide minimum levels of excise duty on alcoholic drinks in line with inflation since the EU enlargement of 2004 - that is by 4.5 per cent. This is the proposal of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, and it is in line with a compromise which - Taxation Commissioner Laszlo Kovacs told the committee last week - has a good chance of obtaining the unanimous support of Member States it needs to be adopted.
The vote in committee in June was the second time the committee has considered the issue. In its vote in April, the Committee narrowly backed its rapporteur, Astrid Lulling (EPP-ED, LU), in proposing to scrap the minimum rates altogether. When the report came to the May plenary session, however, a series of very close votes left the situation unclear, and MEPs voted to reject the report and return the issue to the Economics Committee.
This time the vote was again very close, with a majority of two votes on many of the key amendments. In the end though, MEPs in the committee backed the proposal to increase the minimum levels of duty by 4.5 per cent, reflecting price rises since the May 2004 enlargement. The original Commission proposal had been for a much larger increase, in line with inflation since 1992 when the minimum levels were first introduced, but the Commission is now backing the lower increase with the aim of obtaining unanimity in Council.
Speaking to the committee on Tuesday evening, Commissioner Kovacs said, "The ECOFIN Council could easily reach unanimous agreement on this proposal. Not even the Czech Republic is now against." (The Czech government had previously opposed the plan). He also indicated that another request of MEPs, to study whether setting maximum and minimum rates or encouraging tax competition would be the best way to achieve convergence in rates of duty, would be accommodated in a study the Commission was already planning.
At the plenary session in Strasbourg, Parliament will vote without debate on the amendments now adopted by the committee. No further amendments will be admissible at this stage (Rule 53.2 of the Rules of Procedure).

Economic and monetary affairs
Future developments in financial services
2007-07-04 - 18:29
MEPs will debate a wide-ranging report from the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee on the future of EU financial services policy. The committee says the EU capital market “is leading the world not least because of the quality and solidity of its financial regulation” but also set out a series of areas where there is room for improvement, and highlights some potential concerns for the future. Drawn up by Ieke van den Burg (PES, NL), the own-initiative report is a response to a White Paper from the Commission. The following is just a selection of the points made by the committee.
Market concentration
Noting a high market consolidation in the top segment of financial service provided to large listed companies, “notably by audit firms, credit rating agencies and investment banks”, the report urges the Commission and national competition authorities carefully to apply competition rules to these players and be “vigilant to any risk of unlawful market concentration.”
The committee says credit rating agencies play a public role in some cases, and should meet the same standards for accessibility, transparency, quality and reliability required of regulated businesses like banks. They should also separate their rating activities from ancillary services. MEPs in the committee call on stakeholders to consider whether they should encourage the emergence of a European player in credit rating.
There is also a welcome for “increased vigilance of supervisors on plain cases of market manipulation."
Alternative investment vehicles
MEPs in the committee recognise that alternative investment vehicles (hedge funds and private equity) provide liquidity and diversification in the market and create opportunities to improve the efficiency of corporate management, but they “share the concern of some central banks and supervisors that they may give rise to systemic risk and to high levels of exposure of other financial institutions.” They ask for the Commission to take a broader and more critical approach in its analysis of such funds “with regard to the risks of market abuse.”
Retail financial services – financial literacy
Cross-border integration of retail financial services is less well advanced than on the wholesale market, the report notes, calling for a focused approach on the specific barriers impacting in particular mobile cross-border users. They want to prevent Member States “engaging in competition based on the lowest supervision and security standards” so that the same risks can be matched by the same security across the whole internal market. They also argue for a greater emphasis on improving financial literacy.
The committee wants the Commission to develop a “harmonised solvency framework for pension funds” in line with the Solvency II approach developed for the insurance industry.
Better regulation
MEPs in the committee are “fully committed to the aims of better regulation based in the findings of careful, independent and professionally conducted impact assessments” focussing on more than purely financial aspects. They regret that the Commission has not fulfilled its commitment to have a proper impact assessment with every new proposal, but warn against impact assessments having the effect of bringing law-making to a standstill.
Systemic risks
The report says the nature, source and transfer of risks to the financial system are changing, and expressed concern that the “current nationally and sectorally based supervisory framework may potentially fail to keep pace with financial market dynamics”. MEPs stress that it must be well resources and coordinated to “give adequate responses in the case of major systemic crises that affect more than one Member State.”
Architecture of regulation and supervision
MEPs in the committee stress the need for cross-sectoral consistency in prudential regulation, so that similar products are regulated in similar ways, whether they are being sold by a bank, pension fund or insurance company.
To help reach common decisions on how national supervisors should apply EU rules, the committee suggests the three Level 3 committees (which respectively bring together national supervisors of the banking, pensions and insurance industries responsible for implementing EU legislation) should consider using some form of qualified majority voting.
They encourage agreements and codes of conduct between Member States and central banks on bail out and lender-of-last-resort obligations, as part of a strengthening of the system for oversight of prudential risks.
The report emphasises that home-host supervisory cooperation is the most significant building-block in the set-up of the single financial market. Greater convergence among supervisors should, it says, facilitate the business of companies dealing with more than one regulator – and encourage the emergence of a European retail financial market.
Global impact
The report highlights the importance of developing the transatlantic partnership to ensure, among other things, the implementation of Basel II by the US authorities, and of the mutual recognition of EU and US accounting standards. It calls for more democratically controlled cooperation with the US in monitoring regulators of alternative investment vehicles. It also calls for cooperation with other jurisdictions, such as India, China and South Korea.

Food safety
Food additives, flavourings and enzymes: safer rules on the way
2007-07-04 - 18:29
Parliament will be asked to approve with amendments a set of four regulations aimed at updating procedures for authorising food additives, flavourings and enzymes. The four first-reading reports are being tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. The House will debate them on Monday evening, with the vote following on Tuesday. The public increasingly demands that food additives be subject to high safety standards. It is also in the interests of the industry to ensure consumer confidence in these substances.
Food additives are currently regulated by a dozen or so EU laws, which the four new regulations will simplify and bring into line with the latest scientific findings. The first regulation sets out an EU-level "common authorisation procedure" for additives, enzymes and flavourings. The other three deal in detail with each of these categories, for which lists of authorised products will be compiled, with conditions of use and rules on labelling. The European Commission would manage the lists of approved products, subject to risk assessments carried out by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).
In voting on the regulations, the EP Environment Committee added further guarantees to make procedures more transparent, improve consumer protection and safeguard the EP's role as legislator.
Single EU-wide approval of additives
In a report by Åsa Westlund (PES, SE) on the common EU authorisation procedure, MEPs voted unanimously to make far-reaching changes to the Commission's draft regulation.
They first decided the new procedure must be more transparent. Any decisions taken and the reasons behind them must be made public, and any application to place a product on the market should be notified not only to Member States but also to the EP and to stakeholders. In addition, all authorisations must be regularly reviewed.
MEPs also adopted an amendment granting applicants scientific data protection for five years if, as part of their application, they have to reveal trade secrets that could help their competitors.
The Commission proposes to update the approved lists itself after consulting an EC committee of experts, since it regards the legislative procedure (co-decision) as too cumbersome for this purpose. By contrast, the Environment Committee calls for co-decision to be used, so that Parliament has the final say.
The general procedures laid down in this regulation underpin the three sectoral regulations on food additives, flavourings and enzymes, which are described below.
300 additives to be re-evaluated
In another report by Åsa Westlund , adopted by a similar majority, the committee looks at the draft regulation on food additives such as sweeteners, colourings, preservatives, antioxidants, emulsifiers, gelling agents and packaging gases.
This regulation lays down conditions for approving such additives: they must not endanger the health of consumers or mislead them, and they must be technologically necessary. Additives would be banned in unprocessed food, as would sweeteners and colourings in food for babies and small children.
In their amendments, MEPs stipulate that additives must not have a harmful effect on the environment that they must bring benefits to consumers and must not give a false impression as to the freshness of a product. Flavour enhancers should be used only if the desired effect cannot be achieved by using spices. On the technical front, there should be separate limit values for nanotechnologies. Labels should state whether an additive has been produced using GMOs and - for allergy sufferers - whether it contains azo-dyes.
How will the system work? In parallel to the authorisation procedure for new additives, all additives already on the market - around 300 in number - will gradually be re-evaluated, starting one year after the regulation enters into force. In the meantime, additives which are currently authorised may stay on the market but, after the updating process is complete, any additive not on the approved list will be banned.
Flavourings and enzymes: MEPs push for precautionary principle
The food industry uses a great many natural and artificial flavourings, with around 2600 being currently registered. Another category of substances - food enzymes - has been used for hundreds of years, for example in baking, cheese-making and brewing, where these products perform useful functions such as improving texture, appearance and nutritional value.
As with food additives, the Environment Committee says that both flavourings and enzymes should be used only if there is a benefit to the consumer, if they do not mislead as to the freshness or naturalness of a product and, if they are produced from GMOs, this must be indicated on the label. In addition, the precautionary principle should apply.
MEPs believe flavourings should be used only if the effect sought cannot be achieved with spices. A flavouring should be deemed "natural" only if 95% of the flavouring element is of natural origin (the Commission proposes 90%) and the effect of flavourings on vulnerable groups should be investigated, in particular the impact on the food preferences of children. Lastly, the committee favours a derogation for fresh or dried herbs and spices.
The Environment Committee adopted the report by Mojca Drčar Murko (ALDE, SI) on flavourings by 46 votes to 0 with 2 abstentions. The report by Avril Doyle (EPP-ED, IE) on enzymes was approved by 43 votes to 0 with 1 abstention.

Public health
Deal on EU public health programme set to sail through Parliament
2007-07-04 - 18:29
The House will be asked to approve a second-reading compromise package agreed with the Council on the second Community action programme on public health. Parliament's negotiating team has accepted the budget figure proposed by the Council in order to get the new programme up and running as of 1 January 2008. The programme was initially due to run from 2007 to 2013. At first reading the EP sought to increase the amount available over the whole period to €1,500 million but under the Financial Perspective adopted in 2005 this figure was cut to €365,600,000.
Under the compromise, Parliament has accepted the latter figure but given the delay in adopting the programme it will now run from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2013. Some of the funding is being used this year for the first health action programme (2003-2008), so the total figure for the remaining period is reduced in proportion.
The institutions also signed a declaration by which they undertake to explore ways of finding further money for the programme on a year-to-year basis.
The compromise was negotiated by the rapporteur for the Environment and Public Health Committee, Antonios Trakatellis (EPP-ED, EL), and is backed by all the main political groups, so it can be expected to sail through the plenary.
As part of the compromise package, Parliament successfully pushed for the programme's objectives to include the reduction of health inequalities as well as the promotion of cross-border care and the mobility of patients and health professionals. At the EP's instigation the text now contains specific references to complementary and alternative medicine as well as to major diseases including cancer.
What action can the EU take on health?
Healthcare systems are a matter for national governments but action on some areas of public health is often best carried out at European level. Epidemics, rules on exposure to chemicals, prevention of injuries and accidents at the workplace: these are the kinds of problems the EU can tackle, by laying down Europe-wide rules, boosting cooperation between national authorities, promoting best practice and data-swapping on illnesses and medicines, and promoting healthy lifestyles.

Action to tackle cardiovascular disease
2007-07-04 - 18:29
Georgs ANDREJEVS (ALDE, LV), on behalf of the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee will be putting the following question to the Commission on action to tackle cardiovascular disease. Given that cardiovascular disease is the number one killer in Europe and accounts for 1.9 million deaths in the EU each year. In June 2004, the Council recognised the need "to effectively address and reduce the incidence and suffering from cardiovascular diseases". When does the Commission plan to produce a Communication on the prevention and early detection of cardiovascular disease to reflect this commitment?
Given the current health inequalities throughout the EU, how does the Commission intend to promote regular exchange of experience, information and data on cardiovascular health between stakeholders involved in cardiovascular disease prevention?
What are the Commission’s next steps to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease on European economic productivity across the Member States?
How will the Commission take into account different funding opportunities such as the 7th Research Framework Programme, structural funding and the European Development Fund to encourage cardiovascular health promotion, early detection and prevention interventions as well as further research into cardiovascular disease?

Transport
Transport Committee advocates more transparent ticket prices
2007-07-04 - 18:29
In order to avoid the current practice of some air carriers, i.e. publishing air fares without any taxes and charges, the Transport Committee decided that passengers should be provided with a full breakdown of any taxes, fees and charges added to the ticket price. Air passengers must be treated like other consumers and thus have a right on clear and full information of the price they finally should pay, the Committee argues. The report by Arūnas Degutis (ALDE, LT) deals with the Commission proposal on the revision the 1992 "third liberalisation package" of the internal aviation market that aims to increase market efficiency, to enhance the safety of air services and to improve passenger protection. The regulation lays down rules for, inter alia, operating licences, leasing of aircraft, public service obligations, traffic distribution rule and price transparency.
The price you really have to pay
Air passengers must be treated like other consumers and thus have a right on clear and full information of the price they finally pay. Especially internet booking has to be considered, as they are often the only possibility of booking with low-cost carriers.
Air carriers therefore will have to provide the general public with comprehensive information "in any form, including on the Internet", on their air fares. Those fares and rates have to include all applicable taxes, non-avoidable charges, surcharges and fees known at the time of publication (i.e. taxes, air traffic control charges or duties, fees and other costs for the benefit of the airlines or of the airport operators) Air fares may not incorporate costs not actually incurred by air carriers.
Security taxes and charges
Security charges are on the rise. The Transport Committee argues that the consumer has a right to know how high they are, and where they are used for. Where airport or on-board security costs are included in the price of an air ticket, those costs shall therefore be shown separately on the ticket or otherwise indicated to the passenger.
Security taxes and charges, whether levied by Member States or by air carriers or entities, shall be transparent and shall be used exclusively to meet airport or onboard aircraft security costs.
Conditions for granting an operating licence
An undertaking has to provide evidence that it has sufficient insurance cover. Its net capital is at least EUR 100 000. Also, its principal place of business has to be located in the Community and it has to operate the largest part of its air services within, to or from the Community.
An operating licence can be suspended or revoked if there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the Community air carrier cannot meet its actual and potential obligations for a 12-month period.
Social legislation
In the past, the operation of bases other than country of origin has created problems as to the determination of the applicable laws to crews on the employment. Therefore, Member States shall ensure the proper application of Community and national social legislation with respect to employees of a Community air carrier operating air services from an operational base outside the territory of the Member State where that Community air carrier has its principal place of business.
Background
On 23 July 1992 the final stage in the liberalisation of air transport in the Community was reached with the adoption of the three Regulations, known as the "third package". This followed up the "first package", adopted in December 1987, and the "second package" of June 1990.
More than ten years after the entry into force the third package has largely played its role, allowing the unprecedented expansion of air transport in Europe. Old monopolies have been swept away, intra-Community cabotage has been introduced, and competition in all markets has intensified to the benefit of consumers.

Towards a future Maritime Policy
2007-07-04 - 18:29
Willi PIECYK (PES, DE), for the Transport Committee, will be tabling an own-initiative report on a
future maritime policy. The report highlights several key areas including climate change as the greatest challenge to maritime policy: the committee stresses that the EU must play a leading and pioneering role in combating climate change through at least three policies: (i) the emissions from ships of substances such as CO2, SO2 and nitrogen oxide must be drastically reduced; (ii) the feasibility of emissions trading for shipping must be carefully assessed; (iii) renewable energies such as wind and solar power must be introduced and promoted for shipping. The Commission is urged to propose legislation in order to effectively reduce maritime greenhouse gas emissions and the EU is urged to take decisive action to include the maritime sector in international climate conventions. The committee believes that it is important to coordinate a timetable for drawing up marine strategy action plans with important programmes at EU level, such as the EU's Structural Funds, in order to reap the greatest possible benefits of coordination with existing programmes. It considers that the action plans should, therefore, be drawn up by 2012 at the latest in order to facilitate coordination with the drafting of the structural programmes from 2014. The coordination with the EU's agricultural fund is of particular importance for those regions in which agriculture is responsible for a significant portion of discharges into the sea.
Better European shipping with better European ships : stressing that sea transport is an essential part of the world’s economic system, and that goods transported by ship is at present one of the least environmentally damaging methods of transport; the committee considers, nevertheless, that shipping has a considerable environmental cost, and therefore a sustainable balance between environmental protection and economic use of Europe’s oceans is essential, whereby guaranteeing sustainability must be an absolute priority.
The ‘Transport’ Council is urged to discuss the ‘Third maritime safety package' very soon and to take a decision, together with Parliament, so that there is no question of a credibility gap. As for the Commission, it is urged to reinforce all measures relating to civil and criminal liability and to tighten vigilance with regard to the application of the rules on the mandatory use of double hulls.
MEPs call for the introduction of a European quality label for ships , in line with the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) white list classification scheme, meeting the latest safety standards and social conditions, which will give these ships favoured treatment with regard to port state controls. They urge the Commission to create vocational retraining plans for fishermen, encouraging them to focus on new practices that promote the use of knowledge relating to work at sea. They note that the creation of conditions ensuring hygiene, safety and comfort for workers in the fishing industry, both for fishermen themselves and for people working in sectors upstream and downstream, is a key objective of a policy for the seas and oceans.
As regards the dismantling of ships, the committee calls on the Commission to draw up proposals to improve working conditions in the docks where the ships in question are dismantled and to explore all the possibilities in the area of criminal law made available by the Court of Justice with the ‘polluter pays’ principle applying in the maritime sector as is the case in other sectors. The Commission is called upon to develop a proposal for a ‘green passport’ to be carried with ships’ papers, listing all the toxic substances they contain. The committee believes that the Community should address the ship recycling issue by concluding a mandatory international Convention - foreseen for 2008 or 2009 - and in the meantime follow the IMO guidelines.
Better European coastal policy including better European ports: it is considered that the participation of regional and local stakeholders is essential for the success of a European maritime policy. The committee proposes the design of an EU “label” and that prizes be awarded to exemplary maritime regions as a way of promoting best practice. The committee favours the creation of more maritime clusters which take advantage of the positive experience gained and good practices already being carried out in this domain and believes that these examples should be followed and promoted and calls on the Member States to take measures to enhance the economic competitiveness of coastal regions by encouraging research, the creation of centres of maritime excellence and technological development and innovation as well as inter-business cooperation (networks, clusters, public partners) and the provision of improved support services aimed at reducing the dependence of those regions on a very limited number of (traditional) economic activities.
Sustainable maritime environment : the committee recalls its resolution of 14 November 2006 on a Thematic Strategy on the Protection and Conservation of the Marine Environment and reiterates, in particular, the need for : the EU to have as its overarching objective the sustainable use of the seas and the conservation of marine ecosystems, including a strong EU policy on marine protection, preventing further loss of biodiversity and deterioration of the marine environment; the inclusion of a common EU-wide definition of good environmental status; the European Environment Agency to provide regular assessments of the marine environment, which necessitates improvements in national data collection, reporting and exchange; recognition of the importance of prior consultation, coordination and cooperation with neighbouring states in the adoption and implementation of the forthcoming Marine Strategy Directive.
Maritime research, energy, technology and innovation : the committee calls for maritime research to be enshrined in the EU’s Seventh Framework Research Programme as a crosscutting theme and as a key topic for future framework research programmes and urges that the oceans’ potential contribution to solving Europe’s energy problems be included as the main focus of research, which must be encouraged. The Commission is called upon to draw up an offshore wind energy action plan embodying an efficient European approach to offshore technology, promoting more extensive networking and indicating the prospects for achievement of power generation capacity of at least 50 GW by 2020: therefore expects above all the adoption of a 'one-stop shop' approach and the promotion of an intelligent offshore network infrastructure; welcomes the Commission recommendation for a European strategic Energy Technology Plan and urges that efforts be focused on the large-scale development of offshore wind energy.
Blue biotechnology is considered as one of the most promising technologies of the coming decades, with many possible uses in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, the food industry and environmental remediation and it believes that research efforts in this area should be strengthened and Member States could take advantage of the creation of Blue Investment Funds, as proposed by the Green paper and that better synergy could be achieved by better coordinating Member State research efforts in this field. The committee emphasises that any blue technology development must be strongly regulated and properly assessed in order to avoid overexploitation and further damage to already fragile and threatened marine ecosystems.

MEPs to reject directive on road infrastructure safety?
2007-07-04 - 18:29
Based on a co-decision report by Helmuth MARKOV (GUE/NGL, DE), the Committee on Transport and Tourism recommends rejecting the proposal for a directive on road infrastructure safety management. It calls on the Commission to formulate recommendations for road infrastructure safety management. It substantially supports the Commission proposal, however, it considers that some parts of it should be deepened and strengthened. The directive aimed at prevailing a uniformly high level of safety at all stages of the planning, design and use of all roads in the EU and infrastructure planners to be made aware of safety issues. Road infrastructure planners should receive the guidelines, training and information they need to ensure that they can maintain a road network that meets modern safety requirements. Obligatory audits and inspections should therefore be introduced.
However, a majority of committee members took the view that this directive was unnecessary. They claimed that it provided no added value and would cause red tape at odds with the principle of better lawmaking. An exchange of tried-and-tested practices was sufficient and the Commission should encourage and support this by means of recommendations.
The amendment for rejection was adopted by 19 votes in favour to 18 against with one abstention and was supported by most EPP/ED, ALDE and Green Members with PES and GUE/NGL being against. The House will take the final decision at next week's plenary session in Strasbourg on the basis of the amended report, now asking for rejection of the Commission proposal.

First railway package - MEPs to examine proper implementation
2007-07-04 - 18:29
The Committee on Transport and Tourism is proposing an own-initiative report by Michael CRAMER (Greens/ EFA, DE) on the implementation of the first railway package. The salient issues of the report are as follows: Conditions for intermodal competition : given growing traffic volumes, rising emissions and limited energy resources, as well as thousands of road accident victims, MEPs state that reviving rail transport is a key objective of EU transport policy. The Commission is called upon to take account of this fact in implementing the first rail package. They consider that the “Eurovignette 2” directive is an initial step towards fair intermodal competition. The Commission is also called upon to submit a directive by 2008 (in which the Eurovignette is adjusted in line with the rail route pricing system, tolls are made mandatory for all lorries over 3.5. tonnes on all roads in the EU without loopholes, and external costs are internalised. The Commission should also translate the principles of the transport protocols of the agreement with Switzerland, and of the Alpine Convention, into corresponding measures for the shift to rail of trans-Alpine freight transport.
Noting that competition between rail and air transport is distorted, MEPs consider that exemption from kerosene tax and from VAT on international air tickets should be placed on the agenda as a matter of urgency at international and EU level. They emphasise that the lack of network interoperability is still the main obstacle to creation of an integrated European railway area, and welcomes the Commission’s decision to put forward a new initiative on this aspect and they consider that liberalisation should have gone hand-in-hand with the progress on interoperability and regrets that the two processes have proceeded at very different speeds. The Commission is called on to modernise and develop intermodal infrastructures, particularly junctions with port infrastructures.
The committee stresses that the interoperability of rail traffic must be further improved so as to enhance the competitiveness of the railway. It calls for ERTMS (European Rail Traffic Management System) to be installed rapidly and without gaps on the six corridors on which the EU has reached agreement with the railway undertakings and the Member States (A: Rotterdam-Genoa; B: Naples-Berlin-Stockholm; C: Antwerp-Basle/Lyon; D: Seville-Lyon-Turin-Trieste-Ljubljana; E: Dresden-Prague-Brno-Vienna-Budapest; F: Duisburg-Berlin-Warsaw).
The report urges the Commission to extend the good example set by state aid for rolling stock, made possible in connection with the installation/improvement of ERTMS in trains, to noise reduction in goods trucks, as this will enable savings to be made in infrastructure investments. The Commission should take action against subsidy practice whereby EU transport aid flows into Member States which use it almost exclusively to fund their road networks while neglecting the railways. It is considered that, in the event of co-financing, at least 40% of the appropriations should be allocated to the railway.
The Commission is called upon to look into the possibility of introducing better transparency and predictability of route prices, establishing the principle of a minimum of harmonisation of prices on international corridors which are the subject of investment by railway undertakings to improve interoperability.
Regulation of the separation between network and operation : MEPs in the committee consider the separation of railway infrastructure and operation to be a key issue of rail policy, given the central role of infrastructure operators for the rail industry, and in this connection regards it as absolutely essential to create an independent and transparent regulating body with adequate funding. The Commission is invited to adapt the rail systems currently confined within national borders in such a way that each rail undertaking which meets the necessary legal and technical requirements in a Member State is permitted to operate across the whole European network (cross-acceptance), thus promoting not only trans-European but also regional cross-border traffic.
The report states that the railways’ share of the freight market has been stabilizing since 2001 in EU-25 and the best performance, disregarding the Baltic States which benefit from their very special geographical location and the kind of goods transported, can be seen in Member States which were first to start reforming their railway industry in anticipation of the Community Directives and the opening up of the market. In this context, developing competitiveness of the sector through market opening means supporting future investment. In addition, by contributing to the development of environmentally friendly transport, the Community deliberately opts for the development of sustainable transport. MEPs in the committee underline the importance of the European social dialogue in preventing the process of liberalisation from clearing the way for social dumping.

Transport
Sustainable mobility for our continent
2007-07-04 - 18:29
Etelka BARSI-PATAKY (EPP-ED, HU) for the Committee on Transport and Tourism is proposing an own-initiative report on Keep Europe moving - Sustainable mobility for our continent. In so doing, the Parliamentary committee stresses the need for pragmatic and cooperative interconnection in the field of transport and in other national or Community policy areas such as energy, environment and innovation. It emphasises that these policies must incorporate the requirements of climate protection as well. It considers that only an integrated approach could achieve positive results in reducing casualties and emissions and improving safety and environment, as it was laid down for example by CARS 21.
On the other hand, the report deplores the conditions under which the Union’s transport policy is being implemented by the Council and calls strongly for decisions to be taken more quickly under the legislative procedure and for swifter and better coordinated transposal into national law. It calls on the Commission to do all in its power to achieve this goal.
The resolution notes that Community funds for financing trans-European transport projects remain limited, and the added value of the TEN-T programme cannot be attained unless the entire network is completed, emphasises the financing of infrastructures (especially where congestion problems are significant), the cross border sections and transport hubs.
The importance of the "Motorways of the sea" projects has been emphasised as has the wish for the Galileo Programme and European Traffic Management System (ERTMS) to be sped up.
In addition, the Parliamentary committee:
looks forward to a generally applicable, transparent and comprehensible model by the Commission in 2008 for the assessment of all external costs to serve as the basis for future calculations of infrastructure charges, which model shall be accompanied by an impact analysis of the internalisation of external costs for all modes of transport and a strategy for the implementation of the model for all modes of transport;
calls on the Commission to increase its efforts to fully implement Directive 2004/52/EC on the interoperability of electronic road toll systems in the Community and asks the Commission to come up with a report on the implementation of this Directive before the end of 2007;
calls for a feasibility study - in line with the report on the future of the EU’s own resources - to be carried out so as to provide secure and lasting funding;
emphasises that priority should be given, when implementing the Seventh Framework Programme, to projects and programmes concerning intelligent transport systems and logistics, including road safety, urban transport and clean-engine technology;
calls for EU-wide quality and interoperability standards for bio fuels to be ensured;
underlines the need for the energy efficiency road plan;
emphasises the importance of the Green Paper on urban transport, and hopes that specific means will be provided to help urban public transport move towards modal integration, developing traffic management systems, and creating conditions enabling users to be rewarded for their decision to make use of alternatives;
underlines the importance of taking further measures in favour of sustainable transport in mountainous as well as densely populated areas, following the signature, by the Transport Council on 11 December 2006, of the Transport Protocol to the Alpine Convention;
suggests that a Green Paper on European tourism be submitted and that a specific impact assessment of legislation which has a clear influence on European tourism be carried out;
The committee fully agrees that Community legislation - in line with the principle of Better Regulation and the principle of subsidiarity - should focus on new areas such as urban transport. European legislation should focus on fields where it is necessary and policy measures should be taken at EU-level only where it would bring clear added value. The Commission and the Member States are called upon to ensure the implementation and enforcement of the existing European transport legislation, further calls are made on the Commission to carry out regular monitoring to observe the effectiveness of measures seeking to achieve the objectives set and, where necessary, to make corrective changes.
Lastly, the Commission is called upon to immediately start work on a well-prepared European transport policy after 2010, which can meet the new challenges in a sustainable manner.

Situation in Darfur - MEPs to vote on a resolution
2007-07-04 - 18:29
The House will vote on a resolution on the situation in Darfur. A delegation of five MEPs from the EP Development Committee are in Darfur from 30 June to 6 July, where they visit camps of displaced people in Darfur as well as camps of Sudanese refugees in eastern Chad. The delegation will be led by Josep BORRELL (PES, ES), chair of the Development Committee. To stem the mayhem in Darfur (Sudan), a hybrid force of United Nations and African Union peacekeeping troops is needed fast, MEPs on a fact-finding mission there said. "We cannot wait another year for security", said delegation chief Josep Borrell, and "humanitarian operations cannot go on for ever", added EP humanitarian aid rapporteur Thierry CORNILLET (ALDE, FR)
The Darfur crisis calls for the "rapid and effective and deployment of the hybrid force, with an adequate mandate, as recently agreed by the Sudanese government" said Mr Borrell.
Reinforcements needed for security
African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) forces already in Darfur are "incapable of providing security", local people told MEPs. Yet creating a United Nations/African Union hybrid force is likely to take time - AMIS reinforcements are not expected to arrive before well into 2008, the delegation was told.
The other members of the EP delegation are José Ribeiro e Castro (EPP-ED, PT), Frithjof Schmidt (Greens/EFA, DE) and Jürgen Schröder (EPP-ED, DE).
ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly position on the situation in Darfur
On 28 June, the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly meeting in Wiesbaden (Germany) adopted a resolution on the situation in Darfur. It welcomes the acceptance by the Government of Sudan (GoS) on 12 June 2007 of the AU/UN hybrid force. The resolution recalls that the GoS has made previous commitments to allow the hybrid force into Sudan. The resolution stresses, therefore, the importance of ensuring the swiftest possible deployment and continued cooperation of the Sudanese authorities and expects the GoS to disarm all militia, including the Janjaweed, and to stop the bombing of the Darfur region.

EU membership a possible long-term prospect for a reformed, democratic Ukraine
2007-07-04 - 18:29
EU membership is a possible long-term prospect for a reformed, democratic Ukraine, says an own-initiative report drafted by Michał Tomasz KAMIŃSKI (UEN, PL) on behalf of the Foreign Affairs Committee. The report calls on Ukraine's politicians to resolve the current crisis peacefully, unravel political from economic powers, weed out corruption and ensure an independent judiciary, as well as further integrating Ukraine's energy markets with those of the European Union. The committee welcomes the Council's decision to open negotiations on a new agreement with Ukraine, but nonetheless believes that "the negotiations should lead to the conclusion of an Association Agreement that would allow Ukraine to use its mechanisms for further deepening of integration with the EU and to prepare the next steps for fulfilment of Ukraine's European aspirations, aimed in the long term at attainment of EU membership."
Reform is the key to stabilisation
On the other hand, MEPs in the committee also express their disquiet about current political tensions. They say that "before the negotiations are concluded and a new, closer relationship between the EU and Ukraine is established, the current crisis has to be peacefully resolved, the system of checks and balances restored and the enforcement of the rule of law ensured." In particular, the report notes that "the key to the stabilisation of Ukraine lies in unravelling political from economic powers, weeding out corruption and ensuring an independent judiciary."
Energy issues
The report also urges Ukraine to comply fully with market economy and transparency principles in the energy sector. MEPs in the committee urge faster procedures for nuclear safety evaluations, a diversification of energy resources, and an overall effort to raise energy efficiency in Ukraine, which lags behind most other countries in the world.

Situation in Palestine - MEPs to vote on a resolution
2007-07-04 - 18:29
The Council and Commission will make statements on the situation in Palestine. The House will also vote on a resolution on the topic. On 26 June, Louis Michel , the European Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, called for the opening of the border between Israel and Gaza to enable vital relief supplies to reach the people inside the Gaza Strip. "We know the needs are increasing all the time. The problem now is providing secure access to those who are suffering. €30m in supplies and funding from the EU are ready and waiting: give us the tools to get on with the job."
Mr Michel stressed the need for rapid action to prevent the humanitarian position from deteriorating any further. "In the current situation, there is a real risk that Gaza will begin to look like a citadel under siege, where the civilian population is trapped and even basic needs cannot be met. Humanitarian aid is neutral. It does not seek to confer any advantage on any party or imply any form of political recognition. There are no grounds for a blockade of humanitarian aid. This must continue to be provided to the people in Gaza in the same way as for vulnerable groups in the West Bank - and in other crisis zones."
The European Commission has a relief package of almost €30m for Gaza, including €10.2m just released from its food aid reserve for the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) for emergency food aid in the Gaza Strip. This comes from an overall humanitarian budget of €67.4m for the Palestinians - €43m in its humanitarian global plan and €23.4m earmarked for food aid. The relief programmes are implemented by the Commission's operational partners including the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), the World Food Programme (WFP), the International Committee of the Red Cross and non-governmental organisations.

Future agreement on Kosovo
2007-07-04 - 18:29
MEPs will debate the future agreement on Kosovo after hearing statements from the Commission and the Council. On 29 March, Parliament gave its full support to the Ahtisaari proposal for a status settlement, stating that "sovereignty supervised by the international community is the best option" for securing the objectives of a peaceful, self-sustaining Kosovo. The report also reaffirmed the European perspective of both Serbia and Kosovo, and called for the EU to play a central role in the current international negotiations for a settlement.
Members voted to fully support the UN-led drive to determine the final status of Kosovo, and to the Ahtisaari Proposal in particular. Martti Ahtisaari, former Finnish President, was the UN Special Envoy charged with devising a plan for the status settlement of Kosovo. His proposal, released early last month, would give Kosovo some of the trappings of sovereignty, such as rights to membership in international organisations, but does not advocate outright independence. The own-initiative report by Joost Lagendijk (Greens/EFA, NL), adopted by an overwhelming majority in the House on Thursday 29 March (490 in favour to 80 against with 87 abstentions) spelled out several desirable aspects of a settlement:
- access to international financial organisations
- an international presence in Kosovo, with a clear definition of its role and mandate
- clear provisions on decentralisation which grant substantial autonomy in key areas
- full respect for human rights
- retention of Kosovo's multi-ethnic character, with protection for cultural and religious sites
- the establishment of a limited, internal, multi-ethnic Kosovar Security Force
- international guarantees for the territorial integrity of all neighbouring states
International implications
Addressing fears, especially in Russia, that granting Kosovo any form of independence would exacerbate other separatist tensions around the globe, the report "underlines that the solution in Kosovo will set no precedent in international law, as Kosovo has been under UN rule since 1999 [...and] is in no way comparable to the situation in other conflict regions which are not under UN administration."
In addition, the House is of the view that "in the long run, the solution regarding the future status of Kosovo lies also in the fact that both Serbia and Kosovo are due to become part of the EU, together with their neighbours, since the future of the Western Balkans lies in the European Union."
The EU's role
The report emphasises that the EU Member States should speak with one voice on the Kosovo issue, by adopting a common position in Council, and maintaining it in international fora, especially the UN Security Council. The Parliament also argued that "the European Union should have a decisive say on the final terms of the settlement." MEPs also called for a visa facilitation agreement for Kosovo, to ease access for travel into the European Union.
Finally, the report stated that "the EP is prepared to make available the additional resources required in order to finance the future EU involvement in Kosovo with a view to implementing the status settlement." The report also expressed the Parliament's support for the establishment of an ESDP (European Security and Defence Policy) mission to Kosovo. Council and Commission statements

FYROM progressing towards EU membership - despite issue of their country's name
2007-07-04 - 18:29
Progress towards EU membership by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, including reforms and recent agreements between the government and opposition on the use of Albanian in public institutions and the protection of ethnic minorities in decision-making, is welcomed in a Foreign Affairs Committee report. "Macedonia's name issue should not burden its relationship with the EU", the country's Foreign Minister, Antonio Milososki, told the committee. The own initiative report recognises the progress by FYROM since it applied for EU membership in 2004, but stresses that "the reform momentum must be maintained, and that the adopted legislation must now be properly and promptly implemented." The report, drawn up by Erik Meijer (GUE/NGL, NL), was approved by the committee with 58 votes in favour, 4 against and no abstentions. MEPs in the committee are especially concerned about reforms in the fields of police, judiciary and public administration, as well as the fight against corruption.
The committee also commends the Macedonian government for its co-operation in Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP), and welcomed the initialling of visa facilitation agreements with the EU.
Protection of ethnic minority interests
Members note with satisfaction the Ohrid Framework Agreement, which introduces the double majority, or "Badinter" principle, to protect ethnic minorities in parliamentary decision-making and an agreement on the list of laws to be subject to this principle. The committee also welcomed the successful consultations between government and opposition on the use of Albanian in public institutions, but criticised the opposition's boycott of Parliament, pointing out that such practices "are incompatible with functioning parliamentary institutions."
Name issue not part of EU accession conditions
The most enduring controversy over FYROM still seems to be the country's official name. The committee welcome the fact that FYROM has changed its flag, and has made constitutional amendments to confirm that it has no territorial claims against neighbouring countries. MEPs in the committee urge the Macedonian and Greek governments to conclude talks on this issue as soon as possible, while reiterating that "the name issue neither is nor can be part of the conditions related to the country's EU accession agenda."
FYROM's position on Kosovo
On Kosovo, Minister Milososki said that "any status settlement is better than the status quo." The committee welcomes the country's constructive position on the future status of Kosovo, while regretting that no frontier demarcation had taken place between the two sides.

EU strategy to protect critical infrastructure from terrorist attacks
2007-07-04 - 18:29
A proposed EU-wide strategy to protect critical infrastructure against terrorist attacks (in fields such as energy, health, communication and transport), was backed by the Civil Liberties Committee. But MEPs in the committee stress that responsibility for protecting critical infrastructure still rests primarily with Member States and private stakeholders. A draft directive tabled by the Commission in 2006 would oblige Member States to identify and designate existing infrastructure as European Critical Infrastructure (ECI), according to sector-specific criteria established by national governments, the Commission and stakeholders. Once the list is ready, the directive would oblige owners and operators of the ECIs to establish an "operator security plan", with permanent and graduated security measures in the event of a terrorist attack.
Primarily a national responsibility
Parliament's consultation report, drafted by Jeanine Hennis - Plasschaert (ALDE, NL), agrees on the need to identify what national facilities can be designated "European Critical Infrastructure" and to assess their protection needs, but stresses that the primary and ultimate responsibility for protecting critical infrastructures lies with the Member States and the owners or operators. A Community approach, say MEPs in the Committee, can be justified only if at least three Member States, or at least two Member States other than that in which the critical infrastructure is located, would be affected.
Avoid duplicating work
The EU should make every possible effort to avoid duplicating the work of Member States and adding unnecessary costs and administrative burdens for owners and operators, say MEPs in the committee . Future common risk assessments should always take into account existing methodologies in each country. Even when a given facility is designated as ECI, its compliance with existing protection measures might be enough to satisfy the requirement to establish and update an "operator security plan".
Finally, the Civil Liberties Committee agreed with the Commission that appropriate measures must be taken to protect sensitive and confidential information revealing the vulnerability of each piece of infrastructure. According to MEPs, the recent SWIFT case showed that critical data needs to be protected against illegal use by foreign authorities or private actors as well, therefore all sensitive data "shall be carried out within the EU and any mirroring data shall not be allowed in third countries for reasons of security".
An overall strategy to protect critical infrastructure was requested by the European Council in 2004, in the aftermath of the Madrid train bombings, with a view to preventing the potentially disastrous impact that damage to, or the loss of, infrastructure in any one Member State could have on the EU economy and public confidence as a whole.
The rapporteur was satisfied with the adoption of these compromise amendments and hoped the new law will be useful to reinforce EU's strategy to fight terrorism. "Experiences from the past do tell us that if a terrorist attack occurs, the EU Heads of State will be calling for new security proposals within 48 hours, thereby weakening their quality. Or even worse, they come up with measures that are disproportionate and lack transparency, like for example the measures restricting liquids aboard aircrafts", she said in her explanatory statement.

Employment policy
How to make labour law fit for the 21st century?
2007-07-04 - 18:29
"If labour law is to meet the challenges of the 21st century, it must focus to a large extent on employment security throughout a worker's life rather than protecting particular jobs", says an own-initiative report which contributes to the current debate on flexicurity within the EU. MEPs in the Employment Committee call for active labour policy that makes it easier to find a job, and to move from one job to another. The report drafted by Jacek Protasiewicz (EPP-ED, PL), defines flexicurity as "combining flexibility and security in the job market in a way that helps increase both productivity and the quality of jobs by guaranteeing security, while at the same time allowing firms the flexibility needed to create jobs in response to the changing needs of the market".
Reduce administrative burdens
The Employment and Social Affairs Committee stresses the need to simplify administrative procedures for firms, and especially for new and small and medium-sized enterprises. "Excessive administrative burdens" could deter employers from taking on new workers even during times of economic growth, it notes. To combat exploitation of undocumented workers, labour law should be better enforced and legal employment should be made easier, states the text.
Indefinite contracts should be the norm
This non-binding report states that EU labour law should reinforce employment contracts of an indefinite duration as the general form of employment. Any non-standard forms of work, such as fixed-term contracts, temporary contracts obtained through employment agencies, recurring freelance contracts and project contracts, should go hand-in-hand with support for workers who find themselves in transit from one job to another. So for example, during this transition period, when it is "strictly necessary for them to become more employable through training and re-qualification", workers should be entitled to some level of income support.
"Sufficiently flexible" working time arrangements
Working time arrangements should be "sufficiently flexible" to meet the needs of employers and employees and to enable people to better balance work and family life, as well as to safeguard competitiveness and improve the employment situation in Europe, says the report.
Implement existing legislation
The Employment Committee regrets that existing EU rules are not properly implemented or enforced. Member States should, for instance, review and adapt their social security systems and implement active policies to invigorate the labour market. MEPs in the committee also believe it important to achieve "a degree of consistency" in the field of labour law, which may be achieved though collective agreements and the open method of co-ordination.
MEPs in the committee also call on Member States to remove the restrictions on access to their labour markets, so as to improve worker mobility within the EU.

Posting of workers - oral question to the Commission
2007-07-04 - 18:29
Jan ANDERSSON (PES, SE) Chairman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs will be asking the Commission the following questions on the posting of workers. Directive 96/71/EC concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services set 16 December 1999 as the deadline for transposition of its provisions into national law. Soon, appropriate implementation of the Directive proved to be problematic due both to insufficiencies inherent in the text and the lack of proper implementation in the Member States and coordination among their competent authorities. The reviews of the Directive by the Commission in 2003 and 2006 were considered insufficient by the European Parliament .
In its Communications 'Guidance on the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services' and 'Posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services: maximising its benefits and potential while guaranteeing the protection of workers' , the Commission committed itself to take the necessary steps to rectify the situation created by any lack of compliance with the relevant provisions of Community law and/or cooperation between Member States under Articles 4 (cooperation on information) and 5 (enforcement measures by Member States) of the Directive.
How does the Commission intend to address the concerns expressed by the European Parliament in its resolutions, in particular with regard to:
- the keeping of documents at the workplace to control compliance with the Directive, and
- the presence of a posting company legal representative in order to fulfil legal requirements in the host Member State?
In view of the fact that the Directive applies at least from December 1999 and that guidelines explaining to Member States their obligations with regard to postings that take place on their territory were published by the Commission more than one year ago:
- Will the Commission publish clearer, more detailed, guidelines to help Member States and companies to have a better understanding of what they are allowed to do under the Directive and the relevant case-law? If so, when?
- Has the Commission assessed which Member States still fail to comply with the provisions of the Directive, in particular concerning cooperation on information and enforcement measures by Member States?
Can the Commission confirm that, in the framework of posting, it will respect all labour market models existing in the European Union? Jan ANDERSSON PSE SE Oral question - posting of workers

External/international trade
Recent developments in bilateral trade with China
2007-07-04 - 18:29
Helmuth MARKOV (GUE/NGL, DE), chair of the International Trade Committee, will be asking the Commission to comment on recent developments in bilateral trade relations with China. In particular, Mr Markov will be asking the following questions. In 2006 the People’s Republic of China displaced the United States to become the largest source of EU imports, while the EU’s trade deficit with China grew to €128bn. In January 2007 the negotiations on a new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) were launched and, the following month, the Commission released a study which suggested that there were major opportunities for EU exporters in green goods, business services and high-value products. However, the study also concluded that EU exporters faced serious barriers when trying to access the Chinese market, as well as poor protection of intellectual property rights.
In this context, could the Commission:
Set out the latest developments in the negotiations towards a new PCA, and the expected timetable?
Ensure, in accordance with Article 19 of the Framework Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission, that ‘early and clear information’ is provided to Parliament during the conduct of the negotiations and, in particular, that the adopted negotiating directive is transmitted?
Explain how it intends to address the lack of a high level of protection of human rights and of adequate environmental, social and safety standards in China within the PCA negotiations and the WTO framework, as well as its proposed approach towards Chinese distortions of the world market for trade in natural resources?
Explain what steps it is taking to improve market access for EU exporters, how it proposes to combat unfounded allegations of safety problems with European products, some of which appear to have been instigated by official bodies, and, in the light of the US decision to initiate WTO Dispute Settlement procedures with regard to the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights in China, what measures it envisages taking to ensure that European industry does not continue to suffer widespread damage as a result of counterfeiting and piracy?
Provide an assessment of China’s progress towards the fulfilment of the conditions set by the EU in relation to its Market Economy Status request? Helmuth MARKOV GUE/NGL DE Oral question on recent developments in bilateral trade relations with China

TRIPS agreement and access to medicines
2007-07-04 - 18:29
The WTO Decision of 30 August 2003 was supposed to be an 'expeditious solution' to the crisis in access to medicines faced by developing countries with no or little manufacturing capacity. The amendment to the TRIPS Agreement disregards the fact that there is no proof of the Decision's efficacy. The European Parliament has now to give its assent. Gianluca Susta and Johan Van Hecke, on behalf of the ALDE Group, Kader Arif, on behalf of the PES Group, Georgios Papastamkos, on behalf of the EPP-ED Group, Vittorio Agnoletto and Helmuth Markov, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, Carl Schlyter, on behalf of the Greens/EFA Group and Cristiana Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group will be asking the Commission and Council questions on the TRIPS agreement and access to medicines.
In this context, could the Council / Commission:
Give its views on the mechanism created by the WTO Decision of 30 August 2003 and the Protocol to the TRIPS Agreement and, given the restricted use of the mechanism so far, explore the possibilities to improve its efficiency;
Adopt a Joint Policy Statement with the European Parliament on the necessity to find alternative ways, in particular the possibility to use the Article 30 exception provision of the TRIPS Agreement, which could be used by countries or groups of countries to find viable solutions to the problem of access to medicines at affordable prices;
Commit to restricting the mandate to the Commission in order not to negotiate pharmaceutical-related TRIPS-plus provisions affecting public health and access to medicines in the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) with the ACP countries and other future bilateral and regional agreements with poor developing countries;
State that the European Union supports the developing countries which use the so-called flexibilities built into the TRIPS Agreement in order to be able to provide essential medicines at affordable prices under their domestic public health programmes;
Recognise that the European Union must take additional measures as a matter of urgency with a view to encouraging the transfer of technology, research, capacity strengthening, regional supply systems and help with registration, in order to facilitate and increase the production of pharmaceutical products by the developing countries themselves?

Energy
Labelling of office equipment should reflect "ambitious levels of energy efficiency"
2007-07-04 - 18:29
A new agreement has been signed between the EU and the USA which will allow them to continue using the Energy Star label with the overall objective of co-ordinating an energy-efficiency labelling programme for office equipment. A report by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has called for several amendments to the original Commission proposal, such as a greater emphasis on the "savings and environmental benefits", when considering how best to implement this agreement. The first-reading report is written by Nikolaos VAKALIS (EPP-ED, GR) and states that continued participation in this scheme will mean "drawing up the necessary technical specifications" in line with "the Community's policy of energy efficiency and its energy-efficiency targets."
Evaluation needed
The report calls for an evaluation of what constitutes energy efficiency", and recommends that " the Commission, assisted by the EC Energy Star Board (ECESB) shall follow market penetration of products bearing the Common Logo and development of energy efficiency of office equipment with a view of a timely revision of the technical specifications."
The report also calls for an evaluation of the Energy Star programme, and states that "the Commission shall, one year before expiry of the Agreement, produce and submit to the European Parliament and the Council a report monitoring the energy efficiency of the office equipment market in the Community and giving an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Energy Star programme. The report shall include qualitative as well as quantitative data. The report shall also include data on the benefits derived from the Energy Star programme, namely energy savings and environmental benefits in terms of carbon dioxide emission reductions."

Energy Committee calls for a "fully liberalised European energy market as soon as possible"
2007-07-04 - 18:29
The internal energy market should allow "consumer choice of supplier in an open competitive environment", and also be able to guarantee security of supply given that "it is essential for every citizen of the [EU] to have affordable access to energy", according to a report by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. The own-initiative report, by Alejo VIDAL-QUADRAS , focuses specifically on the gas and electricity markets, and says that in order to facilitate the liberalisation of these markets it is crucial to "promote investments in infrastructures in a non-discriminatory way" and allow "fair access to the grid for new entrants and transparency in the market."
Regulation of the energy markets
Concerning how these markets and regulated, the report seeks to "promote a more European approach to regulation on cross-border issues", part of which will be to "enhance cooperation between national regulators at EU level." Moreover, it is however "essential to overcome technical and regulatory differences that impose serious barriers to cross-border trade and interconnections."
The report also adds that "national regulators should remain the only authority responsible for decisions affecting their national market only."
They should be "independent, strong and have well-defined competences" to "ensure the law is fully implemented in practice and is adhered to by market players and that the necessary investments and transparency levels are in place."
Environmental considerations
Looking at the environmental impact of liberalising the energy market, the report states that regulators should also have the role of "ensuring that energy companies have a statutory obligation to give energy saving advice to customer."
It is also stressed by the committee that "subsidies for non-renewable sources of energy should be eliminated" and Member States are urged to "facilitate an increase in grid capacity in order to allow the incorporation of new massive onshore and offshore renewable energy generation."
Securing energy
Whilst placing an emphasis on the "long-term investments that are necessary in the energy sector", the committee also "reiterates its call on the Commission to take further steps to address concentrations in the energy market in cases of abuse of market dominance."
The "high energy prices derived from the lack of competition in the markets" means that it is necessary to "take account of the importance of the role of small and medium-sized energy companies to the functioning of competitive energy markets."
In this way, it is hoped to "establish a common energy policy based on a broader vision of the common European interest in the energy field by respecting national characteristics and allowing Member States to adhere to their energy mixes in order to diversify energy sources and energy producers as much as possible."

Democratic scrutiny under the Development Co-operation Instrument
2007-07-04 - 18:29
The House will debate the democratic scrutiny under the Development Co-operation Instrument after hearing a statement from the Commission. The House is also due to vote on a resolution on the topic. This resolution will first have to be adopted by the Development Committee which meets on Monday 9 July in Strasbourg. MEPs have regularly complained to the Commission, regretting that the country strategy papers (programmes targeting countries in Asia and Latin America) do not allocate a sufficient part of the resources to the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) overarching goal of poverty eradication and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
The creation of the Development Cooperation Instrument will allow renewal of one of the European Community's most important tools for funding its development cooperation activities, with almost €17 billion for the 2007-13 period. These funds (previously decided) come in addition to €22.7 billion agreed specifically for African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries over the 2008-13 period, bringing the total - not including member states' national contributions - to almost €40 billion in new Community funding.
Interventions are planned at two mutually-reinforcing levels. The first is geographic, covering Asia, Central Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and South Africa, the second thematic, enabling regional programmes to be reinforced in response to specific needs, such as migration, education, and health. ACP countries can also benefit from the thematic programmes, and a specific amount is earmarked for ACP countries that need assistance in adjusting to the effects of the EU's sugar sector reform.
Moreover, the DCI allows for a simplified system by replacing a series of existing instruments by a single financing instrument, enabling all EU interventions to be decided on the basis of the same principles and to follow a simpler decision-making procedure.
The DCI is part of a new framework for planning and delivering assistance in order to make EU's external assistance more effective. The framework also includes:
an instrument for pre-accession assistance to candidate countries and countries that are potential candidates for membership of the EU;
- a European neighbourhood and partnership instrument;
- an instrument for industrialised and other high-income countries and territories;
- a financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide;
- an instrument for stability. Commission statement - Democratic scrutiny under the Development Cooperation Instrument
