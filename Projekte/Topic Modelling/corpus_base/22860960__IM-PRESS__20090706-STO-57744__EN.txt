The end of "cu-cumbersome" legislation? A cucumber in Hamburg, Germany, 30 June. Â©Belga/EPA/K Nietfeld For those of you who like your fruit and vegetables to look as crooked, knobbly and curvy as possible 1 July was a good day. It saw the phasing out of minimum EU standards for 26 types of fruit and veg. The rules, intended to ensure proper marketing standards and help storage and transport, became the subject of ridicule with the press running "straight cucumber" stories. From now on everything from leeks and onions can be sold just the way nature made them.
It is hoped that the repeal of such rules by the European Commission will lessen the burden of regulation and also allow shoppers more choice and ensure that fruit and vegetables that look slightly different will not be thrown away.
The fruit and vegetables affected are: apricots, artichokes, asparagus, aubergines, avocadoes, beans, Brussels sprouts, carrots, cauliflowers, cherries, courgettes, cucumbers, cultivated mushrooms, garlic, hazelnuts in shell, headed cabbage, leeks, melons, onions, peas, plums, ribbed celery, spinach, walnuts in shell, water melons, and witloof/chicory.
10 popular favourites could also be exempted
It is thought that EU States could also decide to exempt a further 10 popular products such as apples, citrus fruit, kiwi fruit, lettuces, peaches and nectarines, pears, strawberries, sweet peppers, table grapes and tomatoes from marketing standards.
Originally the so called "Cucumber Regulation" (EEC No 1677/88) and the "Carrot Regulation" (EEC No 730/1999) set EU-wide quality standards for fruits and vegetables to facilitate their storage, handling and transportation and ensure they remain fresh.
As you can see from our photo, fruit and veg come in all shapes and sizes!
