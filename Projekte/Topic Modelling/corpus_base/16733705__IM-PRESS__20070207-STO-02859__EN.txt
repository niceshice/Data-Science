How football should be enjoyed
Football - the beautiful game - but all too often marred by hooliganism and racism. Last week in Italy all football games were suspended after the death of a policeman following riots after a Catania-Palermo match. By coincidence the Parliament's Civil Liberties Committee debated a report on security at matches last week. It concerns European cooperation on the use of personal data on football supporters considered to be a "risk".
The decision in Italy to suspend matches came amid claims that only 6 of the 31 main stadiums met safety standards. This prompted the government not to let people into the stadiums before improvements are made.
Heysel: tragic night prompts action
Violence has been a feature of the game almost since it became professionally organised in the 19th century. However, it was the Heysel stadium disaster in 1985 that really brought home to Europe the danger of hooliganism. The European Cup final between Liverpool and Juventus that year saw 39, mainly Italian supporters, die after rioting in the stadium before the match. Liverpool was banned from European football for five years and serious steps were taken to tackle hooliganism.
The man who scored the winning goals was Michel Platini - recently elected Chairman of European football's governing body UEFA. He has pledged put the fight against racism and violence in football at the top of his agenda,
Information key to identifying fans who pose "risk"
The tragedy of Heysel prompted the Council of Europe to adopt a "European Convention on Spectator Violence". In 1996 the European Parliament adopted a report on hooliganism written by Claudia Roth. The report advocated banning alcohol at matches, separating supporters, controlling ticket sales and safer stadiums.
In 2002 EU governments established a network of "national football information points". The aim was to increase police cooperation - particularly when it came to international matches. All of these points had to provide "risk assessment" when either their national team or clubs played abroad. This cooperation was important in the lead up to the European Championships in Portugal in 2004.
Racism: MEPs want clubs to face sanctions
Violence and racism often go hand in hand. In March last year 424 MEPs signed a written declaration on racism. It called on clubs and national football associations to face serious sporting sanctions if their supporters committed racist acts.
As well as personal data on potential hooligans - the report in the Civil Liberties Committee (drafted by Italian MEP Giusto Catania) also wants the data to be protected. The Committee are hoping to organise a public hearing on football in the near future.
