The reform of the European Social Model is at the heart of the debate in Europe. Demographic changes, technological developments, globalisation and the resulting pressures on public expenditure necessitate an urgent reform of social systems to ensure they play a productive role in the economy.
How to continue to improve the standard of living for EU citizens while remaining competitve in the global economy? How can the European Union contribute to this reform? What benefits are there to be expected from the so-called flexicurity-approach? How can the reform be financed?
The invited experts will present their views on these questions
