Romanian PM Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu and leaders of the Political Groups
Romanian Prime Minister Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu told European Parliament President Josep Borrell and the leaders of the political groups that he expects Romania to get the green light for accession to the EU. As Romania moves into the final stages of its bid to join the Union, he outlined its progress in meeting the criteria for EU accession and spoke about Romania's vision of EU developments and its role after accession.
The visit to Brussels on Thursday took place just a few days before the publication of the European Commission monitoring report, which will state if the January 2007 accession date can be maintained as well as whether there is a need to use "safeguard clauses" in the areas in which the progress does not meet Brussels' expectations.
Mr Tăriceanu said that he expected a positive report from the Commission, hoping that no, or at least very few, areas of concern will be raised. He stressed that further progress will be made during the following months, so Romania can fulfil all the EU membership criteria.
Economic issues, the judicial system in Romania, minority rights, international adoption and agriculture were discussed during an extraordinary meeting of the Conference of Presidents. “Romania is functioning at its full capacity in order to fulfil the European commitments. These efforts will continue after the presentation of the European Commission Monitoring Report of 26 September and after the EU accession” was the message that Mr Tăriceanu conveyed to MEPs.
In the press conference that followed the meeting, EP President Josep Borrell noted that the Romanian PM's comments were warmly received by the leaders of the political groups. In response to a question, Mr Borrell added that there is no EU "enlargement fatigue" as far as Romania and Bulgaria are concerned.
What's next?
The Commission's report on whether Romania and Bulgaria have met the criteria for EU accession will be presented to the Parliament during the next plenary session in Strasbourg. The conclusions of the report will be voted on in Parliament in the 10-11 October part-session in Brussels.
In the Commission's previous report in May this year, Romania was given four "red flags" - areas of serious concern - where reform was still needed: three of them concerned agriculture (including the establishment of an agency to distribute farm subsidies and food safety). The fourth required tax administration IT systems to be ready for inter-operability with those of the rest of the Union.
Mr Tăriceanu visited the Parliament after his Bulgarian counterpart, Sergei Stanishev, met President Borrell and the leaders of the political groups two weeks ago during the first September plenary session in Strasbourg.
