European Strategic Energy Technology Plan needed to achieve 2020 energy climate objectives, say MEPs

MEPs say energy efficiency needs to be included in the European Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan in an own initiative report adopted by 596 votes in favour to 85 against and 14 abstentions. The report also makes recommendations to the Commission's SET Plan on the inclusion of intensified research into biofuels, and supports the plan to include research in nuclear power and carbon capture and storage (CCS).
The aim of the SET Plan is to improve the European innovation system on energy technologies, first by creating the framework conditions and incentives for the development of new energy technologies, and then by fostering the acceleration of the lab-to-market process.
In the report MEPs consider the SET Plan as "fundamental to achieving the EU's energy climate objectives for 2020", which include reductions in CO2 emissions, increasing the use of renewable energy and improvements in energy efficiency, if it has adequate financial support.
Nuclear energy, biofuels and energy efficiency
The report supports a list of industrial initiatives the Commission has drawn up, including one on research in nuclear power, and states that research and design resources should support both third and fourth generation nuclear technologies.
The report also supports the European Industrial Initiatives (EIIs) outlined by the Commission, but calls for biofuels research to be intensified under the programme so the overall environmental impact of the production of those fuels can be determined, and for energy efficiency to feature more prominently as "it is the area with the most potential for cost effective emission reductions in the medium term".
Support for research into carbon capture and storage
The report calls on the Commission to facilitate the realisation of up to 12 proposed CCS demonstration projects and believes that the development of CCS technology could play a role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, "provided its efficiency and safety is assured". The report also notes that support for clean coal technologies, such as coal to gas conversion, "will make it easier and cheaper to deploy CCS with the possibility of making it mandatory in the future".
Research and technology transfer
The report emphasises "the need to boost research in basic sciences such as biology, information technology, materials science and macro-technologies", "the need to improve the transfer of technologies from research centres and enterprises" and urges the private sector to invest more in research and assume greater risks.
Financing the SET Plan
MEPs stress that the SET Plan should not be financed through the reallocation of funds made available for energy under the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) and the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP), and encourage the Commission to urgently ensure adequate financing and support for new low carbon and zero carbon technology research and development, demonstration and commercialisation.
