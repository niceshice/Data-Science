Hillary Rodham Clinton, Secretary of State of the United States of America, will join European Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering at Parliament in Brussels this Friday, 6 March, for a discussion with an audience of young Europeans.
The “town hall” style event with questions and answers will be preceded by a bilateral meeting with President Pöttering, who will then introduce Secretary Clinton to the audience.
Access to the event is strictly by invitation only. Due to space restrictions, a pooling arrangement will be in place for audiovisual media wishing to cover the event. Europe by Satellite (EbS) will cover the Town Hall live and it will also be streamed on Parliament’s EPLive website and on EuroparlTV. Print journalists are advised to follow the discussion via EbS or in the EP Press Room.
Audiovisual media wishing to take part in the pool for coverage of arrivals/greetings and the Town Hall itself should contact Kirsten van Kampen in the EP Audiovisual Unit (details below) before 1800 on Wednesday.
Location and timing: Yehudi Menuhin hall, PHS building, Brussels - 10am, 6 March 2009
