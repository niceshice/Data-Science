Greek President calls for citizens to drive the future of Europe
2006-05-22 - 17:49
Speaking to MEPs in a formal sitting, Karolos Papoulias, President of the Hellenic Republic, said the democratic participation of Europe’s citizens in decisions about its future was essential - and that the European Parliament had a key role in bringing this about.
President Borrell welcomed the President of the Hellenic Republic, Karolos Papoulias, to the chamber, praising him as a man of peace and a man committed to building Europe. President Papoulias had, he said, constantly worked for peace including fighting the military dictatorship in his country and mediating in the Middle East at a crucial time. President Borrell described President Papoulias as a man who delivers what he promises and should therefore be an inspiration to everyone present.
The Future of Europe
President Papoulias said the European Union was founded out of the ruins of the Second World War for prosperity and progress, and was based on three principles: freedom, equality and humanitarianism. Freedom, he said, was linked to security and European Union citizens wanted to feel safe but not by compromising human rights and personal freedoms. Equality, he continued, was extremely difficult to achieve as there are many different ways of assessing it, whether one talks about the immigrants who want equal treatment with people of the host country, unemployed people who want equal opportunities or the poorer people who demand equal education and health care. He said that the European Parliament is the most important institution in the European Union, as it is democratically elected to reflect citizens’ concerns. He stressed that European citizens were the most important factors in the future of Europe as they will shape the future. Their participation was essential to building a European Union “superpower of humanitarianism” and it was the Parliament's role to ensure that their voices are heard loud and clear.
Enlargement
President Papoulias said that the enlargement in 2004 had caused a real shock in day-to-day Europe but the advantages outweighed the disadvantages. It had a great moral value as it symbolised the overcoming of the Cold War divisions and giving Europe roots in Eastern Europe as well as being neighbours with the Middle East. He said that he also welcomed enlargement into South Eastern Europe. He said his country was in favour of Turkish accession talks being successfully concluded, but this presupposes a full implementation of the EU’s processes and rules, which cannot be twisted in favour of geopolitical expediency.
He added that while the Cold War division had been overcome, the island of Cyprus is still divided along the Green Line, which was a major European problem waiting to be solved.
External Relations
President Papoulias said that the European Union needed to act in union and show a united force in all critical aspects of the world. He mentioned the Iraq war, where Europe had failed to unite. He said that it was clear that there had not been one voice, there had been open and sterile opposition among the countries with clear dividing lines. Europe, he said, needed more than a common currency or a common flag to unite the citizens. He stressed the need for common values and a common political culture. President Papoulias also mentioned the tension over Iran’s nuclear programme, saying diplomatic means were inexhaustible until an agreement is reached.

Better regulation, less red tape and a bigger voice for Parliament
2006-05-22 - 17:49
Parliament gave its backing to four reports concerning the better lawmaking initiative, following the Commission's communication on ‘Better regulation for growth and jobs in the European Union’, within the context of the Lisbon Strategy.
Better lawmaking 2004: application of the principle of subsidiarity - 12th annual report
Rapporteur: Bert Doorn (EPP-ED, NL)
This is the annual report prepared by the EP on the application of subsidiarity principle by the EU legislator. It also concerns the improvement of the impact assessment practices carried out by the Commission on every piece of legislation. The impact assessment aims to evaluate the effect of a EU law in social, economic and environmental terms.
The report backs the Commission's initiatives on the measurement of administrative burdens and the simplification of existing legislation under the "better regulation" principle. It stresses also the importance of improving the reputation of the EU law among the public. Nevertheless, it suggests the Commission to prepare clear guidelines on how to conduct the impact assessment by September 2006. It proposes that the evaluation on the impact assessment uniformity should be carried out by an independent agency. In its indent 12, the report says: "the European Parliament will not consider any proposals without their being accompanied by an independently scrutinised and approved impact assessment".
Monitoring the application of Community law (2003 and 2004) - overall position - 21st and 22nd annual reports
Rapporteur: Monica Frassoni (Greens/EFA, IT)
The report calls on the Commission to conduct a specific evaluation of the application of the annual priority criteria concerning future legislative proposals. Moreover, in the context of the "Monitoring the application of Community law" initiative, it proposes different options to the Commission to improve the conformity checking, i.e. the way Member States implement EU laws. The proposed solutions vary from a “name and shame list” to be regularly discussed in the competent committee in the EP, to regular sessions to be held with representatives of the Member States. Moreover, with regards to the citizens' right of direct complaint to the Commission in case a Member State did not correctly implement a legislation (that "represents an irreplaceable instrument for forming a consciousness of belonging to a community of law that goes beyond their State"), it proposes more transparency and better information to the public. Finally, MEPs asked for a citizens' friendly summary to be included in all legislative acts to improve people's understanding of the EU policy making.
A strategy for the simplification of the regulatory environment
Rapporteur: Giuseppe Gargani (EPP-ED, IT)
The report strongly backs Commission's proposal on the simplification of the EU law. It suggests improving the use of the following practices: the repeal of legal acts which have become irrelevant or obsolete, the codification of old directives to simplify the legislative texts and the recasting to update the EU law. All these measures should be carried out according to clear rules and procedures and should not lead to a re-writing of EU law outside democratic control. MEPs also approved an amendment that asked to take into account the economic, social, environmental and health aspects of legislation, when considering simplification.
Better regulation, less red tape and a bigger voice for Parliament
The European Parliament gave its backing to an own-initiative report on the implementation and impact of internal market legislation.
Noting that transposition and implementation of Community law continue to be a problem, the report urges the Council and the Commission to boost their monitoring capacity and to ensure compliance with EU regulations. Sanctions for non-compliance, notes the report, should be considered. The European Parliament wants to play a central role in any such monitoring process.
Better assessments make better lawmaking
Commission President Barroso has committed to scrapping legislative proposals that no longer seem to have a raison d´être and to do away with 'absurd' laws, noted rapporteur Arlene McCarthy (PES, UK). The better regulation process, she argued "must ensure that we do not end up with 'absurd' laws in the first place."
With that in mind, members voted to call on the Commission to set up an "independent audit body" to manage the quality and independence of impact assessments of EU law. The Parliament, warned MEPs, "will not consider proposals without their being accompanied by a quality impact assessment."
Although the EU institutions have committed themselves to the use of alternative methods of regulation, no formal mechanism exists to consult Parliament on the measures that will be delivered by alternative regulation. "This absence of checks and balances" -- reads the report -- "undermines the democratic prerogative of Parliament".
The own-initiative report was approved by an overwhelming majority of MEPs.
The 4 reports are "own initiative" and regard the "better lawmaking" initiative to make EU law clearer and thus more effective.

MEPs agree new criteria for withdrawing proposals for legislation
2006-05-22 - 17:49
Parliament adopted an own-initiative report on the outcome of the screening of legislative proposals pending before the Legislature drafted by Sylvia-Yvonne KAUFMANN (GUE/NGL, DE).
MEPs agreed following guidelines on the withdrawal and the modification of legislative proposals by the Commission:
(a) the Commission may, in principle, withdraw or modify a legislative proposal at any time during the procedures leading to its adoption as long as the Council has not acted. This means that in co-decision and cooperation procedures the Commission may no longer do so after the adoption of the common position by the Council unless, in its decision on the common position, the Council has exceeded its powers to amend the Commission proposal, so that the decision in reality constitutes a legislative initiative by the Council itself, for which the Treaty does not provide;
(b) where Parliament has rejected a legislative proposal or has suggested substantial amendments to it, or where Parliament has in some other way asked the Commission to withdraw or substantially modify a legislative proposal, the Commission shall take this position into proper consideration. If, for important reasons, the Commission decides not to follow the position expressed by Parliament, it shall explain the reasons for that decision in a statement to Parliament;
(c) where the Commission intends to withdraw or modify a legislative proposal on its own initiative, it shall give Parliament prior notification of its intention. This notification shall be given in good time, allowing Parliament the opportunity to give its view on the matter, and shall include a clear explanation of the reasons for which the Commission believes that a specific proposal should be withdrawn or modified. The Commission shall take the view of Parliament into proper consideration. If, for important reasons, the Commission decides to withdraw or modify its proposal, against the wishes of Parliament, it shall explain the reasons for that decision in a statement to Parliament.
MEPs welcome the Commission communication of 27 September 2005 and consider that the withdrawal or modification of the great majority of the proposals mentioned in it will in fact contribute to a simplification of the Community legislative environment. Parliament insists however that the Commission should take into proper consideration the objections raised by the President of the European Parliament.
Parliament welcomes the fact that, before adopting its final position, the Commission has again reviewed its proposals in the light of Parliament’s objections. The House acknowledges that, in every case in which the Commission has not accepted those objections, it has stated reasons for not doing so and that in some cases it has also indicated possible initiatives by means of which Parliament’s wishes could be met.
The report stresses that in future proceedings of this nature, the Commission should present specific reasons for the withdrawal or the modification of each proposal, and not confine itself to invoking general principles that do not clearly explain the reasons why the Commission believes that a specific proposal should be withdrawn or modified.
MEPs ask the Commission, immediately after it has been appointed, to draw up and submit to Parliament and the Council a list stating which of its predecessor’s legislative proposals it intends to retain. They also ask the Commission to include in its annual legislative and working programme a list of the proposals it intends to withdraw or modify, in order to allow Parliament to express its point of view in accordance with its prerogatives under the Treaties and the procedures laid down in the Framework Agreement of 26 May 2005.
Parliament recognises, however, that, within clear limits, the ability of the Commission to withdraw a legislative proposal during a procedure leading to its adoption
– flows from its right of legislative initiative and constitutes a logical complement to its ability to modify a proposal;
– may contribute to enhancing the role of the Commission in the legislative procedure, and
– can be considered as a positive element in ensuring that the procedures leading to the adoption of a Community act and the interinstitutional dialogue are aimed at promoting the ‘Community interest.

Food safety
Food safety: MEPs vote on health claims and additions to food
2006-05-22 - 17:49
MEPs approved tougher rules for foods claiming to provide nutritional and health benefits. They want clear definitions for claims that foods are "low energy", "low fat", "high fibre" or even "reduce cholesterol". The European Parliament also looked at harmonising national rules on the addition of vitamins and minerals to foods in order to improve consumer protection and the free circulation of goods within the EU.
The first report aims to harmonise the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States which relate to nutrition and health claims in order to ensure the affective functioning of the internal market whilst providing a high level of consumer protection.
The House adopted a legislative report by Adriana POLI BORTONE (UEN, IT) on nutrition and health claims made on foods. Agreement was reached between Parliament and the Austrian presidency on food health and nutritional claims. The key idea of the regulation is that there should be clear definitions for claims such as "low energy", "low fat", "high fibre" or even "reduces cholesterol".
Agreement between Council and Parliament at second reading
The EP / Council deal reinstates Article 4. The compromise states that nutritional profiles - the appropriate ratios of salt, sugar and fat in any given product - will be laid down by the Commission in consultation with the food industry and consumer bodies on the basis of information provided by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)
A producer can make a claim concerning one of the three ingredients (fat, sugar, salt - known as "profiles") if the other two ingredients also comply with the regulation or if it is clearly stated that the product has a "high content" of these ingredients.
Drinks containing over 1.2% of alcohol may not give as their only health claim the descriptions "reduction of energy content" or "low alcohol levels".
In the absence of specific Community rules regarding nutrition claims referring to "low alcohol levels" or "the reduction or absence of alcohol" or "energy content", relevant national rules may apply.
Accelerated procedure
A register of health claims authorised so far is to be compiled, allowing manufacturers who wish to introduce a product with a particular health claim to simply consult the register in order to know the rules to be observed and not to have to go through the authorisation process itself.
When a producer lodges an application, EFSA must give its opinion within 5 months. If the Agency demands further information from the applicant, a further 2 months is allowed.
Further points of the compromise
- fresh food such as fruit, vegetables and bread are excluded from the regulation; national rules will apply until (and if) Community standards are adopted;
- trademarks: these products can continue to be marketed for 15 years after the regulation's entry into force;
- foods used in a Member State before 1 January 2006 which are not included in the annex can continue to be used for 3 years after the regulation enters into force.
Other gains made by Parliament
- support for SMEs to help with comply with the regulation;
- products for children will be subject to the "authorisation" procedure.
Vitamins and minerals in food - agreement reached
MEPs adopted a second legislative report on vitamins and minerals in food. Agreement was reached with the Council, meaning the regulation can enter into force swiftly. The aim of the regulation is to harmonise divergent national rules concerning the addition of vitamins and minerals and of certain other substances to foods in order to ensure a high level of consumer protection and the free circulation of goods within the Community.
An agreement was reached with the Council, on Wednesday 10 May, on the report by Karin SCHEELE (PES, AT) on the addition of vitamins, minerals and certain other substances to foods. Five compromise amendments were agreed.
The amendments deal with the following subjects:
- the definition of “other substances";
- the extension of deadlines: the Commission must submit, within 2 years of the regulation’s entry into force, a proposal on maximum levels of vitamins and mineral substances that can be added to foods
- foods on the market before the regulation’s entry into force can continue to be sold up to the last day of the 35th month following its entry into force.
The addition of vitamins and minerals is banned in some Member States but allowed in others, with various restrictions. These different national rules mean it is sometimes difficult for “enriched” products to be sold freely in the EU single market. The purpose of the new regulation is to lay down standard EU rules.
The regulation sets out a positive list of over 100 forumulae for vitamins and minerals that can be added to foods. However, it bans their addition to unprocessed fresh foods such as fruit, vegetables, meat and fish as well as drinks and products with 1.2% alcohol by volume.
On 26 May 2005 Parliament adopted 46 amendments at first reading. These included a requirement for manufacturers to indicate the recommended daily intake of a product and warnings about exceeding such limits.
In December 2005, the Council adopted its common position, in which it did not accept some of Parliament’s main amendments. At the Environment Committee's second reading, MEPs voted by a large majority to reinstate these amendments.
Karin Scheele’s report stresses that any vitamins and minerals added must be “bioavailable”, in other words capable of being used by the body. Otherwise it would be misleading for the consumer and in extreme cases "could result in adverse affects on health". Although the Council has inserted a reference to the bio-availability of substances in the recitals (the preamble), it is still necessary to stipulate this in one of the articles of the legislation.
If absorbed in excessive amounts, vitamins and minerals can have damaging effects on health. Maximum safe levels therefore need to be laid down if they are to be added to food.
It is already planned that the food additives directive will lay down maximum levels but the relevant figures are not yet available. The report says that information for the consumer must be “easy to understand and useful”. It must give all relevant details needed to prevent excessive amounts of vitamins and minerals being ingested. The Commission is therefore urged, before adding the figures, to consult those concerned, including the food industry and consumer groups. Adopted text

Human rights
MEPs evaluate EU actions on human rights in the world
2006-05-22 - 17:49
The EU is a staunch advocate of human rights, inside and outside Europe. But does it practice what it preaches? In a resolution evaluating the annual EU report on human rights in the world in 2005, MEPs have a close look at specific EU actions in the world and find room for improvement.
The report, by Richard HOWITT (PES, UK), is a reaction to the EU Council's annual report on human rights in 2005. Contrary to previous years, the current report not only remarks on the general human rights situation around the world today, but expressly evaluates the EU's actions in human rights promotion. It singles out areas where the Council's activity deserves praise. These include the UK Presidency's efforts to combat the death penalty and promote freedom of expression and the Austrian Presidency's promise to "continue the practice of demarches in respect of all of the EU's international partners regarding the ratification of international conventions banning the use of torture."
MEPs welcome the inclusion of human rights issues in the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and commend the "increasing effectiveness of EU electoral observation activities." They praise the Council for imposing sanctions on Uzbekistan last year, and reiterate their condemnation of the violent repression in Ethiopia and human rights abuses in Tunisia.
Nevertheless, the report is concerned about the "deteriorating security situation in Darfur," "continuing reports of a long list of human rights abuses" in China, the "extrajudicial killings, disappearances and torture in custody in Chechnya," and "Iran's poor human rights record." There is also anxiety about human rights abuses in Iraq, but a welcome for EU support for the new government there. The Parliament asks Council and Commission to "call upon the US government immediately to close the Guantanamo detention centre" and give the prisoners held there a fair trial.
The report warns that "there is a general failure by the European Union to systematically and continuously address human rights concerns" and that "EU activities in the UN with respect to human rights are too introverted." MEPs want to see a much more significant proportion of European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights funding devoted to grass-roots projects. They want a "clear system of sanctions" to be applied to countries that violate the human rights clause in agreements with the Union. In addition, the Parliament is "concerned that countries with a poor human rights record have been elected as members of the UN Human Rights Council."
In future annual reports, MEPs want to see a list of "Countries of Particular Concern" according to the EU's Human Rights Guidelines. They call for the reports to "address explicitly discrimination issues" based on ethnicity, religion, gender, disability and sexual orientation. Finally, Parliament wishes to be more directly involved in the drafting of the annual reports, but wants to "continue to issue its own report in order to assess the EU's human rights policy and to exercise parliamentary control."

Human rights
Human Rights : Nepal, Sri Lanka and Taiwan
2006-05-22 - 17:49
As usual, the Strasbourg plenary session ended with three debates on human rights issues around the world. MEPs called for support for stabilisation in Nepal, condemned the latest attacks in Sri Lanka and asked that Taiwan be able to participate in the work of the World Health Organisation.
Nepal: encouraging a return to stability and democracy
On Nepal, Parliament strongly welcomes the return to democratic rule, which was achieved thanks to the engagement of millions of citizens in a people's movement. It conveys its deepest sympathy to the families of all who have lost their lives or have been seriously injured during the protests.
MEPs welcome recent developments in Nepal encouraging a return to political stability, including the restoration of Parliament, the establishment of an interim government on 2 May, the initiative to set up a Constituent Assembly to draft a new Constitution, the announcement of a unilateral three month's ceasefire and the reaffirmed commitment from the 7-party Coalition and the Maoists to the 12-point peace agreement of November 2005.
Parliament says the restoration of the sovereignty of the parliament's democratic authorities is only a first step towards real peace and a lasting democracy, and that substantial progress needs to be made in a number of areas in order to consolidate the situation, including: democratic control of the Royal Nepalese Army and local militia to end the human rights abuses; addressing the root causes of the conflict and ensuring that there is greater economic prosperity and a better redistribution of wealth for all throughout the country; respect for minority rights; the necessary devolution of power to the regional and local levels; a more representative electoral system.
MEPs encourage the Maoists to permanently renounce violence and to return to the political arena. They call for parliamentary elections to be held at an early stage, and suggests an EU election observation mission. In the meantime, they call for the sending of an ad hoc European Parliament delegation to assess the situation and to conduct talks with all relevant forces.
MEPs are deeply concerned about alleged extrajudicial killings, widespread torture, impunity and other human rights violations committed by both sides. They call on the Nepalese government and other parties to the conflict to do all in their capacity to ensure full and transparent investigations of human rights violations, including unresolved cases of forced disappearances, and insists that adequate sentencing of those convicted will be essential for the re-establishment of social peace. They stress that all restrictions on media freedom should be lifted immediately, and that all political prisoners, including journalists and human rights activists, should be released. Parliament welcomes the fact that the government has already revoked a number of controversial royal ordinances curbing press freedom and controlling non-governmental organisations.
MEPs reiterate support for the UN Office of Human Rights in Nepal which must continue to carefully monitor the human rights situation. They support Nepal's new government's decision to freeze the previous administration's purchase of military planes and weapons and the recruitment of soldiers, and call on the Council and the Member States to continue the freeze on all military aid. They further call on the international community to establish a Contact Group to be made up of Nepal's key partners and international organisations (the EU, the US, India and the UN), to provide coordinated international action with regard to Nepal. They propose that the European Parliament appoint a special rapporteur to monitor the situation.
Parliament calls on the Council, the Commission and the Member States to support the peace process by: assisting all armed groups to demobilise and disarm; using development and humanitarian assistance to consolidate peace and economic development; sending human rights observers; encouraging international financial institutions to give priority to macroeconomic stability and transparency, rather than forcing ambitious economic reform proposals on a fragile democracy.
MEPs urge the Council and Commission to work closely with the UN and other members of the international community to support the Nepalese Government on the road to democracy. They call on them to offer further technical, logistical and financial assistance to Nepal, including practical planning for a ceasefire monitoring mission in cooperation with other donors, should this be requested by Nepal.
They ask the Council to consider appointing a Special Representative for Nepal, with the aim of encouraging greater political engagement in Nepal on the part of the EU and to sharpen its political analysis and level of understanding during the delicate transition. They repeat their call for a follow-up to the 2002 London International Conference to be organised by the Contact Group of key partners, which should set out the principles and values needed to underpin a peace process in Nepal.
Parliament welcomes the plan of Nepali civil society activists to start the process by organising their own conference in Kathmandu this coming year. Finally, it calls on the Nepalese Government to protect Tibetan refugees in transit to India, and end the suspension of exit permits without delay.
Sri Lanka: Parliament condemns latest attacks
In its resolution on Sri Lanka, Parliament strongly welcomes the move by the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE to return to the negotiating table in February, and condemns, therefore, the LTTE's unilateral refusal to participate in the second round of negotiations in Geneva that were scheduled for April 2006. It urgently calls on the LTTE to resume peace negotiations with the Government of Sri Lanka without delay, to be prepared to decommission its weapons and to set the stage for a final political settlement of the conflict. It severely condemns the renewed campaign of attacks by the LTTE, the high level of human rights violations committed by both sides and the constant breaches of the ceasefire agreement.
MEPs deplore the gross violations of the Ceasefire Agreement by the LTTE through actions at sea, in particular the attack of 11 May on the Sri Lankan naval force, which resulted in many casualties and put SLMM monitors in grave danger. They call on the parties to the Ceasefire Agreement to ensure the security of the SLMM which is an unarmed body invited by both the Government and the LTTE to monitor the Ceasefire Agreement, in order to allow the mission to fulfil its mandate, and commend the contributing countries, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, for their invaluable work. They call on both the LTTE and the Government of Sri Lanka to refrain from further actions liable to jeopardise the peace process, and in particular attacks on civilians.
Parliament condemns the appalling abuse of children through the recruitment of child soldiers, which is a war crime, and calls on all rebel groups, and notably the LTTE to stop this practice, to release those it holds and to make a declaration of principle not to recruit any children in the future. It urges the Government of Sri Lanka to put into place legal measures to prevent and criminalise the practice. MEPs recognise that the LTTE does not represent all the Tamil peoples of Sri Lanka and calls on the LTTE to allow for political pluralism and alternate democratic voices in the northern and eastern parts of Sri Lanka which would secure the interests of all peoples and communities. It strongly condemns the particular repression against Tamil language press and Tamil organisations, and calls for a thorough investigation into the murders of Mayilvaganam Nimalarajan and Dharmeratnam Sivaram, as well as the two employees of the newspaper 'Uthayan'.
Parliament says Sri Lanka's recent election as a member of the UN Human Rights Council places an obligation on the government to manifest its commitment to uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights. It welcomes the announcement of new memebrs of the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission and stresses the need for an effective independent investigation into all alleged human rights violations by security forces or armed groups, bringing the perpetrators to justice in accordance with international fair trial standards, and insists that all parties should subscribe to comprehensive human rights agreements as a key element of future peace negotiations.
MEPs urge both sides, as an immediate gesture of goodwill, to cease the use of anti-personnel landmines and to assist in their removal. To this end, the Government of Sri Lanka should set an example by signing the Ottawa Convention and the LTTE should sign the Geneva Call 'Deed of Commitment'.
Parliament is worried that a deal to share international aid has still not been implemented and believes that aid sent to Sri Lanka by the EU and other international donors, in response to the tsunami must benefit the victims of that disaster without regard for their ethnic or religious denomination. It is concerned about the distribution and use of tsunami funds, which have not had the expected impact on the everyday lives of the victims or on Sri Lanka's recovery. MEPs note that the political gridlock on the 'Post-Tsunami Operations Management Structure' has already delayed the release of a further € 50 million in aid, hindering reconstruction work in the North and East of Sri Lanka.
Parliament deplores the fact that the demands of heavy defence costs have for many years diverted resources away from urgently needed investments in economic and social infrastructure in Sri Lanka. Finally, it calls on the EU Member States to do everything in their capacity in order to stop all illegal attempts by the LTTE to uphold a system of forced taxation among sections of the Tamil community living in the European Union.
Taiwan should be able to participate in the WHO
In a resolution adopted with 66 votes in favour, 21 against and one abstention, Parliament insists on better representation of Taiwan in international organisations and takes the view that it is unfair to continue to exclude more than twenty million people from the world community. It calls on the Director General of the World Health Organisation (WHO) to immediately include the Taiwan Centre for Disease Control as a participant in the WHO Global Outbreak and Alert Response Network, and to ensure the rapid exchange of relevant information on a regional and global basis.
MEPs call on the Director General and all WHO Member States to ensure that Taiwan has direct access to and can attend all technical meetings of the WHO which are relevant to the maintenance and improvement of public health in Taiwan and the rest of the world and, in addition, to allow Taiwan to meaningfully participate in the technical activities and events of the relevant Regional Office of the WHO.
Parliament also calls on the People's Republic of China to consider the possibility of observer status for Taiwan within the World Health Organisation or at least in the World Health Assembly as its most important decision-making body, in order to protect the health of the people of Taiwan, of international representatives and foreign employees on the island, and of the entire population of the globe. It reiterates its call on the Commission and the Member States to support Taiwan's application for observer status in the WHO. Link to adopted resolutions

Abbas: there is a Palestinian partner for peace with Israel
2006-05-22 - 17:49
The President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, addressed MEPs in a formal sitting on Tuesday. He stressed that there was a Palestinian partner for peace with Israel, and rejected unilateral solutions to the border question. He also called the new Palestinian government to "be given the chance to adapt to the basic requirements of the international community."
President Borrell welcomed Mahmoud Abbas to the plenary, thanking him for returning to Strasbourg so quickly after his abortive visit in March. "You have been in the eye of the storm in the Middle East at a decisive time for Palestinians and for the people of Israel, which will also have an impact on the whole region and the EU." He said the whole Parliament wanted to help foster a viable peace process: "If we don't do the right thing, we run the risk of seeing the world enter a period of wars of religion, which could plunge the Middle East into chaos."
Mr Borrell stressed that President Abbas had been actively seeking a peaceful two-state solution since the 1970s, before many of his people were ready to accept it. "No-one could harbour the slightest doubt of your commitment to peace and willingness to negotiate. Your legitimacy is clear from your election."
The EP President said Europe fully respected the results of January's legislative elections, even though these had caused serious concerns in the international community. "That community is starting to realise the dangers of cutting off aid. The Quartet meeting this week gave the EU responsibility for finding a mechanism for aid to the territories at least to keep public services running." He noted that the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly had warned of the chaos that could result if aid was cut off. The EU, he said, was the only body capable of talking to all parties at the same time. He told Mr Abbas: "You are the umbilical cord linking to the path of peace."
Mr Abbas took the floor, saying: "When I speak to you, I convey the message of the Palestinian people to representatives of nations in a continent with whom we share a permanent neighbourhood on the shores of the old sea and a history of continued, varied and interlinked relationships. We also share common objectives for a future of strengthened relations built across the waters of the Mediterranean with bridges that will promote cooperation and partnership in various fields, for innovative and fruitful interactions, and for a fertile dialogue between ancient civilizations that gives greater importance to human values, rejects extremist views, strengthens our historical neighbourhood and contributes to the creation of peace, prosperity and progress in the Mediterranean area."
Mr Abbas noted that yesterday (Monday, 15 May) the Palestinian people commemorated the 58th anniversary of the "Palestinian Nakba" in 1948 which represented the historical injustice when "we the Palestinian people, were uprooted from our land, forced into a diaspora, most of us were displaced and became refugees, and our firm national rights were denied."
"Despite the horror of the historical injustice inflicted upon our people, we were able to formulate a realistic policy to restore the rights of our people to self-determination. At early stages, European capitals were places where secret and public meetings between PLO officials and Israeli activists from the peace camp took place. It was a European capital, Oslo, that hosted the first official contacts between the PLO and the Israeli government and the initial signature of the first agreement in history between the two sides in 1993 before its official signing in Washington that same year.
When the Palestine National Council approved in 1988 the Palestinian peace initiative and accepted United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, it offered an opportunity to achieve a historical reconciliation. I must honestly say that this was not easy for our people. But as a leadership, and I recall here the role of our historical leader Yasser ARAFAT, it took courage to put forward a peace formula that enjoyed the support of our people on the basis of establishing a Palestinian state on 22 per cent of the land of historical Palestine, which represents the land occupied by Israel in 1967. Following the establishment of the Palestinian Authority, we continued our intensive search for peace. We repeatedly emphasised that the core of the process must be based on the principle of "partnership", a partnership committed to agreement and to the resolution of problems imposed by a legacy of a long, bitter and bloody conflict, a partnership that understands the legitimate concerns of the other and lays the foundations for a new and different future between Palestinians and Israelis.
The severest blow to the peace process, which was supposed to have reached its final stages within a few short years, was handed by the Israeli rejection of the logic of partnership and its insistence on practicing destructive policies, specifically of building settlements, constructing walls and confiscating land to create facts on the ground that prejudice the outcome of negotiations. The abandonment of commitments and agreements and the rejection of international patronage have become a main feature of Israel's policy, and have resulted in the lack of momentum in the peace process and the shaking of peoples' belief in its utility. This policy has developed in recent years to the level of attempting to completely destroy the Palestinian National Authority and its institutions, and to the systematic destruction of our basic infrastructure, which your countries contributed to developing.
For our part, and despite the state of frustration and suffering of a size and severity, I trust you realise and appreciate - those of you who have witnessed it closely - we were careful not to allow our national struggle to be diverted from its course and to protect its conformity with international law. We rejected and condemned all attacks against civilians and rejected terrorism in all its forms. We emphasised the importance of sanctifying a culture of peace, and the peaceful and popular nature of resisting occupation.
Sixteen months ago, the occupied Palestinian territory observed presidential elections after the death of late President ARAFAT, in which I ran with a clear platform: to declare a truce and emphasise adherence to negotiations as a way to resolve the conflict, to adopt a policy of reform in various fields, to strengthen democratic performance, to achieve a period of calm to foster security, and to promote the rule of law.
I am proud that the Palestinian people greatly entrusted me. Our work started immediately, with the agreement of all groups and factions, on a tahdia that provided for the first time in years an almost complete halt in armed attacks by Palestinians. But our Israeli counterpart responded with the continued destruction of the apartheid wall in the West Bank that divides our territories into scattered cantons, with continued assassinations, arrests and military incursions in our towns, villages and refugee camps, with tightening and suffocating sieges, and with the rejection of agreements and understandings, including the understanding reached in Sharm al-Sheikh after the presidential elections. In spite of all this, we engaged Israel's plan to withdraw from the Gaza Strip, ensured its smooth and calm implementation, and provided our ability to assume our own security responsibilities, especially in the border areas where monitors from the European Union assist us to ensure the proper functioning of the first border crossing in history that is fully administered by Palestinians.
Frustration at Israeli policies
The frustration created by the practices of the Israeli occupation and the absence of a positive outlook for the peace process formed the background for the legislative elections that took place last January. The entire world witnessed how the transfer of power was smoothly implemented and how we established the foundations and the tradition of a democratic process that we have no choice but to follow. We emphasise again that democracy remains without soul in the absence of people's freedom and the continued occupation. Over the past four months, we have been going through the unprecedented situation. The declared platform of the party that won the elections and formed the government does not conform to my platform and the commitments and prior agreements of the Palestinian Authority.
Our approach to dealing with this situation rests on the same concepts that led us to carry out elections on time. We are addressing this problem inside our institutions and in according with our laws and regulations. The good political activity in Palestine during the past few months is gradually producing a public opinion that emphasises respect for the agreements and commitments of the Palestinian Authority, and commitments to international law. I have asked the new government to amend its platform in order to conform to these commitments. We are in a continued dialogue that will take us to an expanded national dialogue in a few days. I hope that this will lead us to the required process of amendment.
Support of the International Community
Our approach needs the support of the international community. The new government must be given the chance to adapt to the basic requirements of the international community. Stopping assistance to the Palestinian Authority will exacerbate the deteriorating economic and social conditions and will weaken the network of efficient and working government ministries, administrations and institutions that the countries of the European Union have played a vital role in building and developing,. Here I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Quartet for its latest decision to resume providing assistance to the Palestinian people on the basis of a mechanism which will be developed under the EU leadership. And, in this regard, we call upon Israel to fully release our tax and customs revenue immediately. The EU can play a leading role here. We call for your assistance in achieving the immediate release of these funds.
The Israeli government is yet again repeating the slogan of "no Palestinian partner." You remember that they used this slogan in the past as an excuse to abandon agreements and to refuse to return to the negotiating table. We are gravely concerned for the future of peace in our region as we hear about Israeli projects that aim to draw the final borders of Israel inside the occupied Palestinian territory. These projects will foreclose the possibility of implementing the two-state solution by annexing large portions of the occupied Palestinian territory and render that which remains of it into scattered islands that lack geographical contiguity and vital water resources. The attempt to implement these unilateral projects will destroy any remaining hope to revive the peace process. It will also lead to another bitter era of tension and conflict for which peoples in this region have, for decades, paid a heavy price.
We ask that the international community act immediately in order to prevent the region from sliding into an abyss and a new cycle of conflict that will negatively impact the region and the world as a whole at a moment when our region is experiencing other tensions. Such action would be based on international law, the "Roadmap" and in the adoption of negotiations between partners as an alternative to the policy of unilateralism, diktat and the negation of the other. Such action would draw its justification and necessity from values that unify people in our region, such as the yearning for freedom, peace, development and modernisation that we also share with the people of Europe.
The claim that there is no Palestinian partner has no basis. I reiterate that, based on the constitutional power granted to me by our basic law which entrusts negotiation responsibility in the hand of the PLO Executive Committee, its President and its Negotiations Affairs Department, we remain fully committed to return immediately to the negotiating table to reach an agreement that ends this long conflict. When I spoke to Mr Ehud Olmert by phone to congratulate him on taking office a few days ago, I stressed our true desire to immediately return to the negotiating table."
1967 border
Concluding, President Abbas expressed his thanks to the European Parliament for their invitation to speak and their hospitality. "I believe that I have just spoken before friends who share with us the dedication to promote the values of freedom, democracy, tolerance and dialogue. I am confident that you will continue to support the just cause of the Palestinian people until we gain our freedom and build an independent state in the Holy Land on 1967 border next to the State of Israel."

Bolivian President Morales tells MEPs: "nationalisation is not expropriation"
2006-05-22 - 17:49
President Evo Morales of Bolivia told MEPs of his ambitions to tackle the engrained poverty in his country when he addressed a formal sitting of Parliament. He also stressed that his nationalisation of natural resources was essential to achieving these goals, but was not a matter on expropriation – he wanted to work in partnership with other countries and their firms.
Welcoming President MORALES to the Chamber, President BORRELL noted that EU – Latin American relations were both highly topical and important. He spoke of Mr Morales's early life in poverty, which had helped spur him to become president of what was the second poorest country in Latin America, despite having the second largest natural gas reserves. He noted that the nationalisation of the energy sector involved the investments of many European firms and was of great interest to MEPs. He said the European Parliament appreciated Mr Morales's visit, and noted Parliament's commitment to helping to build a fair and more prosperous society.
Evo Morales spoke of his pride at addressing the European Parliament as President of Bolivia, and of his willingness to listen in return. He said the native peoples of Latin America were peoples of dialogue, culture, balance and fairness: “My family and my people historically have been excluded, but we do not exclude others. We have been enslaved, but have never enslaved anyone else.” His election, he said, was an expression of hope in solving the social, cultural, economic and structural problems facing his country. After 100 days in government, already some 2,000 people had been taught to read, 50,000 undocumented families had been registered and 8,000 free eye operations had been carried out – but this was just a start. His political movement was for “an end to discrimination, a change of policies which tended towards extermination of native peoples. This is why I was elected. I was not able to go to university, but the greatest capital of the Evo Morales movement is honesty. Don't steal, don't lie, don't be weak are the three cosmic commandments which have brought me this far.”
Natural resources
Speaking of the nationalisation of the country's natural resources, he insisted this was not a matter of expropriation or expulsion. “I understand that your companies need a return on their investments, but you cannot own the resources – the state will control them. Companies will be our partners but not owners of natural resources. I regret that some parts of the media trying to create confrontation.” He said cooperation was needed to solve Bolivia's problems – and Europe's: “Europeans have problems with migration, many people come from Bolivia – the only way to solve is to create jobs in Bolivia,” by creating markets for farmers and small community businesses.
Regarding coca cultivation, he said that Bolivia played no part in cocaine culture or drug smuggling. This was a new problem which had been imported. It needed to be fought, but this fight should not be used as an instrument for re-colonisation or oppression: “There is a country; there are countries, that use this as a way to subordinate others to their will.” Cocaine, however, was not the same as coca, and he proposed that coca farming should be allowed but limited to 40 square metres per farmer. He said that Europe needed to keep control of chemical precursors and banking secrecy: “The real drug smuggler is moving billions of dollars around. Not in a suitcase - he works through private banks...”
Admiration for the EU
President Morales spoke of his admiration for the EU as a symbol of democracy, and of his desire to work together with neighbouring countries in the Andes and Latin America. He spoke of his nation's decision to “re-found our country and get away from economic models which have not solved our problems... We are fighting for democracy though peaceful revolution, without confrontation. We understand that businesses want legal security, but for that there also needs to be social security, health, housing and jobs.” Integration with regional partners also meant building roads – literally, since there was only one metalled road leading to a neighbouring country, Peru. Mr Morales stressed his respect for President Lula of Brazil: “We see him as a big brother and want to follow his lead.” He also called for the extradition from the USA of ex-Bolivian president Gonzalo Sánchez Lozada.
The Bolivian President stressed the importance of environmental protection, saying we needed to work together to protect Mother Earth.
He stressed that he was no-one's puppet, and that he wanted to mark and end to the past practice of Bolivia being a “beggar state” whose president went abroad to ask for budgetary support. Having recovered ownership of the country's natural resources, he hoped to export more at a better price and help support the solution of the social and cultural problems of his nation. He said he wanted to be able to count on the support of the EU in this endeavour.
Thanking President Morales for his address, Josep Borrell remarked that he had spoken wisely, and wished him every success in fighting for the prosperity of his people, who had shown their support by making him their democratically elected representative.

Development policy: Parliament must keep co-decision powers
2006-05-22 - 17:49
In adopting the report of Gay Mitchell (EPP-ED, IE), the plenary proposed that the European Parliament should maintain its co-decision power for decisions on priority policies, threatened by the creation of a single instrument for the co-operation of development and industrialised countries. Without restructuring the Commission's proposition, Parliament would have lost its co-decision power in 16 existing areas of regulation on 1 January 2007.
Parliament is determined to maintain its powers as co-legislator in strategic priorities, geographical and thematic aid programmes, which the European Commission desires to be determined by the comitology procedure. Co-decision also applies to multi-annual financial framework.
In line with the Millennium Development Goals, Parliament has limited the scope of the instrument to the developing countries. Cooperation with industrialised countries will be dealt with in a separate agreement. At the time of yesterday's debate the European Commission had accepted this claim.
On the question of aid funding, MEPs stated that budgetary support should receive the support of the Court of Auditors and the parliament of the partner country. Any suspension of aid must be decided by the Council of Ministers by a qualified majority after the European Parliament has been consulted.
During the debate, the rapportuer Mr Mitchell and the President of the Committee on Development, Luisa Morgantini (GUE/NGL IT) announced the setting up of a new working group which will determine Parliament's position even before the Council agrees on its common position. Adopted text

EU Solidarity Fund: money to be available for public health crises, acts of terrorism and technological disasters
2006-05-22 - 17:49
MEPs voted to enlarge the scope of the EU Solidarity Fund (EUSF) to include the consequences of terrorist attacks, major health crises and major environmental, industrial and technological disasters. Parliament adopted a report dealing with the draft regulation for the renewed EUSF from 2007.
In 2002, following major floods in Central Europe, the EUSF was created in order to respond to such events within the EU and the countries taking part in accession negotiations. The objective of the fund is to ensure an efficient response to major disasters or public health emergencies, independent of their nature and origin. The original EUSF ends in 2006 and Rolf BEREND's (EPP-ED, DE) report sets out how what criteria should apply to the new EUSF to start in January 2007. The EUSF may grant financial assistance to Member States or candidate countries totalling up to €1 billion per year.
MEPs define the term "disaster" to mean any major destructive event that causes serious harm to the population and the environment, such as flood, fire or drought.
Threshold for intervention lowered - political judgement still possible
Parliament backs the Commission's proposal to lower the threshold for financing the recovery process following a natural disaster. For the new EUSF, the thresholds are reduced from €3 billion or 0.6% of GNI of the affected country to €1 billion or 0.5% respectively. Despite these specific amounts, MEPs say that the Commission may, in exceptional and duly justified circumstances, recognise that a major disaster has occurred on a specific territory of an eligible state and therefore use the Fund.
Wider scope for funding
Financial assistance from the EUSF, says the House, should be granted for operations carried out by the public authorities of the state concerned, and which include the following categories:
- essential emergency operations necessary for the immediate restoration to working order of infrastructure and plant, creation of emergency infrastructure to guarantee the immediate supply, in the fields of energy, drinking water and waste water, telecommunications, transport, health and education;
- to satisfy the population’s needs;
- immediate medical assistance and measures to protect the population in the event of a major health crises;
- essential emergency operations for the immediate tackling of natural disasters or their immediate impact, as well as the immediate securing of preventive infrastructures;
- immediate medical assistance to the direct victims of major disasters and terrorist attacks as well as psychological and social assistance to them and their family. In cases of terrorist attacks the EU should, says the Parliament, react to events even where the material damage does not reach the threshold for mobilisation of the Fund but the consequences of the attack are so serious that Community solidarity becomes imperative.
Polluter pays
Parliament says the ‘polluter pays’ principle should apply, particularly in the event of industrial and technological disasters. Beneficiary States must therefore prove that they are seeking all possible compensation from third parties. The Solidarity Fund must not, according to MEPs, relieve culprits of their liability. The Member States should therefore create an effective legal framework so, where possible, those responsible are held liable for industrial accidents.
Finally MEP say that the beneficiary State should clearly inform the population directly concerned and the general public about assistance received from the Fund. Adopted text

New EU wide strategies to tackle natural disasters
2006-05-22 - 17:49
The EU would be better able to tackle natural disasters such as floods, drought and fires through improved coordination at European level, according to a series of reports adopted by MEPs on Thursday. They suggest a range of measures including the setting up of a European Civil Protection Force, an agriculture disaster fund, funds to relieve the suffering of disaster victims, restrictions on monoculture and increased reforestation. MEPs also want tougher fines for fire starters.
Regional aspects
Parliament says the Commission should submit a proposal on a European strategy to combat natural disasters. It is calling for the setting up of a "European Civil Protection Force" and a European Monitoring Centre for drought and desertification. Parliament wants compensation to be made available to natural disaster victims and their families - and also to farmers whose crops are destroyed.
In a report adopted by 498 votes in favour 35 against 20 abstentions by the committee Chairman, Gerardo Galeote Quecedo (EPP-ED, ES) on natural disasters, MEPs point out that fires once again destroyed thousands of hectares of forest in 2005 and have cost the lives of more than 30 civilians and firemen, and the phenomenon – which has become an annual scourge for the regions and countries affected – is getting worse.
In response, the House says that that Commission should draw up a European strategy to combat natural disasters. It should include a compulsory approach for comprehensive risk prevention and devise a technical protocol for joint action by the Union.
MEPs say a survey should be done of the locations which are most vulnerable to fires and to prolonged droughts - and also of the resources available at those locations. The House calls for the creation of a "European Civil Protection Force". Specifically on forest fires, MEPs consider that within the 2007-2013 financial framework, a Community forest-fire protection programme must be designed to promote adequately funded forest-fire awareness-raising, prevention and risk-management initiatives dovetailing with agricultural- and structural-policy measures.
Call for directives on fire prevention and management of drought and desertification
Parliament says the Commission should propose a directive on prevention and management of fires in the EU to best use available Community and national resources for the problem. It says a similar proposal on the prevention and risk management of drought and desertification is equally necessary. MEPs also call for a European Drought and Desertification Monitoring Centre to be set up.
Compensation
MEPs urge the Commission to make available the resources needed to relieve suffering and satisfy the material needs of all the victims of natural disasters and their direct families, by means of the European Solidarity Fund and other Community instruments. They also call for an agriculture disaster fund to compensate any loss of income stemming from crops losses of farmers affected by natural disasters.
Improved Community action needed against natural disasters - Agricultural aspects
A report on the agricultural aspects of natural disasters drafted by Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos (PES, PT) also passed by a large margin today (397 votes in favour 70 against and 26 abstentions).
The report suggests "eligibility criteria that are better adapted to the circumstances of natural disasters, including drought and frost" for the EU Solidarity Fund, as well as the introduction of a flexibility clause that would allow unspent CAP money to be made available for disaster relief. MEPs also affirm that "serious market crises constitute unforeseen and exceptional events which expose farms to risks that may be as great as those caused by natural disasters" and that compensation for these should also be envisaged. In addition, the report "believes that the drawing up of risk maps and management plans should not be restricted to flooding […] but should cover drought and forest fires" as well. Parliament maintained its support for measures aimed at reducing the combustibility of forests and reiterated its call for the establishment of a European forestry strategy that would contain viable management measures and preventive actions for natural catastrophes.
Learning to cope with natural disasters - Environmental aspects
The natural disasters of 2005 made a deep impression on MEPs, who have responded with various proposals and appeals for more preventive measures. When MEPs resumed work in September 2005 following the summer recess, they commemorated the victims of fires and floods in Europe and then - on 8 September - adopted a resolution which led to three own-initiative reports, on the agricultural, environmental and territorial aspects of natural disasters.
Parliament prepared for these reports by sending fact-finding delegations to Germany, Austria, Spain, Portugal, France and Italy. In addition, a public hearing was held on 20 March. Also in March MEPs adopted a report by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL, EL) on civil protection and in May they will adopt a report by Rolf Berend (EPP-ED, DE) on the new Solidarity Fund.
This report on the environmental aspects adopted with 450 votes in favour 38 against and 13 abstentions highlights the role of climate change in aggravating natural disasters but refuses to accept that nothing can be done. Instead it suggests ways of managing the countryside better, in particular forests, as well as technical prevention measures.
MEPs believe there is often not enough coordination at European level of the measures taken in response to disasters. They want to see more sustainable water management as well as awareness campaigns which would be conducted and financed by the European Social Fund or by specific programmes such as Forest Focus.
They also call on the Commission to co-finance the building of infrastructure and the acquisition of technological equipment for fighting forest fires. Examples would be satellites and other leading technologies for prevention, detection and help to extinguish fires. To combat floods and desertification, monocultures should be restricted and reforestation encouraged. The areas of the Natura 2000 network affected by fires or floods should also be restored using Community funds.
As many fires are not caused by natural disasters but by vandalism, MEPs want to see tougher penalties imposed for such crimes.

Member States' fiscal policies under attack
2006-05-22 - 17:49
Parliament has adopted a report which strongly criticises national governments for failing to get a grip on public spending and refusing to improve coordination of economic policy.
In the report, originally drawn up by Dariusz Rosati (PES, PL), MEPs express their concern about the persistently slow growth in Europe since 2002, substantially below long-term potential, constrained by structural rigidities, weak internal demand, and a lack of proper balance in the macro-economic policy mix. They warn of the risks of rapid adjustments to global imbalances which might lead to a drop in US demand, with lower exports and weakening growth in the EU.
Parliament says stable, outward-looking and competitive macro-economic policy setting is a necessary precondition for sustainable public finances. It supports the reorientation of public policies and expenditure towards innovation and education.
MEPs say that the incorrect application of the Stability and Growth Pact means that there has been no significant improvement in the Member States’ fiscal positions since last year. They stress that it is vital to correct public deficits, saying that they are impeding economic recovery and making the cycle more acute. Parliament is calling for a much more ambitious reduction in public deficits in 2006 that a mere economic adjustment made in anticipation of higher growth.
The report warns that the lack of political will to contain spending, overoptimistic revenue projections, creative accounting and fiscal consolidation based mainly on one-off measures have largely contributed to budgetary slippage. Calling for improved statistical governance, MEPs also want greater transparency about implicit liabilities such as public sector pension commitments.
Parliament deplores the lack of policy coordination in the euro zone, notably the divergence of fiscal policies, and is concerned at the possible antagonistic effects of the lack of coordination. It calls on the Eurogroup chairman to propose a detailed plan for the duration of his term in office, with regular reports on the level of implementation achieved. Finally, MEPs call on the Member States to meet their obligations under Article 99 of the Treaty to regard their economic policies as a matter of common concern and to coordinate these policies.

Parliament endorses appointment of Jürgen Stark to the ECB Executive Board
2006-05-22 - 17:49
MEPs have approved the appointment of Jürgen Stark to the Executive Board of the European Central Bank. Mr Stark, currently vice-president of the German Bundesbank, has been nominated to replace Otmar Issing.
By voting in a secret ballot with 359 votes in favour to 110 votes against with 35 abstentions, MEPs agreed with the position of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, which, after a hearing on 18 April, recommended the endorsement of Mr Stark.
According to Article 112 of the EC Treaty, members of the ECB Executive Board are appointed "by common accord of the governments of the Member States at the level of Heads of State or Government, on a recommendation from the Council, after it has consulted the European Parliament and the Governing Council of the ECB." The ECB Governing Council has already given a positive assessment in this case.

Enlargement
Commission: Romania and Bulgaria can join EU in 2007 if they resolve remaining failings
2006-05-22 - 17:49
Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn announced to Parliament that Bulgaria and Romania should be able to join the EU on 1 January 2007 if they take action to address a number of outstanding problems. The Commission will make a new report in October on whether that target date can be met.
Mr BARROSO said the Commission had taken this decision after an extensive process of review and dialogue with stakeholders. The EU, he said, must honour its existing commitments, but also be rigorous in applying the conditions: "Since October last year, both governments have worked extremely hard and have made progress. However, some important issues need to be addressed. Further progress needs to be made in the field of Justice and Home Affairs. Romania and Bulgaria should be prepared for membership by 1 Jan 2007 provided they address a number of outstanding areas."
The Commission President stressed the need for judicial reforms and fight against corruption. There needed to be fully functioning justice systems equipped to fight corruption and organised crime. Both countries had shown determination and should receive credit for reforms already achieved. Bulgaria, he said, still needs to demonstrate results on the fight against corruption, especially at high level, including follow up with judicial proceedings and on the independence of judiciary. It needed to step up efforts in fighting organised crime. Romania also needs to fight against corruption, in particular with judicial proceeding following up investigations.
As regards the acquis, there were still some serious concerns regarding agriculture, food safety, veterinary matters, justice and home affairs and finance. "They need to be in position to implement EU policies on accession. We expect them to take immediate corrective action."
The Commission, he said, would review outstanding issues no later than early October: "the EU must signal that it stands ready to honour its commitment. Practical conditions for accession must continue, including the ratification of the treaties."
Mr Barroso added that he and Commissioner Rehn would be travelling to Bucharest and to Sofia on Wednesday and Thursday to explain the decision in detail.
Commissioner REHN said the Cassandras had been proved wrong about the 2004 enlargement. The Commission's goal, he said, was to welcome Romania and Bulgaria to the EU in 2007 and that it was its duty to ensure that they really meet the conditions. The monitoring process had been unprecedented in scope and intensity.
As well as the points made by Mr Barroso, Mr Rehn mentioned the need for progress on human rights and minority rights. The transformation of the economies of the two countries had been a remarkable success, he said.
In those areas where there were shortcomings, safeguards could be invoked if certain limited problems persist at moment of accession, with a monitoring mechanism to follow.
"I trust today's carefully calibrated decision and its rigour will convince national parliaments which have not yet ratified to due so. The Treaties ensure that they can only join once they are ready, and that they must respect their obligations as members," he said. "This constructive, transparent and rigorous approach will bring best results for Bulgaria, Romania and Europe."
Political group speakers
EPP-ED group leader Hans-Gert POETTERING (DE) first criticised the absence of Council representatives in the debate. His group, he said, welcomed the fact that Bulgaria and Romania were on their way to membership "What a huge achievement this is for Romania and Bulgaria after 45 years of communism, waste and mismanagement - they have turned themselves into states based on the rule of law." He asked the two countries to understand criticism not as sermonising, but as a desire to make it a success for all concerned. "We want to be able to say with a clear conscience in October that they are ready for 2007." He said public concerns about enlargement should be addressed by accentuating the positive, setting out the great successes of earlier enlargements. Finally, he stressed the need for progress on the EU constitutional project.
For the Socialist group, Martin SCHULZ (DE) said there had been significant process. "Our position is that if there are no major obstacles, then 1 January 2007 actually is the date. We are pleased the Commission is working on the basis that they will join on that date." Mr Schulz stressed the need for the Commission to spell out the remaining shortfalls in great detail to the governments concerned, so they could be sure of what they needed to do. He said it was important for the EU to have stable and successful members in a region bordering on much less stable areas.
ALDE group leader Graham WATSON (UK) paid tribute to the Enlargement Commissioner and to the European Integration Ministers of the two countries. "We believe we should not revisit these decisions except in the gravest of circumstances - Romania and Bulgaria should be judged no more or less harshly than previous applicants." The concerns on corruption and the rule of law, and the ill treatment of the Romany people, he said, should be taken seriously - the failures should be put right without delay. He pointed out, however, that some present Member States were not flawless. Calling enlargement the EU's greatest success story, he called on individual Romanian and Bulgarian citizens to make a personal commitment to winning the battle against corruption. "We should demonstrate that Romania and Bulgaria do not walk alone," he concluded.
Daniel Marc COHN-BENDIT (Greens/EFA, DE) said that the Commission was being too idealistic saying that the problems in Bulgaria and Romania will sort themselves out. While he was in favour of enlargement, he did not support the current enlargement process. It was not a question, he said, of saying yes or no, it was a question of whether they are ready or not. And if they are not ready, they should not become members of the European Union in 2007.
Jaromír KOHLÍČEK (GUE/NGL, CZ) said that the Copenhagen Criteria set out three criteria that needed to be fulfilled in the last enlargement. It already discriminated against the 2004 new members compared to the old 15 but the points raised in the Commission's report are an even harsher discrimination, demanding, for example, the dismantling of a nuclear power plant on which many citizens, even in the current EU, rely. He asked the question - what the European Union will give to these countries?
Bastiaan BELDER (IND/DEM, NL) said that he had always been in favour of overcoming the Cold War divisions but he believed in separate assessments of Bulgaria and Romania. He stressed that the commitment to change was not enough but that the countries needed to change before one can set a date for accession.
Brian CROWLEY (UEN, IE) said that the European Union should give the countries a very clear signal. They were not allowed to join in 2004 so they needed to be considered properly now. He said that the current 25 should not lecture Bulgaria and Romania but should share their experiences and ideas. Bulgaria and Romania should join if they fulfil the fundamentals of the European Union.
Andreas MÖLZER (NI, AT) said that the European Union's citizens' concerns were not being taken into account. He said that the current mechanisms of enlargement were not effective as Bulgaria and Romania have all sorts of problems that cannot be resolved in a few months and it is not in the interest of neither the European Union nor these two countries if one pushed their membership through too quickly.
United Kingdom speakers
Baroness NICHOLSON OF WINTERBOURNE (ALDE, UK) said it would be difficult to play cards against Commissioner Rehn because he holds his cards close to his chest and plays the trump card at the very last minute. However, Baroness Nicholson said that Commissioner Rehn was playing the cards on behalf of Romania and Bulgaria and that 1 January 2007 would be D-Day or "delivery day". Indeed, Baroness Nicholson said she would be booking her flight to Bucharest for 31 December 2006. "Inevitably, there are problems", she said, in particular pointing to human trafficking from Eastern Europe and Russia through the two countries. More needed to be done to combat this.
Geoffrey VAN ORDEN (EPP-ED, UK), rapporteur on Bulgaria, recalled that the Accession Treaty on Bulgaria states that there has to be a unanimous decision of the Council to postpone enlargement by one year. "No such recommendation had been made". Bulgaria, he said, fulfilled the conditions for accession on 1 January 2007 and noted that their unemployment rate was now lower than in Germany. The sixteen areas of serious concern outlined by the Commission in October had been reduced to six. Nevertheless, more action was needed to combat organised crime, fraud and corruption. Many crime bosses were still at large. The police, he said, would need further resources for this. Secondly, more action was needed to ensure effective financial management structures were in place to ensure that the Structural Funds could be spent properly. The Council in its Summit in June, he said, should endorse 1 January 2007 as the date for accession for Bulgaria. In other words, it was a case of: "Yes, but to some extent".
Nigel FARAGE (IND/DEM, UK) said that "we should stop the farcical pretence that Romania and Bulgaria would join the EU because it met the criteria". They would join for political reasons. People, he said, had lost confidence in the EU. The two countries joining would be a victory for the political classes and a victory for the politicians in Romania and Bulgaria and he quipped "we should welcome them onto the EU gravy train". Mr Farage also said that an open immigration policy with countries having vastly different GDPs was not sustainable. The UK's public services could not sustain further mass migration from Romania and Bulgaria and he also pointed out that Romania and Bulgaria would lose many talented people. "It would all end in tears".
Charles TANNOCK (EPP-ED, UK) said that enlargement was one of the greatest success stories for the EU. It had been a great success despite the concerns expressed over mass migration and a lack of a Constitution. Romania and Bulgaria represented the fifth and a half wave of enlargement as they originally were supposed to join at the same time as the EU-10. Nevertheless, the scale of the tasks facing the two countries after enlargements should not be underestimated. High level indictments and convictions would be helpful in Bulgaria to underline the fight against corruption. It may be helpful to invoke the one-year safeguard clauses after enlargement for Bulgaria in the area of justice and home affairs. Mr Tannock raised two specific points: he called on Romania to settle its maritime border dispute with Ukraine over Snake Island and, secondly, he called on the Romanian government to reconsider its position on inter-country adoptions.
Arlene McCARTHY (PES, UK) said that her country was pro-enlargement to Bulgaria but her region was against because of the case of Michael Shields who was convicted of a violent attack in Bulgaria. Recalling that a confession made in the UK by another Liverpool man, was not accepted by the Bulgarian courts, Mrs McCarthy said that a fair trial had not taken place and called on the Bulgarian authorities to take up the offer of assistance from the UK government. Any EU Member State can make a mistake but the important thing is to try and rectify it.
Commission's response to the debate
Responding to the debate, Commissioner Rehn said he perceived overall support for the Commission's basic approach that 1 January 2007 was possible if the countries target their remaining shortcomings. "We are for both the target and sticking to the conditions with rigor," he said. He insisted the remaining conditions were achievable and said the report contained a clear "to-do" list, which he and Mr Barroso would be explaining in person in Bucharest and Sofia in the days ahead. He gave an example of the need for Bulgaria to implement the digital photographic mapping of agricultural land in order to manage direct farm payments. Regarding a possible postponement, he said the conclusion of Commission report says: "We shall assess by early October whether the two countries have been able to address remaining shortcomings and take a stance on whether the date can be maintained. The Commission reserves the right to consider use of the safeguard clause of postponement if shortcomings are not addressed - which is do-able if they make the efforts needed. Our aim is January 2007, our duty is to see they join when they meet the criteria. This is the best way to make a success of the process for Bulgaria, Romania and Europe."
(The debate continued without the presence of Commissioner Rehn)
Irish speaker
Mairead MCGUINNESS (EPP-ED, IE) spoke of the official opening in Romania today of protected homes for 100 vulnerable people as part of a partnership between the Romanian government, local councils and Irish NGOs. The focus on the plight of disabled people may not have been welcomed by the government there, but if it had helped to improve their situation it was a good thing, she said. "The problem of trafficking has been identified by the Commission, and all Member States, including my own, need to do their utmost to solve this problem. I believe the two countries will accede in January."

Transport
All the way for Marco Polo II
2006-05-22 - 17:49
If no action is taken, total road freight transport in Europe is set to grow by more than 60% by 2013. Parliament therefore adopted, by a large majority, the report by Reinhard RACK (EPP-ED, AT) on the Marco Polo II programme. This programme for 2007-2013 aims at shifting the average yearly increase of international road freight towards short sea shipping, rail and inland waterways. The adoption of this first reading report concludes the procedure and means that it will enter on 1 January 2007.
The environmental performance of the freight transport system is expected to improve substantially by Marco Polo II, which has a budget of €400 million. The Commission had proposed €740 million, but this amount was reduced to €400 million following an agreement between Council and Parliament.
Although the Commission proposals were warmly welcomed, the House adopted a range of compromise amendments tabled by EPP-ED, PES, ALDE, Greens/EFA and UEN groups aimed at strengthening the effectiveness of the programme. The reduction of the eligibility thresholds, for instance, should be reduced and SMEs should have better accessibility to Marco Polo II. The geographical coverage of the programme is the 25 EU Member States, the applicant countries, EFTA and EEA countries to the East such as Russia and Ukraine, the Balkan states as well as the Mediterranean region.
An important part of Marco Polo II is also traffic avoidance which involves encouraging the rationalisation of traffic, logistics and supply chains. The incentives have already been there for a long time in the industry. The EU's role here consists of providing encouragement and exchanging experience and best practice.
A new development is the introduction of the so-called Motorways of the Sea (MoS) action, which means any innovative action directly shipping freight from roads to short sea shipping or a combination of short sea shipping with other modes of transport. A proper use of the MoS should mean that traffic flows that normally go over land can be strategically diverted and brought closer to destinations.
The adoption of this first reading report in agreement with Council concludes the co-decision procedure after agreement was reached with Council and the Marco Polo II programme will enter info force on 1 January 2007 as planned.

Mad cow disease: ten years later, vigilance the watchword
2006-05-22 - 17:49
Even though British beef is permitted on French plates again, a new regulation on transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) has been voted on in the first reading between the Council and the European Parliament.
Through the report of Dagmar ROTH-BEHRENDT (PES, DE), MEPs have strengthened both passive and active surveillance measures. They notably wished to specify the annual surveillance programmes more, to include all cattle older than 24 months to be sent for emergency slaughter and those aged more than 30 months to be slaughtered in normal conditions, to have stricter supervision of possible subsequent modifications (for example the listing of materials of specific risks, such as the brain, the spinal cord etc.) and to require detailed justifications of scientific committees responsible for these modifications.
The European regulation attunes to the International Office of Epizootics' decision, of 167 Member States, in May 2005 to reduce the categories of risks related to BSE from five to three: negligible risk, controlled risk and undetermined risk, being the highest level.
No meat but fish for young ruminants
Bovine spongiform encephalopathy broke out as meat-based flour was introduced into cattle's feeding, which today is forbidden. The new regulation upholds this ban: "It is necessary to uphold the ban on using animal proteins in ruminants feeding in ways that are not part of their natural food." At the end of the compromise the European Commission can decide to authorise the use of proteins derived from fish in young ruminants feeding.
Finally, when a case of BSE is discovered the whole herd is usually slaughtered. The MEPs believe that slaughtering of cohorts could be avoided under strict controls, by using animals that seem healthy until the end of their production life; no scientific proof has shown BSE to be transmitted by milk or to cattle's offspring.
This text defines the import and export regulations on the common market as well as with third countries. Member States or Member States' regions - likewise even third countries or third countries' regions - which pose an undetermined risk of BSE are not permitted to neither export food intended for animal breeding which contains mammal proteins nor food intended for consumption by mammals to the Community (amendment 49).
In return the MEPs believe that consumption of mechanically separated meat ("obtained by removing the meat from the bone in a way that the fibre structure of the muscles is destroyed or modified") by human beings should be re-examined. Text adopted

Budget
Long-term budget makes its way through European Parliament
2006-05-22 - 17:49
The European Parliament approved the EU's budget for the coming seven years, but underlined the need to resolve a number of shortcomings, including funding, during the budget review in 2009. Following Parliament's approval, it was signed into law by the EP, Commission and the Council. MEPs welcome the extra €4 billion to be used on EP priorities, but said the higher figures approved by Parliament last June would have offered the best way of funding EU policies.
The agreement was signed by European Parliament President Josep Borrell, Austrian Federal Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel for the EU Presidency, and by the European Commissioner responsible for Financial Programming and Budget, Dalia Grybauskaite.
The report, adopted by Parliament with 440 votes in favour, 110 against and 35 abstentions and drawn up by Reimer BÖGE (EPP-ED, DE), stresses the main points of the deal of 4 April: four billion euros will be redistributed to a range of programmes and, following the 2009 European elections, Parliament will have the chance to vote on the budget review carried out by the Commission, a review in which Parliament will be closely involved (see our press release of 5 April - link at bottom of this page).
A key point, say MEPs is that the political agreement reached on 4 April is the "only possible compromise that Parliament could achieve…with a view to guaranteeing the continuity of EU legislation". However, the deal will also ensure that the EU budget is soundly managed and will preserve Parliament's legislative and budgetary powers over the period 2007-2013. Parliament comments on the outcome of the European Council of December 2005 and makes clear its belief that national interests overrode common European goals when the Member States adopted their position on the FP.
Among the shortcomings identified by the draft report is the system of own-resources, which MEPs say should be revised to "avoid the same painful experience of national bargaining for the next Financial Perspective". Lastly, the House adds that it still believes the higher figures adopted in June 2005 offered the best way of funding Community policies.
Parliament also voted on a report by Sérgio SOUSA PINTO (PES, PT) which gives the formal go-ahead for Parliament to sign the Inter-Institutional Agreement needed to establish the new Financial Perspective.
Key speakers in debate preceding the vote
Speaking during the debate preceding the vote, Parliament's rapporteur on the Financial Perspective agreement Reimer BÖGE (EPP-ED, DE) said: "After difficult negotiations, we have an Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and sustainable budgetary management." Thanking all those who took part on the Parliament side, he said it showed the strength of Parliament that it had been looking for European added value, not just using a profit and loss approach. "We now have more flexibility in budgetary procedure, we can react better and more quickly to disasters, we have strengthened budgetary rights, clearer obligations of the Member States, better financial planning and better controls on the setting up of new agencies."
"We have not been fixated on the 1 per cent debate like the Council. We wanted a deeper analysis of challenges of enlarged Union. We sought to improve and modernise structures and budgetary discipline. While we are far from achieving everything we wanted, there have been some real improvements. " The rights of Parliament in foreign policy instruments had been shored up, he said. The whole system would be reviewed in 2009 and Parliament would be able to check what happens then. Galileo, he said, was still underfinanced, and Natura 2000 had been left to one side, so this was still a work in progress. "On 8 June [at the European Council] we are looking for ambitious challenges to be set and met. "
He thanked the Commission and the Austrian Presidency for playing their part in reaching an agreement: "There is a very clear advantage for citizens, with reforms to budget and maintenance of Parliament's budgetary rights."
Sérgio SOUSA PINTO (PES, PT), rapporteur for the Constitutional Affairs Committee, said the proposed agreement was compatible with the Treaties and respected Parliament's prerogatives. In future, there should be a five year budgeting period in line with the mandate of Parliament and Commission. While this agreement was very far from the statements of intention laid out by European Councils and EU government leaders, "it is a satisfactory compromise, safeguarding cohesion as the basis of the European Union and supporting the Lisbon Strategy. It is enormous progress, and infinitely better than having an extended squabble between the European institutions." Parliament would, he said, be fully involved in all aspects of expenditure and revenue. Given the exceptionally difficult circumstances of the negotiation, he paid tribute to the work of Reimer Böge in representing Parliament.
Janusz LEWANDOWSKI (EPP-ED, PL), Chairman of the Budgets Committee said that the latest compromise on the Financial Perspective coincided with the second anniversary of enlargement to the new Member States as was a "sort of birthday present". The negotiations had proven that it was possible to reach a compromise with 25 Member States. Nevertheless, Mr Lewandowski doubted whether if there was enough money to achieve the EU's ambitions. The figures would have to be reviewed upwards. He welcomed the increased flexibility in the budget citing increased loans from the European Investment Bank, the new globalisation fund and the EU Solidarity Fund. The lesson learnt from the negotiation was that the EU had to plan better in the future.

Fisheries
Morocco Fishing Agreement gets Parliamentary approval
2006-05-22 - 17:49
The EP approved a fisheries partnership agreement between the European Community and Morocco today, despite some MEPs' reservations about its international legal ramifications regarding Western Sahara.
The fishing agreement with Morocco covers 119 vessels, mostly from France, Spain and Portugal, although it also includes a 60 000 tonne quota for industrial pelagic fishing for several northern European fleets. The financial contribution is set at €36.1 million per year, making this agreement the most valuable of all EC fisheries agreements. The Parliament's consultative report was drafted by Daniel Varela Suanzes-Carpegna (EPP-ED, ES), and passed by 409 votes in favour with 167 against with 79 abstentions.
The report approves the fishing agreement and protocol, although it demands "an annual report on the implementation of the agreement" before it gives its go-ahead for the negotiation of the next protocol. It also asks that "in the event of evidence that the use to which the Agreement is being put is in contravention of international obligations, the Commission shall take immediate steps to suspend the Agreement." This addition refers to the relationship between Morocco and Western Sahara.
Several MEPs had been troubled by the inclusion of the waters of Western Sahara in the fishing agreement. They were concerned that by signing an agreement with Morocco giving the EU fishing fleet access to waters off the coast of Western Sahara (i.e. south of the 27.4 degree line), the EU would be breaking its commitments to the UN. Several amendments were therefore submitted to prohibit fishing in these areas, but they were voted down.
The fishing agreement is expected to be approved by the Council on 22 May, allowing the agreement to enter into force before the first payments are due on 30 June. The Parliament had previously rejected using the urgency procedure to ratify the agreement during its April session - more details are available via the link below. Text adopted

Taxation
Charging VAT on services at the place of the customer
2006-05-22 - 17:49
MEPs have approved a plan to change the VAT system regarding the taxation of services, so that tax will be paid according to where the customer is based, rather than where the supplier is established.
Parliament adopted a report, drawn up by Otmar KARAS (EPP-ED, AT), which proposes a few minor changes, but accepts the principle that VAT on services should be applied according to the place of establishment of the customer, as is already the case for VAT on goods.
The old system – taxing based on the location of the supplier – was seen as simpler to manage, and caused few problems when most services suppliers were in the same jurisdiction as their customers. With the increase in e-commerce, however, more services can be supplied remotely, including things such as internet telephony, and there is a greater risk of distortions in the market as companies establish their internet services in countries with lower VAT rates to serve customers across Europe.
The Commission originally proposed making this change only for business-to-business transactions, but subsequently decided to extend it to business-to-consumer sales as well.
As with most taxation related matters, Parliament has a consultative role, and if the change is to become law it will require unanimous agreement between the Member States in the Council. Text adopted
