15:00 18:30 Brussels ASP 3G3 Other events Signature of Environmental Statement by European Parliament The President of the European Parliament, Josep Borrell, and the Secretary-General, Julian Priestley, will sign the Environmental Statement by the European Parliament on Tuesday 24 January at 9am. The ceremony will be held in the meeting room of the Environment Committee (PHS 1A02).
This signature makes official Parliament's commitment to abide by European standards known as EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme). EMAS is a management tool drawn up by the European Union in the 1990s. Initially aimed at industry, the scheme was extended in 2001 to all sectors of the economy, including public administrations, to enable them to assess and improve their environmental performance and to apply for registration and a logo attesting to their compliance with best practice. The European Parliament started work in 2001, first to evaluate the environmental impact of its activities and then to set targets. Various measures have been taken in recent years, including separate collections of waste as well as savings of energy and paper. In December 2005, Parliament's Bureau approved a global environmental management programme, which is based on a small internal administrative unit and is aiming, after validation by an external audit, to achieve registration for the EP by the end of 2006. 09:00 12:30 Brussels, ASP 1E2 Joint meeting on energy efficiency with national parliaments
