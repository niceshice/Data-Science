MEPs set to debate pay inequality
Women's rights/Equal opportunities
2007-03-12 - 16:07
The last 30 years have brought great improvements in the social, political and economic position of women. However, women still earn 15% less than men across the European Union. Later today MEPs meeting in Strasbourg will debate a report suggesting ways to strike a balance between work and life commitments. The report is on the European Commission's gender equality "roadmap" over the next three years. It also calls for measures against domestic violence and human trafficking.
Amalia Sartori of the European People's Party is the rapporteur for the Women's Rights Committee on the issue. Prior to the debate she stressed that some practical steps must be taken if the Commission roadmap is to have any effect.
Women earn 15% less than men
In particular, her report says the right of equal pay for men and women must be properly enforced. Across the 27 states of the EU women earn on average 15% less than men for doing the same tasks. The Sartori report would also like to see greater paternity leave encouraged and expanded so that it is not just women who stay at home when couples have children.
Research has shown that in the 20-49 age group, employment rates fall by 15% among women if they have a child and rise by 6% in men. The report states that society as a whole should bear the cost of motherhood rather than business.
Integrate female immigrants through language training say MEPs
Integrating migrant women into European societies is also strongly encouraged as 54% of all immigrants in the EU are women. Language learning and knowledge about local laws are just steps that could dramatically improve integration say the report.
However, it is critical of the Commission's roadmap as "it does not contain a single new legislative proposal".
Action against violence and human trafficking
It is estimated that trafficking affects 100,000 people in the EU annually, with children making up 40% of the total. This modern day slavery affects more women than men, who are often tricked and sold into prostitution by criminal gangs. MEPs from the women's rights committee would like to see stronger action to protect children and women, in particular to protect them from forced marriage, "crimes of honour" and exploitation.
The March session of the European Parliament opens in Strasbourg from 1700 CET today. Watch it live online here.
