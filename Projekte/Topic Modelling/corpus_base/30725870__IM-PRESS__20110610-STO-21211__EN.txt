70% of donors worldwide are men Â©BELGA/ANP/Lex van Lieshout Voluntary blood donation is on the rise in the EU, but young Europeans are giving less than the older generation. According to MEPs who regularly donate blood this is the ultimate expression of generosity and solidarity and it should be promoted. On 15 June the Environment Committee discussed the latest European Commission report on blood donation.
Committee Chair Jo Leinen said, "I donate blood myself, and we could see how important donations are during the current outbreak of the E.coli epidemic. Hospitals in Germany made an urgent appeal for more blood donors, because there was a shortage of blood."
How it works
Donations should be voluntary and unpaid. According to a 2002 EU Directive, "Member states shall take the necessary measures to encourage voluntary and unpaid blood donations with a view to ensuring that blood and blood components are in so far as possible provided from such donations."
However, 16 EU countries provide specific incentives to blood and plasma donors. For example, in Poland donors get tax breaks. Other incentives include: transport to the donation point, blood test results, chocolates and a day off.
Collection agencies are public or non profit organisations in 23 countries, while donations are handled by private agencies in Austria, Finland, Germany and Lithuania.
The EU and the rest of the world
According to the latest World Health Organisation information 62 countries get all their blood supplies through voluntary and unpaid donations, a 50% increase over the last decade.
Some 70% of donors are male. In richer countries donors tend to be older, while in poorer countries they are younger.
According to the WHO, if 1% of the population donates blood, it should be sufficient to meet a country's basic needs.
World Blood Donor Day is 14 June.
