As in previous Eurobarometer surveys, 49% of those interviewed felt that Parliament should focus first on the fight against poverty. What is new is that the coordination of economic, budgetary and fiscal policies now ranks second. There was also a sharp increase in responses within the Euro zone (42%, +13).
The survey also found that 40% of Europeans would like to receive more information from the European Parliament on possible ways to tackle the crisis.
At the mid-term of the 2009-2014 legislature, Europeans were asked about their perceptions of the European Parliament and about the policies and values that they want it to defend. 26,594 European citizens aged 15 and over were interviewed.
