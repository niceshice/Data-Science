From humanitarian emergencies to technical rules and regulations, swift minor adjustments are sometimes needed to EU legislation without resorting to lengthy procedures. The Lisbon Treaty introduced a new streamlined system for delegating to the European Commission the power to make minor changes to EU laws when needed. MEPs adopted a resolution on Wednesday stating how these powers should be delegated, under what conditions and limits, and how the Commission's use of them should be monitored.
Only "non-essential" parts of a legislative act may be supplemented or amended by the Commission. The "essential" parts cannot be delegated. Such changes to EU legislation may be needed to take account of scientific or technical progress or specific events, or to update quantitative values. For example Parliament has decided that the Commission may change the technical requirements for a rabies vaccination to be deemed valid for a "pet passport", to take account of scientific progress.
Wednesday's resolution, drafted by József Szájer (EPP, HU) for the Legal Affairs Committee, explains that delegated acts will have important implications in many areas (agriculture, environment, transport, industry, etc) and argues that Parliament should be on a equal footing with the Council with respect to all aspects of the power of legislative delegation.
Under the treaty, power may be delegated solely by means of a legislative act. Today's resolution adds that Parliament and the Council must, within an act, define "expressly and meticulously" the objectives, content, scope and duration of the delegation of power.
