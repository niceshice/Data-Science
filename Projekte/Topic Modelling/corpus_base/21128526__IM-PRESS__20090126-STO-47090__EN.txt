A debate on green investment is one item online this week The EU’s antiterrorism coordinator, Gilles de Kerckhove, and Interpol representatives, will brief MEPs on Thursday about progress in combating terrorism. Elsewhere MEPs are working on next week's plenary session, which will include a final report from the temporary committee on climate change and penalties for employers of illegal migrants. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will also speak to MEPs next week.
Energy and the environment remain hot topics on the website with a story on energy security, while our online debate on the election website will focus on green investment . We ask a number of MEPs whether green investment is really the future and ask you to give us your opinions. We also want to know what you think about the role of the EU in a globalising world and how well the EU is dealing with the world economic slowdown.
As President Morales of Bolivia attempts to persuade his people to change the constitution in a referendum - we talk to a group of MEPs who were in Bolivia to assess the situation on the ground. Will the change mean more or less democracy?
You can also catch up with the 2009 budget and what it has in store in terms of the EU's priorities. We also publish more interviews with winners of the Sakharov human rights prize and publish the latest " guest photographer " image sent in by a member of the public.
With the Gaza conflict high on the agenda, EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering will chair a meeting of the Bureau of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly on Thursday. He travels to Prague for a meeting with the Speakers of the Czech, French, Spanish and Swedish Parliaments on Friday.
