"Charter of rights" (& compensation) closer for Europe's bus and coach passengers
Italian MEP Antonio Cancian (EPP) on Europe's bus and coach passengers: "All of them will have a charter of rights" Europe's bus and coach passengers could soon be entitled to refreshments, compensation and even hotel accommodation if their journeys are delayed European Parliament debates and votes on Charter of Rights Tuesday 15 February Interview with rapporteur - Italian MEP Antonio Cancian (EPP) Europe 's 70 million bus and coach passengers could soon be entitled to refreshments, compensation and even hotel accommodation if their journeys are delayed under rules being considered by the European Parliament. For example if a journey is over three hours is delayed for more than 90 minutes then meals and even a hotel room could be offered. MEPs discuss and vote on the new EU-wide Regulation Tuesday.
Ahead of the debate we interviewed the man who has drafted Parliament's report on the issue - Italian MEP Antonio Cancian (EPP).
The European Commission proposed this regulation way back in 2008 - why is the process still ongoing?
AC: Buses and coaches are not usually managed by big companies like air or train companies, but often by family businesses. EU governments argued it was not the right moment to impose new rules for Small and Medium size Enterprises (SMEs) to avoid affecting their competitiveness. This is understandable, but we have to take into account that bus passengers are often "vulnerable" in terms of income or education. They can't solve their problems by going to Court. Then we have people with reduced mobility, not only disabled but also an increasingly older population. Therefore, a common set of rules was absolutely necessary.
What will change for European bus and coach passengers?
AC: All of them will have a charter of rights. Furthermore, on services over 250 kilometres (155 miles), they will have compensation for delays, assistance in the event of delays or cancellation. They will also have protection for accidents and fatalities, reimbursement for lost or damaged luggage and accessible information. Moreover, passengers who have reduced mobility will be entitled to special assistance, as on planes.
What were the main points of disagreement with European governments?
AC: We wanted the rules to apply for services over 50 km and they wanted it only for services over 500 km so 250 km was a compromise. It was very hard to find an agreement. The last night of negotiations we finished at 1.30 am. It was the first conciliation act after the Lisbon Treaty. It was a fiery debate.
We are speaking about passengers rights on long distance services, but what about shorter distances?
AC: The regulation provides a series of 12 basic rights - valid for every distance - focused in particular on the needs of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility.
What's next?
AC: With this regulation we have completed the dossier on passengers' rights. No matter which mode of transport people use, now they are protected at EU level.
The European Commission has committed itself to revise in the coming years all the current regulations for all modes of transports under a common framework. This would make it easier for passengers to be aware of their rights and reduce the number of authorities that have to monitor the implementation. We will also ask for a single ticket for all modes of transport. So that we are not going to become mad if we have to take a bus and then a train in the same trip!
Charter for bus and coach passengers
Compensation and assistance in the event of accidents and accommodation of up to €80 per night and per passenger for a maximum of 2 nights
If a bus or coach is cancelled or delayed for more than 120 minutes or overbooked, passengers shall immediately be offered the choice between continuation of the journey or re-routing
Where a journey of more than 3 hours is cancelled or delayed for more than 90 minutes, snacks, meals or refreshments must be provided as well as hotel accommodation of up to €80 per night, per person

Pressing the Services directive into action
Evelyne Gebhardt, the German Socialist who guided the measure through Parliament. Monday afternoon. MEPs debate report on Services Directive Activities covered by the Services Directive account for 40% of EU GDP and jobs Monday afternoon sees the European Parliament debate the implementation of the Services directive. The directive was one of the most important pieces of legislation adopted by the European Parliament as it would allow one service provider to operate in another European country. The House will vote Tuesday (15 February) on the report.
For example under the Services directive German ski instructors should be able to give lessons in Austria and Latvian transport companies operate in Belgium. However, for many of them it has not been the case, even if the Services directive had entered in force, the implementation has been only partial and poorly achieved by many countries.
The report is Parliament's first assessment on the state of play of implementation, focusing on main issues raised in the Member states: the scope of the directive, the points of single contact, the administrative cooperation and mutual evaluation process.
It's not usual that Parliament does a report on the implementation of a directive. "We worked on this very important piece of legislation for years and now we want it to be put in place correctly; we realised that in some countries there was a considerable delay," explained Evelyne Gebhardt, the German Socialist EP who guided the measure through Parliament in 2006.
She went on to sat that " so still for a certain time, there was a requirement that tourist guide in Rome to be Roman and a German ski instructor wasn't able to instruct in Austria because he was asked a paper from his bank that didn't even exist in Germany," she added.
Many stops and no shops?
One of the most serious delays concern one-stop-shops called ' Points of Single Contact' (PSC), foreseen in the Services directive, where any person wishing to provide services in another country could obtain the necessary information: this quintessential tool to facilitate the cross-border service provision has been either poorly or not at all established.
The report points out that PSC should be provided with financial means to ensure the availability and the quality of information, and t here's also a question of languages: "The information can't be just in the language of the country; it should absolutely be provided in several languages, namely in areas close to borders, and in English of course," insists Ms Gebhardt . Also, she points out, particularly as PSC shouldn't be just a portal or electronic form, but there should be a human contact involved in order to provide to users comprehensive answers to their questions.
She insists on keeping the pressure on Member States in order to achieve full transposition: "After all it's also the Member States that wanted this Directive. It's a real pity it's not being put in place." Even more so because, as the report says, the activities covered by the Services Directive account for 40% of EU Gross Domestic Product and jobs and are therefore could be crucial for economic growth and employment.
The report and the debates in the Parliament's Internal Market Committee also focused on the scope of the directive and the uncertainty regarding some services area excluded from the directive, especially social services, healthcare services and services of general economic interest.

Opening of the session: Egypt, child soldiers, executions in Iran
Ushers welcome the opening of a new agenda as the European Parliament opens in Strasbourg, Monday 14 February Egypt, Buzek spoke of "a new wind blowing" through the country President condemns "shocking news from Iran" of death sentences passed on dissidents and political prisoners At the start of this week's Strasbourg plenary session, EP President Jerzy Buzek commented on the popular uprising in Egypt, the fresh arrival on European shores of refugees from north Africa, International Day against Child Soldiers and the recent death sentences passed on dissidents in Iran.
On Egypt, the President spoke of "a new wind blowing" through the country. He said peaceful demonstrators should not be persecuted and emergency rule should be ended. The European Union must "not be afraid to be involved economically and politically", he continued, adding "let us help our neighbours" and "act in solidarity as a true community".
As a result of the upheaval in north Africa, significant numbers of immigrants are arriving in the EU. "The EU Member States must share this responsibility", argued Mr Buzek.
International Day against Child Soldiers took place on 12 February. "We as a parliament abhor the practice" of recruiting child soldiers, said the EP President, pointing out that there are between 200,000 and 300,000 such children in armed groups around the world.
The "shocking news from Iran" of death sentences passed on dissidents and political prisoners was the final issue highlighted by Mr Buzek. In the name of Parliament, he urged Iran to abolish capital punishment.
Agenda changes: debates on Russia and refugees from north Africa
The House approved two changes to this week's plenary agenda.
At the request of the ALDE and Greens/EFA groups, a debate on the rule of law in Russia was added to Tuesday morning's agenda. A resolution will be put to the vote on Thursday.
At the request of the EPP group, Tuesday afternoon's agenda will now include a Commission statement with debate on immediate EU measures in support of Italy and other states affected by the current increase in migratory flows.

MEPs combat killer fake medicines
Seized counterfeit medical pills are pictured at the customs building in Zaventem, north-east of Brussels ©BELGA Internet sales a real concern Some MEPs want EU norms applied outside Europe Viagra, cancer drugs, anti-malaria pills and painkillers - more and more people buy medicine on the internet, but it's often counterfeit.
During the February Parliamentary session MEPs will debate (15 February) and vote (16 February) on new safety rules for medicine in general, including internet sales, to reduce the number of fake medicines in the European Union.
In November and December 2008 customs officials seized more than 34 million illegal pills across the EU. Faking medicines is high-profit, low risk crime and it is not sufficiently regulated at European level.
It is estimated that 1% of medicinal products currently sold to the European public through the legal supply chain are fake and the number is increasing. In other parts of the world more than 30% of the medicines on sale can be fake. More and more innovative and life-saving drugs are counterfeit.
Control over packaging, internet sales
Parliament will vote in Strasbourg on the new law, including more safety rules, sanctions on counterfeiters and a control system to prevent dangerous medicinal products from reaching the patient.
MEPs on the Environment Committee managed to add to the rules regulating the sale of pharmaceuticals via the internet, as the internet is one of the main routes by which fake medicines enter the EU market
The MEPs also want to add to the European Commission's proposals regulating the sale of pharmaceuticals via the internet. Not all countries allow it but if they do, the sellers have to obtain a special authorisation, carry an EU logo, list on a European database, and link to a central website at government level.
On 27 April, Parliament's rapporteur Marisa Matias (GUE/NGL) said, "counterfeit medicines are a form of pharmaceutical crime - criminal networks easily overcome the national borders. I think that the absence of legislation encourages counterfeiters today. Falsified medicines are silent killers because they can seriously harm patients."
The debate is expected to start around 1800 CET in Strasbourg. You can watch it live online here using the first link.

Bus passenger rights to enter into force in 2013
Compensation for passengers for long delays are envisaged under proposed new rules ©BELGA New law provides for compensation of 50% of the purchase price as well as a full refund of the ticket, if an operator cancels a service and cannot honour the transport contract If there is a delay of over 90 minutes according to the timetable, passengers must be given snacks and refreshments. The missing link on passengers' rights under EU law was finally put in place in Strasbourg on Tuesday when the European Parliament adopted new rules laying down greater rights for bus and coach passengers.
After two years of tricky negotiations, Parliament and the Member States have agreed on rules covering all long-distance scheduled services (250 kilometres or more), whether national or crossborder, starting in spring 2013.
Compensation
For such services, the new law provides for compensation of 50% of the purchase price as well as a full refund of the ticket, if an operator cancels a service and cannot honour the transport contract, even by other routes or means of transport, following a delayed departure of at least two hours. Passengers who prefer not to go ahead with their trip following a cancelled departure or a two-hour delay will be entitled to a full refund.
If there is a delay of over 90 minutes according to the timetable, passengers must be given snacks and refreshments. If a trip is broken or if there is an accident or a delay requiring passengers to spend the night on the spot, the operator will also be required to offer up to two nights in a hotel at a maximum price of €80. The operator can only be exempted from these obligations if the problem is caused by natural disasters or weather conditions that prevent the journey taking place under safe conditions.
In addition, the operator must provide for a refund with a ceiling of no less than €1200 if luggage is lost or damaged. In the event of death or injury as the result of an accident, the operator will be liable for payment of up to €220,000 (or more, if national law so provides).
To enable smaller firms to adjust to the new rules, Parliament voted to allow Member States to exempt certain regular national services or those where an important part of the service is provided outside the EU, for a maximum of four years, renewable once.
Fundamental rights
At the same time, thanks to MEPs a package of twelve fundamental rights was approved which will apply to all regular services regardless of distance. These rights include information before and during a journey and the needs of people with disabilities or reduced mobility. Non-discriminatory access to transport is guaranteed, with full compensation if wheelchairs or other mobility equipment are lost or damaged.
Staff training
Bus and coach staff must be trained, under the regulation, to provide appropriate assistance to reduced-mobility passengers who make a request at least 36 hours before a departure. If an operator is unable to provide suitable assistance, a reduced-mobility passenger will have the right to be accompanied at no extra cost by a person of his/her choice.
"This agreement is very important for transport and tourism. It embodies a strategic balance, as it protects smaller firms and will make life easier for people with disabilities", said Antonio Cancian (EPP, IT), who steered the legislation through Parliament.
Parliament adopted the legislation today under the co-decision procedure (third reading conciliation agreement) by 504 votes to 63 with 89 abstentions.

Pension reforms should ensure sustainability and adequate income
In the EU in 2008 4 people were employed for every pensioner, in 2020 it will be five and in 2060 it will be two ©BELGA Non-legislative report debated Member States must act to ensure that pension schemes can sustainably deliver an adequate income to the EU's growing number of retired people The resolution was approved by 535 votes to 85 with 57 abstentions. EC paper: "At present there are four people of working age for every person over 65, by 2060 there will be just two" Member States must act to ensure that pension schemes can sustainably deliver an adequate income to the EU's growing number of retired people, despite the economic crisis, says a Parliament resolution adopted on Wednesday. Pension portability must also be addressed, as must inequalities faced by women and older workers, stress MEPs.
"At present there are four people of working age for every person over 65, by 2060 there will be just two" says a European Commission Green Paper, to which the European Parliament resolution is a response.
The resolution was approved by 535 votes to 85 with 57 abstentions. Ria Oomen-Ruijten (EPP, NL), who drafted the resolution, commented that "although Member States play the lead role, there are aspects where coordination at European level is important. The ageing of the population has a big impact because not all Member States have put money aside for their pensions. This could lead to enormous expenses which will have consequences for the Stability and Growth Pact. The supervising authority should monitor pension systems and some Member States must be encouraged to provide for a safe and adequate pension system".
Economic pressures
Responsibility for pensions lies with Member States, which are re-evaluating or reforming their schemes in the light of the current economic situation and the ageing of their populations. MEPs urge EU countries to maintain "stable, reliable and sustainable" pension systems as well as adequate retirement allowance levels to combat poverty in old age. Proper consultation should take place before making changes, they add.
Portable pensions
Europeans usually work for several employers during their careers, and many spend periods working in different EU countries. MEPs want the EU and Member States to remove obstacles to mobility and address pension transferability difficulties within and between EU Member States. For example, they say retirement plans should not require long contribution periods to be valid.
Older workers
MEPs note the wide gap between the statutory pension age (which is under review in some countries) and the actual age at which many stop work. Older workers would benefit from better adapted workplaces and working conditions, as well as improved protection against dismissal, they say.
Gender inequality
MEPs want greater emphasis on gender equality. Inequalities in the labour market are translating into lower pensions for women, who face a high risk of poverty in old age. On average, women are paid less than men for equivalent work. They are also more likely to work part-time and take longer career breaks to care for family. MEPs urge the Commission and Member States to address inequalities and take account of these factors in retirement benefits.
********
Ahead of the debate we looked at some of the issues surrounding pension reform.
Millions of Europeans depend on pensions. Millions more will soon do so, making up an ever greater proportion of Europe's greying population. Meanwhile, EU countries have widely varying retirement ages and spend very different proportions of GDP on social security. How can we square these many circles? Also how will we pay and do we all need to work longer? We spoke to two MEPs with diverging views.
The report on "Adequate, sustainable and safe European pension systems" by Dutch Christian Democrat Ria Oomen-Ruijten was backed by MEPs on the Parliament's Employment Committee on 1 February and will be debated Tuesday afternoon in plenary from about 1630 CET. Watch live via the first link below.
The report urges stable, reliable and sustainable" pensions systems and says principles of solidarity between generations and national solidarity are key.
One of the ideas to make pension systems healthier is to raise the retirement age so we asked an MEP from the Netherlands (where the retirement age has been raised), and one from France, where the majority of citizens is against a longer working life what they think.
Ms Oomen-Ruijten says it is important to discuss the change of retirement age with the public: "It is of utmost importance to take a decision like this in dialogue with social partners ". She added, "to ensure pensions for the future it is necessary for more people to participate in the labour market and to do so for longer. Many States with pay-as-you-go systems are confronted with big increases in costs, which means growing pressure on solidarity and a heavy burden on the younger generation".
"We are facing enormous demographic challenges, and we need to act now to prevent problems in the future. Member States also need to limit the prevalence of early retirement schemes and create a labour market on which people can participate in old-age, especially in precarious jobs," she said.
French Socialist Françoise Castex has a different view. "They say that since people live longer we should work longer, otherwise we won't have balance with pensions. We don't know what it will happen in 10 or 20 years for life expectancy and demography. In some social classes, for instance, there are problems in accessing medical care and for this reason life expectancy is decreasing".
She said the starting point must be the needs of people. "The economy should adapt itself to the needs of people and not vice versa. France will never accept a European proposal that we have to work more. It is against our European social model. We need to protect employed people and to ensure enough pension funds."
The European Commission is awaiting the EP's views before coming forward with a proposal on European pensions.
Greying Europe
In the EU in 2008 4 people were employed for every pensioner, in 2020 it will be five and in 2060 it will be two
in 2010 the average age at which people stop work is 61.4 years
Life expectancy for men will increase from 76 years in 2008 to 84 in 2060 and for women from 82 in 2008 to 89 in 2060
By 2060 average public expenditure relating to ageing population will be 4.75% of GNP and for pensions 2.4% of GNP

Fake medicines: Parliament approves new rules to protect patients better
A new law to prevent fake medicines from entering the legal supply chain was approved by Parliament on 16 February. Internet sales will be covered by the law, which also introduces new safety and traceability measures, as well as sanctions against counterfeiters. This law still needs to be formally approved by the Council of Ministers.
"Falsified medicines are silent killers, either because they are devoid of effect or because they contain toxic substances that may harm, or even kill, those who take them. The absence of a legal framework encourages counterfeiting, an organized crime. We have been witnessing a huge growth of this criminal activity, with an increase of 400% in seizures of fake drugs since 2005. Protecting patient safety is the core aim of this directive", said Marisa Matias (GUE/NGL, PT), who led discussions in Parliament. Her report was adopted with 569 votes in favour, 12 against and 7 abstentions.
An estimated that 1% of medicinal products currently sold to the European public through the legal supply chain are falsified and the share is growing. In other parts of the world, up to 30% of the medicines on sale may be fake. In particular, more and more innovative and life-saving drugs are counterfeit.
Internet sales
MEPs deemed it necessary to regulate internet sales of medicines because this is a key route by which fake ones enter the EU market. The Commission's original proposal did not cover internet sales. Under the new law, In those EU Member States where internet pharmacies are allowed to operate, they will need to be authorised to supply pharmaceuticals to the public.
Internet pharmacy sites will be required to display a common logo, which should be recognisable throughout the EU, so as to help the public to ascertain that they are linked to an authorised pharmacy. All authorised internet pharmacies will be linked to a central web site in each Member State and will be listed on that web site. The various national web sites will in turn be linked to an EU web site. Citizens will also have to been informed about the risks involved in buying medicines via the internet.
Safety features, traceability and product recalls from patients
The legislation updates current rules and provides for new safety features to be placed on individual packs in order to identify them, guarantee their authenticity, and enable pharmacists to check whether the outer packaging has been tampered with. These safety features - which still need to be developed by the European Commission - could for example include a serialization number which can be "read" by the pharmacy to ascertain that the pack is authentic.
As a general rule these features would apply to all prescription medicines, unless there is clearly no risk. They would apply to non-prescription medicines only in exceptional cases, where there is a risk of falsification. Where medicines are repackaged, these safety features must be replaced by equivalent ones.
Product recalls
Member States must also put in place a system to preventing dangerous medicinal products (falsified and with quality defects), from reaching the patient. This system must permit recalls, including recalls from patients.
If a medicinal product is suspected to present a serious risk to public health, all actors in the supply chain and in all other Member States must be rapidly alerted. If the falsified medicines reach patients, then the alert must be given within 24 hours, so that the medicines can be recalled.
Brokering, export to third countries and sanctions
Pharmaceutical distribution networks are becoming increasingly complex. They involve not only distributors, who are already covered by existing legislation, but also medicinal product brokers. MEPs stipulated that in future, brokers will have to register as such, and may be removed from the register if they fail to comply with the new rules.
MEPs wanted not only imports but exports of medicines to third countries to be better regulated. They therefore stipulated that the relevant rules on information must apply to the supply of medicines to authorized persons in third countries, too.
Finally the new directive states that sanctions imposed on those who infringe it must not be inferior to those applicable to infringements of national laws of similar nature and importance.
Next steps
The text approved by MEPs results from an agreement reached with Council, which must also give its formal approval. Once it is signed into law, Member States have 24 months to make any necessary changes to their national legislation.

Croatia: the EU's 28th Member State?
The fight against corruption, support for returning refugees and the restructuring of shipyards are among the remaining challenges facing the country MEPs acknowledge that major efforts have been made to change the constitution, reform the judiciary Croatia's EU membership negotiations could be completed in the first half of 2011 provided Zagreb pushes ahead with reform, according to a resolution adopted by Parliament on Wednesday. Yet the biggest challenge may be "selling" the benefits of EU membership to a sceptical Croatian population.
The fight against corruption, support for returning refugees and the restructuring of shipyards are among the remaining challenges facing the country. However, MEPs acknowledge that major efforts have been made to change the constitution, reform the judiciary and co-operate more closely with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
EU front runner
In a resolution adopted by 548 votes to 43 with 52 abstentions, MEPs congratulate Croatia on its "substantial progress" in introducing the reforms needed to join the EU. "Negotiations with Croatia can be completed in the first half of 2011 provided that the necessary reforms continue to be pursued resolutely", says Parliament. The resolution notes the considerable improvements to the constitution and to the judiciary, as well as Croatia's closer co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). It stresses, however, that the tribunal's request for important military documents remains unanswered. Regarding the ongoing judiciary reforms, the resolution underlines the need "to proceed quickly with the prosecution of war crimes" and to improve witness protection.
Corruption
Whilst acknowledging the government's efforts to fight corruption and prosecute two former ministers and a former prime minister, MEPs judge that corruption "remains a serious problem". Few corruption cases have come to court and most remain at the investigation stage. . Parliament asks OLAF (the EU's anti-fraud body) to cooperate closely with the Croatian authorities to shed light on the potential secondary corruption which may be generated within the EU Institutions.
Refugees
Overall, progress has been made in the field of refugee returns and public hostility towards returning Serbs has diminished. However, say MEPs, more effort is needed to help returnees to acquire permanent resident status, improve house reconstruction and launch social integration projects for refugees, thousands of whom have not yet returned and remain in Serbia.
Privatisation of shipyards
The Croatian government should accelerate the process of restructuring and privatising shipyards, failing which it will not be possible to close the "competition" chapter of the EU accession negotiations on time.
The biggest challenge starts at home
MEPs are very concerned that the majority of Croatian citizens think Croatia's EU membership would not benefit the country, according to the latest Eurobarometer survey. They urge the Croatian authorities and civil society to mobilise and make citizens "feel the European project is theirs as well". Croatia will need to put EU membership proposals to a referendum. In addition, parliamentary elections will take place in November 2011.

The EP discusses the Arab world's "democratic tsunami"
Egypt, the voice of Tahrir square has been heard
©BELGA The post–Mubarak era is dawning and 80 million Egyptians face the complex task of establishing a new democratic order which could inspire the entire region. Parliament discussed the extraordinary developments in the Arab world, the high hopes for the future but also the fears that can't be ignored in this "democratic tsunami" as one MEP described it during Wednesday's debate, (16 February). As the EU's foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton visits the regional to hold talks with key officials MEPs debated the situation in Egypt.
On behalf of Catherine Ashton, Štefan Füle, the Commissioner for Enlargement and Neighbourhood Policy, announced a special meeting of EU Foreign Ministers this coming Sunday ahead of Ms Ashton's visit to Egypt on Monday.
On the situation in the country, Mr Füle said "we have taken good note of the commitments to revise the Constitution and to hold parliamentary and presidential elections, to honour international treaties and obligations and to limit the military role for 6 months".
He added that even though "it is not for us to dictate outcomes or propose solutions", the EU "will closely watch the steps that will be taken", hoping that "they will pave the way towards democratic, free and fair elections".
For the centre right European People's Party Spanish MEP José Ignacio Salafranca said: "The departures of Mubarak and Ben Ali are necessary conditions, but are not enough to guarantee the democratic transition process, a process that still presents many uncertainties, the most important being consolidating democracy".
He went on to say that: "This is a good occasion to show that the EU understands in this historical moment we have to play as a global actor and make the required homework or we will have to accept not playing the role we wanted to have".
For the Socialist Group Romanian MEP Adrian Severin observed that: "E vents in Egypt proved that Islam could not be only fundamentalist but can also be democratic. The popular revolt was, on the one hand, the result of the evolution of Egyptian elites and, on the other hand, a consequence of the hardship caused by the global crisis. If the EU does not address immediately the need to overcome hardship in Egypt, the revolution might move to anarchy and from there onto another dictatorship."
Leader of the Liberals Guy Verhofstadt told the House: "The Commission has to come forward with a credible global plan for Tunisia and Egypt" although he pointed out that the EU must also send a message to Egypt on the lack of involvement of the secular parties in the efforts to redraft the Constitution. He concluded by saying that "what we need now is a bold message by High Representative Catherine Ashton on what is happening in Yemen, Algeria, Iran, Libya and Morocco without waiting for "things to happen".
French Green MEP Daniel Cohn-Bendit told the House that "we have today in Egypt and Tunisia a Democratic tsunami". He went on to say "we must mobilize special funds to help people in Tunisia and Egypt now because the reasons for the revolt were first hunger, misery and that if in the transition to democracy there is no relief from poverty there is a risk the rebels may move to the side of fundamentalists".
British MEP Charles Tannock (ECR) underlined the importance of the Camp David Accords to Israel's security. He pointed out that the "EU should make its help conditional on preserving peace treaty" and ensure adequate financial aid while "EU political parties must help set up secular sister parties in Egypt".
Willy Meyer of the GUE/NGL group stated: "The EU has a very serious problem with its neighbourhood policy. We have passed from being custodians of Ben Ali and Mubarak to pretending that we are protecting the revolutionary process of a civil society that wants change. He added that "both revolutions are seeking a social and legal status that has nothing to do with religion".
Italian MEP Fiorello Provera (EFD) said: "The fall of Mubarak opens the way not only to democracy, but an opportunity for the Egyptian people. These elections, if they are held, will allow economic development. The European policy in Egypt must be followed by reforms and must help people to choose their future for themselves".

MEPs want banks/EU Institutions to help small businesses find finance

England. ©BELGA Resolution calls on banks to make finance available Economic crisis has made situation more critical Banks and EU programmes should provide more support for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) according to a resolution backed by MEPs Wednesday. The cross-party motion identifies problems in accessing finance as one of the most pressing facing Europe's businesses with less than 250 employees. Across the European Union it is estimated that over 100 million people are employed in such companies. We spoke to some of the MEPs behind the motion.
Austrian Christian Democrat Othmar Karas said, "member states where SME finance depends mainly on large commercial banks, which is the case for example in UK or Belgium, have more problems than regions with functioning savings banks and cooperative banks."
The financial crisis has exacerbated problems. German Green Reinhard Bütikofer said, "Banks have become much more risk-averse and require higher guarantees. This is creating difficulties across all SMEs sectors, but in particular for innovative enterprises." As a result, several companies have gone bankrupt due to a lack of liquidity even though their order book was full.
The resolution says that credit and loan guarantee schemes remain crucial for growth of SMEs.
Hungarian Socialist Edit Herczog told us, "regulations related to the bank sector should...not preclude the free movement of credit to entrepreneurs and the banks shouldn't look at small businesses as a source of risk but a source of opportunity."
MEPs called for more funds, especially innovative financial instruments. Ms Herczog said , "less than the 2% of SMEs benefit from EU-financed program...but a much higher percentage of enterprises is now seeking European solutions."
Bureaucracy is another issue. The resolution points out the necessity of removing administrative barriers that prevent the use of financial programmes, particularly by individual enterprises asking for small amounts of funding.
Mr Bütikofer said action needs to be taken on several fronts: " On the one hand, existing guarantee instruments under EU financing programmes and risk-sharing schemes should be enhanced for easier SME access. On the other, raising more equity and quasi-equity financing is essential for supporting start-ups and small innovative companies."
The Parliament has an all-party SME intergroup, chaired by Othmar Karas. "The SME intergroup sees itself as an advocate for the concerns of small and medium sized-enterprises," he said. It includes 138 MEPs .

EU - South Korea free trade agreement: green light
GM Daewoo Auto and Technology started shipping new cars to Europe as the South Korean unit of US auto giant General Motors seeks to expand global sales. ©BELGA MEPs give green light for ratification on Thursday (17 February) of the most ambitious free trade accord the EU so far negotiated. The EU's first FTA with an Asian country includes strong safeguard measures to protect European industry from an eventual surge in South Korean imports. Following two and a half years of negotiations MEPs gave the green light for ratification to the EU's Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with South Korea on Thursday (17 February) by 465 in favour, 128 against and 19 abstentions.
The Safeguard clause (OLP) was also adopted with amendments by 495 in favour, 16 against and no abstentions.
The EU's first FTA with an Asian country includes, at the insistence of MEPs, strong safeguard measures to protect European industry from an eventual surge in South Korean imports .
The EU's long-awaited free trade agreement (FTA) with South Korea - its 8th largest trading partner - will eliminate about 98% of import duties and other trade barriers in manufactured goods, agricultural products and services over the next 5 years. The most comprehensive trade deal until now by the EU is expected to double its trade with Korea in 20 years, boosting jobs and growth.
Following carmakers' fears over imports of cheap cars, the FTA includes safeguard measures. They will allow the EU to suspend further reductions in customs duties or increase them to previous levels, if lower rates lead to an excessive increase in imports from South Korea, causing or threatening to cause "serious injury" to EU producers. The EU also gained guarantees from Seoul that new Korean legislation on automobile CO 2 emissions will not have an adverse effect on Europe's car makers.
Clear signal: EU is open for business
"The EU needs to send a clear signal, now more than ever, that it is open for business. The swift adoption of this agreement will send out a positive signal that we are not reverting to protectionism in response to the economic environment", as Parliament's rapporteur on the FTA Robert Sturdy (ECR, UK) underlined.
The British Member hopes that the passage of this FTA will enable the EU to complete other crucial trade agreements with emergent economies, such as India. "The EU must not give up on achieving a multilateral deal through the WTO but, in the meantime, we should seek as much bilateral opening of trade as possible" he pointed out.
On safeguard measures he said that "there have been some genuine concerns about this FTA, and there has been a great deal of scaremongering too. However, with the robust safeguard clause that we have included in the deal, we can be assured that our businesses should only enjoy the immeasurable benefits that this FTA will bring, with limited side effects". Why a safeguard clause?
Minimising the EU industry's concerns was also Spanish MEP Pablo Zalba Bidegain's (EPP) target: "Some sectors of the European industry, specially the automotive sector, had shown their concerns with the FTA with South Korea, and the negative impact on the industry", the rapporteur on the safeguard clause explained.
"We wanted to reach three objectives: First, to create a safeguard clause which would be easy to apply. Second, that the safeguard would be the most effective possible to address a possible surge of South Korean imports. And third, that it would make the FTA more attractive to the concerned European industry" said Ms Bidegain.
What goods are covered? "All products from South Korea that may create, because of a surge of imports, an injury or a threat of injury for European Industry. We have put special protection measures for the most sensible sectors: consumer electronics, textile products and specially the European automotive industry", explained Mr Zalba. Korea enjoys a comparative advantage over the EU in these sectors.
Final step in the long talks
Launched in May 2007, and following two and half years of negotiations, the deal was ( initialled in October 2009 and) finally signed at the EU-South Korea summit in Brussels on 6 October. Under the Lisbon Treaty, all international trade deals need the Parliament's consent. Equally, under Lisbon, the safeguard regulation will now be adopted by Parliament through the ordinary legislative procedure (former co-decision) .
Provided that MEPs adopt the regulation and grant the consent, the deal will come into force in July 2011.

Egypt: back democratic transition and freeze Egyptian leaders' assets, say MEPs
Egyptian anti-government demonstrators flood Cairo's landmark Tahrir Square protesting against President Hosni Mubarak.
©BELGA/UPI/eyevine MEPs call for a freeze on the assets of all Egyptian leaders responsible for misappropriating public funds in the country The resolution outlines the role that MEPs believe the EU should play in helping its strategic Mediterranean neighbour's transition to democracy. Reacting to the dizzying changes in Egypt, MEPs passed a resolution calling on the EU to rethink and improve its political and financial strategy to assist the country’s transition to democracy, including organising free elections. They also call for a freeze on the assets of all Egyptian leaders responsible for misappropriating public funds in the country .
President Hosni Mubarak's departure “has opened a new phase in the political transition in Egypt” and the Egyptian armed forces must now play a constructive role, facilitating the political process, ensuring free elections and keeping to its peace commitments with Israel. The resolution outlines the role that MEPs believe the EU should play in helping its strategic Mediterranean neighbour's transition to democracy .
EU role in assisting Egypt
In the past, the goal of stability has often overshadowed values of democracy, social justice and human rights in the EU’s relations with its southern neighbours, acknowledge MEPs . They therefore wish to ensure that the clause allowing the EU to suspend any association agreement with a third country in the event of serious human rights violations can be implemented effectively in future .
If there is any lesson to learn from the revolution in Egypt, it is that the EU’s existing policies towards southern Mediterranean countries have failed, note MEPs, who advocate revising the EU's European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), so as to prioritise goals such as fostering the independence of the judiciary, combating corruption or ensuring that bilateral agreements give precedence to basic freedoms over economic aims.
Furthermore, ENP countries must fulfil a list of political criteria in order to obtain the so-called “advanced status” in their relations with the EU, says the resolution . Tunisia has been negotiating with Council to become an advanced EU partner in the Mediterranean since May 2010. This status was first granted to Morocco, in 2008.
MEPs also favour mobilising all EU financial instruments, such as the ENP Instrument, the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights and the Stability Instrument, to assist Egypt’s transition to democracy .
Finally, the EU Foreign Affairs High representative should create a “task force”, to include MEPs, which would co-ordinate the response to all financial and political needs during the transition process, including institution-building efforts, ensuring the independence of the judiciary and sending a mission to observe elections .
Union for the Mediterranean criticized
The Union for the Mediterranean (UfM), a multilateral partnership created in 2008 which encompasses 27 Member States and 16 countries from the Mediterranean basin, “proved ineffective to meet the growing mistrust and the basic needs of the people concerned” , says the resolution. Both the UfM and the Anna Lindh Euro-Mediterranean Foundation are urged to react to these historic circumstances, mobilize civil society and play a more active role in promoting democracy and human rights in the region .
€ 1 billion for SMEs in the Mediterranean basin
Voting on separate legislation on Thursday, Parliament also decided to increase by € 1 billion the overall amount of guarantees to the European Investment Bank for loans to projects outside the EU. The whole of the increase should be used to back loans for small and medium sized enterprises and infrastructure in the Mediterranean basin.
Delegation
Also on Thursday, Parliament's Conference of Presidents approved sending a delegation of MEPs to Egypt in the coming weeks.
