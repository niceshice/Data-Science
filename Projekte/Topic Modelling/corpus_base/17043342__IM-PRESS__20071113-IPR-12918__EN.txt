Interoperability of digital TV - concern over the 2012 deadline

2007-11-13 - 13:31
The House adopted an own-initiative report on the interoperability of digital TV. The report underlines the importance of the switchover from analogue to digital technology and is concerned about delays in the 2012-deadline set by the Commission. MEPs underline in the report, that the new possibilities of interaction, that digital TV provides should be for the benefit of the users, and that the new technologies should allow the broadcasting of pluralist information and quality programmes.
The European Parliament points out that the switchover from analogue to digital is a great step forward and can contribute towards disseminating cultures and improving social cohesion.
UK tops the EU table for digital TV
According to the report digital television data - EU market for digital TV, (see link below), at the end of 2005 66.6 per cent of households had digital TV, compared to an EU-27 average of 23.8 per cent.
With digital TV, viewers can interact directly with the broadcasters. Interactive TV is based on different applications and software in the receivers with different standards. However, the European Parliament finds that imposing a single standard is not the right solution. MEPs share the view of the Commission that it would be better to continue promoting open standards, which are recognised by the European Standards body, and maintain that these open standards are the most appropriate ones for ensuring the technological neutrality of networks and the free movement of information.
The House regrets that interactive television in the EU has ultimately proved to be less commercially successful than expected and calls on the Commission to study the reasons for this phenomenon and to submit regular reports on the efforts made by the Commission and the Member States to develop the digital TV market and its numerous ramifications.
MEPs consider that the technical and legislative choices related to interoperability should not only be economic, but also social and cultural, and they stress attention should be paid above all to the interest of the users.
