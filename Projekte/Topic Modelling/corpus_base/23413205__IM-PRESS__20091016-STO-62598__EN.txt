EU spending priorities for 2010 could under scrutiny this afternoon when MEPs debate the budget ©Belga The European Parliament will debate the EU's budget priorities for next year this afternoon. The Budget Committee has already called for substantial new money for investment in renewable energy and help for the dairy sector in Europe. Another priority is help for small and medium sized businesses. Watch the debate live at 1600 CET.
MEPs want to increase the EU budget for 2010 to €127.5 billion from the Council of Minister's proposal of €120.5 billion and the Commission's proposed €122.3 billion.
€1.5 billion recovery plan: The Budget Committee is pushing for an extra €1.5 billion to boost Europe's economy. They particularly want it spent on infrastructure for energy, offshore wind energy and for carbon capture and storage to cut CO2 emissions.
€300 dairy fund: A proposed €300 million dairy fund to support Europe's beleaguered dairy farmers has won support from MEPs and the European Commission, which administers Europe's Common Agricultural Policy.
Other priorities for the EP are: research for small and medium size enterprises, financial assistance to Palestine, communication with citizens and journalists, the "Baltic Sea strategy" to clean up and regenerate that sea and more money to promote freedom, security and justice across the Union.
MEPs will vote on the 2010 budget on Thursday. MEPs and ministers are due to meet in November to try and thrash out an agreement.
