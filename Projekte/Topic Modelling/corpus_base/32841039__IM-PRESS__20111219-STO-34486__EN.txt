"Vaclav Havel was, and remains, a hero. In 1989, students in my country came out into the streets to call for Vaclav Havel's release. Havel became soon after the President of a free Czechoslovakia; President of both Czechs and Slovaks and a hero to both," Buzek said in a statement.
The EP President also honoured Havel's work as a playwright as "straightforward and honest; sensitive and beautiful".
