europarltv UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon was in Parliament Tuesday to discuss the fight against poverty, climate change and how to eliminate nuclear weapons. In a interview later, he said, "we have made significant progress in fighting against extreme poverty but of course the financial crisis has...slowed progress." But "we can make it happen" - with the political will and global cooperation.
According to the UN more than 60 million people around the world have been pushed into poverty by the global economic crisis, with unemployment up by nearly one third since 2007. Some 1.4 billion people live on less than $1.25 a day, while nearly 1 billion are hungry.
Ban Ki-moon stressed that the "developed world should ensure that there is predictability in their support for developing countries so that the developing world can plan their economic and social development plans. This is very important and is why we talk about aid effectiveness, while also ensuring efficiency and transparency."
Climate change
Ahead of the upcoming international climate summit in Cancun, he told us, "Practically speaking we do not expect that there will be a breakthrough. But we are not giving up, we are working very hard, we are moving ahead."
Opportunities from immigration
On the issue of discrimination, which he touched on in his speech, he said, "it is regrettable and sad that we still have many cases where immigrants have been denied basic human rights...I believe in cultural diversity and this cultural diversity should be respected."
Ban Ki-moon (66) became the 8th UN Secretary General in 2007
