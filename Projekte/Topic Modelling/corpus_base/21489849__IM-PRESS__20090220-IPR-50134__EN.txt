Practical steps to help Parliament meet its goal of reducing its CO2 emissions by 30 per cent by 2020 were adopted in an action plan by the Bureau this week.
The plan sets out a wide range of steps which could be taken to reduce the carbon footprint of the European Parliament. Some are effectively already underway, others can be put into effect quite quickly while others require further study before deciding where and how they could be applied.
Among the measures that will now go ahead are:
individual studies on how to improve the energy performance of each of Parliament’s buildings, such as by making use of photovoltaic, solar thermal or geothermal energy, installing systems that reduce the use of electric lighting and air-conditioning or – for future constructions – using “passive buildings”;
making better use of IT systems, whether by finding ways to reduce the quantity of equipment needed for each staff member or by improving and promoting videoconferencing facilities;
integrating the issue of reducing carbon emissions into all decisions on transport, for example by promoting train, bicycle and foot travel as opposed to car or plane travel, by promoting low-emission car-use and by improved planning of events to minimise travel and transport needs;
creating a long term plan to improve awareness and communication in aiming to change the mindset and the behaviour of staff with regard to carbon efficiency;
a variety of other steps which could cumulatively make a difference: such as encouraging suppliers to reduce their carbon emissions and introducing various water saving measures.
In addition – as this will not count towards the 2020 target for reducing emissions from 2006 levels – a scheme will be developed to allow MEPs and staff voluntarily to off-set the carbon emissions of their air travel, at least until aviation is incorporated into the EU’s Emissions Trading Scheme in 2012.
