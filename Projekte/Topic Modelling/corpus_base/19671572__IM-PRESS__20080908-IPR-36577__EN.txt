Transport Commissioner Antonio Tajani announced on Tuesday at the European Parliament that the Commission plans "to look closely at some European airlines". Mr Tajani was appearing before the EP Transport Committee to report on updates in Community law on air safety, in the wake of the accident at Madrid's Barajas airport. He promised that a minimum number of annual inspections would be made in each Member State and that checks on Europe's airline would be tightened up.
Mr Tajani stressed the importance of the Community programme "Safety Assessment of Foreign Aircraft" (SAFA) and stated that 54% of the planes inspected in the EU in 2007 under this programme belonged to European companies. Last year a total of 7376 runway inspections were made, nearly double the number in 2004 (3993). Moreover, said Mr Tajani, "the Commission's services are working to introduce a minimum number of inspections each year in every Member State".
The Commissioner highlighted the need to distinguish between fair competition and the lowering of safety standards, arguing that "no form of fair competition justifies weakening safety guarantees for Europe's citizens". He also emphasised the need to review existing Community legislation on air safety, giving two examples: the 1994 directive establishing fundamental principles governing the investigation of civil aviation accidents and incidents, and the June 2003 directive on occurrence reporting in civil aviation.
Mr Tajani also spoke of the Commission's planned legislation on a Single European Sky, which will strengthen the powers of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) over procedures for certifying airport safety and granting pilot licences. It will also enable the EASA to work more closely with national aviation authorities when investigating accidents.
Community blacklist
During the debate prior to Mr Tajani's speech, Georg Jarzembowski (EPP-ED, DE) called for the blacklist of airlines managed by the Commission to be updated and for new inspections of European airlines to be carried out. Mr Tajani pointed out that the air safety committee is to meet on 5 November to update the list and he confirmed that inspections of Community airlines will be beefed up. At present none of the banned companies on the list is European.
Inés Ayala (PES, ES) welcomed the plans to improve Community legislation but she also spoke of the current "legal vacuum" regarding passenger rights.
Arūnas Degutis (ALDE, LT) cited a study that had found that air safety problems "are much more frequent than we hear". He proposed there should be a service at Community level to identify all incidents "that normally pass unnoticed".
Eva Lichtenberger (Greens/EFA, DE) argued that we should ask whether "competition between air transport companies is always a good thing" And like Mr Jarzembowski, she wanted to turn the spotlight on European companies when the blacklist is updated on 5 November.
