Parliament adopted an own-initiative report on the outcome of the screening of legislative proposals pending before the Legislature drafted by Sylvia-Yvonne KAUFMANN (GUE/NGL, DE).
MEPs agreed following guidelines on the withdrawal and the modification of legislative proposals by the Commission:
(a) the Commission may, in principle, withdraw or modify a legislative proposal at any time during the procedures leading to its adoption as long as the Council has not acted. This means that in co-decision and cooperation procedures the Commission may no longer do so after the adoption of the common position by the Council unless, in its decision on the common position, the Council has exceeded its powers to amend the Commission proposal, so that the decision in reality constitutes a legislative initiative by the Council itself, for which the Treaty does not provide,
(b) where Parliament has rejected a legislative proposal or has suggested substantial amendments to it, or where Parliament has in some other way asked the Commission to withdraw or substantially modify a legislative proposal, the Commission shall take this position into proper consideration. If, for important reasons, the Commission decides not to follow the position expressed by Parliament, it shall explain the reasons for that decision in a statement to Parliament,
(c) where the Commission intends to withdraw or modify a legislative proposal on its own initiative, it shall give Parliament prior notification of its intention. This notification shall be given in good time, allowing Parliament the opportunity to give its view on the matter, and shall include a clear explanation of the reasons for which the Commission believes that a specific proposal should be withdrawn or modified. The Commission shall take the view of Parliament into proper consideration. If, for important reasons, the Commission decides to withdraw or modify its proposal, against the wishes of Parliament, it shall explain the reasons for that decision in a statement to Parliament.
MEPs welcome the Commission communication of 27 September 2005, and consider that the withdrawal or modification of the great majority of the proposals mentioned in it will in fact contribute to a simplification of the Community legislative environment. Parliament insists however that the Commission should take into proper consideration the objections raised by the President of the European Parliament.
Parliament welcomes the fact that, before adopting its final position, the Commission has again reviewed its proposals in the light of Parliament’s objections. The House acknowledges that, in every case in which the Commission has not accepted those objections, it has stated reasons for not doing so and that in some cases it has also indicated possible initiatives by means of which Parliament’s wishes could be met.
The report stresses that in future proceedings of this nature, the Commission should present specific reasons for the withdrawal or the modification of each proposal, and not confine itself to invoking general principles that do not clearly explain the reasons why the Commission believes that a specific proposal should be withdrawn or modified.
MEPs ask the Commission, immediately after it has been appointed, to draw up and submit to Parliament and the Council a list stating which of its predecessor’s legislative proposals it intends to retain. They also ask the Commission to include in its annual legislative and working programme a list of the proposals it intends to withdraw or modify, in order to allow Parliament to express its point of view in accordance with its prerogatives under the Treaties and the procedures laid down in the Framework Agreement of 26 May 2005.
Parliament recognises, however, that, within clear limits, the ability of the Commission to withdraw a legislative proposal during a procedure leading to its adoption
– flows from its right of legislative initiative and constitutes a logical complement to its ability to modify a proposal,
– may contribute to enhancing the role of the Commission in the legislative procedure, and
– can be considered as a positive element in ensuring that the procedures leading to the adoption of a Community act and the interinstitutional dialogue are aimed at promoting the ‘Community interest.
