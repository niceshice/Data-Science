Humanitarian aid

EU S.O.S. squad The need to think about reforestation, land use and managing water through dykes are just two things MEPs want governments to take action on in the wake of recent natural disasters. Floods in Portuguese Madeira and storm Xynthia in Europe this year have claimed scores of lives. Natural calamities were debated Thursday morning (11 March). Recent earthquakes in Chile and Turkey have also brought emergency responses into focus.
In the debate and the resolution adopted by the House MEPs expressed their "deepest sympathy" with all the victims.
As well as the human cost the impact on the environment, tourism, biodiversity were all mentioned in the debate.
"Increasingly frequent" storms and floods
What seems clear is that such catastrophes will grow more apparent as the impact of climate change becomes more paramount. As the resolution states: "It has become clear in recent years that problems with floods, storms and other extreme weather phenomena are likely to be increasingly frequent. Investment in mitigating climate change is important in order to prevent such catastrophes."
Several MEPs stressed the need to mobilise the EU's Solidarity Fund which was set up in the wake of flooding in 2002 to help regions affected by natural disasters. French MEP Elisabeth Morin-Chartier (EPP) called for the solidarity fund to be used to help victims "we always complain that Europe is too far of our citizens is the opportunity to show them otherwise" she told the House.
Condolence but need for tangible help
Dutch MEP Lambert Van Nistelrooij (EPP) demanded "how is it that the Council (of Ministers) does not follow the Parliament's request to ease the functioning of the European solidarity?"
This was echoed by Portuguese Member Jo√£o Ferreira (GUE/NGL). "Our first words should be words of condolence. But then we should turn to something more tangible, financial aid. Prevention should play a very important role".
Others paid tribute to the people affected "I'll never forget the courage and determination shown by those who lose their houses and properties in Madeira. People in Madeira count on the solidarity of the EU" said Portuguese Socialist Edite Estrela.
