EP President, Jerzy Buzek (L) with Sweden King Carl XVI Gustaf at Stockholm Royal Palace Friday 4 Sept. Ahead of a major policy speech launching his President at the September session of the European Parliament, EP President Jerzy Buzek was in Stockholm on Friday (4 September) to hold talks with Swedish PM Fredrik Reinfeldt, current holder of the EU Presidency. The financial crisis, the forthcoming Copenhagen climate conference, immigration reform and energy issues were among the things discussed.
Mr Buzek also held talks with Swedish MPs and the Speaker of the Swedish Riksdag Per Westerberg, as well as Sweden's Europe Minister and ex-MEP Cecilia Malmstr√∂m. He also met with King Carl XVI Gustaf.
Cooperation between MEPs and the Council of Ministers (which Sweden currently heads) will be crucial for the forthcoming few months as issues like immigration reform are debated.
