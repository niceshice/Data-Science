Hungarian EPP-ED Member Zsolt Becsey wants to help entrepreneurs with micro-credits Pioneered by Bangladeshi economist Muhammad Yunus, micro-credits have become a way for poor and excluded people in parts of the developing world to access credit allowing them to start up mini-businesses. Now Hungarian MEP Zsolt Becsey wants to extend the scheme to the poorest people in Europe. At midday on Wednesday the European Parliament will vote on his report. We spoke to him about the issues involved.
Micro-credits are familiar in less-developed countries but not in Europe. Why do we need them?
The aim is to target people in Europe who lack their own resources and the collateral necessary for traditional banks. The idea is to bring them into the labour market where traditionally they would be excluded.
Why should lending institutions like banks get involved?
It is win-win situation. Experience not only in Asia but also in France and Romania has shown that more than 90% of start-up enterprises survive more than two years and so contribute to the labour market. These entrepreneurs later become clients of commercial banks. Hence micro-credits act as a sort of incubator for potential clients so banks have an incentive to participate in social banking.
Micro-credits have been identified with the developing world, does this mean Europe is regressing?
No, but Europe has to deal with those segments of society outside the labour market such as the Roma community and immigrants. Otherwise Europe will have great difficulties in sustaining the 70% employment levels it needs to develop.
What will happen if and when MEPs approve it?
We hope the new Commission will take up the legislative invitation. In addition, we hope that the pilot project on micro-credits, voted in the EU budget, will start at the end of this year.
