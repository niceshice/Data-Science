MEPs have approved the legal changes necessary for new Member States wishing to adopt the euro as their currency, possibly as early as 1 January 2007. A report by Dariusz Rosati (PES, PL) seeks modifications in the timetable for the cash changeover, but otherwise broadly support's the Commission's plans.
MEPs say the period between adoption of the euro and the introduction of notes and coins should be no more than one year, while agreeing with the Commission that it could be eliminated altogether . They want to limit the period of dual circulation of the old and new notes and coins to no more than two months, with banks changing the old currencies for euro without charge for a further three months . Finally, they call for thorough preparations by the Member States adopting the single currency, notably including sufficiently lengthy periods of dual pricing.
The changes need to become law by the end of 2005 if there is to be sufficient time for country's aiming to adopt the euro in January 2007 to make the necessary preparations. Currently, Estonia, Lithuania and Slovenia are aiming at this entry date.
