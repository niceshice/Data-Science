Albertini - Consolidate EU before Croatia accession In the summer, Parliament decided on who will chair each of its committees. The person holding the gavel of the Foreign Affairs Committee is Italian Gabriele Albertini. Who is this former mayor of Milan? What can we expect from him and what are his strong and weak spots? "A good consensus-builder" and someone who "prefers facts to words" is what the people working closely to him say. Read on to discover more.
During the previous European Parliamentary term, Mr Albertini worked in the transport committee with former MEP Georg Jarzembowski who calls him "a very open-minded, experienced and eloquent person".
"Although he is a true Italian, he always is on time"
He said, working with him was a "joy because he is efficient, knowledgeable and always good for an argument." He adds, "although he is a true Italian, he always is on time - and this is not always typical for Italians: he is a European Italian".
Luca Toschi, Mr Albertini's assistant at the European Parliament since 2006 said "his most outstanding capacity is to listen and to understand the person in front of him". Toschi says: "Having been mayor of a big city for 9 years, he is used to needing 360 degree vision, without ever losing the final goal. He is very aware of his limits, and never hides how important for him are his collaborators."
"He combines a huge classical culture - famous his long quotes in Latin - with freshness and curiosity, without any ideological barrier," says Andrea Vento, director of International Relations in Milan when Albertini was mayor. "He is authoritative without being authoritarian: he doesn't need to raise his voice...and then he has a strong sense of humour."
Advocate of bus and coach passengers' rights
Mr Jarzembowski and Mr Toschi agree that Mr Albertini's biggest success as an MEP was getting rules on bus and coach passengers' rights through the EP. "He showed his ability to negotiate and take into account all his interlocutors, from the big bus companies to NGOs representing people with reduced mobility. He talked to Greens and Socialists," explains Mr Toschi.
Mr Jarzembowski said, "in the end he came up with a solution that was nearly unanimously accepted by the Parliament. He is a good mediator." He expects this to be a valuable skill in his new role. "In the foreign affairs committee you have divergent views and it is a large committee. I think he will be able to mediate among the groups and try to find consensuses on the major lines: that is why I think he will be an excellent chairman".
This is the first in a series of profiles of the chairs of Parliament's committees.
