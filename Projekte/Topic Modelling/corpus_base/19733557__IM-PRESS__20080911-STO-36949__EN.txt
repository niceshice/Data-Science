MEPs inspired by Cern physics research

Large Hadron Collider under French-Swiss border Recent physics experiments in Geneva will boost European science. That is the view of two leading MEPs who are closely involved in the EU's 7th framework programme for science and research. They point to the international team of physicists on the project and funding for scientists to return to their home universities as two examples.
Since early September scientists at Cern, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, have been conducting the world's largest physics experiment.
They have been using a Large Hadron Collider (LHC) particle accelerator to smash particles together at the speed of light in a bid to unlock the secrets of the Universe.
Worldwide web created by Cern
All but two countries who are taking part in the Nuclear Research Organisation are EU members with the Union being a major partner and paymaster of the project. Over the next few years until 2013 the European Union has committed over 50 billion euros to scientific research.
It is later impact of scientific research that most impressed Italian MEP Umberto Guidoni, 54, a former astronaut and physics researcher. In the European Parliament he is now involved in nuclear research and training issues under the 7th Euratom framework programme.
Speaking to us Mr Guidoni (GUE/NGL) said that "even if not immediately ready to use, basic research can disclose profitable perspectives for science and technology, as shown by the example of world wide web - created by Cern to manage a huge amount of data".
Polish MEP Jerzy Buzek, 68, (EPP-ED) identifies space, nanotechnologies, scientific exchange and the research infrastructure as areas where the physics experiment and the resulting cooperation could pay off.
MEP stresses wider role science can play
He also points to the involvement of Universities such as Helsinki, Leeds and Leipzig. Buzek follows this area closely as he is parliament's draftsman for reports on the European research programme.
Mr Buzek draws parallels between Cern and another international science project - ITER in France, which is looking at the scientific and technical feasibility of fusion power.
Drawing wider lessons is also important: "we have to embark on big scientific projects to find the answer for the biggest social and economic questions - like energy" said Mr Buzek.
