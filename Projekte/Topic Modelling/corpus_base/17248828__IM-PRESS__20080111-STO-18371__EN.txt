Protestors in Kenya lay down the law
The fight against climate change and resolving the status of Kosovo are among the priorities that Slovenia's Prime Minister Janez Janša laid out to MEPs Wednesday for his country's Presidency of the EU. Ahead of a resolution on Thursday MEPs also debated the crisis in Kenya with condemnation of the violence and a call for fresh elections. Ahead of a visit by President Musharraf to the EP's foreign affairs committee next week the House debated the situation in Pakistan.
Mr Janša contrasted the position that people in Slovenia find themselves in now with that under Communism. In particular he spoke of the ability to travel freely around the European Union as the country has just joined the Schengen area.
As well as energy, the fight against climate change and resolution of the Kosovo impasse he stressed the need for a "free flow of knowledge". He told MEPs that his idea would be to make this the "fifth freedom" of the EU after free movement of goods, services, people and capital. In this, the year of intercultural dialogue, he pledged to push forward this agenda.
Kenya - MEPs call for elections but EU aid should continue says Commission
Recent turmoil in Kenya following disputed Presidential elections was on the agenda Wednesday afternoon. There was a general call for fresh elections and for both presidential candidates to try and resolve the crisis. MEPs condemned the violence in which scores of people have been killed.
Kenya is a recipient of large scale EU aid and in the debate the Commissioner for development and humanitarian aid Louis Michel said this should continue - otherwise the ordinary people of Kenya would suffer even more.
