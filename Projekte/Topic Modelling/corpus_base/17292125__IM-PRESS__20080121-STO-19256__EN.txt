President Pervez Musharraf used a meeting with MEPs on Monday to assure them that Pakistan would hold free and fair elections. He also stressed that the Pakistani security forces were in no way complicit in the murder of Benazir Bhutto. MEPs from the Foreign Affairs Committee and South East Asia delegation voiced scepticism over the extent of media freedom in Pakistan and whether the President wants an international investigation of the Bhutto assassination.
Speaking confidently President Musharraf laid out what he considers to be the achievements of his nine years in power - a growing economy, a liberal media with "50 channels operating freely" and rising levels of employment and literacy.
During talks lasting over an hour and a half, some MEPs expressed scepticism about the level of press freedom in Pakistan, but President Musharraf invited them to come and see the independence of the media for themselves.
He highlighted the role Pakistan and its army and security forces have played in the post 9/11 war on terrorism. He chided MEPs, saying that Pakistan was "living in terrorism's fire, you are merely getting part of the heat".
Assassination of Benazir Bhutto
Where MEPs and President Musharraf did have a meeting of minds was on the murder of Benazir Bhutto with all sides condemning it. However, Mr Musharraf was forced to reject any hint of state complicity in the murder by the Pakistan army or ISI security services.
Spanish MEP José Ignacio Salafranca wondered what Bhutto’s assassins were trying to achieve and asked whether President Musharraf was in favour of an international investigation into the case.
President Musharraf defended allegations that Mrs Bhutto was left unprotected by stressing the murder took place outside the rally and after scheduled events. "The security didn't tell her to go out and wave to her friends", he told MEPs.
Internal opposition and 18 February elections
In reference to the confrontation inside Pakistan with Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry (whom he tried to remove in March 2007 prompting riots by lawyers), Mr Musharraf described the Chief Justice as "politicised, inept, corrupt and nepotistic".
Looking ahead to the elections on 18 February which were postponed due to Mrs Bhutto's assassination, many MEPs were concerned about the extent to which they would be fair. President Musharraf said that the elections would be "free, fair, transparent and peaceful".
A delegation of MEPs will travel to Pakistan for the elections to take part in international election monitoring. German EPP-ED Member Michael Gahler is likely to lead the EU observation mission to the elections.
Belgian Socialist Véronique De Keyser spoke for many MEPs when she said that they were "receiving Musharraf with respect, but not with open arms".
