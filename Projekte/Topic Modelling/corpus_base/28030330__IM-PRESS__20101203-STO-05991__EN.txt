Chinese dissident and Nobel Peace laureate Liu Xiaobo (L) and his wife Liu Xia (R) in Beijing © Belga/AFP Relations with China are complicated. On one hand the EP has been highly critical of its human rights record, but on the other China offers huge trade opportunities. That dichotomy was clear this week when the Human Rights Sub-Committee discussed China's reaction to the awarding of the Nobel Prize to Lu Xiaobo and Tibet on Monday while the Trade Committee talked business with China's Ambassador to the EU Song Zhe on Tuesday.
Human Rights Sub-Committee on the Nobel Prize winner
A great deal of discussion was devoted to the recent Nobel Peace Prize winner and Chinese dissident Lu Xiaobo, who is in prison. The award has drawn criticism from the Chinese authorities and praise from many in the West.
The Chair of the meeting, Slovak MEP Eduard Kukan, said that Parliament would welcome a statement form EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton calling for the release of Lu Xiaobo, his wife and their supporters,
Heidi Hautala, Chair of the Human Rights Sub-Committee and EP vice-president Edward McMillan-Scott attended the Noble prize ceremony, which was held without Lu Xiaobo.
Vincent Metten, the EU policy director for the international campaign for Tibet told the meeting that "the courageous attribution of the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo reminds us of the important and brave combat of Chinese opposition and focuses the attention on important human rights violations in China. "
Tibet troubles MEPs
MEPs also debated the issue of Tibet. At the end of November the European Parliament passed a resolution which condemned plans to make Chinese the language of instruction in Tibet. The text also stressed the need to preserve and protect the distinct cultural, religious and national identity of the 6 million Tibetans.
Ngawang Choephel, President of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organisation spoke of a "human rights crisis faced by people the people in East Turkistan, Mongolia and Tibet" and "cultural genocide". He spoke of a crackdown on "spiritual leaders, human rights defenders, environmentalists, writers, intellectuals, artists and Tibetan entrepreneurs".
International Trade Committee
Human rights and Tibet were also mentioned by Peter Šťastný (EPP, Slovakia), Carl Schlyter (Greens/EFA, Sweden) during discussions with the Ambassador about trade.
However, several MEPs stressed that economic cooperation had withstood several crises and had continued to deepen.
Ambassador Song said, "you may have noticed the fast changes in the past three decades, not only in economic development, but also of the political institutions and democracy. This progress shouldn't be neglected."
He noted that there were some areas of notable cooperation between China and the European Union and said that Beijing and Brussels should "increase policy coordination to create a favourable environment, oppose trade protectionism and maintain our markets open, expand mutual benefit to motivate stronger cooperation". Mr Song noted that China is a fast growing consumer market, with rapid industrial growth and is building a greener economy and cooperating with the EU in science and technology.
Mr Schlyter urged China to adopt a different mindset to the environment and welcomed the mention of green issues in the Ambassador's address.
