Journalists asking questions during a press conference in Brussels Clamping down on the derivatives trade
Legislation to make trade over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives safer and more transparent will be put to a vote on Thursday.

Turkey's progress: MEPs to call for better treatment of journalists
Turkey's laws curbing media freedom and numerous trials of journalists will be a key issue in Wednesday's debate on its EU accession prospects. On Thursday, MEPs will vote a resolution urging it to do more to reform the judiciary and protect civil liberties.
Progress of Serbia, Kosovo and Montenegro towards joining the EU

MEPs to urge Commission to strengthen air passenger rights
Airlines should give stranded passengers clear information and immediate help, MEPs say in a draft resolution to be voted on Thursday. When airlines go bankrupt or cease flying, passengers should be repatriated free of charge, it adds.
EU resettlement programme for refugees
EU countries would get more EU support to resettle refugees on their territory if Parliament approves a new joint resettlement programme on Thursday. Starting in 2013, the programme would focus on vulnerable refugees, such as women at risk and unaccompanied minors.
EP budget 2013 to be frozen in real terms
Parliament votes on its administrative budget for 2013 on Thursday. The Budgets Committee recommends that the increase in the budget should not exceed the EU-wide inflation rate of 1.9%, which means freezing it in real terms. However, €8,5 million should be added to accommodate the arrival of Croatian MEPs, it says.
Parliament to call for more sanctions against Belarus

Special committee on organised crime: membership
Parliament votes Thursday on the membership of a special committee to investigate organised crime, corruption and money laundering, and recommend measures to tackle them. The committee will have a one-year mandate, and is to start work by the end of April 2012.
MEPs to call for better protection for EU citizens' basic rights

Opening: President Schulz condemns Toulouse killings
Martin Schulz The recent callous and cowardly murder of three soldiers, three children and a teacher in Montauban and Toulouse must strengthen Parliament's resolve to uphold the values of mutual respect and tolerance, said President Martin Schulz, opening the Brussels mini-session.
"Rarely have I experienced such a repellent act," said Mr Schulz, voicing MEPs' sympathy with the victims' parents and siblings, and condemning "gruesome and cowardly murderers" who take the lives of innocent children in order to propagate their "crazy views".
Together with the city of Toulouse and its Jewish and Islamic communities, "we are all called upon to stand by the values of mutual respect and tolerance. There are no political divisions on this point. These values are the foundation of the civilised world," he added.
Mr Schulz next welcomed Turkish journalist Ahmat Şık, just released from a year's detention. To MEPs' applause, he reiterated Parliament's concern at long pre-trial detentions.
Finally, he welcomed a delegation from the United Republic of Tanzania on an official visit.
Incoming/outgoing MEPs
Mr Schulz welcomed Ms Birgit Collin-Langen (EPP, DE), replacing Mr Kurt Lechner, with effect from 17 March 2012.
