Europarltv MEPs join MPs to discuss energy European "grid" debated Sustainability, competitiveness and security of energy supply: the three pillars to the foundation of a new EU energy community. A first step would be the interconnection of national energy grids, argued the 250 plus MEPs and MPs gathered for a joint parliamentary meeting in the European Parliament on 7-8 June. "People have great expectations," said EP President Jerzy Buzek, "and we must deliver on them."
The debate, entitled "Towards a European Energy Community for the 21st Century" was co-chaired by Mr Buzek and the Speaker of the Spanish Senate, Javier Rojo.
Mr. Buzek launched the initiative on 5 May, together with ex-European Commission President Jacques Delors, building on a report from think tank Notre Europa . The report's writers were on hand to explain why we need an EU energy community with integrated networks, price stabilisation measures, a diversified energy portfolio and common control over resources.
Schengen model of open borders proposed
Speaking in the debate Professor Marc Van Der Woude of the Erasmus University of Rotterdam said that there was a industrial revolution coming and that it would probably be in the energy sector.
In reference to the original European Coal and Steel Community he told the hearing that "there's been regression rather than progression in energy policies".
He offered the vision that the EU could adopt the Schengen model of free movement around Europe to ease energy cooperation.
Grid a "fundamental building block"
Leigh Hancher, professor of European Law, Tillburg University, said an energy network, a grid, is "a fundamental building block for competitive energy market."
She asked whether we have an energy policy: "We have not delivered on affordable access, nor on sustainability. In security we have some progress. But is it enough?"
Mr Buzek suggested that steps towards an energy community could include building networks and storage facilities, large scale research (renewable energies + efficiency of production and use, as "we will have fossil fuel for years to come") and pooling our resources.
Energy "a geopolitical force"
Polish Christian Democrat Jacek Saryusz-Wolski told the hearing that "energy is not just an economic commodity - it is a security issue and a geopolitical force", referring to the Russian-Ukraine gas disputes in 2006 and 2009.
He said that a grid was a precondition for development of renewable energies, such as wind and solar energy, and reducing CO2 emissions.
Swedish Green Per Bolund stressed the need for solidarity. "We need solidarity, so that when the wind doesn't blow in Sweden, Spain will share their solar energy."
Danger of dependency on one supplier
Lithuanian Socialist Zigmantas Balčytis said that without a sovereign energy market, we will lose on a competitive level. A good first step would be a gas purchasing group.
Spain's Energy Minister Pedro Marín said that "to have a "real" internal market, we need to diversify our internal energy supply."Previous crises have shown us the dangers of being dependent on only one energy supplier," he said.
Europe's Competition Commissioner Joaquín Almunia noted that an energy community can't be created in one day, but applauded regional co-operation as "very important in the meantime".
Mr Garcia said energy will play a fundamental role in renewing our energy structures in the EU. "It used to be a wish. Now it's a need - an urgent need."
