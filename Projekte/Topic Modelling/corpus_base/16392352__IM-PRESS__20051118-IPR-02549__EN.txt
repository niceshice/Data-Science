The European Parliament has condemned the statements of Iranian President Mahmoud AHMADINEJAD that Israel "must be wiped off the map" and reaffirmed Israel's right to exist within internationally recognised borders and in security, side by side with an independent and viable Palestinian state.
In a resolution adopted by a large majority, MEPs expressed their concern about the possible consequences of such statements and praised the position of several senior Palestinian officials, who have equally condemned Ahmedinejad's views. They also welcomed the statement by the Central Council of Muslims in Germany that every nation has to respect international law and the rights of other states.
MEPs underlined that the statements cause concern about Iran's role in the region and its intentions. They called on Iran to refrain from any support for international terrorist groups.
The House reaffirms its unalterable commitment to Israel's right to existence within internationally recognised borders and in security, side by side with an independent and viable Palestinian State.
MEPs call upon Iran to recognise the State of Israel and its right to live in peace and security and to use its influence in the Middle East to persuade movements with which it maintains relations to refrain from the use of violence.
Parliament also said that the EU should continue to seek a diplomatic solution to the question of Iran's nuclear programme.
