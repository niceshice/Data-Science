The appointment of Mr Lazaros Stavrou Lazarou (CY) and Mr Gijs de Vries (NL) as members of the European Court of Auditors was approved by the European Parliament on Thursday.
Mr Lazarou was nominated by the Cypriot authorities to replace Mr Kikis Kazamias, whose mandate expires on 1 November. Mr De Vries was nominated by the Dutch government to take over from Mr Maarten Engwirda, who has resigned and needs to be replaced for the remainder of his term of office, from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2013.
In preparation of the hearings, the two candidates were asked to answer the written questionnaire prepared by the Budgetary Control Committee. Last week the candidates had separate hearings, consisting of a five-minute presentation and 25 minutes of questioning by MEPs, after which the Committee voted unanimously in favour of both candidates.
The appointments were approved in secret ballots. Mr Lazarou's appointment was approved with
