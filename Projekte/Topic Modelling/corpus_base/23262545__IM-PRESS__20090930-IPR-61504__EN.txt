The Bureau of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly strongly condemns the use of force by the Guinean government to disperse the demonstrations that took place in Conakry, Guinea, on Monday, 28 September 2009, which led to the deaths of more than one hundred civilians.
The actions of the Guinean authorities are a clear violation of the essential elements of the Cotonou Agreement, as provided for in Article 9 of the Agreement, to which the Government of Guinea is a signatory. The Members of the JPA Bureau express their sympathy to the families of the victims.
The Bureau urges the Guinean Government and the security forces to exercise maximum restraint as well as uphold the rule of law and respect for basic human rights. The Bureau calls on the Government of Guinea and all stakeholders to respect the letter and the spirit of the Cotonou Agreement and to commit itself to a peaceful and democratic restoration of civilian government through the early holding of transparent, free and fair elections.
