The European Parliament adopted a report by 556 votes in favour to 62 against and 15 abstentions by Luís CAPOULAS SANTOS (PES, PT) on the conclusion of a fisheries agreement between the European Community and Guinea-Bissau. The Protocol to the agreement, which will apply until 15 June 2011, grants fishing possibilities for 23 tuna seiners and surface longliners from Spain, France and Portugal and for 14 pole-and-line vessels from Spain and France, subject to a total of 37 licences.
This fisheries agreement with Guinea-Bissau repeals and replaces the agreement which entered into force in 1980 and was one of the oldest agreements signed by the Community . The new Protocol covers the period from 16 June 2007 to 15 June 2011.
MEPs approved today, under consultation, the proposal for a regulation on the conclusion of the agreement with some amendments, which are intended to highlight the importance of enhancing Parliament’s role and the information supplied to it.
The fishing opportunities set out in the Protocol to the agreement are allocated among the Member States as follows:
(a) shrimp fishing: Spain - 1421 GRT; Italy - 1776 GRT; Greece - 137 GRT; Portugal - 1066 GRT
(b) fin-fish/cephalopods: Spain - 3143 GRT; Italy - 786 GRT; Greece - 471 GRT
(c) tuna seiners and surface longliners:
Spain - 10 vessels; France - 9 vessels; Portugal - 4 vessels.
(d) pole-and-line vessels:
Spain - 10 vessels France - 4 vessels.
The financial contribution is fixed at EUR 7 million per year. 35% of this financial contribution (EUR 2.450 million) will be allocated each year to the support and implementation of initiatives taken in the context of the sectoral fisheries policy drawn up by the Government of Guinea-Bissau. An additional specific contribution of EUR 500 000 per year will also be targeted at improving the health and hygiene conditions of fishery products. However, this contribution could also be used to support control and surveillance measures. The Protocol will also contain a financial mechanism, with a maximum allocation of EUR 1 million per year, aiming to improve the use of fishing opportunities by shipowners, and support for setting up joint ventures.
