The European Parliament strongly condemns the Belarus regime's "indiscriminate attacks" against any perceived opponents.
The joint resolution condemns in particular the actions against the Union of Poles in Belarus and the continuous persecution of Polish minority activists, the complete marginalisation of the Roma minority, the ban against the Reformed Evangelical Church, the ban on foreign financing of conferences or other meetings and the refusal to admit a delegation of MEPs on a fact-finding mission in August 2005.
Parliament calls on the Council and Commission to raise the situation in Belarus with the Russian authorities. The House also calls for expanding the visa-ban list should the freedom of speech, assembly and religion not improve in Belarus. MEPs welcome the launch, by the European Commission, of independent broadcasting to Belarus, but calls for more resources. European political parties and groups in the Parliament are encourage to increase their contacts with and support for the Belarus opposition.
