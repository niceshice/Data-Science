Doha Round: a successful conclusion could stabilise the economy
External/international trade
2008-10-09 - 12:05
Following the WTO Doha Round suspension of negotiations last July, MEPs are concerned over the future of the Round. The House calls on India and the USA to find a political solution on the conditions for the application of Special Safeguard Mechanisms (SSM) over which the negotiations collapsed at the Geneva Ministerial meeting.
In the context of the economic and financial crisis, MEPs are convinced that a successful conclusion of the Doha Round could be a stabilising factor for the world economy. MEPS thus reiterate their commitment to the multilateral approach to trade policy
The resolution calls on the EU and the USA, as well as the G20, to assume their responsibilities in the current negotiations and to make every effort to reach a deal as rapidly as possible. The progress made during the negotiations so far should provide a basis at the next meeting for achieving a successful outcome.
The Parliament calls on the developed and advanced developing countries to follow the EU Everything but Arms initiative, offering 100% duty-free, quota-free market access for less developed countries.
Reform of the WTO
According to MEPs, difficulties of the Doha Development Agenda highlight the need, once the Round is over, to address the question of reform of the WTO in order to make it more transparent and improve its democratic legitimacy. Parliamentarians should exercise a more vigorous and effective scrutiny in the area of international trade, says the resolution.
The resolution was adopted with 567 votes in favour, 37 against and 47 abstentions.
