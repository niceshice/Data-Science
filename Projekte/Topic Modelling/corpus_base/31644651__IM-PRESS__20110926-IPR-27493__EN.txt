Andrew BOREHAM BXL (+32) 2 28 42319 PORT (+32) 498 98 34 01 EMAIL press-en@europarl.europa.eu President Jerzy Buzek opened the plenary by looking forward to the economic governance "six pack" vote, question time with Euro Group President Jean-Claude Juncker, and Commission President José Manuel Barroso's State of the Union address. He also mentioned the Eastern Partnership debate with High Representative Catherine Ashton, welcomed Council President Herman Van Rompuy's first UN Assembly address on the EU's behalf, and condemned the executions of Troy Davis and Alireza Molla-Soltani.
That the "six pack" is ready for a vote on Wednesday, after a year's negotiations, is a "great triumph", which "demonstrates that the Community method is a good way to deal with the crisis", said Mr Buzek, adding that the crisis had highlighted the need to process some legislation faster.
Tuesday's question time with Euro Group President Jean-Claude Juncker would give MEPs a "new means to represent citizens", by putting their questions about the crisis to him, said Mr Buzek.
Turning to Wednesday's State of the Union address, Mr Buzek said that he was expecting further legislation to counter the crisis.
The debate on Tuesday with foreign policy High Representative Catherine Ashton, in the run-up to the 29-30 September Eastern Partnership Summit in Warsaw, would be another opportunity for MEPs to demonstrate their awareness of the seriousness of the problems facing citizens, he added.
Executions of Troy Davis and Alireza Molla-Soltani
Mr Buzek condemned the execution in the USA of Troy Davis on 21 September. Capital punishment is "inhuman and unacceptable" in any circumstances, said Mr Buzek, reiterating Parliament's opposition to the death penalty.
At the same time, Mr Buzek condemned the execution in Iran, on the same day, of 17-year old Alireza Molla-Soltani, adding that executing minors breaches international law.
Resignations and new arrivals
Mr Buzek announced the resignation of Daniël van der Stoep (NI, NL), who will be replaced by Auke Zijlstra.
Former MEP Eva-Britt Svensson, who had already resigned, will be replaced by Mikael Gustafsson (GUE/NGL, SE).
