Last year pink highlighted breast cancer
Every 2 minutes a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer and every 6 minutes someone dies of it somewhere in the EU. Every year it claims 88,000 women and 1000 men. October is "International Breast Cancer Awareness Month" and on 17 October Parliament and the European Cancer Network are organising a workshop on ways to tackle the condition. A week later MEPs will vote on a breast cancer resolution with the focus on research, helping patients back to work and EU guidelines for nursing the disease.
Current guidelines recommend two specialised nurses at each healthcare unit, but there is still no overall consensus about the necessary professional skills of such breast care nurses.
Breast cancer awareness month is an annual event every October to increase awareness of the condition, raise funds for research into the disease and support people affected by it. The workshop on 17 October will concentrate particularly on training breast care nurses. Healthcare experts and nurses from across Europe will attend to offer their expertise and experiences.
Screening vital to fighting disease
The resolution to be voted on during Parliament's Plenary session on 24 October is based on oral questions jointly from Parliament's Environment, Employment and Woman's Rights Committees. It will build on the resolution of 2003 which called on European Union members to reduce mortality rates for the disease by up to 25% within five years
German Socialist member Karin Jöns, who chairs an all-party group of MEPs on breast cancer, says mammography screening is a key area. Research by the World Health Organisation says the disease can be reduced by 35% with screening carried out to European standards. "There are corresponding EU guidelines since 1992. But still 14 of 25 members do not have nationwide screening" said Ms Jöns.
Poignant in Pink
On last year's "Breast Cancer Day" the Parliament was illuminated in pink, the international colour of the fight against breast cancer, in order to draw attention to the condition and all those who suffer from it.
If it has taken you two minutes to read this article - someone, somewhere in the EU will have been diagnosed with breast cancer.
