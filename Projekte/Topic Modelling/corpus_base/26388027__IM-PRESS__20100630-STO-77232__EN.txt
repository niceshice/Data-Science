A child on a beach putting yellow starfish in a circle Â© European Union 2010 19 July to 27 August Parliamentary recess Next full sitting on 6 September During the July plenary session in Strasbourg MEPs tackled the SWIFT data agreement with the US, bankers' bonuses, novel food, the new EU diplomatic service and passengers' rights. They also looked back at 6 months with Spain at the helm of the EU Council and forward to the Belgian presidency. As MEPs take a break, we look back to some highlights so far this year.
From 19 July to 27 August Parliament is in recess and MEPs are away from Brussels and Strasbourg. There will be less activity within the Parliament so we will have a slower flow of articles on our website.
When the recess ends at the beginning of September, MEPs will come back and start preparing for a busy autumn of legislative work, filled with meetings, debates and decisive votes. The first plenary session after the recess will begin 6 September.
In the meantime, we looked back at some of our stories from the last few months and republish some of our favourite, most interesting and noteworthy moments of the year. We will publish compilations of interviews with MEPs and VIPs, videos from EuroparlTV and other articles on topics that we hope you will find useful and interesting.
Stay tuned with our regular Facebook updates and discussions. Enjoy your summer reading on our website.
