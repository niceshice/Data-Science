MEPs debate economic governance, nuclear waste in June Brussels plenary
Institutions
2011-06-21 - 14:31
Vote on next ECB head MEPs finally had the chance to debate the economic governance package, aimed at preventing future crises, in the plenary on Wednesday. They voted Thursday on texts agreed with ministers and the European Commission but since there are still points of contention they stopped short of voting on the entire package, so that talks can continue with the aim of finalising an agreement as soon as possible.
MEPs also discussed the export of nuclear waste when they met 22-23 June in Brussels. Also on the agenda, was a vote on new rules to protect consumers who buy items via the internet, on the doorstep or by email. Buyers will have two weeks to change their minds but will have to pay to return items.
MEPs approved Mario Draghi's candidacy as the next European Central Bank president and discussed funding aimed at helping the development of the EU's regions.

Future of CAP, 2012 budget on agenda
Parliament sticks to its guns on economic governance six-pack
MEPs are determined to make EU governments act more responsibly with regard to their budget deficits and debts. They insist that it should not be left to the Member States to impose budgetary discipline but that the Commission should play a bigger role here. As it has yet to agree with the Council on this point, Parliament will vote only on its amendments, but will not yet close the procedure in order to leave room for further talks.
New European consumer rights law enters the final lap
An EU-wide right for consumers to change their minds within two weeks about distance purchases of goods as well as clearer pricing rules for internet sales are among the main benefits of new rules on consumer protection, under a deal struck between Parliament and Council on an update to the EU consumer rights directive.
Parliament to vote on Mario Draghi's appointment as ECB President
Mario Draghi was recommended to succeed Jean-Claude Trichet as President of the European Central Bank by the EP Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee on 15 June but this needs to be confirmed by Parliament in a plenary vote on 23 June. Mr Draghi's nomination is also on the European Council agenda of 23-24 June.
2012 budget: keep up investment to help Europe emerge from crisis
Key investments in education, social inclusion, poverty reduction and a knowledge-based society must go ahead without delay, says a draft resolution by the Budgets Committee on the 2012 EU budget proposed by the Commission. If backed by the full Parliament, the resolution will constitute the mandate for MEPs in their first round of budget negotiations with the Council and Commission on 11 July.
How the future CAP might look
A revamped EU agriculture policy providing secure food supplies, environmental protection, new jobs and renewable energy is the goal sketched out in a draft resolution by the Agriculture Committee. The committee also urges that EU budget spending on the farming sector be maintained at current levels.
MEPs stand up for regional aid
Economic, social and territorial cohesion in the EU must be adequately funded in future, insists the Regional Development Committee in five draft resolutions to be debated and put to the vote on Thursday. Simpler access to EU aid, more effective controls, better cross-border cooperation and a possible expansion in the number of regions to benefit from EU funding are among ideas highlighted by MEPs.
Parliament's input to EU summit
MEPs will state their views on key topics for the 23-24 June European Council in a debate with Council and Commission representatives on Wednesday.

Consumer rights: "big step closer to a truly common internal market in Europe"
Refunds must be within 14 days ©BELGA_ANP_LexVanLiesenhout 14 days to change your mind buyer pays cost of returning items ministers still to approve new rules to be implemented within 2 years MEPs voted Thursday on a new deal to protect EU consumers when they buy items via the internet or through any other sort of distance selling, including by door-to-door salesmen. After tough negotiations, the EP, Council and European Commission compromised on clear common conditions for firms competing across the EU's single market. But what does exactly does it mean for EU consumers?
What EU consumers get
14-days to change your mind for any off-premises sales (online, via phone or email or by someone who comes to the door) from the time the item is delivered
if the seller fails to inform the buyer about the right to return goods, the buyer has up to 1 year to return goods
money paid for returned goods must be refunded within 14 days of the withdrawal
delivery must be within 30 days , if it is longer the buyer can cancel the order
the seller is responsible for loss or damage during transit
no more hidden charges and a ban on pre-ticked boxes like those for priority boarding on planes that suddenly increase the price. If you buy online, there will be a pop-up box with the final price at the end of the buying process that must be ticked to accept and complete the sale. Any charges added after that must be covered by the seller
What is not covered
the buyer pays the cost of returning an item . If it is a big item like a sofa or fridge, the cost of returning it must be clear at point of sale
digital goods , like music, films or software programmes are exempt from the right of withdrawal, they are considered sold from the moment the download begins
custom- made items are excluded - for example a dress made specifically for you or a table designed to your specifications
if you cancel a service you must pay for the part of the service you have received . For example if you decide to sell your house and get a solicitor to start conveyancing work and then change your mind a few days later, you will have to pay for the hours spent on the sale, up to the point of cancellation
German Christian Democrat Andreas Schwab , who is guiding the legislation through Parliament said, "Consumers and businesses will equally win. We are a big step closer to a truly common internal market in Europe".
What's next?
The EU Consumer Rights Directive still has to be approved by EU ministers, after which it must be implemented by member states within two years.

Need to resolve disposal of high-level radioactive waste
"We need the highest possible safety standards" The disaster at the Fukushima plant in Japan has made the public very sensitive about all questions related to nuclear safety and one issue that has been debated for decades is what to do with radioactive waste. A report by Romana Jordan Cizelj on the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste, says the "polluter pays" principle should apply. MEPs debated the issue Wednesday and voted on Thursday. We spoke to the rapporteur when her report was debated in in the Energy Committee.
Do you see any risks in the way we deal with radioactive waste and spent fuel?
The main risk regarding nuclear waste in Europe is the societal risk. I would call it the risk of responsibility. In Europe we mostly deal with the disposal of low- and medium-level waste, but not high-level radioactive waste. I don't think this is responsible, especially because we do have technical solutions for this.
High-level radioactive waste is stored in facilities that are not a final, but only an intermediate solution. Spent fuel is usually stored next to the reactors. So it is safely stored, but the safety level would be much higher with final disposal. To have as high as possible safety standards for final disposal is at the core of our responsibility to the public.
It seems there is no real solution for the long-term storage of radioactive waste. What are the main safety standards you are suggesting?
It is true that we don't have any final disposal of high-level radioactive waste, although. Finland and France are close to a final solution. I think it is appropriate that we are talking about common European legislation, which will force member states to really act. The main characteristics of standards, I would say, are the use of state of the art technology, a strong and independent regulatory body and appropriate human and financial resources.
Of course, the directive contains many more aspects. We also have to ensure public confidence and trust not only in the professionals but also in politicians. That's why the directive also includes transparency and public participation.
Who should pay for the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste?
I am a supporter of the general European "polluter pays" principle. We must use this principle in this case. I am proposing an amendment that goes beyond that: the assessment of costs, monitoring and reviews, regular reporting to the Commission and the involvement of national parliaments.
How can we ensure that higher standards in the EU don't mean the waste is exported to third countries?
The Commission is proposing that we prohibit exports of nuclear waste. That's one possibility. A second is that exports are only possible to countries that have the same safety standards as the EU. A third option, and we should do this anyway, is that we try to introduce higher safety standards at an international level, especially in the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency.
On 26 May, the Energy Committee agreed that EU member states should be allowed to export radioactive waste to non-EU countries provided the waste is processed in accordance with EU safety rules.
On 23 June MEPs said nuclear waste exports to countries outside the EU should be prohibited, unless exported for recycling and imported back into the EU, and even within the EU should be permitted only when governed by bilateral agreements. . MEPs also backed stricter rules for protecting and training workers, called for stronger investigatory powers for national authorities and said research on alternatives to burying the waste deep underground should be stepped up.

EU should reduce CO2 30% by 2020 - Eickhout
Need to get tougher to stay competitive The EU should agree before the end of the year to cut its greenhouse gas emissions 30% by 2020, from 1990 levels, in order to achieve the UN goal of limiting global warming to 2º Celsius, Bas Eickhout says. That will boost economic growth and create millions of new jobs, according to the Dutch Green MEP who has drafted a report on the issue. We spoke to him ahead of a debate Wednesday.
Given the tough economic climate, some might argue now isn't the time to come up with expensive proposals. Why do we need to agree a 30% target this year?
In 2009, the EU's greenhouse gas emissions were already down 17% from 1990 levels, partly as a result of the economic downturn. Estimates show that there will be a surplus of 2.4 billion allowances in the CO2 emissions trading system. Furthermore, the absolute cost of meeting our 20% climate target has fallen considerably since the adoption of the climate and energy package in 2008. Moving to a 30% climate reduction target would lead to many benefits including improved health, lower energy import bills and millions of additional jobs.
How can the EU stay competitive if we adopt tougher standards than our competitors?
It is exactly by adopting tougher climate standards that the European economy will remain competitive: boosting economic growth, bringing major health benefits for our citizens and creating millions of jobs, as has been shown by several research institutes over the past months.
Of course, during the transition period to a climate-friendly Europe, we will need to spur innovation and the uptake of green technologies and help those member states with the greatest energy saving potential to reap the benefits. Climate mainstreaming of the EU budget is essential and must become a top priority in the upcoming discussions on the multi-annual financial framework.
The real question is, how can we stay competitive if we stick to fossil fuel rhetoric and an outdated 20% climate target?
How will tougher climate targets affect the lives of ordinary European citizens?
More ambitious climate policies will improve the health of European citizens by improving air quality. This will result in, for example, fewer incidents of asthma and other respiratory diseases.
Moreover, tougher climate targets will stimulate EU industry, which will become more resource efficient. Only such an economy can stay viable for the longer term and deliver the jobs our citizens need.
Do you think ministers will agree on the 30% reduction target?
We call on the Commission to come forward with a legislative proposal to move to a 30% climate target. This move is supported by more and more countries, including the UK, Spain and Denmark. Furthermore, more and more companies are also asking for bolder climate policies. The Council therefore needs to make a move.
A vote on the report is expected in July. Eickhout report Press release on committee vote More about Bas Eikhout Environment committee
Economic governance: Parliament seals its position ahead of European Council
EP wants more transparency, stronger sanctions The EP plenary adopted its position on the economic governance six-pack on Thursday, insisting on a number of new rules which give more ambition and clout to the Commission's original proposals. More transparency, stronger automatic warnings and sanctions as well as new fines are all part of Parliament's position. Left-of-centre groups, however, warn that this represents too much austerity.
Parts of the package, particularly those dealing with strengthening of the stability and growth pact, went through with slim margins, with the S&D, Greens/EFA and GUE/NGL groups voting against because of what they considered to be an excessive focus on fiscal control with little room for continuing vital investment needed for long-term growth and employment. The texts dealing with preventing macro-economic imbalances (overheating economies) garnered significant majorities.
The adopted texts now provide finance ministers and heads of state, ahead of the European Council of 23-24 June, with an official position of the EP as a whole. This position will form the backbone of the talks between MEPs and Member States, which are set to continue in earnest in order to reach a final deal as soon as possible.
Important points emerging from the vote
The adopted texts contain a range of improvements extracted by MEPs during the latest negotiation session concluded with the Hungarian presidency last week. They do not include Ecofin's proposals made on Monday, deemed insufficient by the rapporteurs. Among the new points are:
Increased use of reversed qualified majority voting (RQMV) to make warnings and sanctions more automatic. This is particularly the case regarding the declaration that a Member State has taken no corrective action to remedy identified macroeconomic imbalances.
More transparency by making public more texts and discussions than previously envisaged. Also through the involvement of the EP and national parliaments in holding Member States to account.
Codification of the European semester into the legal texts, thereby giving legal weight to this procedure.
Increased powers for the Commission through requiring more information to be supplied to it than previously envisaged and through surveillance missions to Member States.
A new fine (0.5% GDP) for fraudulent statistics with regard to data on deficits and debt.
An interest bearing deposit sanction (0.1% GDP) in the event of a Member State not acting upon recommendations to rectify a macroeconomic imbalance.
Increased independence of statistical bodies.
More detail on indicators to be used for checking for macroeconomic imbalances to ensure that the Commission does not only look at pure economic indicators but also keeps the social dimension in mind.
Safeguarding of social bargaining processes and wage setting agreements.
Revision clause on Eurobonds (Eurosecurities). By the end of 2011 Commission to prepare a report and possibly legislative proposals.
Pending issues also in the six-pack adopted in plenary
Although there is as yet no firm agreement on the following points, they also feature in the texts adopted on Thursday by MEPs:
No agreement yet on issuing declarations to Member States which disregard Commission warnings on expenditure overshoots. This is included in the adopted texts since it is considered as the door to imposing sanctions and therefore can provide a real incentive to a country to rectify its situation.
Hearing of finance ministers by the EP. The drafting proposed by the plenary would see the EP "offer the opportunity to the Member State concerned (...) to participate in an exchange of views".
A reference to the need to look at high surplus current account countries (like Germany) as well as countries with deficit current accounts (high import countries) when evaluating the causes of a macroeonomic imbalance.

Consumer Rights: Parliament approves new EU-wide rules for on-line shopping
Formal approval by ministers expected for July An EU-wide right for consumers to change their minds about an on-line purchase within two weeks of receiving the good, and new requirements that on-line traders must give buyers precise information on the total price, the goods ordered and the trader's contact details, are among the benefits of new rules approved by Parliament on Thursday.
"We wanted to regulate mainly off-premises and distance contracts such as online trading, as this is where the most cross-border sales take place", commented Parliament's rapporteur and chief negotiator Andreas Schwab (EPP, DE), adding that "The new directive is thus a good example of how more Europe brings more benefits to consumers and traders alike. We have reached a well-balanced deal which meets both calls from consumers and business interests".
The new rules, approved with 615 votes in favour, 16 against and 21 abstentions, will strengthen protection for online shoppers and will also specify rules on delivery and digital downloads whilst cutting red tape for small and medium sized businesses.
As current EU rules on consumer rights predate the digital revolution, consumers today are poorly protected when shopping on line. Concerns about late or non-delivery of goods as well as the patchwork fragmentation of Member States' consumer protection rules are holding consumers back from on-line cross-border shopping. At the same time, businesses cite legislative differences among Member States as the main reason for not selling across borders.
For further information about the Consumer Rights Directive, see the "What the new rules will mean" link below.
Next steps
After today's final vote in Parliament, the last, formal approval by the Council of Ministers is expected to take place in July. Member States will have a maximum of two years to implement the new rules.

Parliament backs Mario Draghi's appointment as ECB President
European Council has to finalise appointment MEPs on Thursday endorsed the nomination of Mario Draghi as incoming President of the European Central Bank, ahead of this week's European Council, which can now finalise his appointment.
President Jerzy Buzek said: "I am very pleased that the European Parliament has approved Mario Draghi as the next President of the European Central Bank. In these tough economic times, it is reassuring to know that the euro-zone will be in safe hands with Mr Draghi and I look forward to working with him."

Agricultural policy after 2013: greener, fairer, more competitive
MEPs want farm budget to remain unchanged until 2020 MEPs want to keep the EU agriculture budget unchanged until 2020 so that farmers have incentives to provide secure food supplies, environmental protection, create new jobs and provide for a competitive EU farming sector.
Ahead of Commission proposals on the future of the Common Agricultural Policy the Parliament is staking out its position for the next long-term budgetary period, running from 2014 to 2020.
In response to rumours of cuts in aid for rural development, MEPs stressed their support for adequate funding for this area.
"The vote sends a clear, strong signal to the commissioner [Dacian Cioloş] and I hope the Commission will bear in mind what we have put into the report and incorporate it in the final legislative proposal", said Albert Dess (EPP, DE), who drafted the resolution.
Making the CAP greener
If the EU's agriculture policy is to provide both secure supplies of high quality food and contribute to environmental protection and renewable energy, it must be adequately funded, say MEPs, to give farmers an incentive to use modern, environmentally friendly techniques.
Direct payments to farmers should be more directly linked to "greening measures" (low carbon emissions, low energy consumption). An EU wide incentive system, 100% financed by the EU, should be set up to support farmers who go in for sustainable production methods.
Fairer distribution of EU funding
Agricultural funding should be distributed more fairly among Member States and among different categories of farmers. Parliament proposes that each EU country should in the future receive a minimum percentage of the EU average payment. MEPs agree with a ceiling on direct payments per farmer but emphasise that new rules must take the size, employment record and environmental performance of each farm into account.
To avoid misuse of public money, direct payments should be reserved for "active farmers", i.e. those who actually use their land for production.
Stability: speculation, crisis management and farmers' bargaining power
Fighting speculation in agricultural commodities and extreme price volatility requires a global-level solution, say MEPs, in order to guarantee greater stability for farmers and secure food supplies for wide public. Parliament proposes a worldwide notification system of current states of stocks to counter speculation in agricultural commodities.
The milk market
To guarantee security of milk supplies, MEPs ask the Commission to monitor the milk market and use suitable policy instruments for milk and milk products even after 2015. The current quota system is to be scrapped in 2014.
Next steps
Today's non-legislative resolution was adopted by show of hands. The Commission will present its draft legislative package in the late autumn and Parliament will co-decide - together with the Council - on the final content of the legislation.

Aid to regions is a vital driver of growth, says Parliament
Regional aid budget should remain stable ©BELGA/AFP/Boryana Katsarova The EU's cohesion policy budget for 2014-2020 should at least equal the current one, to enable poor regions to catch up and all regions, including frontier ones, to deploy their economic and innovative potential in line with the EU 2020 strategy. In four non-legislative resolutions on regional development, voted on Thursday, Parliament seeks to defend the architecture of EU structural funds.
In the debate, MEPs declared themselves in favour of a cohesion policy that is effective, ambitious and founded on solidarity, one "which has proven itself and provides impetus for growth and employment" said Markus Pieper (EPP, DE), author of a consolidated report on strategy for cohesion policy post-2013, the vote on which was postponed to the next plenary session, at the start of July. In the debate with regional policy Commissioner Johannes Hahn, MEPs stressed their firm opposition to any attempt to transfer cohesion policy to national level or split it by sector, in particular via new thematic funds such as climate, energy or transport.
Cross borders, integrate town and country
By approving the detailed proposals of Marie-Thérèse Sanchez-Schmid (EPP, FR) on the "future agenda for cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation" (612 votes in favour, 46 against, 15 abstentions), Parliament encourages the Commission to increase the share of structural funding allocated to objective 3 (territorial cohesion) from today's 2.5% to 7%, notably to improve transport infrastructure. Stepping up co-operation between towns and outlying suburbs and rural areas, so as to achieve more balanced regional development, is a key aim of the proposals of rapporteur Oldřich Vlasák (ECR, CZ), approved with 603 votes in favour, 41 against and 3 abstentions.
Better-targeted checks
On the basis of reports by Miroslav Mikolášik (EPP, SK) on the implementation of the Cohesion Policy programmes for 2007-2013 and Georgios Stavrakakis (S&D, EL), MEPs ask that the aid allocation process be simplified and accelerated, notably to benefit small and medium-sized firms, and that multi-funding and cross-funding be encouraged. Improving synergies between the various funds should make it possible focus regional development policy more closely on results, says Mr Stavrakakis' report on "future synergies for increased effectiveness between the ERDF and other structural funds", which was approved with 601 votes in favour, 61 against and 12 abstentions.
Next steps
At the end of September, the Commission is to propose a legislative package consisting of a general regulation and specific rules for the social, cohesion and regional development funds and for territorial co-operation. At the end of 2011, this will be followed by a proposal for a common strategy framework for all EU funds.
