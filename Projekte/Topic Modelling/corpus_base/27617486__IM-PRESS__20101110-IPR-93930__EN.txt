Plenary sittings
2010-11-11 - 12:19
Parliament decided Thursday to waive the parliamentary immunity of Mr Krzysztof Lisek, charged by the Polish judicial authorities with offences in relation to his management and accounting activities as chairman of the board of the Polish Youth Card Association and of Campus Sp. at a time prior to his election to the European Parliament.
The charges brought against Mr Lisek (EPP, PL), do not refer to the opinions expressed or votes cast in the performance of his duties as a member of the European Parliament, but to his activities in Poland.
