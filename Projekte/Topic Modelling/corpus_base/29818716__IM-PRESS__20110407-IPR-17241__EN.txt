EP aims for swift tightening of rules for MEPs and lobbyists
Parliament's Rules of Procedure

Parliament's political leadership endorsed on Thursday the creation of a working group under the chairmanship of President Buzek to prepare tighter codes of conduct for both lobbyists and MEPs themselves.
The Conference of Presidents – the leaders of Parliament's political groups, chaired by EP President Jerzy Buzek – wants the group to act quickly: its first working meeting will be next week and it should complete its work before summer. The plans will then be put to the Bureau, the Conference of Presidents and, subsequently, the Constitutional Affairs Committee.
President Buzek will chair the Working Group on Codes of Conduct himself. The other members are to be appointed by the Bureau - the President and 14 Vice-Presidents - in the next few days upon a proposal by the political groups.
