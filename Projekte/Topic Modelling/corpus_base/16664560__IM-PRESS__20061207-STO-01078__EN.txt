Election monitoring is one area funded
With over 1000 projects in 32 countries worldwide, the "European initiative for democracy and human rights" is one of the ways the European Union tries to "export" its key values. However, with funding due to dry up at the end of the year - MEPs have pushed for the initiative to receive € 1.1 billion over the next seven years. This is crucial as the initiative funds projects in some of the toughest places on earth - helping reconciliation in Sudan's 22 year civil war being just one case.
The European initiative for democracy and human rights was created in 1994 at the behest of the European Parliament. As well as it's stated aims it also plays a significant role in conflict prevention and reconciliation. Funding observers during recent elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo is one recent example of attempts at reconciliation after a long civil war.
In Colombia it supports NGOs who protect the rights of children whilst in five African countries it supports the "Forest Peoples Project" which protects the rights of indigenous people.
On Tuesday during their plenary session - MEPs are expected to vote to approve a text that will ensure the initiative is ready for 2007. The report which recommended the Parliament's continue support was co-written by Hélène Flautre, a French Green MEP and chair of Parliament's Human Rights Committee, and Edward McMillan-Scott, a British Conservative MEP and Vice-President of the Parliament.
Projects will not require government consent
Mrs Flautre explained the significance of the funding; "this instrument provides the only financing of projects by non-state civil society actors in the promotion of democracy and human rights". Mr McMillan-Scott echoed this saying "w hile most of the money will go to civil society actors, in many countries democratic political groups are in permanent opposition and they also deserve support". He went on to say that that "the EU should become more active in "difficult" countries and he has recently visited China, Cuba and Russia to examine the scope of NGO reform there.
A crucial aspect of the democracy and human rights initiative is that projects do not require the consent of the government where they are taking place. Funding can also be made available to individuals - this is an important principle for the Parliament as through its "Sakharov prize" for fro freedom of thought it often honours individuals. On Tuesday MEPs will award this year's prize to Belarus opposition leader Aliaksandr Milinkevich.
EU should uphold "universality" of human rights
The initiative is consistent with the position that Parliament has long held over the promotion of these values. In 2002 it adopted a resolution saying that “one of the main objectives of the EU to uphold the universality and the indivisibility of human rights”. It went on to say that the EU has “an extraordinary capacity to extend and improve democratisation and respect for human rights among its partners worldwide".
