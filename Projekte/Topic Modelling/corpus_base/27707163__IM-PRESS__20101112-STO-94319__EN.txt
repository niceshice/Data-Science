80% percent of offences are committed by someone who is trusted by the child. Â©Belga MEPs examine ways to strengthen EU efforts against the sexual abuse EU is currently working on the revision of the framework decision Children who are victims of sexual abuse suffer its consequences all their lives. The Civil Liberties' Committee Monday (15 November) examined ways to strengthen EU efforts against the sexual abuse and exploitation of children and child pornography. Combating sex tourism, information exchanges to prevent someone charged with this type of crime from working with children and the blocking of websites hosting this kind of content were among the issues discussed.
Parliament's rapporteur Italian MEP Roberta Angelilli (EPP) explained that the EU is currently working on the revision of the framework decision on the subject which dates back to 2004. "If we can count on everybody's support, we will obtain a good result."
The wording of the proposal says that "sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children are particularly serious forms of crime as they are directed against children, who have the right to special protection and care. They produce long-term physical, psychological and social harm to victims".
Belgian Federal Minister of Justice - Stefaan De Clerck , who represented the Belgian Presidency, said this piece of legislation constitutes "one of the priorities of the Belgian Presidency".
"Children who are victims of sexual abuses suffer its consequences lifelong...we would like to reach a final decision in the Council by the end of December in order to start making progress by the beginning of the Hungarian Presidency," he said.
Role of the Internet
Mr De Clerk also noted the need to take into account the role new technologies play and explained that one of the issues still being debated is "how to block websites containing child pornography".
The proposed directive warns "developments in information technology have made these problems more acute by making it easier to produce and distribute child sexual abuse images while offering offenders anonymity and spreading responsibility across jurisdictions".
German Liberal Alexander Alvaro (ALDE) told fellow MEPs that "blocking apparently doesn't work". He noted, that "the Culture Committee already voted an opinion, which was unanimously for proposing to seek the deletion of websites hosting materials for child abuse".
German Green Jan Philipp Albrecht said that "blocking the sites does not work because often there is no good cooperation with the countries hosting the webpages".
"80% percent of offences by someone who is trusted by the child"
Better prevention of abuses is another key objective. Ms Angelilli said, "80% of these offences take place at home or at school, by someone who is trusted by the child".
This is very closely linked to one of the main difficulties stated in the proposed directive: "victims are reluctant to report abuse, variations in national criminal law and procedure may give rise to differences in investigation and prosecution, and convicted offenders may continue to be dangerous after serving their sentences".
What happens now?
Ministers from EU governments will discuss the issue in December. The EP will discuss Ms Angelilli's report in January and is scheduled to be vote on it in February.
