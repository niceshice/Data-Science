The News: Two weeks to save the planet In today's debate of the forthcoming EU leaders' summit of 10-11 December MEPs outlined three priority topics: the Copenhagen climate change summit, the financial crisis and the Stockholm programme on justice and citizenship. Speakers agreed that with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the appointments of the EU top jobs it is now time to move on to substantial issues.
Top jobs
Several speakers took a moment to congratulate the holders of the two new top jobs in Europe: President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy and High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton.
Joseph Daul of the centre right EPP welcomed the appointment of Van Rompuy in his new post and quoted Van Rompuy's own remarks saying that "the image of the Council will be built on results" and the approach will be a "step-by-step approach". Daul called this "the Jean Monnet method".
For the Socialists, Martin Schulz told the Parliament "we are happy that Catherine Ashton has the position of High Representative. As the second biggest party in this Parliament - we want the second post in the Commission". He then stressed the important tasks the individuals faced.
Copenhagen
Ahead of the UN climate summit Joseph Daul said that "the Copenhagen conference not only has to come up with political objectives but also firm commitments with figures and targets" and his point was echoed by several other speakers who stressed the need for binding agreement.
Martin Schulz told the Chamber: "I don't think we are discussing climate change enough. Investing in an environment friendly technology, we have a possibility to create jobs. In other words green technology is a future oriented project."
Rebecca Harms for the Greens/EFA echoed this: "climate protection is perceived as a burden, but in fact there are opportunities that arise if we want to combat climate change".
Economic crisis
For the current holders of the rotating EU presidency Cecilia Malmström, Sweden's Europe Minister, told MEPs: "The impact of the crisis is going to continue to be felt for a long time to come, the Lisbon Strategy will expire next year so we need to have a new strategy which can help to promote long term prosperity."
For the European Commission José Manuel Barroso indicated that there is a new "2020" strategy being outlined by the Commission. He urged the "EP to work with the Council” so that “new authorities (Financial supervision package) are in place by the end of 2010”.
Guy Verhofstadt for the Liberal ALDE group noted "a single European supervisor is what we need” pointing out that it was the opinion of the majority in the EP.
Lothar Bisky for the GUE/NGL group noted that "Heads of State and Government have to find a way out of the crisis that binds the development of Europe with social progress".
For the ECR group Timothy Kirkhope said that "the EU must now move on and concentrate of the real work at hand, building dynamic and competitive economies and creating a strong, global trading system".
"Stockholm programme" on justice and citizenship
On the "Stockholm programme" on justice and citizenship Cecilia Malmström told the House "The vision is a safer, more open Europe safeguarding fundamental freedoms".
Mr Barroso spoke of how the Treaty of Lisbon brings “full involvement of the Parliament” in the policy of justice and citizenship. The Stockholm programme should bring "real change, real benefits to our citizens”. Concrete steps are the respect of fundamental rights, better access to courts, more effective action against organised crime, human trafficking, terrorism, effective migration management.
Most speakers agreed that the main point is to strike a balance between freedom and safety, security and protection.
Treaty of Lisbon
Nigel Farage for the EFD bloc voiced his previously expressed concerns about the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon and said that a "free and fair referendum in the UK to decide whether we stay as a part of this Union or not" is needed.
