Parliament adopted a legislative report on the inland transport of dangerous goods. The proposed Directive aims to simplify and update the existing dangerous goods rules and at the same time extend the scope of the current rules by including inland waterways. The proposal also endorses a user-friendly single set of rules for the inland transport of dangerous goods in the European Union.
The proposed Directive will make an important contribution to ensuring the safety and security of the transport of dangerous goods in the European Union. It updates the existing four directives and four Commission decisions on this issue and merges them into one piece of legislation.
Parliament's vote approved the common position where the Council introduced several modifications, which are summarised as follows:
those Member States which have no railway systems will be exempted from transposing and implementing the proposed Directive, insofar as rail is concerned;
all Member States, which have no inland waterways or whose inland waterways are not linked to those of other Member States, will be given the possibility of not applying the Directive, insofar as inland waterway transport of dangerous goods is concerned;
a transitional period of up to two years for the application of inland waterways;
provisions provided for to allow sufficient time for the adoption of national provisions, the establishment of legal frameworks and the training of personnel.
The transposition date is set for 30 June 2009 and Member States may maintain national restrictions on the transport of substances containing dioxins and furans for certain periods of time.
