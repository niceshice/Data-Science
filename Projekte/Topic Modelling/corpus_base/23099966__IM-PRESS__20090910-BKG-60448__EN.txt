The appointment of the Commission President and the rest of the Commission
Hearings
Institutions
2009-09-10 - 16:13
The EP votes on Wednesday on the candidacy of Jos√© Manuel Barroso as Commission President. This vote is taking place under the rules of the Nice Treaty, which requires a simple majority of the votes cast by MEPs. Abstentions do not count.
Had the Lisbon Treaty already been in force, the nomination would have to have been approved by an absolute majority of MEPs, in other words at least 369 votes if all 736 MEPs are in office at the moment the vote takes place.
The rest of the Commission (known as the "College") can only be voted upon later. The Council and the President-elect will draw up a list of Members for the new Commission. The committees of the Parliament will arrange hearings for all candidates. After these, the President-elect presents the College and its programme at an EP plenary session and the EP votes on the Commission as a whole.
The following passages are all direct citations from the respective Treaties/Rules.
