Just as phones have cameras and increasingly the internet - TV on your mobile phone could soon become the norm across Europe. A survey last year concluded that by 2012 the number of mobile TV subscribers will have jumped to 155.6 million from 4.4 million today. With such staggering growth it is no wonder that European telecommunications companies are starting to take notice. A hearing in Parliament on 1 April discussed the issues involved.
Late last year the European Commission officially selected DVB-H (Digital Video Broadcasting Handheld) as the standard for Europe. This provides legal certainty for service providers, broadcasters and telecommunications companies.
The hearing was chaired by Greek Socialist Katerina Batzeli, head of the Culture and Education Committee. She called for profit to be given the same consideration as quality and cultural content.
The employment and economic possibilities were also stressed during the hearing as many leading European companies like Nokia have been at the forefront of such technology.
Ms Batzeli said that Parliament would continue to search for a regulatory regime that "will be in the best interests of the consumers and the business world".
Mobile TV is already well developed in Japan and South Korea. Its supporters are keen to develop the medium in 2008 as the European football Championships and the Olympic games will provide extensive new markets.
