People are asking more questions about candidates and voting as the election draws near Many people contact the European Parliament with questions. As the 4-7 June European elections approach there have been lots of election questions. Here is a taster of the most frequently asked questions.
What steps must be taken to stand as a candidate?
The precise steps vary from country to country, although they usually involve registering with either your local, regional or national electoral authority. A number of counties also require individual candidates or political groups to pay a deposit.
Who is eligible to stand?
In theory, anyone who enjoys their full rights as an EU citizen and is over the voting age is eligible to stand for election, although some countries require that candidates are older than the minimum voting age. In some countries candidates must pay a deposit, which they lose it if they don't get a certain amount of votes.
The unusual thing about the European elections is that you can also stand as a candidate in a foreign country providing you have been resident there. In the current parliament, several MEPs have one nationality but represent people from another country - 1981 world rally champion Ari Vatanen is Finnish by birth but was elected by French voters.
Where can I find out who the candidates are?
As the election approaches local authorities will publish a list of names of people who have put their names forward to be candidates. As official lists become available, Parliaments Information Offices around Europe will have those lists.
