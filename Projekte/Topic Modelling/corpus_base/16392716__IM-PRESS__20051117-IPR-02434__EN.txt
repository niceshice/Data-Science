A thirty-strong delegation of MEPs is to participate in the WTO Ministerial Meeting in Hong Kong in December. They will also take part in a parallel meeting of the Parliamentary Conference on the WTO, which is jointly organised by the European Parliament and the Inter-Parliamentary Union.
The Ministerial Meeting takes place from 12 to 18 December, with sessions of the Parliamentary Conference on 12 and 15 December. The MEPs will have meetings with representatives from the governments and parliaments of EU Member States and EU's main trading partners, as well as with groups representing civil society and the social partners. As is the standard practice, they will also hold meetings throughout the week with the UK Presidency as well as with Trade and Agriculture Commissioners, Peter Mandelson and Mariann Fischer Boel, and senior Commission officials.
