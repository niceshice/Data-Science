With the 2006 World Cup just weeks away, the role of football and football clubs in society was on the agenda at a public hearing held in the Parliament on 3 May. Football experts and MEPs exchanged ideas on the future of football and how the popularity of football can be used as a force for good in European society.
It is more than obvious that the role football in society today is hugely influential and diverse. The most popular game in the world enables people to meet one another, share ideas and in some cases aids participation in society. However, as Nikolaos Sifunakis, the Greek Socialist Chairman of the Culture Committee said when opening the event, "this social aspect of football is being eroded because football teams are now investing less and less money in educating local talent" as they prefer to buy players from outside.
The UEFA's "home grown player rule" is one answer to the erosion of local sports activities and was warmly welcomed by most of the MEPs. From next season, football teams will have to use at least four locally trained players - players who have been registered for three years with the club between the ages of 15 and 21. This minimum level could be raised to eight home grown players in three years time.
British Labour MEP Richard Corbett said the measure "will oblige clubs to make sure that they get their players not just from buying them on the transfer market...it will oblige them to train people in their own locality, to bring them up through the youth teams and junior teams". Fellow MEP, Belgian Christian Democrat Ivo Belet agreed: "Football clubs can only be successful if they stay in close touch with their local community."
Football is seen as a tool in combating discrimination and racism and potentially a source of identity and social integration. One example is professional football player Salou Ibrahim from Ghana who entered the EU squads at the age of seventeen and now represents Belgian club S.V. Zulte-Waregem. He said football helped him a lot, from overcoming language barriers to settling down in Belgium. It would be pity if this experience wasn't replicated.
The meeting was organised jointly by the Committees for Culture, Internal Market, Economic and Monetary Affairs and Employment and Social Affairs.
