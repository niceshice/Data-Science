Action on jobs and an international deal on a post-Kyoto framework are high on the agenda as is action to clean up the Baltic Sea. What is clear is that Stockholm is assuming the EU helm at what one MEP called at a "really tough period" internationally.
Gunnar Hökmark is an MEP from the ruling Moderate party in Sweden: "I hope the Swedish Presidency will make wise decisions that ensure the EU will get out the financial crisis with enhanced European competitiveness and establish Europe as the world's leading economy."
He went on to tell us of his "hope and confidence that the Presidency will consolidate the EU's environmental policy as the best in the world".
One of the litmus tests of the next 6 months will be the ability to clinch a deal on an international agreement to replace Kyoto. Mr Hökmark, an MEP since 2004, was cautiously optimistic: "Despite the financial crisis, I do not think we have ever had better conditions for reaching an international agreement."
On the change in international political climate the 56-year old economics graduate stressed: "Signals from the United States are positive. It will however take determination and skilful diplomacy to get the whole world onboard."
"Unite EU and find solution with rest of world"
For Social Democrat MEP Göran Färm there are two large crises that the Swedish Presidency must somehow face.
The first is the Copenhagen climate talks that must be concluded in December and a post-Kyoto deal agreed. As Mr Färm says, the Swedes "must firstly unite the EU on a stand and also find a solution with the rest of the world".
The second key issue he sees is the current economic crisis that Europe is facing. In particular he sees the "rising unemployment and negative growth" as being particularly serious issues that need to be tackled.
Added to these "two extraordinary tasks" former journalist Mr Färm cites the "complicated situation" of a new European Parliament as well as a European Commission that has not been yet selected, added to uncertainties over the ratification of the Lisbon treaty. In short, he describes the current European political situation as "shaky".
"Eco-efficiency" a way out of economic and climate malaise
For Lena Ek, a Swedish Liberal and former law lecturer, she sees the present moment as a "really tough period" for a country to hold the Presidency of the Union.
For her the triple crisis of the "economy, jobs and the climate" make for a daunting agenda over the next few months.
She called for the use of what she called "eco-efficiency" in European economics to get Europe moving again.
Ms Ek, a 51 year member elected in 2004, mentioned the importance of pursuing policies that will help the area around the Baltic Sea. She described this area as being in "ecological crisis" and that many of the States around it "are suffering in the financial crisis". She saw dealing with environmental and commercial problems in the areas as parts of the same solution.
On the preparations of the Reinfeldt government for the Presidency she said that they had been "very thorough" thus far and had already shown "new ways of cooperating with the Council and the Commission".
