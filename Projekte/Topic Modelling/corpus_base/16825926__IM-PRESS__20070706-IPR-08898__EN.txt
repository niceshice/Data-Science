2007-07-10 - 12:49
The House voted by acclamation to appoint Martine Roure (PES, FR) as a new Vice-President of the European Parliament. Ms Roure replaces Pierre Moscovici. Mr Moscovici was elected to the French National Assembly and is therefore no longer an MEP. The 14 Vice-Presidents and the EP President sit on Parliament's Bureau along with the six Quaestors. The election of Martine Roure means there are now five female Vice-Presidents out of a total of 14, or 35.7 per cent.
The Bureau elected by Parliament for a period of two and a half years (which can be renewed) is the body that lays down rules for Parliament. It draws up Parliament’s preliminary draft budget and decides all administrative, staff and organisational matters.
The 14 Vice-Presidents are listed below:
Rodi KRATSA-TSAGAROPOULOU (EPP-ED, GR)
Alejo VIDAL-QUADRAS (EPP-ED, ES)
Gérard ONESTA (Greens/EFA, FR) Edward MCMILLAN-SCOTT (EPP-ED, UK) Mario MAURO (EPP-ED, IT) Miguel Angel MARTÍNEZ MARTÍNEZ (PSE, ES) Luigi COCILOVO (ALDE, IT)
