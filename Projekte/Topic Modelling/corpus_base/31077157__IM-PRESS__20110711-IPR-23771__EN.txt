An ad-hoc delegation of six MEPs will go to Tunisia from 13 to 16 July to visit refugee camps and meet representatives of local authorities, international organisations and NGOs. The delegation will have meetings with the Tunisian prime minister and other ministers. The aim is to discuss the plight of refugees and the implications for the European Union, notably as regards migration.
"We are going to the Libyan border to see the situation of fleeing refugees for ourselves. The fight for democracy in Libya is causing temporary side effects such as the considerable numbers of people fleeing the country. Europe must address the challenges posed by this situation, particularly the treatment of refugees, humanitarian aid as well as the impact on migration towards Europe. The people escaping Libya also raise issues for Tunisia, which is already under severe pressure for other reasons", said Simon Busuttil (EPP, MT), who is leading the delegation. "Europe cannot stay put in the face of these realities and our delegation will help us understand better how we can help alleviate the situation. We will do this by talking directly to the refugees, to the international organisations running their camps and to the Tunisian authorities", he added.
The other members of the delegation are Claude Moraes (S&D, UK), Judith Sargentini (Greens/EFA, NL), Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra (EPP, ES), Nathalie Griesbeck (ALDE, FR) and Sylvie Guillaume (S&D, FR).

A press conference with the head of the delegation is scheduled for Friday 15 July, at around 13.30* (exact time tbc). It will take place at the EU delegation in Tunisia (1053 Les Berges du Lac - Tunis).
*(14.30 in Brussels)
