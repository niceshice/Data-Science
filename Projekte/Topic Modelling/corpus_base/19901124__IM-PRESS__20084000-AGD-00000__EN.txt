18.30 - Conference "Double memory: debates for Europe" 18:30 19:00 Berlin, Germany Delegations Delegation of the Committee on Budgetary Control to Bulgaria
Bulgaria experienced difficulties in many of the pre-accession programmes (ISPA, PHARE and SAPARD) and still needs to demonstrate that sound financial management structures are in place and operating effectively. Moreover, there have been serious allegations of irregularities as well as suspicions of fraud and conflicts of interest in the award of contracts.
Investigations by OLAF into the management of EU funds by the Bulgarian authorities have led to the temporary suspension of pre-accession funds and the freezing of payments under various other financial instruments. A delegation from OLAF, headed by its Director General, visited Bulgaria on 21 August for discussions with the Bulgarian authorities about what measures should be taken to effectively combat fraud and corruption. In this regard, judicial procedures and recovery of funds seem to be the key issues.
