Europe's foreign policy chief Javier Solana told MEPs about the problems in the Middle East and the EU's search for peace in the region. The House discussed the strengthening of EU-NATO relations following a subtle convergence of certain military projects.
The EU and the Middle East
Mr Solana talked about the need for a "durable and fully respected ceasefire which could allow the delivery of humanitarian aid" to the Middle East.
He sees the new US Administration as an excellent opportunity. "Conditions for cooperation between the EU and US are now better than ever; strong commitment on the part of the current American administration is a reality".
MEPs urge dialogue and peace
Christian Democrat Joseph Daul supported Mr Solana's call for dialogue. "It's not time to keep silent. Our message should be clear: we cannot tolerate aid and humanitarian assistance be taken hostage in this conflict
Martin Schulz of the Socialist group said "violence would only breed more violence".
Graham Watson of the Liberal ALDE group said it is the EU's "moral duty to assist in the reconstruction of Gaza". However, he said EU assistance through aid would not prevent a future conflict. "We need a new approach," he said.
Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering will lead a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary delegation on a fact-finding mission to Gaza and the Middle East from Sunday.
EU-NATO relations
Mr Solana also spoke of the relationship between the EU and NATO. Many see this as a way of strengthening the EU's foreign policy through military means, as NATO is seen as the military backbone of Europe.
Many MEPs emphasised the growing role of the EU in military and security matters, while some minority voices deplored a possible "militarisation" of the Union.

Other debates
Also Wednesday, MEPs discussed the problem of mental health in Europe. One in four adults suffer from mental health problems once in their lives and MEPs want strategies to treat the mentally infirmed.
The Social Economy plan was also discussed, stressing that businesses which place more of an emphasis on people rather than capital could flourish and help stimulate the economy again.
