Make up of the 2009-2014 European Parliament The European elections in June delivered a majority for centre right parties grouped together as the European People's Party in the European Parliament. After taking their seats in July, MEPs now look forward to a new Parliamentary session opening on 14 September at the Parliament's seat in Strasbourg, France.
After the election the final composition of the Parliament is as follows;
European People's Party - 265 Members
Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists & Democrats - 184
Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe - 84
The Greens / European Free Alliance - 55
European Conservatives and Reformists Group - 54
Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left - 35
Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group - 32
Non-attached members - 27
At the last session in July MEPs overwhelming elected their new President (or Speaker) for the next two and a half years, former Polish PM Jerzy Buzek. He is the first person from the 2004 enlargement countries (Central and Eastern Europe) to head one of the EU Institutions.
As a candidate of the EPP his nomination enjoyed a majority when voting took place in Strasbourg.
Vice-Presidents also elected
MEPs also elected the 14 Vice-Presidents of the EP and the five quaestors, responsible for administrative and financial matters of direct concern to Members. The make up of Parliamentary delegations is at present being discussed among Members.
The newly elected MEPs will have to vote on the candidacy of European Commission President Barroso as well as the whole incoming Commission over the next weeks and months.
In policy terms, the run up to the crucial Copenhagen climate summit and the possible new rules on immigration and asylum are likely to be unveiled by the Swedish Presidency of the EU and are likely to become key political issues over the coming weeks and months.
