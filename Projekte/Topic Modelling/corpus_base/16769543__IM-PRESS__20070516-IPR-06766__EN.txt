After a series of close votes on amendments to the Commission's proposal to increase the EU-wide minimum levels of excise duty on alcoholic drinks in line with inflation, Parliament voted to reject the proposal altogether at the final vote - there were 198 votes in favour, 355 against and 39 abstentions. Under Parliament's rules, the issue was, therefore, referred back to the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee.
The rapporteur - Astrid LULLING (EPP-ED, LU) - had proposed to scrap the minimum levels of duty altogether, while amendments from the Socialist group aimed at increasing the levels of duty by less than the Commission originally proposed, in line with inflation since the 2004 enlargement rather than since the minimum levels were first introduced in 1992.
Parliament's position on the issue - as is normally the case for taxation matters - is consultative. In such cases, where MEPs vote against a proposal, and the Commission does not immediately withdraw it, the issue is automatically referred back to the relevant committee.
