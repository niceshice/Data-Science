Milinkevich: Parliament's support "charges us with positive energy"
In March last year Aliaksandr Milinkevich and his followers were jailed after protesting the result of the Belarus Presidential election in which he stood against President Alexander Lukashenko. Amid apparent manipulation of the media and electoral system by the incumbent, the EU and the US condemned the result. Mr Milinkevich later received Parliament's Sakharov prize for freedom of thought for his non-violent opposition.
1. How did the authorities in Belarus react when you won the Sakharov prize?
The authorities were irritated. The chief of KGB commented that "we have many people deserving awards, why Milinkevich?" The uneasiness of the authorities is a good sign.
The award is a sign that Europe is not going to leave Belarus until democracy gains victory there and that it considers it a serious and responsible mission. The European Parliament is immersed in Belarusian affairs so deeply, that sometimes it even seems that we take too much spotlight from other problems. I am very grateful for the support shown, as we are not in a very simple situation. This support charges us with positive energy.
2. Does the recent row over gas prices indicate the Minsk-Moscow friendship has ended?
Moscow is offended like a lady that was promised marriage and leaves when it does not happen. Belarus has changed its mind on the marriage. As an owner of the product, Russia is punishing Belarus and has a right to sell it according to the price it wants.
Mr Lukashenko failed to undertake serious reforms when he had incredibly cheap oil and gas. What was needed was restructuring, privatisation, attracting investment and new technologies. Everything was wasted on empty projects. Economic crisis is imminent, so Mr Lukashenko must conduct free elections and set the media and people free.
3. What problems does the Belarus opposition face and are you united? How were recent local elections?
It is hard to attain unity, which is much easier to achieve during presidential elections when you have a clear objective. During the current period we are having big discussions as to whether a single leader is needed. I would say yes (that we need one leader, headquarters and work programme), but time after time he must go through legitimate elections (in a Congress). Some call me a dictator masked under a pro-democracy flag, but I think we are at war, therefore we need a general, headquarters, officers and soldiers. We must all work for the person we would have elected.
While going from door to door during the campaign, people kept asking me: "do you yourself believe that something can be changed with these elections?" People are pragmatic. In reality there are no elections in Belarus - representatives are appointed by authorities. We can say this and either lose hope or continue working, and our duty is to go out to people, as there is no independent television and only a few newspapers.
4. What is your message to our readers in 27 European countries?
I want Europe not to forget that there is a country living in difficult conditions of dictatorship, a European neighbour with European history, traditions and mentality. Second, I would like to see as many politicians as possible that cherish morals more than economic interests. In the European Parliament I see very many politicians like this, and I am thankful for that. There are discussions on what is more important: security, stability or fight for human rights, and sometimes a choice must be made. I see that in the Parliament morality takes priority, and I am proud of such a European Parliament.
5. Is there any hope for change before 2011 Belarus Presidential elections?
Free information and the defeat of fear would mean less dictatorship. Yes, economic crisis can accelerate reforms, but I would not like us to come to power due to the collapse of the economy. I am for evolution. One must think about the lives of people and not the seat of the president.
