Entrants must be EU nationals or residents If you are a journalist covering EU policies or have written about the institutions of the Union then the European Parliament's journalism prize may interest you. Divided into four categories - print media, radio, TV and the internet - each winner will receive â‚¬5,000.
Any work published or broadcast between 1 May 2008 and the closing date of 31 March this year is eligible. Journalists can enter individually or as part of a team of up to five people.
Articles or reports that are entered will be shortlisted in each country before being submitted to an award jury of three MEPs and six journalists who will make the final decision.
The 2008 winners included the BBC's Shirin Wheeler for her weekly EU politics programme "The record: Europe".
The award for best internet article went to Finnish reporter Pete Pakarinen of " Verkkouutiset" for his piece on illegal migration into Europe.
