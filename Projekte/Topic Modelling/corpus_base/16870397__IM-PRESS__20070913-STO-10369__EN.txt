Environment MEPs back compulsory CO2 cap on cars

MEPs are exhausted by voluntary caps
Voluntary limits on CO2 emissions by European cars are not working and should be replaced by mandatory caps. That's the message delivered in a new report on emissions by MEPs on Parliament's Environment Committee. They want binding limits for cars by 2009 and have set a target of an emission level of 120 grams of CO2 per km by 2012. Under the present voluntary code car makers have set themselves a limit of 140g of CO2 by 2008. However the report shows that this will not be met.
We Europeans love our cars - there are over 216 million of them on the roads. The problem is they are choking the environment. As emitters of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) they contribute to global warming as gas rises and traps heat from the sunlight. The problem is the number of cars. In July this year a further 1.3 million new cars joined the roads. Overall the number of cars on Europe's roads has grown by 40% from 1990 to 2004 with CO2 emissions rising by a third.
Should car makers be solely responsible?
The man who drafted the report - British Liberal Chris Davies - is very clear that "any legislation should specify technical standards to be met by manufacturers". He says the recent Frankfurt motor show demonstrated that the "technology already exists" to cut CO2 emissions. His report was drafted in response to a European Commission "strategy paper" ahead of possible legislation later this year or early next. At present it covers vehicles below 3.5 metric tonnes. MEPs on the Environment Committee backed his proposal on 12 September. The full Parliament will debate the report in the November Plenary session.
However, some voices believe that the problem should not solely be laid at the car manufacturer's door. UK Conservative Martin Callanan would like to see a combined effort from "fuel suppliers, consumers and government initiatives". He also believes that encouraging a "change in driving habits" (such as driving more smoothly instead of accelerating up to traffic lights) could have an impact.
Small CO2 cuts mean huge savings
Does it make much difference whether the limit is 120 g/km instead of 130 g/km? For vice-chair of the Environment Committee Satu Hassi the answer is clearly yes. "Every year 16 million new passenger cars are produced in Europe. If on average 20,000 kilometres per year are driven by a car, then the 'small' difference of 10 grams means 3.2 million tons of CO2 every year.” The Finnish Green MEP added, "The position of the Environment Committee…to support 120 g/km rather than 130 g/km also means that we want to emphasize fuel efficiency rather than biofuels as a way to reduce emissions from passenger cars."
As well as specific limits set by legislation, the report's backers want financial penalties and rewards for manufacturers who break or beat the Carbon targets. The idea they propose is use of the "Carbon Allowance Reduction System" (CARS) which they want to be operational by 2011.
