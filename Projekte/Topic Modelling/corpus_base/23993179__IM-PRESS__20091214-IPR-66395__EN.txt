Commission President Jos√© Manuel Barroso answered questions ranging from the future Commission portfolios to the Europe 2020 strategy in Parliament's question hour on Tuesday. MEPs were also keen to hear Mr Barroso's views on financial issues and EU-Ukraine relations.
Corien Wortmann-Kool (EPP, NL), asked Mr Barroso to ensure that the timetable for adopting the Europe 2020 strategy would allow Parliament not just to be informed but to be fully involved in developing the strategy. Mr Barroso replied that scheduling the European Council's final decision for June would allow Parliament to participate fully.
Hannes Swoboda (S&D, AT), asked whether Mr Barroso would be prepared to change the Commissioners' portfolios should Parliament's hearings of the Commissioners-designate suggest this is necessary. Mr Barroso replied that the Lisbon Treaty states clearly that the internal organisation of the college of Commissioners is the Commission's responsibility, but that he would listen to Parliament's suggestions.
Guy Verhofstadt (ALDE, BE), raised the issue of the high public debt in Greece and asked whether setting up a market for Eurobonds would help all Member States, including Greece, to reduce the cost of servicing their public borrowing. Mr Barroso said he was encouraged by the Greek Prime Ministers latest statements, and was not proposing any Eurobond initiative.
Rebecca Harms (Greens/EFA, DE), said that some portfolios in the new Commission were "unintelligibly split", such as justice and fundamental rights and home affairs. Mr Barroso replied that almost all Member States had one minister for home affairs and another for justice and that this division would be much more efficient.
Asked by Michal Tomasz Kaminski (ECR, PL), about the recent EU-Ukraine summit, Mr Barroso called it a "successful meeting" but added that "our Ukrainian friends need to do more if they want us to help them more" and "enlargement "is not possible in the current situation".
Lothar Bisky (GUE/NGL, DE), asked about the chances of introducing a multilateral "Tobin tax". Mr Barroso took the view that the EU should support proposals a global tax on financial transactions. "If we want to meet our obligations regarding the fight against climate change, it cannot be only with the money from our budgets", he noted.
Paul Nuttall (EFD, UK), asked whether it is now "official EU policy to offer incentives to close plants" and "outsource the business to India". Mr Barroso replied that the UK government has been pushing for ambitious measures on climate change, and that the aim is not to drive business out of Europe, but to encourage new and cleaner industries.
