Those present debated the need to further harmonise laws on copyright, the possibility of a common European database to establish the authors of creative works and the problem of levies (a tax on purchases of recordable and/or equipment that allows the writing of data to such media).
Copyrights can include everything from a poem, play and other literary works, movies, choreographic work, musical compositions, audio recordings, paintings, drawings, sculptures, software, radio or television broadcasts.
If they are protected by copyright they cannot be legally reproduced, distributed, communicated to the public, lent, rented out or publicly performed without the consent of the owner.
Copyrights also have an economic impact regarding the rights of reproduction, broadcast, public performance, adaptation, translation, public display and distribution.
In addition there are the moral rights - the author's right to object to any distortion, mutilation or other modification of his work that might be prejudicial to his reputation.
Each country has its own copyright rules
Despite eight EU-wide Directives trying to harmonise rules, each country has its own copyright legislation. For example if you wanted to set-up a pan-European service an online music store you would have to negotiate with rights management companies in 27 countries.
Participants called on European Commission to take action to address differences between member states on copyright legislation.
Irena Bednarich Chairs the Copyright levies issue group. She told the hearing that "today in Europe the only unified market is the market of illegal content". In the EU at present 22 of the 27 countries have levies.
Austrian MEP Paul Rübig, MEP (EPP), Chairman of the STOA Panel, remarked that "Intellectual property is a driver for economic development," but "it is very difficult to explain the importance of copyright to the citizens and even to politicians. That is why the EU should try to raise awareness of copyright."
