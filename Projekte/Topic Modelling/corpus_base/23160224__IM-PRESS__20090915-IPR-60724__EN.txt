More needs to be done to prevent future disruption and early-warning mechanisms (which proved ineffective in the 2009 Russia-Ukraine energy crisis) need to be reviewed, MEPs told the European Commission in a resolution adopted Thursday. MEPs also say that gas storage capacity needs to be expanded and interconnections improved.
Parliament also reiterates its call for a common European external energy security policy.
Beefing up the Network of Energy Security Correspondents (NESCO) should help avoid future disruptions, says the resolution. MEPs welcome the agreement on the financing of infrastructure projects as part of the European Economic Recovery Plan (â‚¬250 million) and the idea of giving Europe a new European "supergrid" for electricity and gas.
Hostile takeover bids
The Commission is asked to take action against hostile takeover bids by "non-transparent" foreign entities in the EU energy market, such as Surgutneftegaz's recent acquisition of a stake in the Hungarian energy company MOL and CENTREX's 20% stake in Austria's Baumgarten trading and storage facility.
Human rights
The EU should also engage in dialogue with key energy suppliers, but not at the expense of a frank dialogue on human rights, says the resolution, adding that human rights and energy security should be a priority for the next EU-Russia summit and become an integral part of the new EU-Russia agreement.
Nabucco and Desertec
Linking the EU to new sources of gas from the Middle East and the Caspian region independently of any one company or pipeline is among Parliament's priorities. The Nabucco project will help the EU to become less dependent on Russian supplies and DESERTEC will use the vast potential for solar energy in the Middle East and North Africa, it says.
