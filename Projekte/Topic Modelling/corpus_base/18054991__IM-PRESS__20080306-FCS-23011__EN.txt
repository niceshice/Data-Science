European Parliament at 50 - images from half a century
Institutions
2008-04-07 - 16:25
We have searched through Parliament's video and sound archives to bring you this unique look back on half a century of debate in the European Parliament. We let the images and video clips speak for themselves as we look back at some of the most memorable moments of the last 50 years. It forms part of the celebrations to mark the day on 19 March 1958 when 142 delegates assembled for the first meeting of the then European Parliamentary Assembly.
March's plenary session in Strasbourg will mark the culmination of the celebrations. Former EP Presidents, members of national Parliaments and leaders of the other EU Institutions will gather to mark the occasion. As it convenes this week, the European Parliament (as it became in 1962) looks very different from the Assembly. It is much larger for a start, now having 785 Members from 27 countries.
From Assembly to Parliament
It has also grown into a modern legislature with powers over key aspects of European lawmaking. The codecision procedure has given the Parliament equal power with the Council of Ministers in areas including, transport, the environment and consumer protection. Along with the Council Parliament is also the EUâ€™s budgetary authority, deciding each year on expenditure. It also plays a supervisory role over other EU institutions.
It began as a Common Assembly for the European Coal and Steel Community, which came into force in 1952. After the signature of the Treaty of Rome in 1957 founded the European Economic Community and Euratom a Common Parliamentary Assembly was created for all three communities. The first meeting of the combined body was held in Strasbourg in March 1958. In 1962 it changed its named to the European Parliament, a name that was officially designated by the Single European Act of 1986
The World in 1958
In 1958 the world looked very different from now. The Cold War and the arms race was still raging, President Eisenhower was in Washington, President de Gaulle was elected President of France and a coup by Army officers in Iraq sent a shudder through the Middle East. In sport Brazil beat Sweden 5-2 to win the World Cup.

There's a first time for everything...
The first direct Europe-wide elections, the first debates in Plenary...These are just some of the "firsts" that the European Parliament has had in the course of its history.
Have a glance at some notable first moments in the history of the Parliament.
Elections and the European Parliament
Before direct elections were held in 1979, MEPs were appointed by and from the national Parliaments of the Members of the Community (as it then was). In 1979 the first direct elections were held and voters in 9 countries elected 410 MEPs to represent them.
In 2004, people in 25 countries of the EU elected representatives to the European Parliament. They were later joined by Members from Romania and Bulgaria whose countries joined the Union in 2007.
From 6 to 27 members
The new states are welcomed in 2004 The original six countries became 9, then 10, then 12 and so on until they reached 27 last year. Thus far there have been five enlargements of the Union. It took the largest jump in size in 2004 when it went from 15 to 25 members with almost 500 million people.
This section records the key moments in the enlargement of the European Union.
Young people and the European Parliament
How can young people in the European Union get involved in the European Parliament? There are various programmes and activities that are organised throughout the Parliamentary term to appeal and involve young people. You can get a flavour by watching this section and seeing young people involved in the Parliament's activities.
Freedom of speech and expression: in favour or against?
Machine and beast stage a sit down protest in Strasbourg Freedom of speech and expression, especially concerning political and other public issues is the very essence of democracy. Demonstrations and various organised events are frequently used to try and influence the thinking of legislators. The European Parliament is no exception. In this section see some examples inside and around the Parliament.
MEPs make themselves heard
With so many nationalities and political parties represented in the Parliament, MEPs are always looking for new and eye-catching ways to get over their views and opinions. Be it bikes, football or even chocolate, MEPs have generally found a way to express themselves.
Artists at the European Parliament
