Josep Borrell, President of the European Parliament
Josep Borrell, President of the European Parliament, will visit Lebanon on 14-15 September to convey MEPs' solidarity with the people there following the recent conflict. The visit will be symbolic as Parliament called for an immediate ceasefire as early as 20 July. This reflected its alarm at the spectacular military escalation and the resulting humanitarian crisis
Later, on 7 September 2006, in a further resolution, MEPs stressed the need for a comprehensive political settlement in the region as 'there is no military solution to the conflict in the Middle East'.
During the course of his visit, President Borrell will meet senior government figures and discuss the serious humanitarian problems facing Lebanon.
As President of the Institution with budgetary co-decision powers in the EU, he will assure them of the financial backing of the European Union, which has so far contributed EUR 107 million in aid, (this excludes donations from individual countries). He will also inform them of the significant role the Parliament intends to play in the reconstruction of Lebanon and its environment.
The visit will also provide an opportunity to prepare Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora's forthcoming visit to the European Parliament, following the invitation from the Conference of Political Group Chairmen, and a forthcoming visit by a delegation of MEPs to Lebanon.
