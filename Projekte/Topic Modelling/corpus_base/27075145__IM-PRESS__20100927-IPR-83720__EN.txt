European Parliament President Jerzy Buzek and Secretary General Klaus Welle today renewed the institution's commitments to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and make better use of energy, water and paper.
The commitments entail optimising waste management and including environmental guidelines in procurement procedures. Parliament signed its first environment policy pledge in 2004 and joined the voluntary Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) in 2007. The latest external audit is currently underway.
President Jerzy Buzek said: "If we want to be credible, then we have to do our own homework. I am confident that we will achieve our goal of a 30% reduction in emissions by the end of this decade."
European Parliament Vice-President Isabelle Durant (who has responsibility for EMAS) added: "Parliament should not only pass legislation, but also set a good example. EMAS is a good tool to reduce our environmental footprint. Better use of resources also means better use of public money."
