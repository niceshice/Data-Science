Parliament plans a new film prize from Autumn
A film about two students dealing with unwanted pregnancy in Communist Romania received the prestigious Palme d'Or award at Cannes. Although many European films are being produced this boost will still be welcome. One barrier European cinema faces in reaching a wide audience is the diversity of European languages and the cost of subtitles and dubbing. A new film award by the European Parliament will from this autumn offer the winner the chance to subtitle their film in the EU's 23 languages.
Directed by Cristian Mungiu "4 months, 3 weeks and 2 days" is the first Romanian film ever to receive the coveted award. It is one of 862 films produced in the EU in 2006 - a substantial increase from the previous year. Figures from across the Union show cinema attendances continue to rise, but the well financed and marketed Hollywood films produced in English continue to dominate. European films gained just 27% of the market share in the cinema last year. As well as problems on the "domestic" European market films often struggle to make any impact at all on US audiences.
"Prix LUX" - films we can all understand
The Parliament's new film prize "Prix LUX" (Lux is "light" in Latin) will be awarded on 18 October this year. A shortlist of three European films will be chosen by cinema experts with MEPs voting for the final winner. The winning film will not be awarded a sum of money but will be subtitled into the EU's 23 official languages.
The man who has championed the idea is French Green MEP Gérard Onesta who believes that subtitling will remove linguistic barriers and allow widespread distribution of films. "It will prove that diversity is not an obstacle but an opportunity" he told us.
European success stories
One recent success in the US was the German film "The Lives of the others" by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck which received an Oscar for best foreign language film. This film was financed by the EU's cinema programme "MEDIA". The "Queen" directed by Stephen Frears was another example of a European film doing well at the US box office.
Gérard Onesta was in Cannes recently for Europe Day on 25 May. He commented that the European film industry was "fragile" given its fragmentation in different languages and states.
Cannes - 11 MEDIA funded films nominated
At the recent Cannes film festival a total of 11 films nominated were funded by the MEDIA programme. Two of them were honoured in their respective categories: "The Edge of Heaven" by Fatih Akin which won best screenplay and “Persepolis” by Marjane Satrapi which won the Jury Prize.
The aim of MEDIA is to support Europe's audiovisual industry. It supports the development and distribution of thousands of films as well as training activities, festivals and promotion projects throughout the continent.
In October last year MEPs - as part of the EU's budget for 2007-2013, approved 755 million in funding for MEDIA over that period. On past form, more films supported in this way should receive Cannes nominations.
The only question that remains about the Parliament's new film prize is this; can its seat in Strasbourg and offices in Brussels and Luxembourg match the glamour of Cannes?!
