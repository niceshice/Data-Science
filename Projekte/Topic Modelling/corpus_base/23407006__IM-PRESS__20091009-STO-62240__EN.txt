Although pioneered in the developing world, Members are convinced that microcredits can create jobs and boost enterprise in Europe. In particular they could help people who are unable to access conventional credit, especially at a time of economic crisis.
Discussions on 29 September centred on plans by the European Commission to unveil loans worth €25,000 through a European Microfinance Facility. Their proposal came in reply to a request from the Parliament for some kind of action.
The meeting took place as part of a report that Hungarian Socialist MEP Kinga Göncz is drawing up for the Employment Committee. Early drafts of the report call on the Commission to earmark more money for the project - notably €150 million from January next year until the end of 2013.
Speaking to fellow Members, Ms Göncz said that " potential clients are those who do not receive bank loans, those who have lost their jobs and those who face difficulties in entering the labour market".
However, some Members in the meeting expressed concern over the viability of new spending commitments during an economic crisis as well as the effectiveness of the plan and whether it would help the intended beneficiaries.
The Committee is due to vote on the report on 5 November and the whole House will discuss it in December.
