MEPs to harmonize rules for defence equipment market
Free movement of goods
2008-12-15 - 09:02
Heide Rühle wants an open internal market in arms Tanks, guns, socks: the buying of military equipment like this from abroad is complicated due to export rules all being different. This means that Europe finds itself with 27 states and 27 different type of equipment. New rules being considered by MEPs on Monday will make it easier to buy from another country. Its supporters say it will ensure economies of scale and help cooperation between Europe's armed forces. Ahead of the vote, we spoke to Green MEP Heide Rühle who drafted the proposals.
The report relates to a "defence package" launched by the European Commission last December aiming to make it easier to buy and sell military related equipment in Europe.
Soldier's socks need a licence
Heide Rühle's report focuses on making the military export rules similar from one state to another. According to Heide Rühle we currently have "27 poorly coordinated national defence equipment markets" that are characterized by duplication and inefficient use of resources: "The problem is that all the defence related products need a national licence."
She went on to say that: "it means that if you have to buy something simple like socks or shoes, you'll need a licence to transport it from country state A to country B. We want to simplify these licence procedures via general licences."
The new proposal creates a European system of licences which will be uniform and applicable throughout the EU. European companies, national budgets and the job markets are all believed to benefit from the reform.
No arms for "conflict areas"
Ms Rühle underlines however, that there has to be a "strict control" that arms related products do not reach conflict areas. EU members should recognize that violation of export limitations of defence products is a criminal offence: "Every enterprise has to apply for a general licence, which has to be certified."
She explained that "they will only get a certification if it has a good practice and is responsible for complying with the laws. Countries are then obliged to sanction the enterprises that don't follow the rules".
Historic significance of defence spending recognised
Some might ask why it has taken so many years before the European defence market has been subjected to the same openness as the rest of the European Union's internal market which has no borders.
According to Ms Rühle the explanation should be found in the historical tradition of the defence sector: "All countries are very keen on having this link – this short line – to their defence industry... Another point is that there are different policies linked to export control."
She went on to say that "therefore it was very difficult to convince the a country that we could find an instrument, which is linked to the single market, but still respect their sovereignty on exports."
"We need trust among member states, and this directive will be a good basis to create trust, because everybody will have to respect the same rules."
The debate on Ms Rühle's report will be on Monday evening and the vote will take place on Tuesday. The Parliament's Internal Market Committee has already voted to support the measure in a vote in October.
