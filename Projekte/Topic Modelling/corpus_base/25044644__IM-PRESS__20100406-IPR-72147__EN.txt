A delegation of MEPs will be in Sudan from 8 to 15 April to observe the Sudanese elections at all levels of government. The elections are due to take place from 11 to 13 April.
The delegation will be led by Portuguese MEP Ana Gomes, a member of the S&D group. She will be accompanied by:
José Manuel GARCÍA-MARGALLO Y MARFIL (EPP, ES), Frank ENGEL (EPP, LU), Juan Fernando LÓPEZ AGUILAR (S&D, ES), John ATTARD-MONTALTO (S&D, MT), and Jacek WŁOSOWICZ (ECR, PL).
The European Parliament delegation is a part of a European Union Election Observation Mission headed by MEP Véronique De Keyser (S&D, BE).
Activities of MEPs in Sudan
On 9 and 10 April in Khartoum MEPs are to meet representatives and candidates of political parties, the President of the Central Electoral Commission, as well as national and international observers and officials.
Commenting on the mission, EP delegation chair Ana Gomes said "These elections are taking place at a crucial timing for Sudan. They precede a possible referendum in 2011 that, under the terms of the 2005 Naivasha Agreement, will decide upon the future of the country."
Press information
At the end of the election observation mission, a final press conference will be held in Khartoum jointly with the EU Observation Mission. All up-to-date information will be sent to journalists.
