"The result of the referendum brings Turkey a step closer to its European objective," says President Buzek. "Constitutions need to go beyond party politics and not be merely the reflection of any temporary majority rule."
The President of the European Parliament Jerzy Buzek welcomed the positive result of the constitutional referendum in Turkey held yesterday (12 September 2010).
EP President Buzek said:
"I welcome the result of the referendum in Turkey. Democracy has been boosted by Turkish citizens.
The result of the referendum brings Turkey a step closer to its European objective, but more needs to follow.
After implementing these constitutional changes, further and deeper reforms need to be implemented in broad consultation with civil society, different political parties and ethnic minorities.
Constitutions need to go beyond party politics and not be merely the reflection of majority rule."
