MEPs to debate the role of the European Union in the Middle East with Javier Solana
MEPs will debate the role of the European Union in the Middle East after hearing a statement from the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy Javier Solana . Given the recent crisis in Gaza and the elections in Israel's general election, the EU's role is key. Parliament will vote on a resolution on this topic. The European Parliament has a working group on the Middle East.
EU-NATO Relations: strengthen cooperation say MEPs
MEPs in the Foreign Affairs Committee say that the EU and NATO could strengthen each other by avoiding competition and developing greater cooperation in crisis management operations. The report supports the establishment of a permanent EU Operational Headquarters. The first report of the European Parliament on NATO comes a few months ahead of the Alliance's 60th anniversary Summit to be held in Strasbourg and Kehl in April 2009.The report recognises the fundamental role of NATO in the security architecture of the Europe and takes the view that the future collective defence of the EU should as far as possible be organised in cooperation with NATO.
MEPs call for a stronger Common Foreign and Security Policy
MEPs in the Foreign Affairs Committee call for a stronger Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), in a motion for a resolution on the annual report from the Council to the European Parliament on the CFSP in 2007 drafted by Committee Chairman Jacek SARYUSZ - WOLSKI (EPP-ED, PL). MEPs in the committee reiterate that the CFSP must be guided by the values of the European Union and its Member States: these values are democracy, the rule of law and respect for the dignity of the human person, for human rights and for fundamental freedoms, and the promotion of peace and effective multilateralism.
MEPs promote a strong and effective foreign, security and defence policy
MEPs in the Foreign Affairs committee point out that the European Union needs to develop its strategic autonomy. This strategic autonomy will help the EU to promote peace and international security, to defend its interests in the world, to protect the security of its own citizens, to contribute to effective multilateralism, to advance respect for human rights and democratic values worldwide and to safeguard world peace.
Alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners - vote on resolution
Parliament will vote on a resolution on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners following on from the debate of 4 February 2009. In February 2007, MEPs adopted a report saying that over one thousand CIA-operated flights used European airspace from 2001 to 2005 and temporary secret detention facilities "may have been located at US military bases" in Europe.
'Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean' contributes towards peace and prosperity
Opening up the 'Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean' to countries not involved in the partnership "increases the likelihood of establishing parity in relations between the EU and the Mediterranean partner countries and of tackling the problems of the region in a comprehensive way". So says the Foreign Affairs Committee in a report drafted by Pasqualina NAPOLETANO (PES, IT). Provided that the proposal entitled 'Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean' adopted by Heads of State and Government on 13 July, 2008 "delivers its promises and yields concrete and visible results", it contributes towards peace and prosperity and constitutes "a step towards economic and regional integration as well as ecological and climatic co-operation between the Mediterranean countries", the report states.
Review of the European Neighbourhood Policy Instrument
Konrad SZYMANSKI (UEN, PL) for the Committee on Foreign Affairs is proposing an own-initiative report drafted on the review of the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI). Members call on the Commission, together with the partner governments, to develop further mechanisms for consultation with civil society and local authorities, in order better to involve them in the design and monitoring of the implementation of the ENPI and of the national reform programmes.
MEPs will vote on legislative resolution on crackdown on employers of illegal immigrants
Parliament will vote on the legislative resolution on the crackdown on employers of illegal immigrants, following the vote on the amendments in Strasbourg on 4 February. At the time, MEPs decided to postpone the final vote at the request of the rapporteur Claudio FAVA (PES, IT) to allow the addition of a declaration providing reassurance that this directive will not prevent further legislation on subcontractors. Between 4.5 and 8 million illegal immigrants work in the construction, farming, hotel and other sectors in the EU. One of the factors encouraging illegal immigration into the EU is the possibility of finding work. This legislation aims to reduce that pull factor by targeting the employment of third-country nationals who are illegally staying in the EU.
Permanent reduction on VAT for local goods and services welcomed
Member States should be allowed to reduce VAT rates for a new category of goods and services, such as restaurant services, children's car seats, audio books, beauty treatments, and locally supplied services, if there is no distortion to competition in the EU Internal Market, says the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Facing up to the challenges of shrinking oil reserves - nuclear power?
Oil is a finite resource, and yet, according to the US Energy Information Administration, worldwide demand for oil will be more than a third higher in 2030 than it was in 2006. The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, in its report drafted by Herbert REUL (EPP-ED, DE), tackles the EU's reliance on oil imports, international co-operation, price hikes and renewable energy, suggesting a shift to more carbon-neutral solutions, such as nuclear energy.The European Union's dependence on oil imports will rise to 95% by 2030, says the report, and conventional oil reserves will be increasingly concentrated in "countries in the strategic ellipse".
Follow up of the energy efficiency national action plans
Member States' failure to submit national energy efficiency plans highlights deficiencies that might "endanger the attainment of the EU's efficiency and climate protection objectives", says the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy in a report drafted by András GYÜRK (EPP-ED, HU). According to the report, the European Union wastes more than 20 % of its energy due to inefficiency and, if the saving objective of 20 % were met, the EU would use about 400 Mtoe (million tonnes of oil equivalent) less primary energy and the CO2 emissions reduction would be about 860Mt.
A social economy "would reduce speculation in financial markets"
Businesses which focus on people rather than capital play an essential role in the European economy and could help regulate financial markets, says the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. But, the Committee warns, this "social economy" sector "remains little-known and is often the target of criticism stemming from misguided technical approaches".The Committee report, drafted by Patrizia TOIA (ALDE, IT), considers that "social economy enterprises should not be subject to the same application of competition rules as other undertakings" and that "they need a secure legal framework, based on recognition of their specific values".
Adopt framework on informing and consulting employees or face consequences
Noting that a significant number of Member States have yet to fully adopt a framework for informing and consulting employees, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is urging those countries to do so "as soon as possible" or face possible infringement proceedings. Various Member States have failed to take account of some young workers, women working part-time or workers employed for short periods on fixed-term contracts, says the report by Jean Louis COTTIGNY (PES, FR).
Awareness of mental health in the EU
One in four people experience mental health problems at least once in their lives, and many more are indirectly affected. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is calling on Member States to develop awareness-raising campaigns, to combat stigma and social exclusion and to improve mental health legislation. In its report, drafted by Evangelia TZAMPAZI (PES, GR), Member States are called on to draw up "up-to-date mental health legislation, which is in line with international obligations as regards human rights … and which codifies and enshrines the basic principles, values and objectives of mental health policy".
Call for action to eliminate whaling
The Fisheries Committee is arguing for the elimination of lethal whaling for scientific purposes and the maintenance of the global moratorium on commercial whaling. In a report, MEPs call for the EU to work towards obtaining a "universal agreement" on whaling. Almost one in four cetacean (whale, dolphin and porpoise) species are currently regarded as under threat, with nine species listed as either endangered or critically endangered, and the status of others remains unclear. According to the report drawn up by Elspeth ATTWOOLL (ALDE, UK), although some whale populations have recovered somewhat since the introduction of the moratorium in 1986, others have not and their ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions remains unknown.
Need for responsible, high-quality fisheries research
In a report on applied research relating to the Common Fisheries Policy, the Fisheries Committee calls on the Commission to review the 7th framework programme when the mid-term evaluation is carried out, scheduled for 2010, paying greater attention to the specific problems of fisheries and aquaculture. The Fisheries Committee is convinced that both policy-makers and operators in the fisheries sector have a "crucial need for a more practical type of research" and, given the duration of the seventh framework programme, "it is imperative to include the objectives to be achieved".
North-East Atlantic Fisheries
This proposal aims to transpose into Community law the amendments to the Convention adopted by the North-East Atlantic fisheries (NEAFC) at its 23rd annual meeting in November 2004, allowing it to adopt recommendations establishing procedures for the settlement of disputes arising from the Convention. Given that the amendments made to the Convention "are likely to facilitate its application, in particular as regards the settlement of disputes, and that they also improve the sustainable management of fisheries resources", the rapporteur, Philippe MORILLON (ALDE, FR), is in favour of the proposal for a decision.
Competition Policy 2006 and 2007
Jonathan EVANS (EPP-ED, UK) for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will be putting forward an own-initiative report welcoming the publication of the Commission's Competition Policy Reports for 2006 and 2007. MEPs in the committee congratulate the Commission on its effective challenging of the operation of unlawful hardcore cartels and the record fines imposed on offenders. They support the use of the revised leniency notice and procedure to encourage the provision of information about the operation of unlawful hardcore cartels.
European professional card for service providers
Charlotte CEDERSCHIÖLD (EPP-ED, SE) for the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection will be putting forward an own-initiative report on the creation of a European professional card for service providers. The report stresses that greater mobility of persons and services between Member States and between regions is an essential element in achieving the Lisbon agenda for growth and jobs. There are still major obstacles for persons wanting to work in another Member State: 20% of complaints received by SOLVIT in 2007 concerned the recognition of professional qualifications required to pursue a regulated profession.
Community participation in the European Audiovisual Observatory
Ivo BELET (EPP-ED, BE) for the Committee on Culture and Education will be putting forward an own-initiative report by on Community participation in the European Audiovisual Observatory. It recognises that the Observatory plays a vital role by providing detailed information on the sector to both public and private bodies in the field. The report stresses that multimedia and new technologies will play an ever greater role in the audiovisual sector and that the Observatory must, in due course, strengthen its capacity to follow these new developments in order to continue to play an important role in the sector.
Crop statistics
Elisabeth JEGGLE (EPP-ED, DE) for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development will be putting forward a legislative report amending the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning crop statistics. The main amendments refer to the reference to land use, inclusion of definitions and variables with a low prevalence and evaluation of the report's quality.
A special place for children in EU
The Committee on Development, in a report by Glenys KINNOCK (PES; UK), welcomes the Commission's Communication on “A Special Place for Children in EU External Action” and the accompanying Council Conclusions as "important steps forward towards an EU strategy on the Rights of the Child", but underlines that "much remains to be done to put the political commitments into practice". The Committee report notes that despite the recent positive developments at EU level, the EU institutions and staff resources devoted to children’s rights remain inadequate. MEPs stress that "none of the plans will be realised unless adequate funding is available".
Financing of actions other than Official Development Assistance
Thijs BERMAN (PES, NL) for the Committee on Development is proposing an own initiative report by (PES, NL) with recommendations to the Commission on financing of actions other than Official Development Assistance in countries falling under Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 (DCI), calling on the Commission to review this Regulation. The new legal framework requested covers all EU activities with third countries under the DCI which do not fulfil ODA criteria, such as cultural, scientific and economic exchange programmes, citizen-to-citizen contacts, or political dialogue. It is also suggested to limit the geographical scope of the requested legislation to those countries covered by DCI.
New "European Research Infrastructure" status for research projects of pan-European interest
The new regulation aims to facilitate the establishment of pan-European research infrastructures, to be jointly funded by several Member States. Under the new legislation, the European Commission will be able to confer the legal status of a "European Research Infrastructure (ERI)" to research projects submitted by Member States which fulfil certain conditions. The Industry Committee stresses that not only new research projects - as proposed by the Commission - but also already existing European projects should be able to apply for the new status of ERI. 20090210BRI49051 Draft Agenda - 18-19 February 2009 EP Live EuroparlTV

Formal Sitting with Czech President Václav Klaus
2009-02-12 - 18:33
The Czech President and Head of State Václav Klaus will address the European Parliament at 11.00am on Thursday 19 February in Brussels. The Czech Republic currently holds the Presidency of the Council from 1 January 2009 to 30 June 2009. Vaclav Klaus was born in the Vinohrady district of Prague on June 19, 1941. He spent his childhood and youth in the neighbourhood of Tylovo namesti square.
He obtained his university education at the University of Economics, Prague (majoring in the Foreign Trade Economics and graduating in 1963), and economics thus became his specialist field for his entire life. He took advantage of the relative liberalisation in the then Czechoslovakia in order to study in Italy (1966) and the USA (1969). As a research worker at the Institute of Economics of the Czech Academy of Sciences he completed his postgraduate scientific studies and in 1968 was awarded the title of app. PhD. in Economics. In 1970 he was forced to abandon his research career for political reasons, and left to work at the Czechoslovak State Bank for many years. In 1987 he returned from the bank to his academic work at the Prognostic Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences at the end of 1987.
Immediately after the events of November 17, 1989 he entered politics, but did not lose contact with the world of economic science. He continued to lecture and publish occasionally, and in 1991 he was engaged as a lecturer at Charles University in the field of economics. In 1995 he was appointed professor for the field of finances at the University of Economics, Prague.
He embarked on his political career in December 1989, when he became Federal Minister of Finance. Later, in October 1991 he was appointed vice chairman of the government of the Czechoslovak Federal Republic. At the end of 1990 he became the chairman of the then strongest political entity - the Civic Forum. Following its demise in April 1991 he co-founded the Civic Democratic Party, of which he was chairman from its inception until December 2002. He won a parliamentary election with this party in June 1992 and became Prime Minister of the Czech Republic. In this role he shared in the "Velvet Divorce" of the Czechoslovak Federation and the foundation of an independent Czech Republic. In 1996 he successfully defended his post as Prime Minister in election to the Chamber of Deputies. Following the collapse of the governing coalition he tendered his resignation in November 1997. Following a forced general election in 1998 he became chairman of the Chamber of Deputies of the Czech parliament for a four-year period.
On February 28, 2003 he was elected President of the Czech Republic. On February 15, 2008 he was elected President of the Czech Republic.
Vaclav Klaus is married to the economist Livia Klausova and has two sons and five grandchildren. His son Vaclav is the headmaster of a private grammar school in Prague, and his son Jan works as a financial analyst. For many years in his youth Vaclav Klaus was top sportsman, playing basketball and volleyball, and also enjoys skiing and playing tennis. In his free time he enjoys reading fictitious literature and listening to music, in particular jazz.
He has published over 20 books on general social, political and economic themes, and has been awarded a number of international prizes and honorary doctorates from universities all over the world. 11am, 19.02.2009 President of the Czech Republic

MEPs to debate the role of the European Union in the Middle East with Javier Solana
2009-02-12 - 18:33
MEPs will debate the role of the European Union in the Middle East after hearing a statement from the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy Javier Solana. Given the recent crisis in Gaza and the elections in Israel's general election, the EU's role is key. Parliament will vote on a resolution on this topic. The European Parliament has a working group of the Middle East. The EU plays a key role in the Middle East through the Quartet (the United States, Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations). The group was established in Madrid in 2002 by the Spanish Prime Minister Aznar, as a result of the escalating conflict in the Middle East. Former British Prime Minister, Tony Blair , is the Quartet's current Special Envoy.
Relations with the Palestinian Authority
The EU has been working with the Palestinian Authority to build up the institutions of a future democratic, independent and viable Palestinian State living side by side with Israel and its neighbours. These efforts are regularly debated by the EU Council of Ministers.
The Action Plan concluded with the Palestinian Authority set up the agenda of the economic and political cooperation with the EU. The legal basis for the EU’s relations with the PA is the Interim Association Agreement on Trade and Cooperation signed with the PLO on behalf of the Palestinian Authority.
The European Commission is the biggest donor of financial assistance to the Palestinians. In 2008, the EU granted €486 million to the Palestinian Authority.
Community support for the Palestinian Reform and Development Plan is channelled through the new PEGASE mechanism, replacing the Temporary International Mechanism. The European Union - European Commission and EU Member States - is the largest donor to Palestine refugees through UNRWA.
EU-Israel relations
The EU and Israel committed themselves to establishing a partnership which provides for close political and mutually beneficial trade and investment relations together with economic, social, financial, civil scientific, technological and cultural cooperation.
The Action Plan concluded with Israel helped give new energy and focus to EU-Israel relations. Its objective is to gradually integrate Israel into European policies and programmes. Every step taken is determined by both sides and the Action Plan is tailor-made to reflect Israel’s interests and priorities as well as its level of development.
There is also, for the first time, a financial assistance element to EU-Israel cooperation - Israel is eligible for €14 million in European Community financial cooperation over the next seven years.
The legal basis for the EU’s relations with Israel is the EU-Israel Association Agreement.
As a result of the Action Plan discussions on the most contentious issue of EU-Israel relations over the years, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, have been stepped up.
2007 has seen renewed efforts by the international community, including the revitalization of the quartet, combined with increased support from regional partners for peace and stability in the Middle East. The EU believes that the creation of an independent, viable and democratic Palestinian state is in Israel’s interest.

EU-NATO Relations: strengthen cooperation say MEPs
2009-02-12 - 18:33
MEPs of the Foreign Affairs Committee say that the EU and NATO could strengthen each other by avoiding competition and developing greater cooperation in crisis management operations. The report supports the establishment of a permanent EU Operational Headquarters. The first report of the European Parliament on NATO comes a few months ahead of the Alliance's 60th anniversary Summit to be held in Strasbourg and Kehl in April 2009. The report drafted by Ari VATANEN (EPP-ED, FI) was adopted by 37 in favour, 11 against and 17 abstentions in the Foreign Affairs Committee.
The report recognises the fundamental role of NATO in the security architecture of the Europe and takes the view that the future collective defence of the EU should as far as possible be organised in cooperation with NATO.
New security risks such as international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), failed States, intractable conflicts; organised crime, cyberthreats and environmental deterioration require closer partnership and concentration on strengthening the core capabilities of the EU and NATO, and closer coordination in the areas of planning, technology, equipment and training.
MEPs in the committee are of the view that the EU and NATO could strengthen each other by avoiding competition and developing greater cooperation in crisis management operations. MEPs in the committee support the proposal of the French government for the establishment of systematic contact between the secretaries-general of NATO and the EU Council, in particular so as to avoid confusion where the EU and NATO operate side by side, as in Kosovo and Afghanistan.
MEPs in the committee believe in the further need for the EU and NATO to develop a comprehensive approach to crisis management. The resolution calls on the EU to continue deploying missions while ensuring greater sustainability of European Security and Defence Policy so as to prevent conflicts and promote stability.
The report supports the establishment of a permanent EU Operational Headquarters, under the authority of the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative. The mandate of this Headquarter would be to plan and conduct ESDP military operations.
Compatibility between NATO and EU Memberships
Out of the 27 EU Member States, 6 are not members of the Alliance (Austria, Cyprus, Finland, Ireland, Malta and Sweden). MEPs insist that all the EU Member States must be present at the joint EU-NATO meetings without discrimination. The resolution also proposes that candidate countries that are NATO Allies should be more involved in the work of the ESDP and the European Defence Agency.
As the Cypriot problem continues to badly impair the development of EU-NATO cooperation, the resolution encourages Cyprus to review its political position on its membership of the Partnership for Peace and also calls on NATO member states to refrain from using their veto to prevent EU Member States from becoming members of NATO.
The resolution regrets that, in the name of a doctrine of non-alignment, certain Member States have abdicated their responsibility to contribute to the protection of the values and freedoms of the democratic world.

MEPs call for a stronger Common Foreign and Security Policy
2009-02-12 - 18:33
MEPs in the Foreign Affairs Committee call for a stronger Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), in a motion for a resolution on the annual report from the Council to the European Parliament on the CFSP in 2007 drafted by Committee Chairman Jacek SARYUSZ-WOLSKI (EPP-ED, PL). MEPs in the committee believe that the European Union can make an impact only if it speaks with one voice. They also call for appropriate equipment and a further cooperation with the UN. MEPs believe that members of the committees on foreign affairs and defence of national parliaments should be invited by the European Parliament to meet it regularly in order to scrutinise the main developments in the CFSP.
The committee calls for resources commensurate with the objectives and specific targets of the CFSP.
MEPs in the committee reiterate that the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) must be guided by the values of the European Union and its Member States: these values are democracy, the rule of law and respect for the dignity of the human person, for human rights and for fundamental freedoms, and the promotion of peace and effective multilateralism.
The European Parliament underlines that the EU must use the CFSP to fight for the common interests of its citizens, including their right to live in peace and security in a clean environment and to have diversified access to vital resources such as energy.
Parliament believes that the CFSP should continue to focus on upholding human rights, on promoting peace and security in Europe’s neighbourhood and at global level, on support for effective multilateralism and respect for international law, on the fight against terrorism, on non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and disarmament, and on climate change and energy security, since these issues constitute the greatest challenges to our planet and hence directly relate to the concerns of European citizens.
MEPs in the committee believe also that the war in Georgia confirms the need for further development, within the framework of the revision of the ESS, of EU preventive diplomacy, matched by adequate crisis-prevention tools, including the Instrument for Stability, contingency planning and reliable long-term funding, and the need to make full use of the EU's capabilities and experience in managing disasters and crises.
MEPs in the committee believe that the coming months will provide a unique opportunity for the European Union to work out a new transatlantic agenda with the new US administration. Such strategic issues could be covered: a new more effective global governance based on stronger multilateral organisations, the financial crisis, the establishment of a new set of Euro-Atlantic institutions, measures to tackle climate change, energy security, the promotion of a durable peace in the Middle East, the situation in Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan, the fight against terrorism and organised crime, nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, the Millennium Development Goals.
Main EU security concerns
The committee recalls that the consolidation of the post-status Kosovo is essential for the achievement of stability in the Western Balkans. MEPs welcome the consensus reached in the UN Security Council on 26 November 2008, which has allowed the deployment of EULEX throughout Kosovo, and urges the Council, in cooperation with the United Nations Mission in Kosovo, to achieve a clear working relationship and a smooth handover between the two missions in the area of the rule of law.
MEPs in the committee encourage Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) political leaders to implement the agreement reached on 8 November 2008 in order to address the remaining objectives and conditions set by the Peace Implementation Council for the transition from the Office of the High Representative to the EU Special Representative’s office by mid-2009.
MEPs in the committee take the view that the recent crisis in the South Caucasus has clearly demonstrated the need for a stronger EU presence in its eastern neighbourhood. They propose that the Eastern partnership should be matched by a doubling of EU financial assistance and by a strong political dimension of which EURONEST (the joint parliamentary assembly comprising Members of the European Parliament and of the parliaments of the neighbourhood) should be an integral part.
On Georgia, MEPs in the committee urge the Council to insist on the implementation of the ceasefire agreement and to ensure that EU monitors are granted full access to all areas, in compliance with the European Union Monitoring Mission's mandate.
MEPs in the committee urge the Council to consider all means to promote a lasting peace in the Middle East, including the deployment of an ESDP (European Security and Defence Policy) mission.
On the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Parliament calls on all parties to cease the indiscriminate violence and violations of human rights involving the civilian population, to re-engage in the peace negotiations launched in Goma and Nairobi and to endorse the programme adopted by the DRC National Assembly.
MEPs in the committee recall the proposal on a global partnership and a common strategy for relations between the European Union and Latin America and call on the Council and the Commission to take active steps to realise this goal.

MEPs promote a strong and effective foreign, security and defence policy
2009-02-12 - 18:33
MEPs in the Foreign Affairs committee point out that the European Union needs to develop its strategic autonomy. This strategic autonomy will help the EU to promote peace and international security, to defend its interests in the world, to protect the security of its own citizens, to contribute to effective multilateralism, to advance respect for human rights and democratic values worldwide and to safeguard world peace. The committee recognises the need for the EU to develop its strategic autonomy through multilateral cooperation in international organisations, above all the United Nations, and through partnerships with other key actors, according to the report on the European Security Strategy (ESS) and European security and defence policy (ESDP), drafted by Karl VON WOGAU (EPP-ED, DE).
MEPs in the committee reiterate the need for a reform of the United Nations Organization in order to make it capable of fully meeting its responsibilities and acting effectively in providing solutions to global challenges and responding to key threats.
The committee calls for the setting-up of an autonomous and permanent EU Operational Headquarters with the capacity to undertake strategic planning and to conduct ESDP operations and missions.
The report notes that a common defence policy in Europe requires an integrated European Armed Force which needs to be equipped with common weapon systems so as to guarantee commonality and interoperability.
European Security Strategy
MEPs note that the 2003 ESS highlights the main threats faced by the European Union: terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, regional conflicts, state failure and organised crime. (§ 20)
Otherwise, according to MEPs in the committee, the security interests of the Union also include the protection of its citizens and its interests inside the EU as well as abroad, the security of its neighbourhood and the protection of its external borders and critical infrastructure. Furthermore, it includes the improvement of its cyber security, the security of energy supply and sea lanes, the protection of its space assets and protection against the consequences of climate change.
The committee stresses that the European Union gives priority to crisis prevention in the ESDP. It suggests that the ESS should be reviewed every five years at the beginning of a new EU legislative period.
MEPs in the committee strongly request that the European Union and its Member States focus their efforts on common capabilities which can be used for both defence and security purposes. In this context, they consider satellite-based intelligence, surveillance and warning equipment, unmanned air vehicles, helicopters and telecommunication equipment and air and sea transport to be crucial. MEPs in the committee also demand a common technical standard for protected telecommunications and ways of protecting critical infrastructure.
Civilian and military operations
MEPs in the committee also call for further initiatives concerning common training for personnel who are to work together in civilian and military operations. They ask for increased interaction between the armed forces and civilian personnel of EU Member States, coordination of crisis-related training, exchange programmes among armed forces in Europe and the opening-up of armies to citizens of other EU Member States.

Alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners - vote on resolution
2009-02-12 - 18:33
Parliament will vote on a resolution on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners following on from the debate of 4 February 2009. In February 2007, MEPs adopted a report saying that over one thousand CIA-operated flights used European airspace from 2001 to 2005 and temporary secret detention facilities "may have been located at US military bases" in Europe. The 2007 report deploring the passivity of some Member States in the face of illegal CIA operations, as well as the lack of co-operation from the EU Council of Ministers, was approved with 382 votes in favour, 256 against with 74 abstentions.

'Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean' contributes towards peace and prosperity
2009-02-12 - 18:33
Opening up the 'Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean' to countries not involved in the partnership "increases the likelihood of establishing parity in relations between the EU and the Mediterranean partner countries and of tackling the problems of the region in a comprehensive way". So says the Foreign Affairs Committee in a report drafted by Pasqualina NAPOLETANO (PES, IT). Provided that the proposal entitled 'Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean' adopted by Heads of State and Government on 13 July, 2008 "delivers its promises and yields concrete and visible results", it contributes towards peace and prosperity and constitutes "a step towards economic and regional integration as well as ecological and climatic co-operation between the Mediterranean countries", the report states.
The report also welcomes the decision of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Union for the Mediterranean to include the League of Arab States as a participant at all meetings at all levels, considering its positive contribution to the goals of peace, prosperity and stability in the Mediterranean region.
New name proposed: 'Union for the Mediterranean'
The Committee is of the view that changing the name to 'Union for the Mediterranean' - a change proposed at a meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs held in Marseilles on 3-4 November, 2008 - would help to highlight the joint nature of the partnership, but considers it necessary that the strategic value of Euro Mediterranean relations and the Barcelona Process acquis, including the involvement of civil society, be reaffirmed.
Accession prospects not affected
The report stresses that participation in the Union for the Mediterranean does not constitute an alternative to enlargement of the EU and does not affect the accession prospects of any current or future candidate state and considers that the Union for the Mediterranean will not hamper other regional cooperation initiatives.
The Committee report also calls on the Council and the Commission to ensure that all member countries of the Union for the Mediterranean are able to access the regional programmes already provided for under the Euro Mediterranean partnership, pointing to the importance of extending the scope of Community programmes to include participation by partner countries, not least in the fields of education, research and professional training (student exchanges, etc.).
Leadership role of EU in conflict resolution
The Committee believes that the EU must assume the role of leadership in the resolution of conflicts in the region by winning the confidence of all parties involved. It is hoped that the strengthening of Euro Mediterranean relations will provide a "boost to the development of an area of peace and prosperity".
Funding
The report points out that the projects financed within the framework of the Union for the Mediterranean should be supported by funding from the Community, from partner states and from private financing. It calls on the Council and Commission to specify the role and strengthen the initiatives of the Facility for Euro Mediterranean Investment and Partnership (FEMIP) which, through its investment programme, is facilitating the economic opening up and modernisation of the Mediterranean countries.
It also reiterates its support for the creation of a Euro Mediterranean Investment Bank and coordination with international investors and emphasises the importance of the remittance of savings by emigrants from the Southern Mediterranean countries to their countries of origin, considering this to be "a tremendous and as yet insufficiently used lever for development".

Review of the European Neighbourhood Policy Instrument
2009-02-12 - 18:33
Konrad SZYMANSKI (UEN, PL) for the Committee on Foreign Affairs is proposing an own-initiative report drafted on the review of the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI). Members call on the Commission, together with the partner governments, to develop further mechanisms for consultation with civil society and local authorities, in order better to involve them in the design and monitoring of the implementation of the ENPI and of the national reform programmes. The report states that sectoral and general budget support under the ENPI should be made available only to governments which are able to implement it in a transparent and accountable manner and where it constitutes a real incentive. The Commission is asked to review the appropriateness of budget support in countries which have problems with budgetary management and control procedures and high levels of corruption.
Furthermore, there should be a country-specific approach with regard to political conditionality, designed inter alia to promote democracy, the rule of law and good governance, respect for human rights and minority rights and the independence of the judiciary.
MEPs in the committee underline the need to increase the ENPI financial envelope in order to enable the ENP to attain its increasingly ambitious objectives. They go on to recall that, during the negotiations on the ENPI's legal basis, Parliament had legitimate concerns over how the medium and short-term strategy papers and country papers, often containing indicative financial amounts, would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny.
They call for an evaluation of how these indicative financial commitments have been implemented during the past two years. The committee is concerned about the high level of requested budgetary transfers, which already amount to a cumulative increase of EUR 410 million in commitments and EUR 635 million in payments for the years 2007 and 2008.
Country and region-specific remarks: the committee notes the progress made under the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM initiative), but stresses that:
the ENPI financing of the ENP initiative for the South or East should not be used to the detriment of each other;
Parliament should be adequately informed of the UfM projects funded from the ENPI;
when ENPI funds are used, the transparency of other sources, including private funding, is particularly important.
The report also makes the following points:
the Mediterranean component of the ENP should complement the Barcelona Process, and the ENP's objectives need to be more clearly defined in order to strengthen the Barcelona Process by favouring a multilateral regional approach;
there should be enhanced EU involvement in the Black Sea region and an ambitious Eastern Partnership. The committee stresses the need to accelerate the establishment of a free-trade zone in relation to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ukraine and Moldova in particular, as soon as partner countries are ready;
an Eastern Neighbourhood assembly ("Euroeast"), with the participation of the European Parliament, should be created on the same lines as the Euromed and EuroLat assemblies with a view to implementing the ENPI in the countries of eastern Europe, namely Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine and Belarus.

Immigration
MEPs will vote on legislative resolution on crackdown on employers of illegal immigrants
2009-02-12 - 18:33
Parliament will vote on the legislative resolution on the crackdown on employers of illegal immigrants, following the vote on the amendments in Strasbourg on 4 February. At the time, MEPs decided to postpone the final vote at the request of the rapporteur Claudio FAVA (PES, IT) to allow the addition of a declaration providing reassurance that this directive will not prevent further legislation on subcontractors. Criminalising the employer, not the migrant
Between 4.5 and 8 million illegal immigrants work in the construction, farming, hotel and other sectors in the EU. One of the factors encouraging illegal immigration into the EU is the possibility of finding work. This legislation aims to reduce that pull factor by targeting the employment of third-country nationals who are illegally staying in the EU.
The Commission’s draft legislation is supposed to complement other measures, such as the “return directive” and the “blue card” directive, the overall aim being to combat illegal immigration more firmly while encouraging legal immigration. The “sanctions directive" would introduce minimum penalties at European level against employers of illegal immigrants. Employers could be fined, forced to pay wages in arrears at legal levels or even banned for up to five years from bidding for public sector contracts or from receiving state aid – whether national or European.
Criminal law penalties in the most serious cases
The directive would also lay down criminal law penalties against employers for repeat offences, where a large number of people in an irregular situation are employed, where the working conditions are exploitative, where the employee is a victim of human trafficking and this is known to the employer, or if the employee is a minor.
Automatic recovery of unpaid wages
An employer who is found guilty must also refund any state aid received the previous year and pay a graduated fine according to the number of illegal immigrants employed. In addition, he must pay a sum equal to the amount of taxes and other levies he would have paid if the worker had been employed legally and, where applicable, the cost of returning the migrant.
The employment relationship will be assumed to have lasted at least three months unless the employer or worker supplies proof to the contrary. MEPs demanded that the procedures necessary for the employee to recover the unpaid wages must be automatic, without any need for the employee to take action.
MEPs successfully argued that Member States should establish lower financial penalties for people using clandestine immigrants as domestic staff, provided the working conditions are not exploitative.
Grievance procedure
Parliament also wants Member States to set up mechanisms to enable illegal immigrants to lodge complaints. Third parties designated by Member States, such as voluntary bodies or trade unions, should be allowed to report a guilty employer without running the risk of being subsequently taken to court for assisting someone to stay in the country illegally. Irregular immigrants will, if they cooperate with the legal action against their employer, be able to get a temporary residence permit.
Firms that use subcontractors to be liable
If the guilty employer is a subcontractor, the contracting firm must also be held liable, and even fully liable if it turns out that the contracting employer knew the subcontractor was acting illegally. A list of employers who have infringed the directive may be made public – another successful demand by MEPs.
Effective and sufficient inspections
The Member States are asked to conduct effective inspections sufficiently frequently to check on the employment of non-EU nationals in an irregular situation. They must also require employers to check that their non-EU employees have a valid residence permit and inform a national authority of any new recruitment of non-EU nationals.
UK not opting-in
The UK government supports the general purpose of the draft directive as part of the wider fight against illegal immigration. Nevertheless, it has a number of concerns and has not opted-in to this directive. The UK government believes there is no legal basis or Community competence for criminal sanctions in this directive, nor would we support measures which could create a pull factor for illegal immigrants (e.g: back payments, facilitation of complaints procedures and any associated delays in returning illegal migrants Final vote on legislative resolution: Legislation to crack down on employers of illegal immigrants - vote 03.02.2009 New rules will penalise employers of undeclared workers

Taxation
Permanent reduction on VAT for local goods and services welcomed
2009-02-12 - 18:33
Member States should be allowed to reduce VAT rates for a new category of goods and services, such as restaurant services, children's car seats, audio books, beauty treatments, and locally supplied services, if there is no distortion to competition in the EU Internal Market, says the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. The committee report, drafted by Ieke Van den BURG (PES, NL), welcomes the Commission's plans to extend, both in time and scope, the existing range of goods and services on which Member States may apply reduced rates of VAT.
For a trial period, Member States are also allowed to apply lower rates on certain labour intensive services until 2010.
The Commission is proposing that this period continues indefinitely and that Member States can incorporate some additional labour-intensive or locally supplied services into the range of goods and services eligible for a reduction in VAT if there is no risk of distorting the single European market.
The range of goods and services eligible would include:
• restaurant services
• domestic care services for the young, sick, disabled or elderly and
• beauty treatments of the sort provided in hairdressing salons
In addition, a number of updates and additions are proposed to the other categories where reduced rates of VAT are permitted. This notably includes making audio books or books supplied on CD-Rom eligible for reduced rates (printed books are already included) as well as children's car seats.
No impact on competition
MEPs in the Committee confirmed the opinion previously expressed by Parliament that reducing VAT of locally supplied services does not affect competition in the EU Internal Market since the goods and services concerned cannot be supplied from a different location and are only directed at localised markets.
On taxation issues, Parliament's views are advisory rather than binding and the final decision lies with the Council.
The UK has already introduced a VAT cut from 17.5% to 15% on 1 December for a period of 13 months.

Energy
Facing up to the challenges of shrinking oil reserves - nuclear power?
2009-02-12 - 18:33
Oil is a finite resource, and yet, according to the US Energy Information Administration, worldwide demand for oil will be more than a third higher in 2030 than it was in 2006. The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, in its report drafted by Herbert REUL (EPP-ED, DE), tackles the EU's reliance on oil imports, international co-operation, price hikes and renewable energy, suggesting a shift to more carbon-neutral solutions, such as nuclear energy. The European Union's dependence on oil imports will rise to 95% by 2030, says the report, and conventional oil reserves will be increasingly concentrated in "countries in the strategic ellipse". The Committee regrets that "the Commission has not learnt lessons from the economic crisis".
"Only a complete shift in EU energy policy will lead to a solution as regards security of supply, solidarity among Member States and employment, and in social, environmental and economic terms," MEPs say. They also express their regret at the lack "of a clear commitment to further change in energy policy and structure".
Sufficient oil for coming decades
According to the various estimates, it will still be possible to extract sufficient oil to meet demand in the coming decades, says the report, "even though consumers may have to pay a higher price for it".
Noting the exclusion of oil pipelines from the trans-European energy networks (TEN-E), MEPs call on the Member States and the Commission to consider including oil infrastructure in the TEN-E in view of current developments. They also emphasise that new oil infrastructure projects such as the Odessa-Gdansk and Constanța-Trieste pipelines should continue to be "high-priority projects of European interest".
Arctic potential
MEPs call both for "an intensification of efforts to make unconventional oil resources commercially viable" and for environmentally friendly extraction processes to be developed.
They point to the "importance of the Arctic region as an oil-producing area", which is thought to contain up to a quarter of undiscovered reserves worldwide, and note that in the interests of overall international stability, there needs to be an "equitable distribution of hydrocarbon resources in the Arctic".
The report goes on to say that "the extraction of existing resources is increasingly hampered by political factors". MEPs call on the Commission to step up the dialogue with producing countries at all levels and to seek "pragmatic solutions" to disputes in the interests of both parties. They also urge the EU and Member States to take steps to secure a "binding, progressive and all-encompassing Treaty basis for the common European energy supply and security".
High price to pay
Turning to the price of oil, MEPs consider that the main reason for the oil price rise in the past eight years lies with a strong growth in demand that has led to bottlenecks in the extraction, transport and refining of oil and to large windfall profits made by a few big oil oligopolies. Monitoring of competition in the processing and sale of oil and petroleum products is a priority, while improving market transparency is vital, say MEPs.
More investment in other energy sources including nuclear power
However, when and to what extent a "gap will develop between mounting demand and falling supply" is uncertain. Therefore, "all measures that could reduce demand for fossil fuel energy should be vigorously pursued". MEPs believe that the use of oil and other carbon-intensive energy sources should be reduced through "increased energy efficiency and by a shift to more carbon-neutral solutions, such as nuclear energy and energy derived from renewable resources".
They express their doubts regarding the "medium- and long-term suitability of first-generation biofuels as a substitute for oil", calling for increased efforts in researching synthetic fuels", and for more financial support from Member States for investments in alternative energy sources.

Energy
Follow up of the energy efficiency national action plans
2009-02-12 - 18:33
Member States' failure to submit national energy efficiency plans highlights deficiencies that might "endanger the attainment of the EU's efficiency and climate protection objectives", says the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy in a report drafted by András GYÜRK (EPP-ED, HU). According to the report, the European Union wastes more than 20 % of its energy due to inefficiency and, if the saving objective of 20 % were met, the EU would use about 400 Mtoe (million tonnes of oil equivalent) less primary energy and the CO2 emissions reduction would be about 860Mt.
The Committee notes "with regret" that in the majority of Member States the funding allocated to energy efficiency projects is still insufficient and fails to adequately account for regional differences.
Moreover, individual sector policies continue to run counter to the EU's endeavour to be energy efficient, the report says.
Member States should be more ambitious in their energy saving targets
MEPs call on Member States to "increase their level of ambition" by going beyond the national indicative energy saving target of 9% by 2016. Countries of the EU are also urged to turn their National Energy Efficiency Action Plans (NEEAPs) into a "practical tool for delivery", in order to meet the wider and longer term target of improving energy efficiency by at least 20% by 2020.
Residential buildings are among the most energy-wasteful sectors, the report says. Therefore, financial support at both national and Community levels for the energy performance of buildings should be increased and existing financial incentives should be compared with the commitments set out in the National Action Plans.
Cars: increasing demand for transport an issue
Turning to the car industry, the MEPs underline the importance of stringent future emissions targets to be set as soon as possible in the interests of industry certainty and express their disappointment that the 95g CO2 limit for 2020 called for by Parliament is not yet confirmed.
While they welcome the regulation on conditions governing carbon dioxide emissions from cars, they note, "with concern" that the new legislation will not offset the increasing energy demand for transport.
Small businesses do not have capacity to abide by legislation
SMEs also have an important role to play in improving energy efficiency, the report says, but "they do not have the same capacity to comply with legislation or new standards in the energy sector". MEPs therefore consider it necessary for National Action Plans to place special emphasis on how governments intend to promote and support energy efficiency investments on the part of SMEs.
Awareness campaigns to tackle poverty
In view of the fact that rising energy prices can lead to poverty, Member States are encouraged to include appropriate financial instruments for energy saving in their national action plans, and to develop long-term energy efficiency awareness campaigns as a matter of urgency.
Looking to alternative energy sources, Member States are "encouraged" to make substantial use of renewable energy such as wind, biomass, biofuels and also wave and tidal energy, where possible.
Finally, MEPs call on the Commission to make the 20% energy efficiency target by 2020 "legally binding as part of the assessment it must prepare on the progress of the Community towards this target."

Social policy
A social economy "would reduce speculation in financial markets"
2009-02-12 - 18:33
Businesses which focus on people rather than capital play an essential role in the European economy and could help regulate financial markets, says the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. But, the Committee warns, this "social economy" sector "remains little-known and is often the target of criticism stemming from misguided technical approaches". MEPs of the Committee point out that an economic system in which social economy enterprises play a more significant role would "reduce exposure to speculation in financial markets on which some private companies are not subject to the supervision of shareholders and regulatory bodies".
They also stress that the social economy helps to "rectify three major labour market imbalances: unemployment, job instability and the social and labour exclusion of the unemployed".
The Committee report, drafted by Patrizia TOIA (ALDE, IT), considers that "social economy enterprises should not be subject to the same application of competition rules as other undertakings" and that "they need a secure legal framework, based on recognition of their specific values".
A lot the Commission could do
MEPs therefore ask the Commission to promote businesses driven by social benefits rather than profit motive in its policies and to introduce "effective legal barriers to entry", so that only social economy organisations are able to benefit from financing destined social economy enterprises.
The report also calls for a European legal framework to be devised by the Commission, enabling "territorial partnerships to be established and maintained between the social economy sector and local authorities", and for the Commission to look into "reactivating the budget heading specifically for the social economy".
Member States, together with the Commission, are called on to develop programmes offering financial support, information, advice and training and to simplify the process of establishment, including reducing the initial capital requirements for companies in this sector.

Employment policy
Adopt framework on informing and consulting employees or face consequences
2009-02-12 - 18:33
Noting that a significant number of Member States have yet to fully adopt a framework for informing and consulting employees, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is urging those countries to do so "as soon as possible" or face possible infringement proceedings. Many Member States are late in transposing a directive adopted in March 2002, which seeks to strengthen the process of informing and consulting employees within the EU. While some countries have "confined themselves to transcribing certain aspects of its minimum applicable provisions".
Various Member States have failed to take account of some young workers, women working part-time or workers employed for short periods on fixed-term contracts, says the report by Jean Louis COTTIGNY (PES, FR).
The report stresses that Member States cannot "invoke subsidiarity" to justify not imposing sanctions on employers who do not meet the requirements of the legislative framework.
Measures for Member States to take
The report calls on Member States to define precisely the term 'information', leaving no scope for alternative interpretations. It also asks that workers' representatives be allowed to scrutinise the information provided, that information be provided in good time before consultation, and that trade unions be involved in the process, in order to "consolidate social dialogue".
It suggests that those Member States "in which protection for employees' representatives is traditionally guaranteed by means of an agreement negotiated between trade unions and employers' associations provide for a high level of subsidiary protection for such employees' representatives should the negotiations fail".
Member States face possible infringement proceedings
MEPs are urging the Commission to take immediate measures to guarantee effective transposition of the directive and to initiate infringement proceedings against those Member States which have failed to transpose the directive or which have not done so correctly.

Awareness of mental health in the EU
2009-02-12 - 18:33
One in four people experience mental health problems at least once in their lives, and many more are indirectly affected. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is calling on Member States to develop awareness-raising campaigns, to combat stigma and social exclusion and to improve mental health legislation. In its report, drafted by Evangelia TZAMPAZI (PES, GR), Member States are called on to draw up "up-to-date mental health legislation, which is in line with international obligations as regards human rights … and which codifies and enshrines the basic principles, values and objectives of mental health policy".
It also calls on Member States to develop an awareness of the importance of good mental health, particularly among healthcare professionals and target groups such as parents, teachers, those providing social and legal services, employers, carers and, particularly, the public at large.
The media, the Internet, schools and workplaces, all have an important role to play in the organisation of public information and awareness campaigns, the report says, their role being to "promote mental health, increase knowledge about the most common symptoms of depression and suicidal tendencies, de-stigmatise mental disorders, encourage people to seek the best and most effective assistance and promote the active integration of people experiencing mental health problems".
Funding available
The financial cost of mental ill-health to society is estimated at between 3% and 4% of the Member States' GDP, and in 2006 the cost to the EU of mental illness was EUR 436 billion.
The EU should use the funding facilities available under the Seventh Framework Programme, the report says. This would be for more research in the field of mental health and well-being and the interaction between mental and physical health problems. Moreover, Member States should explore the funding facilities for mental health initiatives under the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund.
Mental health and the workplace
In recognition of the important role the workplace plays in the social integration of people with mental health problems, the report calls on employers to promote a healthy working climate, paying attention to work-related stress, the underlying causes of mental disorder at the workplace, and tackling those causes.
It also calls on the Commission to "require businesses and public bodies to publish annually a report on their policy and work for the mental health of their employees on the same basis as they report on physical health and safety at work".
While Member States are asked to ensure that people who are entitled to sickness or disability benefits because of mental health problems are not deprived of their right of access to employment and that they will not lose the benefits related to their disability/sickness as soon as they find a new job.
EU emergency number is 112
Finally, the report calls for more information to be made available on the EU emergency number 112. While it does not replace existing national emergency numbers, it offers European citizens in distress access to emergency services in nearly all Member States.

Fisheries
Call for action to eliminate whaling
2009-02-12 - 18:33
The Fisheries Committee is arguing for the elimination of lethal whaling for scientific purposes and the maintenance of the global moratorium on commercial whaling. In a report, MEPs call for the EU to work towards obtaining a "universal agreement" on whaling. Almost one in four cetacean (whale, dolphin and porpoise) species are currently regarded as under threat, with nine species listed as either endangered or critically endangered, and the status of others remains unclear. According to the report drawn up by Elspeth ATTWOOLL (ALDE, UK), although some whale populations have recovered somewhat since the introduction of the moratorium in 1986, others have not and their ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions remains unknown.
Exceptions to the current moratorium
The present moratorium applies only to commercial whaling. In addition to the exception for aboriginal whaling, scientific research can be undertaken under special permits which are issued by the country undertaking the research. Not all members of the International Whaling Commission (20 out of 27 EU Member States are members of the IWC) have signed up to the moratorium so commercial whaling still takes place.
"There are suggestions, too, that the commercial use of whale meat is a by-product of scientific whaling", says Ms Attwooll.
The Fisheries Committee is calling on the Council, the Commission and those Member States participating in the working group of the IWC to work toward the achievement of a "universal agreement" on whaling.
The tragic history of commercial whaling, combined with the numerous threats currently faced by whale populations, means, says the committee, that the EU must promote the highest level of protection for whales at a global level.
Maintain global moratorium on commercial whaling and end scientific whaling
MEPs support the maintenance of the global moratorium on commercial whaling and a ban on international commercial trade in whale products. They seek to end "scientific whaling" and support the designation of substantial regions of ocean and seas as sanctuaries in which all whaling is indefinitely prohibited.
The committee notes that the EU Habitats Directive defining the Community position with respect to whales (and dolphins) "would not allow the resumption of commercial whaling in respect of any stock of whales in EU waters".
The report accepts the need for a limited amount of hunting to be done by those with a tradition of hunting whales for their own sustenance, but calls for much greater emphasis on research into, and the employment of, humane killing methods. The committee calls for any such hunting to take place only with "clear quotas" and "under strict controls".
More Marine Protected Areas
MEPs call also for the establishment, in suitable locations around the world, of more Marine Protected Areas in which whales would receive special protection and for the use of more selective fishing gear to avoid by-catches of other species, particularly cetaceans. Threats to the cetacean population arising from climate change, pollution, ship strikes, fishing gear, anthropogenic ocean noise (including sonar, seismic surveys and vessel noise) and other hazards should also be tackled outside such protected areas. The Fisheries Committee considers that the Commission should, in advance of global action, bring forward further proposals to counter such threats in respect of EU waters and EU vessels.
The Commission should also define a revised regulatory framework for the practice of whale-watching that protects the economic and social interests of coastal regions where this activity is carried out, taking account of its recent development, MEPs say.

Fisheries
Need for responsible, high-quality fisheries research
2009-02-12 - 18:33
In a report on applied research relating to the Common Fisheries Policy, the Fisheries Committee calls on the Commission to review the 7th framework programme when the mid-term evaluation is carried out, scheduled for 2010, paying greater attention to the specific problems of fisheries and aquaculture. The Fisheries Committee is convinced that both policy-makers and operators in the fisheries sector have a "crucial need for a more practical type of research" and, given the duration of the 7th framework programme, "it is imperative to include the objectives to be achieved".
Key points
"We insist on the need urgently to implement a specific science policy geared to fishery resources, accompanied by a significant financial effort", says the rapporteur, Rosa MIGUÉLEZ RAMOS (PES, ES).
The rapporteur recommends that, in the field of scientific marine research, priority be given not only to research to gain knowledge of the state of fish stocks but also to the ecosystemic, commercial, economic and social aspects that determine fisheries management, since all these aspects are of crucial importance.
The report stresses that "the CFP is among the Community policies most dependent on scientific research and the credibility of the measures adopted under this policy rests on high-quality scientific opinions".
It notes a "clear conflict of interest between fishermen and scientists in the short term, whereas their long-term objectives are more compatible", calling on the Commission to "promote better cooperation between fishermen and scientists".
MEPs in the committee call on the Commission and the Member States to "demonstrate and better convey to fishermen that it is in their interest to take into account the economic benefit that they can expect in the medium or long term in the assessment of their presumed short-term economic loss".

North-East Atlantic Fisheries
2009-02-12 - 18:33
The Fisheries Committee is recommending the plenary give its green light to the amendment of the Convention on future multilateral co-operation in the North-East Atlantic Fisheries (NEAFC). Key points
The proposal aims to transpose into Community law the amendments to the Convention adopted by the NEAFC at its 23rd annual meeting in November 2004, allowing it to adopt recommendations establishing procedures for the settlement of disputes arising from the Convention. Given that the amendments made to the Convention "are likely to facilitate its application, in particular as regards the settlement of disputes, and that they also improve the sustainable management of fisheries resources", the rapporteur is in favour of the proposal for a decision.

Competition
Competition Policy 2006 and 2007
2009-02-12 - 18:33
Jonathan EVANS (EPP-ED, UK) for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will be putting forward an own-initiative report by welcoming the publication of the Commission's Competition Policy Reports for 2006 and 2007. Antitrust : MEPs in the committee congratulate the Commission on its effective challenging of the operation of unlawful hardcore cartels and the record fines imposed on offenders. They support the use of the revised leniency notice and procedure to encourage the provision of information about the operation of unlawful hardcore cartels.
The report also welcomes the publication of the White Paper on damages actions for breach of EC anti-trust rules but urges that reform be pursued in such a way as to ensure that the negative effects of the US system are not repeated in the European Union. MEPs in the committee also call on the Commission to clarify the role and involvement in competition cases of the Commission Consumer Liaison Officer.
Reiterating their concern to avoid the abuse of market power by major corporations, MEPs in the committee call on the Commission to: (i) undertake an analysis of the effects on competition of unequal relationships between suppliers, namely food producers, and retailers; (ii) consider reviewing the operation of abusive practices in the services sector, which may prevent small businesses from being able to tender for work; (iii) consider conducting a sector inquiry into on-line advertising; (iv) undertake an analysis of possible national differences in the application of public procurement rules.
Mergers : MEPs in the committee welcome the announcement of the launch of a review of the Merger Regulation. They consider that the current provisions are insufficient in view of increasingly integrated and complex European markets and that a review should be undertaken with a view to seeking a consistent approach in the evaluation of comparable merger operations.
State aid : the report welcomes the publication of the General Block Exemption Regulation to cover SMEs, research and development aid in favour of SMEs, aid for employment, training aid, and regional aid. It also welcomes the publication of the revised Community guidelines on State aid for environmental protection and calls call for clarification of the existing competition rules and their practical application in relation to services of general economic interest.
MEPs in the committee call on the Commission to undertake analyses of the effectiveness of State aid and urge that a revision of the scoreboard identify those Member States that have failed to pursue the recovery of illegal State aid adequately.
Sectoral dimension : the report supports the Commission in its endeavours to further develop the European gas and electricity markets. However, it expresses concern at the lack of transparency in the formation of fuel prices in European markets and asks the Commission to ensure proper vigilance over competitive behaviour in those markets. The Commission is also called upon to enforce behavioural constraints on financial institutions in receipt of State aid in order to ensure that such institutions do not engage in aggressive expansion against the background of the guarantee to the detriment of competitors.
Effective implementation : the Commission is called upon to ensure that its Directorate General for Competition has appropriate staff numbers to deal with its rising workload. The Commission should also review the structure of its participation in the International Competition Network and at the European Competition Day in order to ensure that the public is more widely and better informed about the key importance of competition policy.
Lastly, MEPs in the committee continue to support a more proactive role for Parliament in the development of competition policy through the introduction of the co-decision procedure.

Free movement of services
European professional card for service providers
2009-02-12 - 18:33
Charlotte CEDERSCHIÖLD (EPP-ED, SE) for the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection will be putting forward an own-initiative report on the creation of a European professional card for service providers. The report stresses that greater mobility of persons and services between Member States and between regions is an essential element in achieving the Lisbon agenda for growth and jobs. There are still major obstacles for persons wanting to work in another Member State: 20% of complaints received by SOLVIT in 2007 concerned the recognition of professional qualifications required to pursue a regulated profession.
Directive 2005/36/EC states that the introduction, at European level, of professional cards by professional associations or organisations could facilitate the mobility of professionals, in particular by speeding up the exchange of information between the host Member State and the Member State of origin. In its resolution on the impact and consequences of the exclusion of health services from the Directive on services in the internal market, the Parliament called for the setting up of ‘a European card to provide access to information on the skills of health care professionals.
Based on theses facts, the report encourages all initiatives that aim to facilitate cross-border mobility as a means to the efficient functioning of the services and labour markets. In this context, MEPs in the committee call on the Commission to assess the transposition of Directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications and call on the Member States to strive for a more harmonised approach to the recognition of qualifications and competences, to simplify the administrative processes involved and to reduce the costs incurred by professionals.
MEPs in the committee stress that a European professional card could be an advantage even for non-regulated and non-harmonised professions, as it would have an information role particularly for employers and consumers, which would be the case for most liberal professions. They therefore call on the Commission to take stock of different initiatives concerning the development of professional cards and to report to Parliament on a representative inventory.
If there is sufficient demand to develop one, MEPs in the committee consider that a professional card should be as simple, easy and liberal as possible, avoiding any new bureaucratic burdens, and that it could establish a "common language" in the qualifications of certain professions.
In any event, a European professional card should not have a negative effect on cross-border mobility, and should only be used as proof of the right to move without being a condition for such movement. Information on a European professional card should be reliable, validated and updated by the competent national authorities and should comply with the highest standards of the protection of privacy. Where appropriate, information contained in EUROPASS CVs could also be included on the European professional card. Finally, MEPs in the committee consider that the professions themselves should finance the development and implementation of a European professional card, if felt appropriate.

Culture
Community participation in the European Audiovisual Observatory
2009-02-12 - 18:33
Ivo BELET (EPP-ED, BE) for the Committee on Culture and Education will be putting forward an own-initiative report by on Community participation in the European Audiovisual Observatory. It recognises that the Observatory plays a vital role by providing detailed information on the sector to both public and private bodies in the field. The report stresses that multimedia and new technologies will play an ever greater role in the audiovisual sector and that the Observatory must, in due course, strengthen its capacity to follow these new developments in order to continue to play an important role in the sector. MEPs in the committee call on the Observatory, in this respect, to extend its activities to cover more specifically the latest challenges that are created by media convergence and new developments (giving particular attention to the analysis of the impact of digitalisation on the film and audiovisual industry in general and the analysis of online audiovisual services, mobile TV and video games).
MEPs in the committee emphasise that the Observatory must be provided with the resources necessary to continue realising its objectives, thereby effectively keeping step with new developments in multimedia and new technologies.
Towards new tasks: MEPs in the committee welcome the Observatory's publication on copyright and other related rights. They suggest that the Observatory cover these issues systematically and extend its coverage to include the issue of tax and labour law in the audiovisual sector in Europe. They invite the Observatory to provide suggestions and policy options which could serve as a basis for European policy.
In addition, MEPs in the committee recommend that the Observatory should carry out an analysis on developing models of cooperation with partners from third countries. Although MEPs in the committee recognise that whilst some specific areas, such as media literacy, are not currently within the field of activity of the Observatory, exploration of such issues should be envisaged.
MEPs in the committee recognise the cultural differences between Member States which may result in different ways of dealing with harmful or offensive audiovisual material, especially vis-à-vis minors, therefore they recall the need for minimum harmonisation in the field of protection of minors as laid down in the Audiovisual Media Services Directive and the actions taken under the Safer Internet plus programme. In this respect, MEPs in the committee call on the Observatory to monitor the different (legal) instruments and to develop policy options.
Raising awareness and information : MEPs in the committee encourage the wider dissemination of the Observatory’s publications through an intensified communications policy in order to promote awareness of its activities. They encourage the Observatory to provide, in cooperation with its members.

Agriculture
Crop statistics
2009-02-12 - 18:33
Elisabeth JEGGLE (EPP-ED, DE) for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development will be putting forward a legislative report amending the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning crop statistics. The main amendments are as follows:
Purpose of the Regulation : MEPs in the committee wanted the reference to land use to be deleted, given that such information will already be available to the Commission in 2010, 2013 and 2016 pursuant to the Regulation on farm structure surveys and the survey on agricultural production methods and repealing Council Regulation no.571/88.
Definition s: definitions should not be included as part of the Annex but should be included in the main part of the Regulation, more specifically in the article on definitions.
Variables with a low prevalence: Member States shall inform the commission of their definition off low prevalence. MEPs in the committee feel that the Commission and Member States should know when exactly exclusion from the statistics is possible and can be applied.
Precision : precision requirements should not be included in a foot-note as part of the Annex but should be included in the main part of the Regulation. Furthermore it is proposed to raise the variation coefficients from 3 to 4 % in order to keep the costs and administrative burdens for Member States within reasonable limits.
Evaluation of the report's quality: every three years, and for the first time 21 months (rather than 18 months) after the date of application of the Regulation, Member States shall provide the Commission (Eurostat) with a report on the quality of the data transmitted making reference to the quality assessment dimensions.
Comitology : Members consider that the regulatory procedure with scrutiny should be applied to the data covered by the Regulation, the modalities and the structure of the quality reports.
Reduce the burden on respondents : the committee inserts a provision which states that where administrative sources are used, Member States shall inform the Commission in advance about methods used and the quality of data from such sources. Furthermore, consideration shall be given to the principle that additional costs and burdens remain within reasonable limits. Rapporteur Elisabeth JEGGLE EPP-ED DE A6-0472/2009 Agricultural statistics: crop statistics (repeal. Regulations (EEC) No 837/90 and (EEC) No 959/93) Procedure : Codecision (1st reading)

Development and cooperation
A special place for children in EU
2009-02-12 - 18:33
The Committee on Development, in a report by Glenys Kinnock (PES; UK), welcomes the Commission's Communication on “A Special Place for Children in EU External Action” and the accompanying Council Conclusions as "important steps forward towards an EU strategy on the Rights of the Child", but underlines that "much remains to be done to put the political commitments into practice". The Committee report notes that despite the recent positive developments at EU level, the EU institutions and staff resources devoted to children’s rights remain inadequate. MEPs stress that "none of the plans will be realised unless adequate funding is available".
More funding needed
MEPs of the Development Committee believe that the participation of children must be institutionalised and better funded in partner countries and at EU level. They insist that the general budget support of the EU should include funds for capacity- building for relevant ministries (such as Ministries of Welfare, Health, Education and Justice) to ensure that they have the appropriate policies and tools to budget and implement services for children.
Welcoming the Commission's plan to address education in its humanitarian aid operations, the report calls for sufficient funding and staffing at EU level to implement the new policy commitment.
The report also urges Member States to fulfil their pledges "to provide adequate, predictable funding through timetabled budgetary aid designed to meet the 2010 benchmarks".
Agreements with third countries should protect children
Turning to third countries, MEPs stress that children's rights must be systematically included in the EU's political dialogue and policy discussions with partner countries, and all EU policies with a likely effect on children in third countries should be subject to consistent child rights impact assessments prior to their adoption.
They call on the Commission to draw up a report examining whether the existing international agreements between the European Union and third countries already contain a legally binding clause on the protection of children's rights and, if not, whether such a clause could be inserted into agreements.
The Commission and Member States are also asked to support institutional structures in partner countries to protect and promote children’s rights, including independent ombudspersons.
Consumers have the power to limit child labour
Observing that purchasers in the developing world "are in a key position" to "bring direct and effective economic pressure" on organisations that use child labour, MEPs call on the European Community and Member States to provide more support to fair trade and labelling initiatives which encourage companies not to use child labour. It recommends that compliance with voluntary codes of conduct regarding core labour rights should be better controlled and made transparent to European consumers.
MEPs also urge the Commission to propose a uniform method for labelling products imported into the European Union so as to certify that they have been manufactured without the use of child labour at each stage in the chain of production, for example, by placing the indication 'without child labour' on the packaging of the products in question. This would ensure that this system is in line with the WTO's international trade rules.

Thijs BERMAN (PES, NL) for the Committee on Development is proposing an own initiative report by (PES, NL) with recommendations to the Commission on financing of actions other than Official Development Assistance in countries falling under Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 (DCI), calling on the Commission to review this Regulation. Purpose of the new legislation : the new legal framework requested covers all EU activities with third countries under the DCI which do not fulfil ODA criteria, such as cultural, scientific and economic exchange programmes, citizen-to-citizen contacts, or political dialogue. It is also suggested to limit the geographical scope of the requested legislation to those countries covered by DCI.
An adequate budget : MEPs in the committee also state that the future instrument must include an adequate budget. They suggest that the necessary funding be drawn from the share under the DCI earmarked for non-ODA activities in thematic programmes and the funds available under a series of ad hoc budget lines. Given the thematic and geographical breadth of this instrument, those funds should be supplemented initially by recourse to the Flexibility Instrument. Subsequently, in the context of the mid-term review, the Commission should consider sources of more permanent funding of the Multiannual Financial Framework. In any event, the multiannual financing of this new cooperation instrument must be compatible with the 2007-2013 financial framework.

New "European Research Infrastructure" status for research projects of pan-European interest
2009-02-12 - 18:33
New and existing pan-European research projects should be able to become a "European Research Infrastructure" (ERI) - a status which would, for example, make it easier for them to receive funding from several EU Member States. The Industry Committee has amended a Commission proposal for a new regulation on the requirements for research projects to be set up as an ERI. The new regulation aims to facilitate the establishment of pan-European research infrastructures, to be jointly funded by several Member States. Under the new legislation, the European Commission will be able to confer the legal status of a "European Research Infrastructure (ERI)" to research projects submitted by Member States which fulfil certain conditions.
Committee's proposals
The Industry Committee stresses that not only new research projects - as proposed by the Commission - but also already existing European projects should be able to apply for the new status of ERI.
Industry Committee MEPs define a research structure of pan-European interest as "a facility, including resources and related services, which can be used by the scientific community to conduct high level research". This definition covers inter alia:
• major scientific equipment or sets of instruments
• knowledge-based resources such as collections, archives or structured scientific information
• enabling ICT-based infrastructures such as grid, computing, software and communications
Next step
The proposal for a new regulation falls under the consultation procedure. Amendments adopted by Parliament will have to be considered by the Council but are not binding.
