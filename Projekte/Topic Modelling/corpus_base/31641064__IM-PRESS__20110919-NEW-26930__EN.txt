Less horse trading, more transparency for future economic governance
2011-09-22 - 16:56
Parliament will vote on the economic governance "six-pack", which aims to prevent Eurozone members from simply ignoring Commission warnings to correct their budgetary policies and make them tackle economic imbalances more promptly. The package would greatly enhance overall transparency and accountability, and should also improve the quality and accuracy of statistics, by ensuring that they are gathered independently. The deal also includes other improvements sought by European Parliament negotiators, such as EP hearings of finance ministers, new sanctions, and in particular a fine in cases of statistical fraud, empowering the Commission to carry out on-the-spot checks in Member States, and a commitment to look into Eurobonds.
For macroeconomic imbalances, the package includes more refined indicators and the Commission will be required also to consider countries with high current account surpluses, such as Germany, as a source of imbalances.
On the most contentious issue, i.e. reducing horse trading to avoid warnings and sanctions before exceeding the stability and growth pact deficit thresholds, EP negotiators introduced rules whereby Commission decisions would be deemed adopted unless Eurozone Members muster a majority to reject them.
If these Member States were to muster a majority in favour of rejecting a Commission decision, the Council would need to provide a public explanation in the EP.

MEPs to debate Palestine's bid for statehood at the UN
2011-09-22 - 16:56
Parliament votes Thursday on a resolution on developments in Palestine. On Tuesday afternoon, MEPs will debate UN General Assembly work, inter alia on the Middle East peace process and developments in North Africa, with EU foreign policy High Representative Catherine Ashton. When Parliament debated the Middle East peace process on 14 September in Strasbourg, most MEPs agreed that EU's main aim must be to bring Israelis and Palestinians back to the negotiating table to agree on a two-state solution.
However, Parliament was divided on the question of UN recognition of a Palestinian state. Some MEPs argued that any "unilateral step" towards recognising it could hinder the peace process, while others asked to whom the term "unilateral" referred and stressed that recognising Palestine could help to boost talks with Israel.
In a debate with Ms Ashton, MEPs will also discuss tensions between Turkey and Cyprus and the forthcoming Eastern Partnership summit, to take place in Warsaw on 29-30 September.

Boosting trade with the Palestinian Authority
2011-09-22 - 16:56
Parliament votes Tuesday on a trade agreement that aims to boost the Palestinian economy, and help build the Palestinian state, by enabling the Palestinian Territories to export farm and fisheries products to the EU directly, rather than via Israel, from early 2012. The agreement between the EU and the Palestinian Authority, which just needs the EP's consent in order to enter into force early next year, would grant direct duty-free and mostly quota-free access to the EU market for agricultural and fisheries products from the West Bank and Gaza Strip and provide access to Palestinian markets for some European produce.
MEPs say that opening EU markets directly to Palestinian products, which have up to now been under the direct control of the Israeli customs authorities, will help the Palestinians boost trade, expand their economy and build their state.
The Palestinian Authority is at present the EU's smallest trading partner in the Euro-Mediterranean region and one of the smallest worldwide. Total trade amounted to €56.6 million in 2009, of which €50.5 million were EU exports.
Imports to the EU from the Palestinian Authority amounted to €6.1 million in 2009, with agricultural products making up 70.1% of this total. Imports rose, however, by 32.6% in the first three months of 2010.

Future of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund
2011-09-22 - 16:56
MEPs vote Thursday on an Employment and Social Affairs Committee resolution proposing that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) should have a specific budget line, to enable it to provide aid faster to sacked workers. MEPs will also call on the Commission to clarify its plan, presented in its multiannual financial framework proposal, to extend the scope of the EGF in some agricultural sectors.
In a separate resolution, MEPs are to approve without amendment a Commission proposal to extend, until the end of 2013, the possibility of making aid available to a wider group of people who have lost their jobs due to the economic crisis.
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) has been operational since 2007. In May 2009, prompted by the economic crisis, the European Parliament voted to change EGF rules so as to make aid available to wider group of redundant workers. In practice, this meant lowering the eligibility threshold from 1000 to 500 redundancies and widening the scope to include job losses due to the crisis.
The EGF co-finances active labour market measures (for example training and retraining, guidance), to help redundant workers to find new jobs.
Procedure: resolution (future EGF), Co-decision, 1st reading (amendment extending crisis measures)

MEPs to call for action to halve road accident deaths
2011-09-22 - 16:56
Deaths and injuries on Europe's roads could be halved by putting a genuine road safety action plan into effect, says a Transport Committee resolution to be put to a vote on Tuesday. The resolution sets out specific measures which it urges the European Commission to take without delay. MEPs want the Commission to draw up an action plan for 2011-2020 to cut the overall number of road accident deaths by half, deaths of children under 14 by 60%, and serious injuries by 40%.
Rapporteur Dieter-Lebrecht Koch (EPP, DE), proposes protecting pedestrians and cyclists by imposing a 30 km/h (19 mph) speed limit in residential areas and making roads safer for two-wheelers.
The draft resolution urges the European Commission to propose, by 2013, that road signs, highway codes and blood alcohol limits be harmonised throughout the EU. MEPs recommend zero tolerance of alcohol for the first two years for beginners and professional drivers.
Key figures (2009)
Over 35,000 people die in road accidents each year in the EU27
1.5 million people are seriously injured, often with lifelong after effects
The social cost of accidents is estimated at €130 bn per year.

Call to help resettle Libya-Tunisia border refugees
2011-09-22 - 16:56
EU Member States should do more to help resettle refugees from war-torn countries in camps along the Libya-Tunisia border, says an EP delegation which visited Tunisia in July. Further to this visit, MEPs will ask the Commission Wednesday about the progress of talks with EU Member States on how to resettle refugees who cannot go home and how many new places will be pledged for them. The delegation to Tunisia was struck by the weakness of EU Member States' resettlement effort, compared to those of countries such as Canada, the USA and Norway.
In August, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) reported that 4,425 persons refugees who cannot go home were still living in desert camps on the Tunisia-Libya border. For these refugees, the only lasting solution is resettlement (relocation) to third countries.
Resettlement places pledged by EU Member States are currently as follows: Ireland 24, Spain 50, Portugal 19, Sweden 200, Belgium 25, Finland 70 and the Netherlands 20. In stark contrast, Norway has pledged to resettle 310 refugees.

Tourism: MEPs to call for "Europe brand" strategy
2011-09-22 - 16:56
MEPs will call on the Commission to table an EU "integrated tourism strategy" by the end of 2012 and develop a "Europe brand", in a resolution to be put to a vote on Tuesday. Tourism in the EU needs more skilled jobs, high standards of service, and access to internet tools, says the resolution, which calls for innovative co-operation between neighbouring regions to drive sustainable growth.
"The tourism sector in Europe accounts for 10% of GDP and contributes to 12% of total employment. It is of crucial importance for the European Union", said rapporteur Carlo Fidanza (EPP, IT), after the Transport and Tourism Committee vote in June.

Cutback threat to free food scheme for the needy
2011-09-22 - 16:56
MEPs will try to stave off a sharp cutback in the EU's free food scheme, on which 13 million deprived people now rely, in a debate with Council and Commission representatives on Wednesday. Funding for the programme is to be cut from 500 million in 2011 to 113 million in 2012. The scheme for distributing food to the EU's most deprived persons, set up in 1987 under the common agricultural policy (CAP), currently provides food aid for 13 million people in 19 Member States.
Further to an EU Court of Justice ruling of 13 April 2011, the scheme will no longer be able to buy food supplies on the open market and will rely solely on (decreasing) CAP intervention stocks. As a result, funding for the scheme will be cut from €500 million in 2011 to €113 million in 2012.
Efforts to save the scheme have been blocked in the Council of Ministers.
Parliament called in a resolution on 7 July 2011 for a swift transitional solution for the remaining years of the funding period (2012 and 2013).

More money to manage migration and refugee flows
2011-09-22 - 16:56
Parliament is to vote Wednesday for an extra €43.9 million to manage migration and refugee flows stemming from developments in the southern Mediterranean. The money will be used to help the EU Member States most directly affected by migration and refugee flows, and to step up maritime surveillance by the EU border agency Frontex.
Frontex is to get an extra €24 million. The rest is to be added to the EU Refugee Fund (€12.2 million), the External Border Fund (€4.9 million) and the EU Return Fund (2.8 million).
The extra money would come from unspent funds for energy projects under the European Economic Recovery Plan.

MEPs to vote EGF aid for sacked workers in Germany, Denmark, and Portugal
2011-09-22 - 16:56
Parliament is to vote Wednesday on European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) aid totalling €9,741,974 for 1,783 redundant workers in Germany, Denmark and Portugal. Germany has applied for €4,347,868 in EGF aid for 778 workers made redundant by five automotive industry firms in Arnsberg and Düsseldorf.
Denmark has applied for €3,944,606 for 325 workers made redundant by six wind turbine manufacturing firms in Midtjylland.
Portugal has applied for €1,449,500 for 680 workers made redundant by footwear firm Rohde in the municipality of Santa Maria Da Feira.
EGF aid helps redundant workers to find new jobs by covering some training and job-search assistance costs.
The fund's annual ceiling is €500 million. After Parliament's repeated requests that the EGF be given its own budget, the EU's 2011 budget is the first to show payment appropriations of €47,608,950 on the EGF budget line. This was achieved by means of an amending budget.

Improving EU-Taiwan trade relations
2011-09-22 - 16:56
Parliament will debate EU-Taiwan trade relations on Monday, further to a question put by EPP, ALDE and ECR MEPs to Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht. The EU trade strategy stresses the need to capitalise on trade relations with "growth markets", especially in Asia. Yet the EU’s trade and investment relationship with Taiwan has not achieved its full potential, says the question to the Commission.
MEPs ask what measures the EU should take to improve terms of trade and investment with Taiwan, and what the Commission thinks about "the feasibility of launching negotiations on a free trade agreement or a scoping exercise".
Procedure: Oral question to the Commission
Debate: Monday 26 September
Question for oral answer on EU-Taiwan trade

Tackling hunger in developing countries
2011-09-22 - 16:56
The EU and its Member States should put eradicating poverty, hunger and malnutrition at top of their policy agenda, because 925 million people still go hungry. The world food crisis is not just a humanitarian disaster, but also a major threat to peace and security, argues a resolution to be put to a vote on Tuesday. Commenting on two March 2011 Commission papers on food security and world hunger, MEPs will point out that 925 million people are still going hungry in the world.
Although this is down slightly from the 2009 figure of 1,023 million, it is still over a million more than the 815 million starving in 2008, the year of the global food crisis.
If we are to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015, the EU must have a clear and coherent policy framework, focusing on human rights and looking at the impact of EU policies on global food security, MEPs will say.
Procedure: Non-legislative resolution
