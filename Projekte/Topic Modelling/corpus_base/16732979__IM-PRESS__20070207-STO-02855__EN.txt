Efforts to deal with climate change and energy security were just two issues discussed when MEPs and MPs met in Brussels on 5-6 February. They were holding a Joint Parliamentary Meeting to discuss the EU's decade-long jobs and growth policy - the "Lisbon strategy". The President of the European Parliament - Hans-Gert Poettering - and the President of the Commission - José Manuel Barroso - were also present.
The meeting was divided into three working groups covering sustainable energy, the internal market and human capital issues such as education. These groups then reported back to the plenary of the meeting.
Sustainable energy
Jürgen Trittin of the German Bundestag reported that there was broad consensus across a wide range of issues.
In particular the fact that the EU still lacks an internal market for energy was noted as a cause for concern. He noted that on climate change there is an urgent need to act to reduce CO2 emissions. The EU's stated aim is a 20% increase in renewable energy by 2020.
This group also pointed out that half of the current EU members had not yet met the targets set out in the Kyoto protocol.
Internal Market
According to a report by European People's Party member Malcolm Harbour the EU should focus on three priorities:
Greater research - especially more University business cooperation.
Support small and medium size businesses
Encourage the free movement of people around the EU - the current restrictions in place were roundly criticised. Implementing the Services Directive would be a major step forward in this direction Mr Harbour said.
Human capital: education, jobs
Some of the recommendations from this group were reported by Maria Manuel Oliveira from Portugal's Assembleia da República. They include:
Fighting discrimination
Investing in lifelong learning.
Promoting social cohesion.
Ensuring tax policy promote competitiveness.
Closer cooperation between employers and their employees.
During the two day debate President Poettering called for action at all levels, local, national and European. He told the meeting that "we have only just agreed on the piece of music the orchestra is supposed to play: there is still a long way to go to achieve the ultimate goal".
The President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso said that the EU must develop a common line on energy - not 27 different ones.
