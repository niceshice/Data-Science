- co-financing (up to 50% of the total cost) of actions of a national scale with a strong European dimension;
- actions on a Community scale, including information and promotion activities and surveys, studies and consultation with national networks and civil society stakeholders to access the preparation for and impact of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
