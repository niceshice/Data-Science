Problems of getting younger, older people into employment
Emilie Turunen and Roger Helmer EU's active population will shrink from 2013/2014 2 million more people a year over 60 - increasing twice as fast as in 2007 Rising life expectancy and falling birth rates mean potential future problems for European countries. How to pay for pensions and future health care are just two issues that MEPs will debate Wednesday when they consider a report by German centre right member Thomas Mann. He is urging more steps to get younger and older people into employment. We spoke to Danish Green Emilie Turunen (26) and British conservative Roger Helmer (66) about the issues raised by this report
Young people say that it is difficult to enter the labour market because the positions are already filled by older people. How do we reconcile the goal of keeping older people in the labour market longer?
Emilie Turunen: There is a belief that if we make old people leave, if we retire them early, then we make space for young people. There is no real logic behind this. We can see it and that's why we need to think more broadly. Right now it is the structural unemployment crisis we need to tackle.
How can the European economy realistically improve employment at both ends of the age spectrum?
Roger Helmer : I am not sure that "Europe" will help at all. Member states need to promote youth employment by raising standards of education, and especially vocational education.
Emilie Turunen: In Europe right now there's only discussion about the pension age. That's too narrow to resolve the problem. We need much broader discussion on working conditions, flexible arrangements, and differentiation between groups. For older people it is very much a question of a flexible working life - you don't have to work full-time or not at all. You have to find flexible retirement schemes to slow down your working life so you can let it continue a bit longer.
Longer working lives and lower pensions are usually seen as the only answer to the demographic and budgetary challenges facing Europe. Do you have another model for dealing with the situation?
Roger Helmer: Pensions, longer working lives and a later retirement age will certainly be part of the solution. There is one way that Europe could help, and that is by a radical deregulation of labour markets, coupled with an initiative for lower taxes. Unfortunately, the whole ethos of the EU runs in the opposite direction, and years of work by the parliament's Unemployment Committee have raised unit labour costs, reduced competitiveness, increased unemployment and made labour markets less flexible.
Europe's future job market
15-24 age group has lowest work rates
Half of 55-64 year olds are not in work
By 2020 the total number of people in work will fall by 3 million
There will be more ‘older workers’ (55-64), more retired people (65-79) and more old people (aged 80-plus)

Opening of Brussels plenary session: support for Russian journalist Oleg Kashin
MEPs gather at the hemicycle chamber for the opening of November plenary session in Brussels Buzek condemns the brutal beating of Russian journalist Oleg Kashin Condemnation of attacks on worshippers at the Baghdad Syriac Catholic cathedral At the opening of today's plenary session in Brussels, Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek voiced support for Russian journalist Oleg Kashin, brutally beaten by unknown assailants in Moscow on 6 November, welcomed the 31 October opposition rally in Moscow, condemned attacks 10 days ago on Christians worshipping in Baghdad, and deplored Chinese pressure on EU Member States not to attend the Nobel Prize award ceremony in Stockholm on 4 December.
Mr Buzek condemned the brutal beating of Russian journalist Oleg Kashin on 6 November, and praised the rapid response and personal commitment of President Dmitry Medvedev to finding the perpetrators.
He then welcomed the 31 October opposition rally in Moscow, as a sign that Parliament's appeals for democratisation are beginning to take effect.
The President condemned the 31 October attacks on worshippers at the Baghdad Syriac Catholic cathedral, which caused deaths and injuries. He called on everyone to respect freedom of worship, and deplored violence committed on religious grounds.
Lastly, Mr Buzek condemned the pressure being put on EU Member States by China not to attend the Nobel Prize award ceremony in Stockholm on 4 December. "Parliament strives to see inviolable human rights respected everywhere, including China", said the President, adding that the EU will be represented in Stockholm by the head of its Norway delegation.

Final draft agenda
Parliament ushers in new EU rules for hedge funds and private equity
Rapporteur Jean-Paul Gauzès is pictured during the vote of his report on hedge funds Imposes registration, reporting and initial capital requirements on these funds. Parliament successfully pushed through chapters on asset stripping and remuneration principles New EU-wide rules on the marketing of alternative investment funds overcame the final hurdle on Thursday when the European Parliament adopted the directive which will impose registration, reporting and initial capital requirements on these funds. Parliament successfully pushed through chapters on asset stripping and remuneration principles, as well as strongly influencing the rules on the passport system, depositary liability, capital requirements and the use of leverage.
The EP, under the leadership of French MEP Jean-Paul Gauzès (EPP), won concessions from Member States in a number of areas aimed at increasing economic stability and investor security, the two key priorities for Parliament all throughout the process. The legislation introduces pay rules and restrictions on asset stripping, points that were both initially not dealt with by the Commission proposal and strongly resisted by Member States.
The EP - which approved the directive today by 513 votes to 92 with 3 abstentions - also successfully pushed for strict liability of depositaries, who are key players in the running of these funds, to ensure that damages can always be claimed by the investors.
Special attention to asset stripping by private equity funds
Parliament insisted from the outset on the need to combat asset stripping, which was not covered by the Commission proposal and the inclusion of which was resisted by Member States during negotiations. The directive now includes a number of provisions to this end, relating primarily to limits on distributions and capital reductions within the first two years that a company is taken over by a private equity investor. This is intended to deter private equity investors from attempting to take control of a company solely in order to make a quick profit.
Thanks to Parliament, strong information and disclosure requirements are to be imposed on private equity investors, particularly regarding information for shareholders, employees and their representatives on the planned strategy for the company.
Depositary liability
Depositary liability has been increased in comparison to the initial positions of Council and the Commission to prevent further Madoff-style scandals. The directive requires that if a depositary legally delegates its tasks to others, it must provide a contract which allows the fund or the fund manager to claim damages against the entity to which the tasks are delegated. This should ensure that at no point in the chain will liability be irretrievably lost. MEPs also secured a requirement that the AIF investors concerned must be informed about the potential delegation of liability and the reasons for this.
Marketing passport for everyone without a free-for-all culture
Today's agreement will enable non-EU AIF and AIF managers to market to investors across the EU without first having to seek permission from each Member State and comply with different national laws. This was a bone of contention between Parliament and some Member States, with Parliament pushing for a marketing passport to be granted to non-EU players. Parliament allayed these Member States' fears by proposing the provisions now in the text whereby AIF and AIF managers will obtain passports only if the non-EU country they are located in meets minimum regulatory standards and has agreements in place with Member States to allow information sharing.
Next steps
The directive's rules are to take effect by 2013, and four years after this the Commission will undertake a general review of the rules. ESMA and the Commission will also have the considerable task of fleshing out the details of how the directive works, through guidelines and implementing legislation.

Parliament signals its priorities for EU-US summit
MEPs debate upcoming EU-US summit with Commissioners Viviane Reding and Karel De Gucht. EU governments were represented by Stefaan De Clerck of the Belgian government (below). MEPs agreed their recommendations on issues such as economic co-operation, personal data protection State of EU-US trade relations amid the economic crisis is a key issue Ahead of the EU-US summit on 20 November, MEPs agreed their recommendations on positions the Council should take regarding key transatlantic issues such as economic co-operation, personal data protection, the introduction of a US travel fee and recent leaks of US classified military documents on Iraq.
The state of EU-US trade relations amid the economic crisis is a key issue for MEPs with a view to the next meeting of the Transatlantic Economic Council. Parliament restates its support for a barrier-free transatlantic market by 2015 but voices concern about differing rules on novel foods, genetically modified products and animal cloning, and stresses the need for US authorities to accept metric-only labelling of EU products.
The adoption of a joint EU-US action strategy for the protection of intellectual property rights, including negotiations on an Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), is another important demand of the resolution, which was adopted by show of hands.
Torture in Iraq
The controversial disclosure by Wikileaks of US military information on alleged torture in Iraq gave rise to several impassioned speeches in Wednesday's debate ahead of today's vote.
The resolution calls for a transatlantic inquiry, saying that Parliament, "although aware that the leaking of classified military documents runs the risk of bringing military personnel in danger, is highly concerned over the recent serious allegations that torture has been condoned in Iraq". It "calls for this issue to be raised in the context of the EU-US summit with a view to an independent transatlantic inquiry".
US travel fee
MEPs express "serious concern" at the US Travel Promotion Act "and its discriminatory effect in applying only to travellers under the US visa waiver programme, as well as data protection concerns that it can only be paid with one of the four major credit cards, whose companies are all based inside the US". Since January, EU citizens from Member States that are part of the US Visa Waiver programme have to pay 14 dollars to travel to the US.
The EU, US... and the rest of the world
Parliament also lists its priorities on EU-US international relations, including the fight against global terrorism, the latest Middle East negotiations and the threat of nuclear weapons.
Regarding the Israel-Palestinian conflict, MEPs welcome the new US approach to Israel. They say that further talks are needed and should lead "within an agreed time-frame, to a two-state solution with the state of Israel and an independent, democratic and viable State of Palestine". The Israeli government is urged to renew the moratorium on settlement building.
A call to "explore less intrusive alternatives" than collection of PNR data
Personal data protection has been a difficult area for EU-US relations recently, as in the case of the agreement on banking data transfers (Swift report). A general EU-US data protection agreement is now under discussion, as is a new agreement on the sharing of passenger flight data (PNR). Parliament will have a right of veto on both accords.
In a separate resolution on this subject, tabled by the EPP, S&D, ALDE, Greens/EFA, ECR and GUE/NGL groups, Parliament stresses that PNR data should in no circumstances be used for data mining or profiling.
MEPs reiterate their call to the Commission to provide factual evidence that the collection, storage and processing of PNR data is necessary" in this respect. They also call on the Commission to "explore less intrusive alternatives".
MEPs stressed that PNR data should in no circumstances be used for data mining or profiling.

Unspent EU money to fund clean and efficient energy projects
Energy system on the roof of Wissenschaftpark, Gelsenkirchen Emscher Park, IBA, Ruhr, Germany Renovations of public and private buildings to improve energy efficiency Clean urban public transport solutions, particularly electric and hydrogen vehicles Parliament voted on Thursday in favour of plans to release €146 million of unused EU funds to finance energy saving, energy efficiency and renewable energy projects.
Amended legislation on the European Energy Recovery Plan (EERP) will channel the unspent money into a new fund, to finance projects such as:
renovations of public and private buildings to improve energy efficiency or switching to renewable energy;
the construction of renewables-based heat-and-power installations, with distribution networks, and their integration into electricity grids;
clean urban public transport solutions, particularly electric and hydrogen vehicles;
local infrastructure, including efficient street lighting, electricity storage, smart metering and smart grids.
The fund will focus chiefly on helping local and regional authorities to pay for such projects, which must be economically and financially viable, so as to refund the investment in due course. A total of €146.34 million will be available from 1 January 2011 and must be allocated by 31 March 2014.
Contributions from the fund could take the form of loans, guarantees, equity or other financial products. Up to 15% of the funding may be used to provide technical assistance to public authorities to help set up the projects. Geographical balance is to be an important criterion in the selection of projects.
Parliament adopted the amended legislation by 582 votes to 27 with 7 abstentions.
Background
The EERP, which was launched in 2009, aims to boost economic recovery by funding energy projects such as cross-border gas and electricity inter-connectors, offshore wind parks, and Carbon Capture and Storage projects (CCS). In 2010 a total of €3.98 billion was earmarked for such plans.
Parliament sought to include energy efficiency and renewable energy in the EERP when it was first proposed. The European Commission has promised to consider this at a later stage, using funds unspent by the end of 2010. The amended regulation provides a legal base to do this, otherwise the money would go back to national budgets.
Next steps
Legislation still has to be formally approved by the Council before the end of the year. Due to the urgent need to address the economic crisis, it should enter into force immediately on publication.

Cereal price hike: MEPs debate resulting crisis in EU livestock sector
Cereals account for 60% of production costs with high prices leaving Europe's farmers facing a crisis ©BELGA Cereals hit 2 year high due to speculation / bad weather MEPs fearful of effect on Europe's livestock farmers MEPs back strong call to European Commission to curtail speculation What would happen if farmers could no longer afford to feed their animals? With EU cereal prices at a two-year high due to bad weather and speculation we could face a significant drop in meat production. On Thursday MEPs debated what action the EU can take with Agriculture Commissioner Dacian Cioloș and adopted a resolution calling on the Commission to ensure that the impact of speculation across the agricultural sector will be limited.
Northern Irish MEP James Nicholson (EPP) explained "the livestock sector is experiencing difficulties due to a range of factors: rising production costs, competition from imports and rising feed costs". Cereals rise 50% in 2 months Spanish Socialist Iratxe García Pérez said cereals account for 60% of production costs and have risen 50% over the last 2 months because of speculation. Many MEPs welcomed the recent Commission decision to release cereals from storage to keep feed material prices down and help livestock farmers. Mr Ciolos told Parliament that "the tension had been taken out of the market" after the cereal intervention measure was announced. He went on to say that said the problem does not stem from a shortage but from speculation, which he said the Commission intended to tackle. He said that the forthcoming reform of the Common Agriculture Policy would include a new mechanism for income volatility. Mr Nicholson expressed his fears about the security of food supplies in Europe as we are "too dependent on 3rd countries". Several MEPs criticized the imbalance created by the high standards for EU farmers versus standards applied to imported meat. "Animal welfare standards must be required for products coming to our markets" said Polish MEP Janusz Wojciechowski (ECR). Price disparity: "Crisis is going to destroy farmers in Europe" During the debate several MEP brought up the issue of prices at the farm gate and those paid by consumers. Irish MEP Liam Aylward (ALDE) said that "the Commission must put in place measures to close the gap between prices paid by consumers and prices received by producers". Romanian MEP Rareş-Lucian Niculescu ( EPP) criticised the high margins that "end up in the hands of the distributors". French Green MEP José Bové commented that "farmers have to survive on €700-800 per month. Consumers pay €17 per kg for steak in the supermarket, but for the same product farmers are paid just €3 per kg. Is that fair?" He added: "This crisis is going to destroy farmers in Europe". *** The debate followed an oral question from MEPs from the European People's Party, the Socialist and Democrats and the Europe of Conservatives and Reformists Groups in the European Parliament.
