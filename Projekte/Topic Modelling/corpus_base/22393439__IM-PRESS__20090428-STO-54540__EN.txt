"Una mera cuestión de fe/Just a matter of faith" is our monthly chosen photograph © Carlos Cazurro/ Una mera cuestión de fe / www.cazurro.com In the hamlet of Tiedra just outside Valladolid in Spain, a women hangs a "exvotos" to the Virgin Mary for helping her son pass his university exams. Captured by Carlos Cazzuro this is April's guest photograph. The theme was "multicultural Europe" and we found his portrait of this ancient rite of faith a worthy choice. "A matter of faith" is one of the many photos sent to us which can now be seen on our flickr page. Ahead of June's European elections, the next subject is "on the way to vote".
This Catholic tradition was caught on polaroid by Carlos Cazzuro, a 33 year old living in Valladolid in north central Spain who has exhibited widely in his native land, Portugal and Brazil and whose twin passions are travelling and photography which complement one another.
"Exvotos" - deeply rooted in Spanish villages
Exvotos are a traditional way of paying homage to the Virgin Mary across Spain, they can be
statues, pictures, paintings that symbolise what the person has prayed for.
Describing the photo Carlos explained: "Nowadays with the situation we are facing, lots of people are relying on Saints. The traditions of the exvotos - promises to the Virgin Mary or to another Saint which have been fulfilled - are still deeply rooted in Spanish villages. In the case of Tiedra the exvotos are photos that are hung on one of the chapel's walls."
