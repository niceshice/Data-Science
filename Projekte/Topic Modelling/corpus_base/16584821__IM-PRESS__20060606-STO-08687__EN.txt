Transfer of passenger data illegal says Court
Fundamental rights
2006-06-07 - 11:33
A personal mark, but who should have access to it?
The European Court of Justice has judged any authorization to transfer air passenger information to the American authorities given by the Commission and Council to be illegal. An agreement on this issue was signed between the United States and the EU in the name of combating terrorism but it was clearly in contradiction with the law. The Court’s judgement ruled in favour of the criticism expressed by the European Parliament but it does not solve all of the problems.
You like vegetarian meals. You don’t give out your credit card number to just anybody, not even your friends and family. And you don’t distribute your e-mail address zozo@intime.com left, right and centre. You might think you choose when and how this information is used, but you are wrong. You are on file. At least, that is, if you get on a plane bound for the United States. In fact, a quarter of an hour before your take off, 34 categories of your personal information are communicated by your airline company to the American authorities.
Safety and fundamental rights are not diametrically opposed
In accordance with an agreement between the United States and the EU on the treatment and transfer of information held by airline companies located in the Member States, which concerns their passengers travelling to the other side of the Atlantic, it is possible to transmit this information. The agreement was signed on 17 May 2004 following decisions made by the Commission and the Council, but against the advice of the European Parliament. The MEPs, however, have decided to defend the civil liberties of passengers, who they believe are being violated by this agreement. In fact, according to EU legislation, citizens’ personal information should only be made available to third countries in exceptional situations and to guarantee they are effectively protected. The MEPs have underlined that it is possible to ensure passenger safety and combat terrorism without flouting civil rights, and this has been proven by an agreement entered into between the EU and Canada and measures that have been applied in Australia.
The Parliament has limited room for manoeuvre
The Parliament has already given its opinion on the issue but, in accordance with the treaties, decisions relating to justice and home affairs are made by the governments, together with the European Commission. As this is not a question of a supranational or community jurisdiction, the Parliament’s role is simply to act in an advisory capacity. In this situation, due to the lack of cooperation between the institutions, the Parliament decided to bring the case before the European Court of Justice in September 2004.
Legal tangle?
The Parliament’s appeal was effective: the Court invalidated the decisions of the Commission and the Council, considering the legal basis of these decisions to be inappropriate. But in this case, the law has nothing more to pronounce on the merits of the case which, for formal reasons has become null and void. The agreement, however, remains in force until 30 September. A series of questions remain unanswered: Is a new agreement necessary? What would be its legal basis? How will the cooperation between the institutions be organized? Watch this space.
