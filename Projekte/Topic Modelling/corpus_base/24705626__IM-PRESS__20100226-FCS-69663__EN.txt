MEPs voting in the Chamber in Strasbourg. In the foreground is a seating plan During the Parliamentary sitting on Monday to Thursday (8-11 March) one of the main issues was a debate on EU foreign and security policy Wednesday morning. In addition the House called for an independent investigation on alleged human rights breaches in the Gaza conflict when they voted on the findings of the UN fact-finding mission. There was also good news for small businesses when MEPs supported exempting very small companies from drawing up annual accounts. Follow the week's news here.
These are just a few of the issues being debated during the week. Read our focus to catch up with what happens each day in Plenary.
Opening of the Strasbourg session by President Jerzy Buzek
At the opening of this week's Strasbourg plenary session, European Parliament President Jerzy Buzek expressed sorrow for the victims of the earthquakes in Turkey, Chile and Haiti as well as the storms in France. He also congratulated Lithuania and Estonia on the 20th anniversaries of their independence (11 March) and, referring to the 51st anniversary of the Tibetan uprising, called on China to engage in dialogue with the people of Tibet.
Gaza conflict: implementing the Goldstone recommendations
Respect for human rights by all parties to the Gaza conflict, independent investigations of alleged violations of human rights, a strong EU common position on the follow-up of the Goldstone report and close monitoring of its implementing measures are Parliament's key demands in a resolution adopted on Wednesday.
EU2020: no EU funding without progress on aims, say MEPs
The EU2020 strategy should focus on reducing unemployment, better co-ordinating economic policies, and beefing up economic governance with binding rules, said Parliament on Wednesday. MEPs stressed that EU funding EU funding should be conditional on results and compatibility with the aims of the strategy.
With GDP 4% down and unemployment at over 23 million, the EU2020 strategy must provide an effective response to the economic and financial crisis, argue MEPs in a resolution adopted on Wednesday by 462 votes to 140, with 58 abstentions.
Strengthening the democratic legitimacy of EU foreign and security policy
MEPs believe the EU must enhance its strategic autonomy and conduct a strong and effective foreign, security and defence policy, and mean to use their budgetary power and democratic right to scrutinise these policies, including funding for the EU external action service, say two resolutions adopted on Wednesday 10 March.
MEPs stress the need to increase the democratic legitimacy of common foreign and security policy (CFSP) to comply with the Lisbon Treaty, e.g. by systematically consulting Parliament before common security and defence policy (CSDP) missions are launched.
What shape for a financial transaction tax?
Plans should be developed for a global tax to discourage excessive risk-taking by financial institutions and ensure that the financial industry pays for the damage caused by the financial crisis, says Parliament in a resolution approved on Wednesday. If a worldwide tax proves unachievable, the EU could consider the option of going it alone, add MEPs.
Reducing red tape for small firms
Very small companies could be exempted from having to draw up annual accounts, after MEPs approved changes to EU accounting rules in Strasbourg on Wednesday. It would be up to each Member State to grant such exemptions, depending on the impact the directive would have in that country. Companies would in any case still have to keep records of their business transactions and financial situation.
Pay gap between men and women
The continuing pay gap between men and women in the EU, violence against women and more female MEPs were some of the issues raised in the Parliament during International Women's Day on Monday. Several MEPs also criticised the fact that Commission presented a new plan how to reach gender equality in the next 5 years but did not discuss it with NGOs or the public.
Post Copenhagen deal in spotlight
The post Copenhagen climate deal was debated by MEPs Tuesday afternoon with Europe's climate Commissioner Connie Hedegaard outlining the way forward. She argued for the EU to maintain momentum ahead of the next climate conference in Mexico at the end of the year and push for a legally binding deal.
Solidarity Fund for disasters?
The need to think about reforestation, land use and managing water through dykes are just two things MEPs want governments to take action on in the wake of recent natural disasters. Floods in Portuguese Madeira and storm Xynthia in Europe this year have claimed scores of lives. Natural calamities were debated Thursday morning (11 March). Recent earthquakes in Chile and Turkey have also brought emergency responses into focus.

Gaza conflict: implementing the Goldstone recommendations
An Israeli shell or bomb explodes on a target in the southern Gaza Strip town of Rafah on 13 January 2009. ©BELGA/EPA/ABED RAHIM KHATIB Respect for human rights by all parties to the Gaza conflict, independent investigations of alleged violations of human rights, a strong EU common position on the follow-up of the Goldstone report and close monitoring of its implementing measures are Parliament's key demands in a resolution adopted on Wednesday.
All parties should respect human rights
"Respect for international humanitarian law and international human rights law by all parties under all circumstances and trust-building between Israelis and Palestinians are essential components of a peace process leading to two states living side by side in peace and security" says the resolution, which stresses "once again the importance of achieving a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, and between Israelis and Palestinians in particular".
Independent and impartial investigations within the next five months
The European Parliament "urges both sides to conduct investigations within five months that meet international standards of independence, impartiality, transparency, promptness and effectiveness." This is in line with the UN General Assembly resolution adopted on 26 February, which requests a further report, as the recent report of the UN Secretary General was "inconclusive on investigations into possible violations of international law during the deadly 2008/2009 conflict in Gaza."
Implementing and monitoring the Goldstone recommendations
The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and EU Member States should work towards a strong EU common position on the follow-up to the Fact-Finding Mission report on the conflict in Gaza and southern Israel, says the resolution.
They should also publicly "demand the implementation of its recommendations and accountability for all violations of international law, including alleged war crimes, and urge both sides to conduct investigations that meet international standards of independence, impartiality, transparency, promptness and effectiveness", it adds.
Furthermore, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Member States should "monitor actively the implementation of recommendations included in the Goldstone Report by consulting the EU's external missions and NGOs working in the field", it says.
No restriction of NGO activities
MEPs stress the importance of co-operation between official authorities and NGOs, and are concerned about "the pressure placed on NGOs involved in the preparation of the Goldstone report and in follow-up investigations". They call on authorities on all sides "to refrain from any measures restricting the activities of these organisations".
Finally, Parliament welcomes the Council's 8 December 2009 call for "an immediate, sustained and unconditional opening of crossings" along the Gaza-Israel frontier as the blockade has further worsened the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip.
The resolution was approved with 335 votes in favour, 287 against and 43 abstentions.
EU2020: no EU funding without progress on aims, say MEPs
MEPs in Strasbourg voting on the Europe2020 plans The EU2020 strategy should focus on reducing unemployment, better co-ordinating economic policies, and beefing up economic governance with binding rules, said Parliament on Wednesday. MEPs stressed that EU funding EU funding should be conditional on results and compatibility with the aims of the strategy.
With GDP 4% down and unemployment at over 23 million, the EU2020 strategy must provide an effective response to the economic and financial crisis, argue MEPs in a resolution adopted on Wednesday by 462 votes to 140, with 58 abstentions.
Parliament asks the Commission to propose new measures, and possibly sanctions, to deal with Member States that do not implement the EU2020 Strategy and incentives for those that do so. The resolution also says that " EU funding to achieve the various EU2020 objectives should be conditional on results and compatibility with the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy ".
Stronger EU governance
Parliament welcomes Council decisions to set fewer targets but to make them clearer, more realistic and quantifiable. MEPs also stress Parliament's key role and prerogatives in implementing the strategy. The resolution suggests that the EU institutions draw up a binding agreement to prevent the Council acting unilaterally.
The Lisbon Strategy failed due to the absence of efficient incentives and binding instruments at EU level, note MEPs. For this reason they urge the European Council to abandon the "open coordination method" based on the "exchange of best practices" and to use the Lisbon Treaty to coordinate better the economic reforms and action plans of Member States.
Unemployment: a core issue
Unemployment is now the core issue in discussion of the crisis, MEPs say. To combat high and growing unemployment, the EU must implement its ambitious social agenda, which includes fighting poverty, discrimination and social exclusion, keeping people at school longer and promoting lifelong learning, they add.
Youth unemployment needs to be tackled by providing more training possibilities and internships and the Commission is urged to table a strategy to this end.
Better co-ordinating economic policies
Parliament also says that the mutual coherence of EU economic strategies, such as the Sustainable Development Strategy and the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), needs to be improved Budgetary consolidation and economic policies must be closely co-ordinated to generate growth and jobs and ensure the Euro's future stability. MEPs regret the absence of mechanisms to safeguard the Euro's stability, They also stress the need for a strong EU supervisory structure for all financial institutions.
The Council and Commission should table proposals to complete the single market and the Commission should do more to promote small and medium-sized enterprises, since it is they who create most jobs, adds the resolution.
Finally Parliament says the EU's current budget is not geared to tackling 21st century challenges, and urges the Commission to retain the target of investing 3% of GDP in R&D.
Strengthening the democratic legitimacy of EU foreign and security policy
Reports by Arnaud Danjean (top) & Gabriele Albertini were among the issues debated with Catherine Ashton Wedesday morning. MEPs believe the EU must enhance its strategic autonomy and conduct a strong and effective foreign, security and defence policy, and mean to use their budgetary power and democratic right to scrutinise these policies, including funding for the EU external action service, say two resolutions adopted on Wednesday 10 March.
MEPs stress the need to increase the democratic legitimacy of common foreign and security policy (CFSP) to comply with the Lisbon Treaty, e.g. by systematically consulting Parliament before common security and defence policy (CSDP) missions are launched.
These views are set out in a report - drafted by Gabriele Albertini (EPP, IT), and adopted on Wednesday with 592 in favour, 66 against and 11 abstentions - on the Council report on CFSP activities in 2008, an assessment on the EU's foreign and security policy around the world.
EU Special Representatives
Parliament calls for greater parliamentary scrutiny of the appointment and the evaluation of EU Special Representatives (EUSRs), underlining the need for gender balance. It adds that Parliament's relevant committee should be consulted about appointments the High Representative will make to senior posts in the European External Action Service and certain EUSRs and Heads of Delegation should appear before the committee on their appointment.
Review inter-institutional agreements
As Parliament now has greater budgetary powers, MEPs call for a review and extension of inter-institutional agreements, to ensure harmonious implementation of budgetary and consultation procedures for the CFSP and the CSDP. Parliament should also have better access to sensitive information (classified as top secret, secret or confidential), they add.
Extra funding needed
MEPs are concerned about underfunding of EU budget Heading IV ("The EU as a global player") and hence the EU's ability to conduct a "credible and proactive" foreign policy. The EU needs extra funding to meet "unforeseen global challenges", they believe. They ask to be consulted on the procedures for urgent financing of CFSP initiatives.
CSDP
The other resolution, drawn up by Security and Defence Sub-Committee chair Arnaud Danjean (EPP, FR), looks at how the Lisbon Treaty will affect the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). This report, which calls for enhanced strategic autonomy of the EU, was approved with 480 votes in favour, 11 against and 64 abstentions.
Permanent operations centre
MEPs backed the idea of setting up a Council of EU defence ministers within the Foreign Affairs Council, and called for a permanent EU operations centre to be established under the supervision of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs. Parliament also recommended setting up a new European External Action Academy.
US anti-missile shield
The proposed US anti-missile system "should take account of a common European approach to protecting Europe against ballistic threats", and must be developed "in a dialogue on a continental scale", "with efforts being made to involve the European defence industry in its development", say MEPs.
With regard to Iran and North Korea, MEPs point out that the Union has "undertaken to use every means at its disposal to prevent, deter, halt and, where possible, eliminate proliferation programmes". Parliament urges the Council and the Commission to significantly increase resources for civilian engagements in Afghanistan.
Faster deployment of EU missions
MEPs want to see further progress in the rapid deployment of CSDP missions and EU forces, including the establishment of a European air transport fleet, a new generation of observation satellites, and a maritime surveillance system. Finally, Parliament also calls for better intelligence to be provided to EU military teams.
What shape for a financial transaction tax?
The resolution was approved with 536 votes in favour, 80 against and 33 abstentions. ©BELGA//magebroker/Creativ Studio Heinemann Plans should be developed for a global tax to discourage excessive risk-taking by financial institutions and ensure that the financial industry pays for the damage caused by the financial crisis, says Parliament in a resolution approved on Wednesday. If a worldwide tax proves unachievable, the EU could consider the option of going it alone, add MEPs.
Parliament asks the Commission to develop the transaction tax plan in time for the EU to present a common position to present to the G20 in June. The Commission is also asked to assess how such a tax could help stabilise financial markets and prevent a similar crisis by targeting "undesirable" transactions, which should be specifically identified by the Commission, says the resolution.
The Commission and Council are urged to look at how the tax could be used to finance development co-operation and help developing countries to combat climate change, as well as at how the tax could contribute to the EU budget.
While preferring a global approach through the G20, MEPs believe that the pros and cons of introducing a purely EU-wide tax should be weighed up, even if the EU's main partners do not introduce such a tax.
Any such tax must not harm the banking system's ability to perform its vital role of financing real economy investments, and must not encourage the migration of capital, the resolution stresses. Negative repercussions on small businesses and individual investors must be avoided, it adds.
This resolution is not advocating one model or another, but aims to launch work on many questions that need answering, said Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee MEP Edward Scicluna (S&D, MT), in a debate with the European Commission on Monday, adding that "there are as many advocates for this tax as there are detractors", and impact assessments would be needed.
Replying for the Commission, Algirdas Semeta said it believed that the issue is best tackled at global level, since this is the only way to prevent capital flight. He also said that the Commission was considering regulating the financial industry by means of such a tax and that without a well-defined distributive mechanism, the revenue generated could well end up in those few countries with large financial centres.
The resolution on a financial transaction tax was approved with 536 votes in favour, 80 against and 33 abstentions.
Reducing red tape for small firms
Small businesses could be exempted from tax returns ©BELGA/WESTEND61 Very small companies could be exempted from having to draw up annual accounts, after MEPs approved changes to EU accounting rules in Strasbourg on Wednesday. It would be up to each Member State to grant such exemptions, depending on the impact the directive would have in that country. Companies would in any case still have to keep records of their business transactions and financial situation.
In the legislative resolution, approved by 445 votes in favour, 196 against and 21 abstentions, the EP also calls for a general revision of the 4th and 7th Company Law Directives in 2010.
5.4 million "micro-entities"
About 7.2 million EU companies are subject to reporting rules under EU accounting directives. Some 5.4 million (around 75%) of these are "micro-entities", for example flower shops or local bakers. They are primarily engaged in business at local or regional level, with little or no cross-border activity. This proposal would allow Member States to simplify the business environment for micro-companies by waiving the usual reporting requirements, thus boosting their competitiveness and growth potential.
"The reach of micro-entities’ business is generally confined to the regional and local market. To that extent they have no cross-border impact on the single European market, and the logical conclusion, therefore, is that they need not be bound by EU-wide internal market regulations", said the rapporteur, Klaus-Heiner Lehne (EPP, DE).
The exemption from having to draw up annual accounts would apply to companies that meet two of the following criteria: balance sheet total under €500,000, net turnover under €1,000,000 and/or average of 10 employees during the financial year.
In its report, the European Parliament argues that Member States should have a free choice of whether or not to exempt micro-entities, "taking account in particular of the situation at national level regarding the number of businesses covered" under these threshold values.
To address concerns that an exemption from accounting duties could hamper internal organisation and reduce transparency and access to information, the EP made it clear that micro-entities must still be subject to the obligation to keep records that show the company’s business transactions and financial situation, "as a minimum standard".
During the debate the rapporteur stressed that the proposal remained blocked in the Council. He called for the blocking minority to "rethink its position".
How much could be saved?
A study cited in the Commission's impact assessment concluded that the average cost per company of complying with the requirements of the accounting directives is €1,558. Of this amount, the administrative burden (i.e. collecting and processing information purely to satisfy legal obligations, without a real business need) is €1,169. If all Member States were to exempt micro companies and did not impose additional requirements, the proposal could save an estimated at €6.3 billion.
MEPs call for equal pay between men and women
Speakers from all sides of the EP called for equal pay The continuing pay gap between men and women in the EU, violence against women and more female MEPs were some of the issues raised in the Parliament during International Women's Day on Monday. Several MEPs also criticised the fact that Commission presented a new plan how to reach gender equality in the next 5 years but did not discuss it with NGOs or the public.
Speaking in the Chamber Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek said "discrimination in society or at work should be a thing of the past."
UK Liberal Diana Wallis wants more female MEPs - in the UK Parliament she estimated that it would take 200 years to reach parity an the current rate of progress: "Much has been achieved, much can be celebrated, but there is very, very much more to do."
On the fact that women earn less than men, Dutch MEP Corien Wortmann-Kool said women make up 50% of the population but earn only 10% of the world's income. The leader of the Socialists in Parliament Martin Schulz said that society is not based on equality of rights if "for the same work men and women get different pay".
Marina Yannakoudakis for the European Conservatives and Reformists said that "the phrase just a housewife needs to be outlawed, no woman is just anything".
Marta Andreasen for the European Freedom and Democracy bloc asked the EU to stop issuing demagogic laws on equality that make life more difficult for women who wish to work. She thinks equality is not about laws but about behaviour. "I would be insulted if someone would give me special treatment at work merely due to my chromosomes."
The European Commissioner for health and consumer policy John Dalli recalled the Women's Charter presented on March 5 which is a good basis for EU future action -which aims at a gender equality plan for next 5 years.
Dutch MEP Marije Cornelissen (Greens/EFA) was sceptical that the Parliament and NGOs were not consulted for Charter. Now "we need to see deeds rather than just words".
Swedish MEP Eva-Britt Svensson (GUE/NGL) is also deeply concerned about the weak content of the Charter and no debate, she proposes to use time until next Women's Day in 2011 to discuss with the EP and public the proposals: "We will work for women's rights not just on this day the 8 March but on all days. That is what men and women in Europe need."
International Women's Day
Post-Copenhagen deal in spotlight in Tuesday debate
Billowing chimneys of a large power plant in Shanghai, China on 28 January 2010.©BELGA_EPA_QILAI SHEN The post Copenhagen climate deal was debated by MEPs Tuesday afternoon with Europe's climate Commissioner Connie Hedegaard outlining the way forward. She argued for the EU to maintain momentum ahead of the next climate conference in Mexico at the end of the year and push for a legally binding deal.
The Commissioner was quizzed by the MEPs on the content and the aims of the European Commission's latest communication on climate change talks titled "International Climate Change policy post-Copenhagen - reinvigorating the international negotiations through immediate action". The communication was published on 9 March.
Managing expectations
Speaking in the debate Ms Hedegaard told the House that a final agreement may be delayed despite the EU being ready. She said that it was very important that expectations for Cancun are managed carefully, as failure may give a boost to those arguing that no deal is necessary.
Ms Hedegaard, a former climate Minister of Denmark said that we need tangible deliverables in Cancun, we must put pressure on US and China and must focus on content not form.
For the Parliament's largest bloc, the centre right European People's Party, Richard Seeber said "there is a confidence crisis in Europe as far as causes for climate change are concerned…you will know that there are polls saying that only 30 percent of European citizens believe that CO2 has an impact on climate".
Another Doha disappointment?
Speaking on behalf of the Socialists and Democrats group Jo Leinen said "we have to find a mechanism that would allow the exchange of information and positions on climate change issues, as both the European Parliament and Commission have wide-ranging contacts and meetings in this area. I am afraid that the climate talks will turn out as Doha trade talks, the final agreement delayed year after year."
For the Liberal ALDE bloc Chris Davies said that in climate change talks the EU is dependent on the goodwill of other parties and cannot sign a deal by itself, "you will need all the friends you can get". For the Green group in the Parliament Satu Hassi (Greens/EFA) said the EU must move beyond its 20% reduction by 2020 goal and aim for 30 percent reduction at least.
Finally for the European Conservatives and Reformists Martin Callanan said that in the absence of a deal, unilateral emissions reductions could harm the competitiveness of European economy.
Copenhagen focus EP calls for new climate diplomacy 2 Feb Commission on new climate change communication (press release 09/03/2010) Copenhagen Accord
Call for use of Solidarity fund for victims of natural disasters
The need to think about reforestation, land use and managing water through dykes are just two things MEPs want governments to take action on in the wake of recent natural disasters. Floods in Portuguese Madeira and storm Xynthia in Europe this year have claimed scores of lives. Natural calamities were debated Thursday morning (11 March). Recent earthquakes in Chile and Turkey have also brought emergency responses into focus.
In the debate and the resolution adopted by the House MEPs expressed their "deepest sympathy" with all the victims.
As well as the human cost the impact on the environment, tourism, biodiversity were all mentioned in the debate.
"Increasingly frequent" storms and floods
What seems clear is that such catastrophes will grow more apparent as the impact of climate change becomes more paramount. As the resolution states: "It has become clear in recent years that problems with floods, storms and other extreme weather phenomena are likely to be increasingly frequent. Investment in mitigating climate change is important in order to prevent such catastrophes."
Several MEPs stressed the need to mobilise the EU's Solidarity Fund which was set up in the wake of flooding in 2002 to help regions affected by natural disasters. French MEP Elisabeth Morin-Chartier (EPP) called for the solidarity fund to be used to help victims "we always complain that Europe is too far of our citizens is the opportunity to show them otherwise" she told the House.
Condolence but need for tangible help
Dutch MEP Lambert Van Nistelrooij (EPP) demanded "how is it that the Council (of Ministers) does not follow the Parliament's request to ease the functioning of the European solidarity?"
This was echoed by Portuguese Member João Ferreira (GUE/NGL). "Our first words should be words of condolence. But then we should turn to something more tangible, financial aid. Prevention should play a very important role".
Others paid tribute to the people affected "I'll never forget the courage and determination shown by those who lose their houses and properties in Madeira. People in Madeira count on the solidarity of the EU" said Portuguese Socialist Edite Estrela.
