The European Parliament decided on Thursday to postpone voting its resolution on Hungary's media law, in the light of Commissioner Kroes' announcement, during the debate on Wednesday, that an agreement had been reached with the Hungarian authorities to amend the legislation to bring it into line with EU rules. A majority of the political groups in the Parliament wants to study this recent development and possibly change their resolutions accordingly.
Parliament decided the postponement by a show of hands, at noon on Thursday.
In the plenary debate on Wednesday, EPP representatives welcomed the Hungarian government's decision and urged Parliament to cancel the planned vote on its resolution. Meanwhile, S&D, ALDE, Greens/EFA and GUE/NGL MEPs pointed out that the agreed changes may not suffice to ensure media freedom in Hungary.
