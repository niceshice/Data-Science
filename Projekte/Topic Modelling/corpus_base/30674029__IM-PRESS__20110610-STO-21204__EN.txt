2011-06-14 - 14:26
Tensions remain 17 years after the end of the conflict Â©BELGA/NOVOSTI /O.Litvin Nagorno-Karabakh is a territory within the recognised borders of Azerbaijan with an ethnic Armenian majority. The region was ravaged by war between 1992 and 1994 and international mediation still has not yet established a lasting peace. Recently EP President Jerzy Buzek visited the area and on 15 June the Foreign Affairs Committee will hold a hearing about the situation there.
The region is an ethnically homogenous Armenian enclave within the territory of Azerbaijan with a population of around 140,000. The region claims statehood, but is not recognised even by Armenia. Despite the ceasefire, tensions still run high, there are acts of violence and many fear Azerbaijan's military may challenge the status quo.
Attempts to resolve the conflict
The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the OSCE, through the Minsk group , under the co-chairmanship of Russia, France and the US is trying to find a lasting solution. Among the principles for a settlement , known as the Madrid principles, are:
the return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control
determining the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh
a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh
the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence
During a recent visit to Azerbaijan, Mr Buzek said: "In my talks, I underlined the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan within internationally recognised borders. The EU strongly supports the international effort to resolve the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh centred around the framework of the Minsk Group and a peaceful solution on the basis of the Madrid principles."
Implications for the region
Since the closure of the border with Turkey, the only overland transport options available to Armenia are Georgia and Iran. So pipelines from the Caspian Sea to Turkey have been built through Georgia, not Armenia, while a rail link from Azerbaijan to Turkey circumvents Armenia.
