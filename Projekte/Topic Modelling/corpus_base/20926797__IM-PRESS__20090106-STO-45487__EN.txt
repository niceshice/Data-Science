2009-01-08 - 12:52
Creativity and Innovation are the watchwords of 2009 Encouraging people to be as creative and innovative as possible in education, employment and cultural activities are three main aims of the European Year of Creativity and Innovation launched Wednesday. The aim is to innovate in areas such as the economy but also social and individual well-being.
Other objectives for this year include creativity and innovation in transport policy, the environment, research and the information society.
There will be promotion campaigns, events and initiatives at European, national, regional and local levels.
Supporters are hoping it will help the so called "Lisbon Agenda" launched in 2001 which aims to make the EU "the most competitive knowledge-based economy" in the world by 2010.
