MEPs adopted a report entitled "Towards a reform of the World Trade Organisation calling for a redefinition of the role and format of Ministerial Conferences and observes already the tendency of WTO members to prefer more informal methods of coordination and decision-making at this level and notes that no Ministerial Conference was convened in 2007.
The report calls for the introduction of a more democratic system of decision-making at the WTO that takes into account the views of the entire membership, which comprises countries at varying levels of development.
Parliamentary dimension
The committee stresses the importance of the parliamentary dimension of the WTO in order to enhance the democratic legitimacy and transparency of WTO negotiations. The report stresses the importance of the work done by the Parliamentary Conference on the WTO, which is organised jointly by the European Parliament and the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), whose activities could be stepped up.
Balanced secretariat
The report stresses that the role of the WTO secretariat is critical, and believes that it is important that the secretariat has a proportionate representation of officials from developed and developing countries in order for it to discharge its mandate more effectively.
Pre-accession
The European Parliament calls on the WTO members to consider the idea of a special pre-accession status for candidate countries which, while not having yet concluded their bilateral market access negotiations with their key partners in the organisation, pledge to take on without delay all the obligations resulting from the application of the existing rules.
The report stresses that the decision on whether or not to admit a new member country to the WTO should always be adopted on the basis of strictly commercial considerations.
