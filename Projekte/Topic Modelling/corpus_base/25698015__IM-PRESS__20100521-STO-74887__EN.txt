Some buses in Brussels have special disabled access Â©BELGA/E Ansotte Disabled still discriminated against MEPs on Petitions Committee want action by governments Around 50 million Europeans are disabled. Even if their rights are covered by the proposed EU anti-discrimination directive, some of them consider that a specific EU law on the rights of people with disabilities is needed and that's what they told MEPs. Some of the petitions received were debated at the end of April, putting the issue on the European agenda and paving the way for a possible specific law.
An insurance company refusing to pay unemployment benefits to a disabled person, an autistic boy excluded from a school and a public bus which is not accessible with a wheelchair. Those were three of the breaches of disabled people rights that were discussed by Parliament's Petitions Committee on 26 April. Different faces of the same reality, denouncing discriminatory behaviours towards the disabled.
European Disability Forum
A possible way of addressing the problem was proposed in an earlier petition from the European Disability Forum with the support of 1.3 million citizens from various EU countries.
This petition says that the EU "anti-discrimination" directive proposed by the Commission (but currently blocked by EU Member States in the Council), would not properly address the specific needs of this group. That is why the signatories asked for a specific European law to protect the rights of people with disabilities.
The Petitions Committee decided to table an oral question to European governments asking them to "unblock" the anti-discrimination directive and push it forward as soon as possible.
It has also said that MEPs on the Civil Liberties should be asked for their opinion on the legislation.
In practice this means that petitioners have succeeded in alerting the EU to a possible lack of European legislation on a particular subject. Now, the Commission will have to examine if it a specific law is necessary.
Petitions: what are they?
Any citizen of the European Union or resident in a Member State, may, individually or in association with others, submit a petition to the European Parliament on a subject which comes within the European Union's fields of activity and which affects them directly.
