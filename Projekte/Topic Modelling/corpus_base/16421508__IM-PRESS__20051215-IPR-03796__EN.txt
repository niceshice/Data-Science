The Conference of Presidents of the political groups has decided in principle to set up a committee of inquiry into the insurance company Equitable Life. The draft mandate and the composition of this committee will be determined by the Conference of Presidents at its first meeting in 2006 and will be put to the vote at Parliament's plenary session of January in Strasbourg.
The committee of inquiry will look into "matters linked to the insurance company Equitable Life and in particular allegations concerning the absence of relevant rules and of the implementation and application of EU legislation in the field of insurances, resulting in heavy losses (savings and investments) suffered by over a million Europeans".
