The Mexican city is hosting this year the UN climate talks (29 November - 10 December). In the decisive second week of the conference an official delegation of 15 MEPs attended the forum to meet other legislators and civil society representatives, and press for agreements that are critical to achieving a global binding deal.
On the eve of the international conference in Cancún the EP set out its position by adopting a resolution on 25 November. The resolution says that the EU would be acting in its own economic interest if it raised its 2020 CO2 reduction target to 30%. The document highlights forest protection and climate aid commitments to developing countries as critical areas for progress in upcoming international talks in Cancún, Mexico.
In this feature you can find information on environmental topics related to the climate talks, an interview with the delegation chair Jo Leinen, (S&D) and the position of the EP on the Cancún conference.

MEPs: Cancun agreement opens the way towards global climate treaty
MEPs (l to r) Jo Leinen, Ivo Belet, Marita Ulvskog, Lena Ek, Yannick Jadot & Bert Metz (European Climate Foundation). 194 countries managed to reach a last-minute agreement MEPs have welcomed the result Despite fears that the UN talks in Cancun would end in failure, representatives from 194 countries managed to reach a last-minute agreement on some key measures for tackling climate change. MEPs have welcomed the result from the negotiations and see it as a way towards a new global climate treaty.
Although talks in Cancun didn't establish a new global, legally binding treaty on climate change, they did, however, provide bring that goal one step closer to fruition. As Jo Leinen, chair of the European Parliament delegation to Cancun said, “the UN climate conference in Cancun paved the way for a global climate treaty".
Breakthroughs in Cancun include the establishment of a Green Fund for developing countries, forest protection and an acknowledgement of the need for tougher targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions.
Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek praised the progress achieved in Cancun but highlighted that "the EU should continue to put pressure on the rest of the world to reach a more ambitious agreement at a later stage. The European Parliament will continue the fight against climate change."
A new atmosphere
Karl-Heinz Florenz, Vice-Chair of the Parliament's Delegation (EPP, Germany) praised "the whole new atmosphere in the climate talks which we would not have dreamed of when Copenhagen was over" and commented that the Mexican presidency seemed to have found an approach that guaranteed transparency.
MEPs have met in Cancun with key national delegations from Japan, Mexico, Brazil South Africa (host of next year’s conference).
The European Parliament will discuss the results of Cancun on Tuesday afternoon (14 December) during its Parliamentary session held in Strasbourg, eastern France.
Cancun - what was agreed?
Set up a Green Fund worth $100 billion a year to assist developing countries cope with climate change from 2020
Ambition is to limit global warming to below 2 degrees and a reference to reviewing whether it might be possible to aim for 1.5 degrees
A framework on paying developing countries to maintain their forests instead of clearing them
Acknowledgement of the need for tougher targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions

MEPs look forward to Cancun climate talks
European Parliament’s position ahead of UN climate talks The main issues in Cancun EP adopted resolution ahead of Cancun A week before the UN conference in Cancun, Mexico the EP debated the issues of the climate talks and adopted a resolution, saying EU should move to 30% emissions reduction target for 2020. (the target now is 20%) A group of MEPs led by the chair of the Committee Jo Leinen (S&D, Germany) will be in Cancun to press for this “Deadlock in climate change negotiations would be unacceptable in Cancún.”, said Leinen.
What are the main issues in Cancun, give it to me in a nutshell
The Kyoto protocol, which sets out legally binding measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, expires in 2012 and time is running out to find a successor to it. That is the purpose of Cancun. However, agreement between developing and developed countries proved elusive last year as the poorer countries agree they should not have to pay for the pollution of richer, industrialised nations like the US and Europe. They are also concerned that limit to emissions could tie back economic growth - something the Chinese are particularly concerned about. In addition there is the question of money, who will pay for the climate mitigation measures that may be needed?
Insiders use abbreviations for these climate change talks like "COP16" and "CMP 6" What do all these mean? Am guessing this is going to be complicated...?
It is - but keep reading anyway. There are in fact 6 conferences taking place at the same time to discuss climate change and related issues. However, the most important are the "Sixteenth session of the Conference of the Parties" (So COP16 means this is their 16th meeting), and the "Sixth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol" (CMP 6). Most governments are members of the United Nations Framework on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which produced the Kyoto's protocol.
Who is there?
A lot of people. Every government around the world sends a delegation whilst the EU, various UN bodies and a range of international organisations are there, as NGOs from around the world.
Is this related to the Copenhagen climate conference last year?
Yes, disagreements in Copenhagen left a lot of unfinished business, Cancun hopes to deal with some of it.

Environment Chair Jo Leinen on biodiversity protection
German Social Democrat MEP Jo Leinen makes his point 17,000 species are endangered Represents a loss of about €50 billion a year The terrifying loss of the planet's biodiversity will be discussed this week at a UN meeting in Nagoya, Japan. Leading the European Parliament's delegation is Jo Leinen, who heads the Environment Committee. In an interview ahead of the conference he told us that it is clear "the EU must take the lead in the preservation of biodiversity". The conference this year is part of the 10th Conference of the Parties (COP - 10) on the Convention of Biodiversity (CBD).
What is the relationship between biodiversity loss and climate change? They are deeply linked. A prominent example is rainforests: if we destroy the forests we increase the danger of climate change. On the other hand, climate change is changing ecosystems - for example desertification. Some talk about "nature extinction". How serious is the situation? Every day 30 species are lost and a UN study tells us that 17,000 species are endangered. Besides the ecological catastrophe this is an economic catastrophe - this destruction of natural capital represents a loss of about €50 billion a year. The worldwide investment for the protection of biodiversity is €3 billion. So there is a big gap and the gap is widening every year. What are your expectations from Nagoya? I hope we'll find a consensus on a vision to stop the loss of species and the degradation of biodiversity. The short term goal is to stop the loss of species by 2020 and the long term vision is to restore destroyed ecosystems by 2050 through reforestation and restoration of water basins. The EU must speak with one voice and must take the lead in the preservation of biodiversity. The 2010 targets, set in 2002, have not been met. How can we ensure that the targets for 2020 will be met? We have to integrate biodiversity in many policy areas, especially in agriculture, fisheries, forest policy and transport. Mainstreaming is the key to success. "Natura 2000" is not enough; we protect 10% and leave 90% in degradation. What we have learnt from the 2010 targets is that we need to adopt a more holistic approach. Norway has a law on genetic resources and donated $1 billion to protect the Brazilian rainforests. Should the EU should take similar steps? Norway is a positive model showing responsibility and commitment. I hope we can follow Norway's example by providing more financial resources and having a legal instrument to control the traffic of genetic resources. A Green Fund would help those countries who urgently need funding to preserve or restore biodiversity. Where should funds for the protection of biodiversity come from? We have to look for innovative sources of financing. Through the linking of climate protection to biodiversity we could use some of the money proposed for development - $30 billion up to 2013 and $100 billion by 2020. We also could use funds from the emission trading schemes and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM - Kyoto protocol). Parliament has also proposed a tax on financial transactions to regulate speculation and preserve biodiversity.

Ahead of Cancún climate talks: MEPs support UN forests programme
Photo taken 5 August, 2010 shows a logged over area in the mountains of Jambi province in Indonesia's Sumatra island. ©BELGA UN's "Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation" policy (REDD) proving successful Environment MEPs back scheme and want a new version after 2012 The importance of forests in combating climate change is crucial as trees are absorbing carbon dioxide being emitted by human activities. What is more, deforestation and forest degradation account for a quarter of emissions. Forestry is one area where there are hopes of real progress at the forthcoming UN climate conference in Cancún, Mexico. Parliament's Environment Committee recognised this recently when they backed a resolution calling for more action in this area.
When forests are damaged or cleared the burned or decaying wood releases stored carbon as CO2. Worldwide deforestation and forest degradation (e.g. through agricultural expansion) causes 20% of annual greenhouse gas emissions. This is more than the entire global transportation sector and second only to the energy sector. The deputy chair of the Parliament's delegation to the UN climate change conference in Cancún is German MEP Karl-Heinz Florenz (EPP). He told us that "the European energy sector emits about 4.1 billion tons of CO2 per year, while deforestation, illegal logging, burning off of the rain forests in Brazil, Indonesia and other countries cause about 6 billion tons of CO2 annually. It doesn't mean that we don't have to do anything, on the contrary. It makes clear our common responsibility". A way to reduce the deforestation: the UN initiative REDD+ Behind the complicated name "Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD)" stands the simple idea to create a financial stimulation for developing countries to avoid deforestation and in this way to reduce emissions. This idea differs from previous attempts to preserve the forest, because it links the financial incentives directly with the carbon stored in forests. The carbon stored in the forest should be estimated and "measured". For the respective quantity of avoided deforestation the countries should get "credits". These credits could be sold in an international carbon market, or there could be financial compensations. The updated “REDD+” goes beyond deforestation and forest degradation, and includes the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks. MEPs from the Environment Committee in their motion for a resolution adopted in October called on the EU to support REDD+. The motion for resolution (which is on many climate issues) sets out the Committee's position ahead of UN climate talks in Cancún, Mexico (29 November - 10 December). The plenary will debate preparations for Cancún during the November session in Strasbourg (24 November). Optimism for Cancún The forestry issue is one of the topics where there are hopes of real progress in Cancun. "An agreement related to deforestation must be the focus of our efforts. There are already experts who speak of Cancun as a "REDD-COP". There is still a lot of work ahead of us, especially with respect to accounting and financing, but I'm optimistic" Karl-Heinz Florenz told us.
UN-REDD Programme
UN-REDD Programme was launched in September 2008.
Assists developing countries. It currently supports 9 pilot countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America
Norway is the largest donor of the Programme. Norway has committed US$32.1 million for 2010.
The UN-REDD Programme also seeks to ensure a REDD+ is included in a post-2012 climate agreement.

Interview with Jane Goodall, British primatologist
In EP Monday to speak to schoolchildren from 37 nationalities Forms part of the "Roots & Shoots" programme British primatologist Jane Goodall was in the EP Monday (22 November) to talk to children of 37 nationalities from schools in Brussels. She talked about chimpanzees, the importance of conserving the environment and ensuring the future. "We haven't inherited the Planet from our parents, we borrowed it from our children," she told us in an interview before the conference when we also asked some questions from EP fans on Facebook.
Dr Goodall, you are in the EP but not to address MEPs, you are here to address a very different crowd, which is more interesting to you? Yes, I'm going to be addressing young people, children from many different areas. Of course, it is important to address the Chamber too. The world is in such a mess, we have inflicted so much harm on it that we need to work from the top as well as from the bottom. But I'm certainly working very hard to developing our youth programme "Roots & Shoots". What are the key messages you are going to deliver today? That although we have harmed their future, there is a lot they can do. It's about time that we all get together, the elders and the youth and start healing some of the scars that we have inflicted. Environmental protection and biodiversity are key subjects for the UN climate change conference in December in Mexico. What is your message to participants? The message is that one of the most important things we can do to slow down climate change, and one of the most economically effective, is to protect tropical rainforests. As we cut down the forests, we release CO2, and then burning releases more, the forest itself is sequestering CO2. Another message is to address intensive animal farming. Vast areas of forests are cut down to provide places to grow grain, more and more people eat more and more meat, they want cheap meat. The animals are fed unnatural diets so they produce huge amounts of methane gas which is a big contributor to the greenhouse effect. Cruelty aside, this intensive farming is incredibly damaging to the environment and to human health. A question from Charlotte Biddle, an EP fan on Facebook: "As a UN messenger of peace what do you feel are the most important messages to convey regarding the environment and wildlife?" The most important message is that environment is part of our future. So many people think it's a question of either or. Either it's human development or it's environmental protection. If we don't protect our environment and our natural resources, the future of our children is in jeopardy. There is a saying, "We haven't inherited the Planet from our parents; we borrowed it from our children". We've been stealing, stealing, stealing, and here we are, the most intellectual people ever to have walked on the Planet, and with this incredibly complex brain of ours we destroyed our only home. It's been said that if everybody on the Planet had the standard of living of the average European, we would need up to 5, even 6 new planets. We don't even have one new planet. So we must use this complex brain of ours and start making wise decisions, based on how these decisions will affect people in the future, now how they affect us now. Dinesh Kumar (EP fan on Facebook): What can common people do to protect biodiversity, after Homo Sapiens (supposedly wise man) destroyed a good part of it? People often ask me: "What can I do?" The problems are so huge in the world that people feel helpless, and when you feel helpless you just don't do anything. Everyone leaves it to the scientists and the politicians, as "it is their problem, not mine". But I always say "just spend a few minutes every day thinking about the consequences of the choices you make - what you buy, what you eat, what you wear, how you get from A to B". Some people cannot afford to make the right choice but there are millions of people who can, and everyone can make some of the right choices. Danielle Demos (EP fan on Facebook): Indigenous delegates to the Fifth World Parks Congress, Durban, South Africa in 2003 said, “First we were dispossessed in the name of Kings and emperors, later in the name of state development, and now in the name of conservation.” What would be your answer to them? My answer is that I'm with them 100%. We work with indigenous people in several parts of the world. They have been abused, dispossessed; they were the stewards of their land. Fortunately in many places they begin to find their voice again. I'm so deeply impressed by the indigenous people who stand up against these forces who would dispossess them, even to the risk of their lives, to try a find a way for them to continue to be stewards of their land and to protect it from the rapacious greed of the rest of the world.
