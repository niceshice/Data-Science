With Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's planes and tanks pounding rebel positions in the east of Libya, MEPs on Wednesday demanded the enforcement of a no-fly zone over the country's territory and the recognition of rebel authorities to help the insurrection against the regime. Events in North Africa are a key test for the European Union, said EP President Jerzy Buzek, emphasising that the first priority should be to overcome the humanitarian crisis.
