EU will press ahead with airline emissions trading inspite of international opposition ©BELGA_SCIENCE As part of its effort to cut damaging greenhouse gases, the EU will include aviation in its Emissions Trading System (ETS) from 2012, affecting all flights into or out of the EU, and it wants other countries to agree on measures to curb air and maritime emissions. As delegates head to the Durban Climate Summit, German Christian Democrat Peter Liese who guided the legislation through the EP explained more.
Why should aviation be included in the emissions trading system?
The emissions from aviation have doubled since 1990. This contrasts dramatically with internationally agreed targets to limit the effects of climate change to a 2°C increase in temperature. Scientists tell us we need to reduce emissions dramatically to achieve this target. It is also necessary to address aviation because other modes of transport like bus, car and train that are more climate-friendly have been subject to regulation and sometimes a very extensive financial burden for years.
What is your reaction to the international opposition to the EU legislation, including the US?
! am very disappointed by the vote in the House of Representatives ( it voted the EU ETS prohibition Act, which would bar US airlines from complying with EU rules ). Fortunately the Senate has not yet taken up the issue, so that it probably will not enter into law. The approach of the US, including the US government, is very disappointing. President Obama has been given the Nobel Peace Prize and one of the reasons was that he is so engaged in climate change. Unfortunately the administration does not behave any differently than the Bush-Administration when it comes to aviation.
Has the situation changed since 2008 when the legislation was approved?
The need to act is much more obvious than in 2008. Unfortunately the political atmosphere has turned to a more hesitant and sceptical approach on climate mitigation. However, if we are responsible politicians we should not base our decisions on the current mood, but on scientific grounds, and that is why I think we need to defend our legislation.
How much are the new charges going to cost and who will pay - airlines or consumers?
According to the Commission's analysis, the price of an intercontinental flight will increase by about €2. Compared to national taxes and charges - for example up to £160 in the UK and €50 in Germany - this is rather modest. At the same time, airline lobbyists are talking about the high costs to them and telling people that ticket prices will increase. One part of the story must be wrong. I hope that airlines will focus on innovation - for example more efficient aircraft and the introduction of bio-fuels - rather than just paying for the allowances and leaving everything unchanged.
