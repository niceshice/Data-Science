The state of equality between the sexes in Europe will be debated Monday. This is American actress Lena Horne in 1943 ©Belga/Van Parys Equal pay for men and women, paternity leave and tackling violence are at the heart of a report being debated Monday evening by MEPs. The state of relations between men and women across Europe will be in the spotlight as Belgian Socialist Marc Tarabella's report is debated. It calls for a change in attitudes so that "no one will still be surprised to find women driving buses or men doing laundry".
MEPs and NGOs discussed the issues at a hearing on 28 January. As Portuguese Green Ilda Figueiredo put it, "equality is at the heart of social progress".
Many speakers noted the grim impact the current economic crisis is having on women. However, they said it represents an opportunity as governments are now re-thinking long established policies.
Several speakers said they thought part of the crisis could be explained by the fact that banks and other financial institutions were dominated by men.
Men still earn more than women
One of the most nagging problems the report identifies is the continued pay gap between men and women. It is estimated that women earn 17%-14% less than men for the same work. In general women are much more likely to be in poorly-paid jobs and part-time work on fixed contracts.
This discrepancy is even more marked given that women now get more University qualifications than men. The report notes, "58.9% of the university qualifications awarded in the Union went to women, yet they are in the minority in corporate and political positions of responsibility".
The darker aspects of man-women relations
A darker aspect of the relationship between men and women is also identified by the report and was brought up in the hearing. The report states that as many as 1-in-4 women suffer physical abuse at some point in their lives with 1-in-10 suffering sexual abuse.
MEPs want the European Union to adopt a specific day every year to draw attention to the problem of abuse.
Dutch Green MEP Marije Cornelissen voiced her frustration at the current state of affairs: "the strategy in Europe suffers from a lot of beautiful language and not very much concrete action".
The report proposes information campaigns in schools and workplaces across the EU to help fight stereotyping.
Equality for mums and dads?
The Tarabella report supports "any moves to introduce paternity-leave entitlement at European level".
Speaking at the hearing, Marisa Soleto, Director of Fundación Mujeres called for a new approach: "It would be desirable that both maternity and paternity leave be of an equal length. For decades, we have been asking men to integrate into domestic work, let us now introduce that balance on a legal level."
The debate on the gender equality will be on Monday and MEPs will vote on Wednesday 10 February.
