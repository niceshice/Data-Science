Get on your (electric) bike! ©BELGA Aim to raise awareness of link between travel & health Transport accounts for 20% of greenhouse gas emissions Get on your (electric) bike! That's the message of some cycling groups who are currently holding an exhibition of electric bikes outside the European Parliament. They are part of "European Mobility week" which promotes eco-friendly ways of travelling. This year the theme is drawing attention to the relation between how you travel and how healthy you are.
Mobility Week is strongly backed by many Members of the European Parliament. The head of its Environment Committee Jo Leinen put the week into a wider context of fighting climate change when we spoke to him. The German Socialist sees the Mobility Week and the issues it raises as crucial because "transport contributes 20% to global emissions".
He also supports the use of electric bikes and vehicles if the power comes from renewable sources. He told us that more use of them will have "a positive environmental impact but also reduce health hazards and noise pollution".
The impact of vehicles in cities is one area that is growing in importance. According to the Green MEP Michael Cramer " cities play a key role in the overhaul of transport policies given that more than 80 % of the European population live in urban areas". He went to say that this accounts "for 70% of transport-related greenhouse gas emissions".
Socialist MEP Edite Estela told us that he used to promote sustainable transport during her previous role as Mayor for the Portuguese town of Sintra. She also told us of her own efforts: "personally, I try to walk to and from work everyday. It's good for the environment and for my health".
The European Parliament itself shall be advising employees through its eco-management services initiative (EMAS) about greener alternatives to cars with the support of Brussels cyclists' associations such as "Fietsersbond", "Gracq" and "Pro-Vélo".
