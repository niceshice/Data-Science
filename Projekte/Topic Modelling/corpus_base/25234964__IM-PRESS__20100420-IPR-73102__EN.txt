More than half the Members of the European Parliament were able to travel to Strasbourg to take part in this week's plenary session. 408 of the 736 MEPs were present on Monday evening, despite the extensive disruption to air travel in Europe.
This has enabled Parliament to continue its business this week, including a debate to hold the Commission and Council to account for their response to the air travel crisis, an issue currently of major concern for millions of European citizens.
On the other hand, with travel from some parts of Europe practically impossible, it would not have been reasonable to hold votes, as the presence of MEPs from different countries is necessarily geographically unbalanced, even though formally quorate.
