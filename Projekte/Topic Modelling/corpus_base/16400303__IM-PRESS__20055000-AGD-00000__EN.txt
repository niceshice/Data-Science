The European Parliament will send a delegation to Libya on a special mission to look into the problems of illegal immigration. The members will meet the Libyan authorities in Tripoli on 5 and 6 December. The trip is a follow-up to a recent EP resolution in which MEPs " expressed their concern at the collective expulsions of migrants from the island of Lampedusa in Italy to Libya carried out by the Italian authorities ". MEPs called then for the setting up of a delegation to Libya in order " to assess the magnitude of the problem and to verify the legitimacy of the actions of the Libyan authorities " regarding the illegal immigrants received from Italy and arriving via other sub-Saharan African countries.
The delegation will be chaired by Simon Busuttil (EPP-ED, MT). The other Members are Boguslaw Sonik (EPP-ED, PL); Fernando Fernández Martín (EPP-ED, ES); Pasqualina Napoletano (PES, IT); Wolfgang Kreissl-Dörfler (PES, DE); Helene Flautre (Greens/EFA, FR) and Francesco Enrico Speroni (IND/DEM, IT).
This is the second delegation of the European Parliament established this year to examine the problem of illegal immigration with an on-site visit. The first went to Lampedusa (Italy) in September and there will also be a third one to Ceuta and Melilla (Spain) on 7-9 December.
