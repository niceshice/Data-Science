Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, President of Liberia
Africa's first woman president, Liberia's Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, will address MEPs Tuesday at midday. The winner of the November 2005 election with almost 60% of the vote, she was elected on a platform of peace and stability, after 14 years of civil war. In her inaugural speech in January, the 67-year-old mother of four told the Liberian people that their ballot was "a vote for healing and leadership."
The problems facing Mrs Sirleaf and her "Unity party" are daunting: Almost 80% of the 3 million inhabitants are unemployed and living below the poverty line. After years of war, much of the population is displaced and scarred by the conflict.
Liberia is still recovering from the rule of Charles Taylor who ran the country like a warlord in the '90s. His rule fuelled rebellion and violence as did his interference in the civil war in neighbouring Sierra Leone. The use of child soldiers in the conflict was particularly disturbing. He is now on trial there accused of crimes against humanity. European Parliament President Josep Borrell hailed his arrest as a victory in the "fight against the impunity of war criminals".
Mrs Sirleaf won a reputation as an "Iron Lady" by standing against Taylor in the '97 Presidential elections. As the first female Minister of Finance she was imprisoned and exiled following the military coup in 1980. She later worked for the United Nations Development Program.
She surprised many in the second round of the November 2005 elections by beating former footballer George Weah. French Socialist Marie-Arlette Carlotti headed the delegation of MEPs who monitored the "peaceful and well administered" poll. Afterwards she said, "the Liberian people have sent out a strong signal to the leaders of the country. It will be up to these...not to disappoint the population."
EU aid to Liberia stands at â‚¬130 million and is focused on development, education and returning refugees to their homes. Liberia is a member of the EU-ACP (African Caribbean and Pacific States) agreements that cover trade and development. The ACP and the EU has a Parliamentary arm that meets twice a year to allow MPs to discuss international issues.
The Liberian President is one of three female Presidents meeting MEPs in Strasbourg. Earlier this month Finland's Tarja Halonen addressed Plenary and in October Chile's new leader Michelle Bachelet has been invited to visit Parliament.
