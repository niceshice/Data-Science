EU support for building democracy outside the European Union touches on wider issues including human rights and poverty reduction. A more consistent approach would make EU action in this area more effective, say MEPs in a resolution adopted on Thursday.
MEPs believe that adopting a Country Strategy on Human Rights and Democracy with country-specific priorities could improve the consistency, coordination and effectiveness of EU external action. So far there is no single document defining an EU vision of democracy-building and support.
"Democracy cannot be exported or imposed from the outside and a successful strategy for democracy promotion must be based on dialogue and entail broad efforts to strengthen civil society", highlights the resolution text.
EU support for electoral processes needs to be followed up
The EU Election Observation Missions are a positive example of strengthening democratic processes worldwide, not only by reinforcing the electoral process but also by enhancing respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and good governance.
However, there is a need for a coherent policy after elections, with a focus on the role of elected representatives and political parties, an independent judiciary and media, and greater participation by women in political and public life.
Moreover, says Parliament, when designing the new EU diplomatic service, the Commission and Member States should mainstream human rights and democracy- building in all policy areas and draw lessons from current process and experience.
The resolution was adopted by show of hands.
