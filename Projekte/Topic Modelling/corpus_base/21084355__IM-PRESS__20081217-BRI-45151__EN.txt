Post-Briefing - 12-15 January 2009 - Strasbourg plenary session
2009-01-19 - 14:29
MEPs debate the Czech Presidency with PM Topolánek
The European Parliament held a wide ranging debate in Strasbourg with the incoming Czech Presidency of European Council. MEPs debated the priorities of the presidency with Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek : Economy, Energy and the European Union in the World and more specifically the Russia/Ukraine-EU gas crisis and the situation in Gaza. The economic crisis and progress on the Lisbon Treaty also featured prominently in the debate.
EP President Pöttering expresses "deepest regret" over the Gaza conflict
At the opening of the plenary session on Monday, 12 January, EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering expressed his "deepest regret" over the escalation of the Gaza conflict between Israel and Hamas, calling for an "immediate end to the violence on both sides". "It is not acceptable for people to continue to suffer, for violence to continue, and now United Nations staff are under fire. How far must the spiral of violence continue before commonsense and reason gain the upper-hand?" he asked.
Gaza: European Parliament calls for an immediate and permanent ceasefire and a negotiated truce
In adopting a resolution on the situation in the Gaza Strip, MEPs call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire which should include the halt to rocket attacks by Hamas on Israel and the end of Israel's military action in Gaza. MEPs call for a negotiated truce that should be guaranteed by a mechanism which could include the dispatching of a multinational presence. MEPs encourage the diplomatic efforts so far undertaken by the international community, especially Egypt and the EU. In the debate on Wednesday (14 January) the vast majority of speakers called for an immediate ceasefire and a negotiated truce.
Russia and Ukraine both lost credibility as reliable energy providers say MEPs
Debating the latest developments in the Russia-Ukraine-EU gas crisis, group speakers stressed that Russia and Ukraine should solve their disputes rapidly without blaming one side or the other. EU citizens are suffering, MEPs said, due to a bilateral dispute. MEPs said that both Russia and Ukraine had lost credibility as reliable partners and the EU should therefore increase its efforts to diversity its energy supply mix. Alexandr Vonda , Czech Deputy Prime Minister for European affairs, outlined the events leading up to the crisis, including the contacts between the Czech presidency of the EU and Russia and Ukraine. He also described measures agreed by the Council for tackling the gas supply problem.
MEPs approve pesticides legislation
The European Parliament adopted new EU pesticides legislation which will increase the number of pesticides available in Member States, while in due course banning the use of certain dangerous chemicals in these products. Measures to ensure the safer use of pesticides in daily life will also be introduced. Voting at second reading on the basis of agreements reached with the Council in December, MEPs overwhelmingly approved a regulation on placing plant protection products on the market as well as a directive on the sustainable use of pesticides.
European Parliament marks ten years of the Euro
EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering welcomed ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet , Eurogroup chair Jean-Claude Juncker , Economics Commissioner Joaquín Almunia and former French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing for a formal session marking ten years of the euro. In his opening speech, EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering called the common currency "a bastion of economic stability", saying that "the creation of the euro was a logical development for a growing economic community". "Today, in the European Parliament we are celebrating one of the most important historical decisions made in the European Union," he said.
Latvian President tells MEPs: "We have a common history, but our destinies have been different"
Addressing the Parliament, Latvian President Valdis Zatlers spoke of Latvia's accession into the European Union and NATO, changes he had witnessed upon entry, the financial crisis and Latvia's economy and the future of Central and Eastern European dialogue. He also made a personal thank you to the European Parliament in its official commemoration of the victims of Stalinism and Nazism.
Parliament calls for EU-wide commemoration of Srebrenica genocide
In July 1995, the Bosnian town of Srebrenica fell into the hands of Serbian militias leading to "several days of carnage". In a resolution adopted by 556 votes to 9 with 22 abstentions, the European Parliament calls on the Council and Commission to commemorate appropriately the anniversary of the Srebrenica-Potočari act of genocide by supporting the European Parliament's recognition of 11 July as the day of commemoration throughout the EU.
Transparency: EU institutions to set an example
A report adopted by the European Parliament urges the EU institutions to do more to open up their registers and documents to the public. In the light of a recent judgment by the Court of Justice, MEPs call on the Council to hold all its debates in public and on Parliament to publish more information on its Members' activities. The report by Marco Cappato (ALDE, IT) on public access to EP, Council and Commission documents was adopted with 355 votes in favour to195 against and 18 abstentions.
Too many violations of fundamental rights in the EU, MEPs say
By adopting the report drafted by Giusto Catania (GUE/NGL, IT) by 401 votes in favour, 220 against and 67 abstentions, MEPs address fundamental rights in its various aspects, voicing recommendations on a broad range of issues like discrimination, immigration, social rights or gender equality.
Global food security: more European initiatives needed say MEPs
The European Parliament calls for “immediate and continuous action” to ensure global food security..In the space of two years world food prices have increased by over 80% on average while cereal stocks have fallen in 2008 to a worrying historic low of 40 days’ supply, points out a report drafted by Mairead McGuinness (EPP-ED, IE) and adopted with 482 votes in favour, 24 against and 59 abstentions. According to the World Bank, over 860 million people in the world are facing chronic famine and this figure could rise by 100 million as a result of the current crisis.
Security features and biometrics in passports
The European Parliament adopted plans to amend a 2004 regulation laying down biometric features to be included in passports and other travel documents, including the holder's fingerprints. Parliament adopted a compromise position agreed with Council last year.
European defence and security market strengthened: deal on public contracts
Defence procurement, still essentially a national competence, is boosted by a new directive, seeking to create a genuine single market for defence and security equipment and services adopted by the European Parliament on Wednesday, 14 January. MEPs voted in favour of the text agreed before with the Council. The challenge has been to put in place a legal framework which will invigorate intra-Community trade in this field and which the Member States can apply without risking their security interests.
Restoring stability in the Horn of Africa: MEPs debate a boost to peacekeeping mission
In a resolution that seeks to restore peace and stability in the Horn of Africa, MEPs demand the reinforcement of the peacekeeping mission in Somalia and the deployment of a UN stabilisation force in Darfur to join forces with the African Union troops already deployed in the region. MEPs also highlight the unresolved border conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea and between Eritrea and Djibouti, and demand that human rights and freedom of the press be observed in these countries.
The EU strategy towards Belarus: MEPs stress the need for greater democratisation
In order to significantly improve relations with the EU, the European Parliament points out five conditions in a resolution adopted by 551 votes in favour, 15 against and 31 abstentions. According to MEPs, Belarus should:
(1) remain a country without political prisoners,
(2) guarantee freedom of expression for the media,
(3) continue to cooperate with the OSCE on reform of the electoral law,
(4) improve conditions for the work of NGOs and
(5) guarantee freedom of assembly and political association.
Economic and monetary affairs
Expressing concern at the unprecedented level of instability in the European and world markets, the report drafted by Donata Gottardi (PES, IT) points out that the crisis in strategic sectors, and especially in the fields of finance and transport, is spurring public investment in takeovers, without care being taken to limit those rescue operations to what is strictly necessary for sustaining and developing the European economy or to ensure they do not respond to national interests only.
UCITS: MEPs back management company passport approach
Parliament approved a proposed reform of the UCITS directives, aimed at making the investment fund market in the EU less fragmented and at improving efficiency. MEPs inserted provisions for a "management company passport". The text has already been agreed with the Council, so this vote effectively completes the legislative procedure. The resolution was adopted with 589 votes in favour, 28 against and 38 abstentions.
Dichloromethane to be banned in paint-strippers
Dichloromethane (DCM) is a colourless chemical compound, classified as a carcinogen category 3. According to the Commission, between 1989 and 2007, 18 fatalities (9 for industrial use, 8 for professional use, 1 for consumer use) and 56 non-fatal injuries have been registered in the EU. The dangerous chemical compound Dichloromethane (DCM) in paint-strippers will soon be banned for consumers and many professionals, after the adoption of a legislative report by the European Parliament. Thanks to MEPs, a derogation for licensed professionals will be limited and the protection of workers during the industrial use of paint-strippers containing the chemical will be strengthened. The resolution was adopted with 674 votes in favour, 17 against and 8 abstentions.
Ecosystem approach to fisheries management
Parliament adopted a report on the Commission communication "The role of the Common Fisheries Policy in implementing an ecosystem approach to marine management". According to MEPs, this initiative is a "contribution" for guaranteeing exploitation of fisheries resources in a way that will create sustainable conditions from the social, environmental and economic points of views, urging however the Commission to reconsider the present system of TACs and quotas.
MEPs call for more economic cooperation between the EU and Western Balkans
The political integration of the Western Balkans into the EU can only take place if there is "better, more intensive regional and international economic co-operation", says the European Parliament. In a report drafted by Bastiaan Belder (IND/DEM, NL), the House states that the EU "must show genuine commitment to the Western Balkans" if its pledge to enable these countries to accede to the EU on schedule is to be fulfilled.
UN Human Rights Council: a mixed record so far says the European Parliament
Parliament adopted a report welcoming the work carried out by the UN Human Rights Council in its first two years of existence but regretting that it has not yet achieved more in improving the UN's human rights record. The EU should play a more prominent role in promoting a clear vision, political agenda and long-term strategy for the UN body, say MEPs.
Human Rights: persecution of Shirin Ebadi, coup in Guinea, censorship in Kenya
In three resolutions on democracy and human rights adopted at the end of the week's Strasbourg plenary session, the European Parliament strongly condemns the persecution of Nobel Peace laureate Shirin Ebadi in Iran, denounces the "seizure of power" by junta in Guinea and voices its regret at the signing of a bill, which could lead to direct media censorship in Kenya. 20081217BRI45151 Texts adopted 13-15 January 2009 Agenda for 2-5 February 2009 Strasbourg session

European Council
MEPs debate the Czech Presidency with PM Topolánek
2009-01-19 - 14:29
The European Parliament held a wide ranging debate in Strasbourg with the incoming Czech Presidency. MEPs debated the priorities of the presidency with Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek: Economy, Energy and the European Union in the World and more specifically the Russia/Ukraine-EU gas crisis and the situation in Gaza. The economic crisis and progress on the Lisbon Treaty also featured prominently in the debate. EP President Hans-Gert PÖTTERING introducing Prime Minister TOPOLÁNEK recalled the Czech Republic's transformation from communism to membership of the EU. He also pointed out that the Czech Republic was the second Member State (after Slovenia) from the 2004 enlargement to hold the EU Council Presidency offering the Czech Presidency the full support of the European Parliament.
Czech Prime Minister - Presidency of the Council
Czech Prime Minister and President in-Office of the EU Council , Mirek TOPOLÁNEK emphasised "the Czech question is a European question " and his belief in the Europe of freedom, rights, ideas and rules.
2009 will be a year of various significant celebrations: five years since the largest expansion in 2004 reunifying a previously divided continent, 20 years since the fall of the Iron Curtain, 30 years since the first direct elections to the European Parliament - the only directly-elected body in the EU. 2009 will also mark 60 years of NATO.
The Czech Presidency Priorities are the three "E"s: Economy, Energy and European Union in the world. Current events also immediately prioritise the two "G"s - Gas and Gaza . "Our motto is a Europe without Barriers but also a Europe of Rules."
On the economy, the Presidency will press for the full implementation of the conclusions of the Declaration of the G20 Summit in November 2008 and the conclusions of the European Council from December 2008. There will be a review of directives on capital adequacy, the completion of talks on the directive regulating insurance, a regulation on the activities of rating agencies and a directive on electronic money institutions. We will press for a review of the regulation on payments in euros, and for the timely and thorough implementation of the road map of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council passed in response to the crisis on the financial markets. In relation to the European Economic Recovery Plan, the Presidency will place emphasis on its insertion in the framework of the Lisbon Strategy : "After short-term tools for strengthening economies, it will be time for tools of medium- and long-term structural reform" . An example of these important structural reforms is the Common Agricultural Policy.
We will press for full assertion and exercise of the four basic freedoms on which the EU is founded. "To these I would add a " fifth freedom" – the free movement of knowledge " something which has always characterised the best of Europe since the Middle Ages, a form of universalism.
The Czech presidency will continue with efforts to provide secure, competitive and sustainable energy for Europe with an additional interest in diversifying supply and transport routes including serious consideration of the development of safe nuclear energy . This Energy priority is "inseparably tied to climate protection policy ". In this area, the Presidency will try to achieve a globally acceptable agreement on the setting of reduction commitments after 2012, "which especially means getting the USA, India and China on board."
In relation to Europe in the world , the new escalation of tension between Israel and Hamas requires not only an active approach from the EU itself, but also coordination with important global and regional players.
The eastern partnership, Transatlantic relations, partnership with Russia, enlargement covering the countries of the Western Balkans and Turkey, the southern dimension of the European neighbourhood policy and also internal security of the EU including further progress on Schengen are all important ongoing priorities.
There are further key issues facing the EU in next six months: Elections 09, the start of discussions about the new form of the European Commission and the Irish position on the Lisbon Treaty. "I am convinced that it is necessary to carry out these talks sensitively and with respect to the sovereignty of Irish citizens. If a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty were to take place in the Czech Republic, according to all indications, it would also not pass. It is necessary to find a solution that a majority of the Irish will be able to accept."
Mr Topolánek concluded that the Czechs are in the deepest part of the continent of Europe, where influences from all its parts converge. "We are at the crossroads of spiritual currents, and it follows that it is our mission to mediate, and mainly to mediate between the east and west. These words are also inspirational at the beginning of 2009, when the task standing before the Czech Republic is to moderate the debate in the European Union for half a year."
European Commission
Speaking of two issues that had faced the incoming Czech presidency, the gas supply crisis and Gaza, Commission President José Manuel BARROSO said "we must show that the EU can face up to these things" and, referring to the European elections in June 2009, "we need to show Europeans why they should play a role in electing the next Parliament".
In 2008, Europe had demonstrated it could take difficult decisions, on climate change and in response to the financial crisis. It had contributed to resolving the conflict between Russia and Georgia and dealt with many other issues. "We must not lose momentum in 2009", he continued. "Europe must show leadership" at the forthcoming G20 meeting. Other issues on the agenda included justice and civil liberties, climate change, a budget review, measures on the financial crisis, the internal energy market, telecoms and road transport. "These are areas where the EU can make a real difference", he stressed.
Returning to the gas supply problem with Russia and Ukraine, he described the situation as "unacceptable and incredible", as supplies had not resumed a day after an agreement to do so was signed. He added "The Commission wishes to send a clear message to Moscow and Kiev. If the agreement is not honoured, the Commission will advise companies to take the suppliers to court. And it will advise Member States to look for alternative supplies. We will soon see if there is just a technical hitch or a lack of political will". At issue was whether Russia and Ukraine could be regarded as "reliable partners". The Commission would in any case bring forward measures to boost the internal energy supply market.
The economic situation was worsening but we must not be fatalistic, said the Commission president. The top priority must be the recovery plan agreed by the Commission and Council. Deploying 1.5% of the EU's GDP would be "significant, if it is well spent". The plan would have a "particular focus on energy supply connections".
Political group speakers
The leader of the EPP-ED group, French MEP Joseph DAUL , believed that the big issues faced by the incoming Czech presidency - the economic downturn, the gas supply crisis and the Middle East - showed that "a united front is the only attitude we can adopt".
On the gas supply issue, he said "we cannot accept that the EU Member States are hostage to this dispute", adding "we need a European energy policy to reduce our dependence".
Turning to the Israel-Palestine crisis, Mr Daul argued that Europe needs "a strategic commitment" to this part of the world. "Are we ready to deploy military means - for peace, not war - as well as financial resources?" he wondered.
Lastly, regarding the economic crisis, he called on the Czech presidency, with the Commission, "to define rules for economic operators" and stressed the need for "a world supervisory system for markets". "We are counting on you to be decisive in this period", he said.
On behalf of the PES group, Martin SCHULZ (DE) argued "what we do in the next six months will be decisive for the European elections". He had been doubtful about some statements made by the Czech presidency in its opening weeks, for example, stressing that "Israel has a right to defend itself" and, on the gas dispute, that "we cannot be the intermediaries", but fortunately those errors had been corrected.
While acknowledging that the economic crisis was "not a defeat for capitalism", Mr Schulz believed "it is a defeat for capitalists". "There were those who in the past said there was no need for rules and regulations" but fortunately the Czech prime minister had now "seen the light" on this matter.
Concluding, the Socialist leader said "we are only strong if we are not divided" and he regretted that differing views had been expressed by EU leaders on the Israel-Palestine crisis and on the gas dispute. "We need a united front" and the Lisbon Treaty would provide a basis for this.
Graham WATSON (ALDE, UK wished the Czech Presidency every success and stated that the experience of the Czech Republic proves the power of markets to lift people out of recession. Referring to the Presidency's work programme, he pointed out that "these are hard times for Europe's citizens ..[..].. your recipe will be contested." He called for an end to the EU's 'umbilical energy dependence' and referred to the implications of the blame game between Russia and the Ukraine. Mr Watson commented that moves to reopen nuclear reactors in Eastern Europe were like the "plot of a Marx brothers film."
He asked the Czech Prime Minister why his country had "delayed yet again ratification of the Lisbon Treaty? ...[and].. why [the Czech Republic is] building a ballistic missile system on European soil?" On the subject of Gaza, Mr Watson pointed out that the European Parliament will never unite around a common position if we seek to apportion blame. In conclusion, he quoted the Czech proverb, 'protect yourself not by fences but by your friends' and reminded the Prime Minister that "this is a union of friends ..[..], equals and partners."
Brian CROWLEY (UEN, IE) began by saying that better political relations need to be created between the EU and the US and he hoped that the Czech Presidency would deal with this in the six months ahead. He referred to the "major challenges facing us all" and to the "very crucial time" at which the Czech Presidency takes over leadership of the EU. He asked the Presidency to guarantee that the EU has "a clear and stronger voice." Mr Crowley paid tribute to both the Czech Presidency and Commissioner Barroso for the 'decisive' action taken on the gas dispute. He pointed to the importance of expanding this idea of an Eastern partnership on the basis of our interdependence on energy and on the economy.
In conclusion, Mr Crowley stated that "we now look to you to give us the next step to where the EU must move" and he quoted John F. Kennedy, who said that "we stand today on the edge of a new frontier but the new frontier of which I speak is not a set of promises, it's a set of challenges."
On the subject of Gaza, Monica FRASSONI (Greens/EFA, IT) pointed out that the EU institutions "should be trying to stop those bombs from falling." She criticised the Czech Presidency's programme as "strongly marked by a rather old-fashioned vision." She used terms like 'old hat' and stated that "I think that you're not really interested in policies, laws or social instruments to respond to the real needs of the citizens of Europe." Ms Frassoni went on to say that "you're out of kilter as far as climate change is concerned" and that the Presidency's approach to the Barcelona process is 'slightly macho', as it seems to be telling women to go back home.
On the subject of immigrants, Ms Frassoni said that "you seem to see them purely from a security point of view." She criticised the Presidency for "not focusing on the consistency and cohesion of our Union" and for not mentioning anti-discrimination. Ms Frassoni said that "it boils down to a programme which sees a world full of danger." She went on to say that energy security and solidarity need to be achieved through 'powerful and concerted action. She asked the Presidency to try and win over the colleagues at the Spring European Council on "the need to make the energy goal binding." Ms Frassoni concluded on the subject of the Treaty of Lisbon, pointing out that is "far from perfect, but very strange that [the Czech Republic hasn't] ratified it yet." She asked the Prime Minister to comment on this.
Miloslav RANSDORF (GUE/NGL, CZ) said we must stop with dogma and prejudice. The Czech Presidency instead should aim for a social economy focussing on innovation which would enable the EU to find a way out of the economic crisis. We need the capacity to change and to be creative, he said. The future belongs to those who are capable of change. He said it was important that we build a Europe that will no longer suffer from an inferiority complex vis-à-vis the USA and welcomed the ambitious goals of the Czech Presidency.
Speaking on behalf of IND/DEM, Vladimír ŽELEZNÝ (CZ) said that an "unfavourable, gloomy picture" has been painted, in particular by the French press, of the Czech presidential term. Yet, against this "bleak" backdrop, the Czech presidency has "reasonable aims and priorities and it will be successful", he said, adding that the Czechs "have a popular and competent President who opposes the Lisbon Treaty". The presidency will prove that a small country can be competent, "and can organise a presidency without being egotistic or using hysterical PR," he concluded.
A non-attached MEP, Jana BOBOŠÍKOVÁ (CZ) said she is proud of the Czech Presidency's dealing of the gas crisis, and hopes that the presidency can demonstrate the same determination when negotiating on the Lisbon Treaty. "You can write history," she said. "You have the chance and power to declare that the Lisbon Treaty is dead after the Irish referendum. You have the opportunity to propose a new visionary document that includes a real common denominator of the Member States interests." This will not prove popular among heads of states, she said, but "you will gain the respect of citizens, who are ignored too often".
British and Irish speakers
Congratulating the Czech President, Timothy KIRKHOPE (EPP-ED, UK) said it is vital that the Russian Government understands that holding nations to ransom is no way to conduct business in the modern world. In relation to the economic crisis, he said that any regulatory changes should be proportionate and sensible. On the future of the transatlantic alliance, he said, it is vital to our security and our prosperity.
Kathy SINNOTT (IND/DEM, IE) said that the Czech Presidency had spelled out an ambitious programme. Such a programme, she said, requires respect between Member States. It also requires respect for the peoples of those Member States to have any hope of success.
Andrew DUFF (ALDE, UK) put four questions to the President-in-Office. "If, as you said, you find the Treaty of Lisbon worse than the Treaty of Nice, why did you sign it? Secondly, will you please confirm that the Czech Republic will not be tempted to follow the Irish example and seek to pull apart the Lisbon package? Thirdly, do you not see a contradiction in coming here and praising the legitimacy of the Parliament but declining to support the Treaty which so greatly increases its powers? Fourthly, can the Czech presidency really have authority unless and until the Czech Republic ratifies the Treaty?"
Noting that the Czech Presidency states that it is doing all it can to enlarge the EU and to admit Croatia, Gary TITLEY (PES, UK) questioned why then can it not ratify the Lisbon Treaty? "After all, the Czech presidency agreed to it and, therefore, should fulfil its obligations." What we need at the moment, Mr Titley said, is leadership, and "what I have seen so far has taught me that the sooner we get a full-time president of the Council the better, because it is only coherent European action that will deliver security to Europe, will deliver world influence and deliver economic recovery. "
Proinsias DE ROSSA (PES, IE) said he was appalled by the comments made earlier by the President-in-Office, that the Lisbon (Treaty) is worse than (the Treaty of) Nice. That is not only untrue, it is divisive and it is a breach of trust. Ireland, he said, will probably have a referendum on a clarified Lisbon Treaty in the autumn of this year. Mr De Rossa said he will work hard to ensure a positive outcome for Ireland and Europe. "Your comments here today have made that task much harder. If the referendum fails, Sir, you will not be thanked by the vast majority of Europeans".
John BOWIS (EPP-ED, UK) hoped that the President in-Office will have a particular insight into the struggle in Gaza and understand the pain and the frustration of the people of Gaza and the people of Israel. He hoped that a stop would be put to the slaughter that is going on there. Other items for the agenda include climate change, cross-border health, free movement of knowledge, especially in the area of medical science and mental health. With regard to the mental health pact for the EU, he hoped that the President-in-Office would ensure it is on the agenda as an item to be furthered because it is to benefit those people who are vulnerable and need support.

EP President Pöttering expresses "deepest regret" over the Gaza conflict
2009-01-19 - 14:29
At the opening of the plenary session on Monday, EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering expressed his "deepest regret" over the escalation of the Gaza conflict between Israel and Hamas, calling for an "immediate end to the violence on both sides". "It is not acceptable for people to continue to suffer, for violence to continue, and now United Nations staff are under fire. How far must the spiral of violence continue before commonsense and reason gain the upper-hand?" he asked. President Pöttering strongly criticised Hamas for ending the ceasefire by firing rockets on Israel, and criticised Israel's "disproportionate reaction". "A state's inviolable right to protect itself does not justify violent acts which affect first and foremost civilian populations," he said.
( MEPs debated the situation in Gaza and Israel on Wednesday 14 January in the afternoon and a resolution was adopted on Thursday, 15 January 2009 .)
Position of Parliament
President Pöttering stated that the EP "stands right behind the calls expressed by the European Council of Ministers as confirmed by the UN resolution of 8 January, 2008. This legally binding resolution is not being respected by either side - Hamas and Israel".
He noted that 2008 was the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, a year which offered a sign of hope, demonstrating that there is "no need for a clash of civilisation", but the Gaza conflict has shown how quickly these efforts can be "wiped out".
Solutions
"The peace process must be resumed and intensified. There needs to be a two-state solution with Israel and Palestine as two sovereign states in secure borders. Together with the Quartet, the Moderate Arab Partners and the parties in conflict, the European union, under the aegis of the United Nations, must bring about a rapid resumption of the peace negotiations."
"It is no longer a process of negotiations; we are in a process of escalation. We are now thinking in terms of crisis management", he said. "Peace in the Middle East cannot be solved solely by the region itself. The international community must be ready, more than ever before to promote peace, in the Middle East, in order for the bitter events of the past decades not to be perpetuated into forthcoming decades", he added.
International intervention must enable peace negotiations
Pointing to negotiations in the last decade, President Pöttering said the Franco-Egyptian plan to set up an international mechanism to secure the Gaza borders must be a success. "At the beginning of the Annapolis process, the European Union already announced in its strategic paper that it was prepared to get involved, and contribute its commitment".
However, he stressed that any deployment of international security forces must be part of "an overall political objective" which creates trust, enables peace negotiations to take place, and guarantees "equal security for Israel and the Palestinians".
"As responsible politicians we must contribute resolutely to a lasting exit from the spiralling violence," he concluded.

Gaza: European Parliament calls for an immediate and permanent ceasefire and a negotiated truce
2009-01-19 - 14:29
In adopting a resolution on the situation in the Gaza strip, MEPs call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire which should include the halt to rocket attacks by Hamas on Israel and the end of Israel's military action in Gaza. MEPs call for a negotiated truce that should be guaranteed by a mechanism which could include the dispatching of a multinational presence. MEPs encourage the diplomatic efforts so far undertaken by the international community, especially Egypt and the EU. MEPs urge the Israeli authorities to allow the international press in the Gaza strip and to guarantee that there is continuous and sufficient flow of the aid through humanitarian corridors.
MEPs call for a negotiated truce that should be guaranteed by a mechanism, to be set up by the international community coordinated by the Quartet and the Arab League, which could include the dispatching of a multinational presence.
Humanitarian assistance
The House requests the Israeli authorities to allow an unimpeded access to humanitarian assistance and aid to the Gaza Strip and to guarantee that the continuous and sufficient flow of the aid through humanitarian corridors. MEPs agree on the necessity of urgently providing the re-opening of the crossing points, the lifting of the blockade and the prevention of smuggling of illicit trafficking in arms and ammunition.
MEPs express their shock at the suffering of the civilian population in Gaza and deplore that civilian and UN targets have been hit during the attacks. They also express their sympathy for the civilian population affected by the violence in Gaza and in Southern Israel.
End to rocket attacks
The resolution calls on Israel to fulfil its obligations under international law and international humanitarian law. The European Parliament calls on Hamas to end rocket attacks and to assume its own responsibilities by committing itself to a political process aimed at restoring inter-Palestinian dialogue and contributing to the ongoing process of negotiation.
MEPs stress the need to renew the efforts for inter-Palestinian reconciliation between all the components of the Palestinian society based on the Mecca agreement of February 2007. This agreement implied the acceptance of the previous agreements including the right of Israel to exist; and underline, in this respect, the need for a permanent geographical connection between, and the peaceful and lasting political reunification of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
Debate - Wednesday, 14 January 2009
European Parliament debates the conflict in Gaza and Israel
In the debate on Wednesday, the vast majority of speakers called for an immediate ceasefire and a negotiated truce. In the resolution voted on in Strasbourg, MEPs express their shock at the suffering of the civilian population in Gaza and deplore that civilian and UN targets have been hit during the attacks. They also express their sympathy for the civilian population affected by the violence in Gaza and in Southern Israel.
Presidency of the Council
Opening the debate for the Council, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg spoke of " the dramatic situation in the Middle East". He described the humanitarian crisis in detail and pointed out that "since 4 November of last year, foreign NGO personnel have not been allowed access to Gaza to deliver and monitor humanitarian aid properly".
The minister believed that "The outlines of a solution to the crisis have started to emerge. First and foremost there must be an unconditional halt to rocket attacks by Hamas on Israel and an end to Israeli military action to enable the sustained delivery of humanitarian aid and the restoration of public services and badly needed medical treatment".
In addition, "The deployment of an international mission to monitor implementation of the ceasefire and to act as a liaison between the two sides could be helpful. In this regard, the European Union is ready to return its observers".
However, "even a durable and comprehensive solution to Gaza will not be sufficient to install peace in the region", he said. " We need a new and inclusive strategy that addresses the internal Palestinian political situation as well as the resumption of the peace talks".
Mr Schwarzenberg emphasised that the EU is prepared "to support any Palestinian government that pursues policies and measures reflecting the Quartet’s principles" but that "urgent and greater effort by the parties will be needed to achieve a comprehensive peace based on the vision of a region where two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, live side by side in peace with secure and recognized borders".
European Commission
The Gaza conflict is now in its third week, and every day the statistics worsen", said External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner , citing evidence of extreme burns, acute shortages of food and medicine, and the destruction of homes and infrastructure. Immense human suffering has been caused both by Hamas' rockets and Israel's military action, she added.
Beyond its immediate impact, the conflict "pushes the prospect of peace ever further away", and "has a negative impact stability throughout the region", she continued.
Ms Ferrero-Waldner stressed the need for an immediate ceasefire to allow humanitarian aid into the Gaza strip, and then an "unconditional halt" to Hamas' rocket attacks and Israeli military action.
The EU Troika had "prepared the way" for the ceasefire plan tabled by France's President Sarkozy, who now chairs the Security Council, and their co-ordinated diplomacy had helped to achieve temporary ceasefire "lulls" to allow in humanitarian aid, she said.
The ceasefire call was a key item by UN Security Council Resolution 1860, noted Ms Ferrerro-Waldner, adding that the smuggling of arms through the Gaza-Egypt tunnels must be halted, the "Philadelphia corridor" along Gaza's Egyptian border policed, and border crossings opened for humanitarian aid. The Palestinian Authority had accepted these requirements, but Israel and Hamas were "still studying" them. "Maybe, in a few days, we shall have a real ceasefire" she said.
Both Israel and Hamas had rejected Resolution 1860, noted Ms Ferrero-Waldner, who nonetheless hoped that with the help of Egypt and Turkey, a lasting solution could be worked out soon. "We must halt the endless cycle of destruction and reconstruction", she said.
In the long run, the conflict would weaken confidence between Palestine and Israel, she added, stressing the need to resume talks for a negotiated political settlement as soon as hostilities cease. "Israel cannot afford to waste time in achieving peace", she said.
Political group speakers
"Seventeen days' fighting have left a deeply depressing balance sheet of destruction, chaos, hatred, and vengeance", said José Ignacio SALAFRANCA SÁNCHEZ-NEYRA (EPP-ED, ES), adding that "you can win all the battles except the most important one, which is for peace".
Mr Salafranca called for an immediate ceasefire, in line with UN Security Council Resolution 1860, and for humanitarian measures to alleviate the misery in the Gaza strip. "Hamas is both a cause and a consequence of these dreadful circumstances", he said.
Martin SCHULZ (DE), speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group, acknowledged that debates of this kind are difficult for all concerned. "Israel is a friend of ours," he said, "but that makes it all the more important that we can talk to them about controversial aspects of these matters." "Israel has the right to defend itself against those who want to destroy it; but it has to use proportionate means, within international law, and I think we would agree that the means they are using are not proportionate," he said.
While recognising that Hamas does not share our values, Mr Schulz insisted that it should be possible to talk to them, and if Israel is not able to talk to Hamas, we should be looking for others means of dialogue through the Quartet. "Neither terrorism nor conventional weaponry will find a solution; this must come from international mediation," he said.
Annemie NEYTS-UYTTEBROECK (BE) speaking for the ALDE group, said that an international force may well be needed to end this conflict and urged the EU to participate in such a force. "The EU needs to act and to speak clearly," she said, "The USA also needs to be involved, as does the Arab League and its members," she said.
Cristiana MUSCARDINI (UEN, IT), asserted that dialogue with terrorists should not be justified by civilian deaths, because there was a risk that this would justify terrorist violence in the future. But the EU needs to make sure that humanitarian needs are met so that 'Israeli and Palestinian needs can be met side by side".
For the Greens/EFA, Daniel COHN-BENDIT (FR) said hope for peace and security is "evaporating very quickly", adding that security has to be nurtured. Recalling Mr Shultz's words, he said we need to both protect Israel from itself and protect the Palestinians from Hamas. Council should stop thinking about upgrading its relationship with Israel, and the Palestinians need help to revolt against Hamas, he concluded.
Luisa MORGANTINI (GUE/NGL, IT) pointed out that that while people are dying, so too are human rights and the dream of Europe for universal respect. "We are not being effective," she said. "We need to understand with absolute clarity that this war, and Israel's attempt to solve things militarily, won't help Israel, it will put an end to Israel as a moral force."
Bastiaan BELDER (IND/DEM, NL) said that Palestine is inextricably an Islamic territory. The Islamic movement has stuck to this principle, he said. It is supported by the Muslim movement in Iran. There is no place for the State of Israel in the Middle East. The effect of this totalitarianism is this bloody conflict. As far as Hamas is concerned it benefits from all of this warfare. If Europe wants to ensure the survival of the state of Israel then there will be a confrontation with Hamas. The ceasefire is simply a break for Hamas; it won't be a permanent one, he concluded.
Luca ROMAGNOLI (NI, IT) said that the vast majority of the House would agree to the calls for peace. I think we need to have the idea of an international peace corridor and it can't simply be something in Gaza, he said. It must cover all Palestinian territory. We need to find a two people - two state solution, he said. A military solution simply won't be workable and viable. And war never solves the problems in the holy land.
British and Irish speakers
Jim ALLISTER (NI, UK) said that the situation is demonstrably clear. Israel, he said, accepts a two-state solution while Hamas cannot even abide the right of Israel to exist and thus unleashes endless relentless terrorist attacks upon its territory. And when after much forbearance, he said, Israel hits back, they cry victim. "Sorry: they are the perpetrators and if they want peace the answer lies in their own hands. Stop shelling Israel."
Reporting that he was in Gaza three days ago, Chris DAVIES (ALDE, UK) said that "this is not a proportionate response of a civilised power. It is evil. Yes, the Hamas rockets must stop. I have said so to Hamas representatives in Gaza myself before now, but let us have no more sanctimonious talk from Israeli officials about the need to fight terrorism, because Palestinians being bombed could name terrorists and they would name Olmert, Livni and Barak." "Mr Davies could think of no occasion in the past that the European Union ever backed up its criticism of the treatment of Palestinians by the Israelis with any kind of action. "We give a green light to Israel to proceed as it would wish and we have compounded that failure by ignoring the lessons of history. You cannot make peace without talking to your enemies, yet we refuse to talk to the elected representatives of the Palestinian people. Now we are completing negotiations with Israel on an enhanced cooperation agreement. We do not plan to condemn Israel: we intend to reward it. Those who want peace in the Middle East, those who want to see justice for both sides, must recognise that it is time to think again."
Speaking in Irish, Seán Ó NEACHTAIN (UEN, IE) said that the war going on in Gaza is terrifying and scandalous A military solution will never succeed in the Middle East - a political solution is the only way of ensuring peace and reconciliation in that area and an end must be put immediately to this violence. Mr O'Neachtain said that he supports the setting up of a Palestinian durable independent state but it must have a proper economy and proper political plan. Our aim, he said, must be that there will be two states that will mutually respect each other. Israel certainly has the right to defend itself but it has gone much too far with these attacks which are immoral and the international community cannot condone them. The peace process in the Middle East must be revived immediately and he hoped that the newly elected President of the United States Obama will work and prioritise this and he wished him every success in this and in his future post.
While Kathy SINNOTT (IND/DEM, IE) wholeheartedly agreed that Israelis have a right to live without the threat of rocket attacks, what is being done in Gaza is not justice, it is slaughter. That the devastation is perpetuated by a supposedly western nation is unfathomable. There is no excuse, she said, there is no possible justification. Ms Sinnott called on Parliament and all EU bodies to impose trade sanctions on Israel immediately and to keep them in place until a meaningful ceasefire is agreed. "If we do any less than our utmost to stop this killing, we become accessories to the slaughter."
Struan STEVENSON (EPP-ED, UK) said that Iran has supplied missiles, munitions and other sophisticated weaponry to Hamas for years. "It has provided money and training for Hamas fighters. Its objective was to provoke Israel into a ground war and the bloody result, with gruesome photos of dead children on TV screens and newspapers around the world, is the best possible recruiting sergeant for fundamentalist Islam and the Iranian mullahs’ vision of a global Islamist movement united against the West".The West, he said, has done nothing to confront or expose Iranian aggression. Faced with mounting evidence of the Mullahs’ sponsorship of terror, the West has gone out of its way to appease Teheran, even agreeing to its primary demand of disabling the main Iranian opposition movement, The People’s Mujahedin of Iran by placing it on the EU Terror List. This must stop, he concluded.
Richard HOWITT (PES, UK) said that the UN Security Resolution should be implemented without delay. We must, he said, see a ceasefire and an end to the blockade so that the people of Gaza can begin to live their lives. There is, he said, an issue of respect for international humanitarian law. "Human Rights Watch and Islamic Relief have told me that the three-hour daily pause is simply woefully inadequate to get in and to distribute aid. It is an issue of proportionality. Save the Children say that the killing of 139 children since the conflict began, with 1 271 injured, cannot be justified as self-defence. "Mr Howitt welcomed the statement today by the EU envoy in Israel, Ramiro Cibrian-Uzal, who said that the EU and Israel have put negotiations on the upgrading of relations ‘on hold’ at this time for these reasons.
Geoffrey VAN ORDEN (EPP-ED, UK) expressed his deepest sympathy to all the innocent people, both in Israel and in Gaza, who have suffered in recent weeks and months as conflict rages. But, he said, we need to take care that our natural humanity, our very justified concerns, do not distort our view of the true nature of the situation that we are dealing with. The sad reality, he said, is that the Palestinian people have been atrociously served over many years by those who have control over Palestine Authority areas; by the international community, which has tolerated extremism and corruption; and by the Arab world, which has done nothing practical over many decades to improve their lives or prospects. We need a Marshall Plan for the Middle East. It is not just peacekeepers that the Palestinians need but a decent civil administration, free from corruption. The civil administration needs to be put under international control, but, first, the terrorist lifeline – weapons, monies and political indulgence – must be cut.
The fundamental point for Proinsias DE ROSSA (PES, IE) is that: we have to stop the bombing, whether it is coming from Hamas or coming from Israel. He hoped the resolution accompanying this debate will receive a strong vote in this House tomorrow, and he also hoped that it will strengthen the hands of the Commission and the Council in pressuring both Israel and Hamas to stop the killing. "Since Israel withdrew from Gaza it has turned it into the largest prison in the world, and for the last three weeks it has turned it into a slaughterhouse, illegally using terror against terror, killing civilian men, women and children, and killing the possibility of a viable two-state solution in the process. "There can, he said, be no upgrading of Europe’s relations with Israel so long as it fails to engage in constructive and substantive negotiations with its neighbours and all the Palestinian elected members, including Hamas. It should be made clear by Europe that any escalation of this war on Gaza will be followed by an escalation of our reaction to that war, he concluded.
Gay MITCHELL (EPP-ED, IE) said that Israel has a right to peaceful coexistence in the region, but we would have to be turnips not to feel emotional upset and moral shame at what is happening at present in Gaza. The Israeli response is totally disproportionate and the deaths of young children are particularly shameful. He added that yesterday a note on the humanitarian needs of the region was distributed to those of who attended the joint meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Development Committee. He urged the Commission and the Council to ensure that a totally comprehensive humanitarian aid package is ready so that we can move in there and help these suffering people at the first opportunity.
Clearly the EU cannot resolve this crisis said Sajjad KARIM (EPP-ED, UK).We need the resolve of the USA. Their disappointing response has been imbalanced and unjust. The timing of these actions by Israel has been strategically calculated, but, Mr Obama, 20 January is fast approaching. The world is waiting and the EU is a willing partner. Colleagues wanting to break Hamas with military means alone, go and see Gaza and the West Bank. Reawaken your basic humanity and you will see why Hamas gains strength. This is not the way to help Israel or Palestinians. An immediate ceasefire is only a necessary start.
Colm BURKE (EPP-ED, IE) said that there must be accountability in international law where such warfare principles as proportionality and non-discrimination are not respected. While acknowledging the fact that Hamas began the rocket attacks against Israel, Mr Burke was of the opinion that the Israeli reaction has been disproportionate. The numbers speak for themselves: over 900 Palestinians have been killed in contrast to a much smaller number of Israelis. Israel must realise its responsibility to measure its use of force right away in compliance with international law. On the other hand, he said, it cannot be overlooked that Hamas is still listed as a terrorist organisation by the EU and continues to refuse to renounce its arms struggle. Not only that, but Hamas has consistently declined to recognise Israel’s right to exist. Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups must recognise that the people of southern Israel have a right to live without bombardment, he concluded.
Neena GILL (PES, UK) said that calls by the world community for an immediate ceasefire are falling on deaf ears. Palestinians need urgent access to food, medical aid and security. Israel must, at the very least, respect the principles of international law. Unless it does so, Israel should lose any remaining support it has from the international community. It is unfortunate, she said, that the UN’s resolution has been sidelined. It is also regrettable that the EU still needs to find a role. Perhaps it can do so if it takes stronger measures than it has done so far. It is not enough just to put the upgrading of the relationship on ice. We have leverage. We are a major trading partner. We are a major funder in that region. So we are able to exercise that role.
Christopher BEAZLEY (EPP-ED, UK) said that the Israeli people are a just and honourable people who have suffered miserably throughout the centuries in this continent. They will understand your recommendation to the Council of Ministers now that the EU should withdraw any contact with the Israeli authorities until they stop the bombing.
Speaking in Irish, Bairbre DE BRÚN (GUE/NGL, UK) supported those who condemned Israeli attacks on Gaza and showed solidarity with the people of Gaza. The EU, she said, should abandon the upgrading of relations with Israel and put all current agreements on hold with Israel until it lives up to its obligations under international law. Even before the escalation of Israeli violence, we saw Israel's collective punishments of Palestinians in Gaza. The type and scale of attacks by a modern army on the besieged Palestinian people already weakened because of isolation and occupation is terrible. Simply blaming the Palestinians is wrong. We must be clear when we say that the main victims of this war are the innocent people of Gaza, she concluded.

Russia and Ukraine both lost credibility as reliable energy providers say MEPs
2009-01-19 - 14:29
The European Parliament debated the latest developments in the Russia-Ukraine-EU gas crisis with many group speakers stressing that Russia and Ukraine should solve their disputes rapidly without blaming one side or the other. EU citizens are suffering, MEPs said, due to a bilateral dispute. MEPs said that both Russia and Ukraine had lost credibility as reliable partners and the EU should therefore increase its efforts to diversity its energy supply mix. Alexandr Vonda , Czech deputy prime minister for European affairs, outlined the events leading up to the crisis, including the contacts between the Czech presidency of the EU and Russia and Ukraine. He also described measures agreed by the Council for tackling the gas supply problem.
The minister said the key objective of the Presidency had been to have gas supplies restored immediately and he assured the House that everything was being done, at political and technical level, to prompt Ukraine and Russia to restore full contractual gas supplies to Europe "and to minimise the negative consequences to our citizens and economies until that is the case".
However, the Czech Presidency was also aware of the consensus among the Member States that short, medium and long term solutions be adopted without delay that would prevent similar situations from recurring in the future.
These would include "the creation of a functional and efficient solidarity mechanism" as "one of the corner stones of the future EU energy security". This solidarity "presupposes interconnection of European energy networks as well as improvement of energy infrastructure" among other things.
Furthermore, "the EU needs to diversify its gas resources and supply routes. In addition, it was clear that "EU energy security is not feasible unless internal energy market is completed and functional. He looked forward to close cooperation with Parliament on the second reading compromise on the Third Energy Package.
European Commission
"We are living through one of the most serious energy crises yet - comparable with the 1970s oil crisis", said Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs .
"Despite promises and the protocol signed on Monday, gas is not yet flowing from Russia through Ukraine", he admitted, noting that although Russia had resumed gas deliveries on Tuesday (at one-third of normal flow), Ukraine had stopped them, arguing that Russia had chosen a difficult entry point, and that this had happened again on Wednesday.
"The two parties must co-ordinate on entry points and volumes", failing which "there will be no energy supply" said Mr Piebalgs, adding that both had "lost their reputations as reliable energy suppliers".
Mr Piebalgs believed the measures taken to be "sufficient", but still saw a lack of contact and co-ordination. "The solution is in the hands of the two parties - but do they want a solution?", he asked.
Any fix now would be temporary, and negotiations for a lasting solution could continue through the EU's Czech Presidency to the Swedish one, he predicted, stressing the need for strategic energy policy decisions to reduce reliance on external suppliers.
Mr Piebalgs also highlighted a "lack of interconnection infrastructure" for carrying gas from storage to where it is needed, saying there was not enough commercial interest in providing such connections.
The 2004 gas supply security directive (2004/67/EC) does not meet current needs, and a proposal to revise it, including a "Community co-ordination mechanism" will reach Parliament in the coming weeks, said Mr Piebalgs.
Mr Piebalgs thanked the European Parliament for its conciliation efforts, and in particular President Hans-Gert Pöttering, and Jacek Saryusz-Wolski (EPP-ED PL). The political weight of debates like this one would encourage the parties to resolve their disputes, he said.
Political group speakers
Jacek SARYUSZ-WOLSKI (EPP-ED, PL) said that major supply disruptions like these are "dramatic for citizens, industry and jobs" adding that "in the elections, we shall have to answer questions about what we have done".
The first such crisis, three years previously, had made it clear that "we need a common policy on energy", said Mr Saryuzs-Wolski. The EPP-ED group had backed this call from the start, and its call for a comprehensive strategy had in turn been backed by all groups, he continued.
The Commission had taken up some recommendations, but this was not enough to prevent similar situations, he continued, stressing the need for lasting, systemic solutions which he said would entail the EU speaking with a single voice to producers and transit countries. To this end, he asked: "Can we buy direct at the Ukrainian border? Can the EU step in and take up transit issues with Ukraine? What instruments of pressure does the EU have?"
The EPP-ED group wants Parliament to be permanently and closely involved, and has already established a contact group with the Russian and Ukrainian parliaments, he concluded.
Hannes SWOBODA (PES, AT) said that from the discussions the Parliament has had with representatives of Gazprom and Naftogaz, he could agree with the Commissioner that neither company has been acting responsibly .
He expressed concern that the current situation could have been foreseen and we needed now to draw the consequences so that such a crisis could be avoided in the future.
It is one thing for us to talk about gas market liberalisation, he said, but we need to be creating a lot more inter-connectors between countries, like the Nabucco pipeline , and the market will not be creating these. It is the same for gas reserves, he said: "It is unacceptable that some countries have only limited gas supplies or do not inform the other countries what reserves they really have."
Speaking for the ALDE group, István SZENT-IVÁNYI (HU) said that Europe cannot be held hostage any longer since millions have no heating and hundreds of thousands are at risk of losing their jobs.
"We need to tell both Kiev and Moscow that they must live up to their international commitments and that there will be serious consequences if they do not - we have to make it clear that there will be a political price to pay."
Hanna FOLTYN-KUBICKA (UEN, PL) said that the gas crisis is a long-term one and that it is not just economic but political. "Behind Gazprom's demands is the political machinery of the Kremlin and the Kremlin is attempting to extend its dominance across the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
Rebecca HARMS (Greens/EFA, DE) congratulated the Czech Presidency on its handling of the gas crisis, claiming that "nothing could have been done better than we what we have done so far". Noting that the gas dispute and commodities trade were merely elements of a bigger picture, she said it is important to clarify the EU's stance on the matter. "What is the EU going to do vis-à-vis countries that are sitting on the fence somewhere between Russia and the EU?" she asked.
Speaking on behalf of GUE/NGL, Esko SEPPÄNEN (FI) unwillingly thanked the Commission for playing the role of mediator and "psychiatrist" in the Russian and Ukrainian dispute. He said EU sanctions "are not the right approach", pointing out that not all countries are in a position to boycott Russian gas.
Gerard BATTEN (IND/DEM, UK), quoting a previous speech made by his fellow IND-DEM MEP Godfrey Bloom, said that the idea of the UK's energy supplies being controlled by "a gangster like Vladimir Putin" was madness. The UK must ensure it held on to its own "dwindling natural gas supplies" and did not subordinate them to a common EU energy policy. It should also "embark on a programme for building new nuclear power stations".
Jana BOBOŠÍKOVÁ (NI, CZ) maintained that the poor in particular were "paying a high price for the EU's short-sighted energy policy". Some Union Member States, she argued, had stood in the way of a strategic agreement with Russia, preferring instead to back the Ukrainian Orange Revolution. "We see now how important it is for individual Member States to be energy self-sufficient", she concluded.
British MEPs in the debate
Giles CHICHESTER (EPP-ED, UK) said that Member States are at risk of over-dependence on gas imports from one dominant supplier and "we need to take action to safeguard security of supply." Member States must bite the bullet and be prepared to pay for adequate gas storage facilities and stocks. Agreeing a level of how many days’ supply constitutes a reasonable reserve would be a good start, he said. Diversifying supplies is another obvious step to take and the construction of LNG terminals around Europe is a good example. Looking at the Nord Stream and Nabucco pipeline projects in a more favourable light seems logical. We need to redouble efforts to improve efficiency and increase conservation of energy in electricity consumption – both in industrial use and domestic consumption. There are huge savings to be achieved.
Above all, he said, we need to rebalance our energy mix and to do so with the twin objectives of security of supply and climate change policy. By increasing the share of electricity from renewables, nuclear energy and clean coal technology, we can do both, but each of these options takes time to deliver and, in the mean time, we must tackle improving energy efficiency with urgency and imagination.
Charles TANNOCK (EPP-ED, UK) said that Ukraine is currently obliged to pay an intermediary company an extra USD 500 million a year. Given that Ukraine’s gas debt to Russia is USD 2.4 billion, the debt could have been wiped off in about five years by scrapping this payment, which, allegedly, according to the deputy prime minister of Ukraine, ends up in the pockets of corrupt politicians. We need, he said, to resist any attempt to drive a wedge between Ukraine and its future with the West, and in particular its future as a full member of the European Union. The best way to ensure that Russia can no longer bully or put pressure on Ukraine, or even provoke the EU into bullying Ukraine to settle, is to champion a common EU external energy security policy which will show solidarity between the Member States at times of crisis and energy shortage.
John PURVIS (EPP-ED,UK) drew three conclusions from the impasse with Russia and Ukraine.
1 Reduce dependency on gas, more and more of which will have to be imported. This means increasing our commitment to indigenous energy, including especially renewables and nuclear power. 2. Improve EU solidarity with mutual support between the Member States for electricity, gas and oil supplies. This implies much improved and extended grids and pipelines. These gaps in the gas grid must be closed, urgently. What is the timing for this, Commissioner Piebalgs? 3. Diversify our sources of supply and our storage facilities for gas and oil. Why are we not making fuller use of the depleted southern North Sea gas fields for storage?
Our liquefied gas infrastructure, he said, must be greatly expanded and pipeline systems developed from alternative sources and through alternative routings. We need better and more connections with Norway, with North Africa and West Africa, with the Caspian and Caucasus, with the Levant and Gulf States in the Middle East.
Concluding, Mr Purvis asked the Commission and Council if they are promoting renewables and nuclear urgently enough, investing sufficiently in the construction of pipelines and LNG terminals and in developing the political relationships which will ensure continuity and diversity of supply.
Fiona HALL (ALDE, UK) highlighted the importance of controlling energy demand. We have, she said, a 20%-by-2020 EU energy efficiency improvement target and a number of pieces of legislation focussed on energy saving. These energy efficiency actions will not only help to tackle climate change and fuel poverty: they will also very significantly improve Europe’s energy security. There is of course a good reason why the Commission’s action plan on energy efficiency has an international element to it and recognises the importance of encouraging energy efficiency improvements in countries outside Europe, not least countries supplying and transiting energy to Europe. The fact is, if they use less, we are likely to get more. That is important above and beyond the immediate political side to this crisis.
Eluned MORGAN (PSE, UK) highlighted the need for the EU to speak with one voice on energy issues. Negotiations on the second reading of the energy liberalisation package will be starting shortly, she said. The Commission came up with a very carefully crafted position on third countries investing in the EU, suggesting that the Commission speak on behalf of the EU on these issues. "What have you in the Council done? You have retreated to national positions and said, no – we Member States we want the final say, not the Commission. Until you understand, she said, that pooling your powers to gain more leverage internationally is the way to go, we will always be in a position where we are vulnerable. You must answer the European citizens as to why they are now sitting in the cold. You have to change your position on this line. Will you do so?"

MEPs approve pesticides legislation
2009-01-19 - 14:29
The European Parliament today approved new EU pesticides legislation which will increase the number of pesticides available in Member States, while in due course banning the use of certain dangerous chemicals in these products. Measures to ensure the safer use of pesticides in daily life will also be introduced. Voting at second reading on the basis of agreements reached with the Council in December, MEPs overwhelmingly approved a regulation on placing plant protection products on the market as well as a directive on the sustainable use of pesticides.
Toxic chemicals will be banned but producers can sell more easily across borders
The key points of the regulation, which deals with the production and licensing of pesticides, are as follows.
A positive list of approved "active substances" (the chemical ingredients of pesticides) is to be drawn up at EU level. Pesticides will then be licensed at national level on the basis of this list.
Certain highly toxic chemicals will be banned unless exposure to them would in practice be negligible, namely those which are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction, those which are endocrine-disrupting, and those which are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) or very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB).
For developmental neurotoxic and immunotoxic substances, higher safety standards may be imposed.
If a substance is needed to combat a serious danger to plant health, it may be approved for up to five years even if it does not meet the above safety criteria.
Products containing certain hazardous substances are to be replaced if safer alternatives are shown to exist. MEPs successfully demanded a shorter deadline for their replacement, of three years rather than five.
Substances likely to be harmful to honeybees will be outlawed.
Manufacturers and pesticide users will benefit because:
Member States will be able to license pesticide products at national level or through mutual recognition. The EU will be divided into three zones (north, centre and south) with compulsory mutual recognition within each zone as the basic rule. This will make it easier for manufacturers to gain approval for their products across borders within a given zone and thus make more pesticides available to users more quickly. However, following pressure from MEPs, individual States will be entitled to adopt additional conditions or restrictions on the use of new pesticides approved within their zone, and even refuse approval for pesticides if they can adduce special environmental or agricultural circumstances.
Product approval times will be speeded up, as Member States will have to decide on mutual recognition within 120 days. Until now there has been no deadline.
The new legislation will only gradually supersede existing EU law. Pesticides that can be placed on the market under current legislation will remain available until their existing authorisation expires. There will thus be no sudden or large-scale withdrawal of products from the market. The agreement with Council was based on a scientific assessment by the Swedish Chemicals Agency that only around 22 dangerous substances are likely to be removed from the market as a result of the new safety criteria.
Hiltrud Breyer (Greens/EFA, DE), the MEP who steered this legislation through Parliament, said: "This agreement is a win-win situation, not only for the environment, public health and consumer protection but also for the European economy, since it will lead to more innovation, placing the EU at the forefront of this sector".
Reducing pesticide use and managing it better
The main points of the directive on the sustainable use of pesticides are as follows.
The principle of Integrated Pest Management is laid down, i.e. the promotion of non-chemical pest control methods such as crop rotation, to be used wherever possible as alternatives to pesticides.
Member States must adopt National Action Plans for reducing "risks and impacts" of pesticide use on human health and the environment, including timetables and targets for use reduction. MEPs dropped their demand for a specific reduction target of 50% for chemical substances of particular concern, to help secure a deal with the Council.
Aerial crop spraying will in general be banned, albeit with exceptions subject to approval by the authorities. No spraying will be allowed in close proximity to residential areas.
Member States must take measures to protect the aquatic environment and drinking water supplies from the impact of pesticides. These are to include "buffer zones" around bodies of water and "safeguard zones" for any surface and groundwater used for drinking water. There must also be protected areas along roads and railways.
The use of pesticides must be minimised or prohibited in specific areas used by the general public or by vulnerable groups, such as parks, public gardens, sports and recreation grounds, school grounds and playgrounds and in the close vicinity of healthcare facilities.
New rules are introduced on the training of pesticide users and salespeople, on handling and storage, on information and awareness-raising and on the inspection of pesticides application equipment.
The directive must be implemented by the Member States by early 2011. The MEP responsible for its passage through Parliament, Christa Klaß (EPP-ED, DE), said "This directive is a step in right direction to protect European consumers and the environment. The aim is to use as few pesticides as possible, but at the right time and in the right dosage." She stressed "Risk management is the key, with training for professional users and adequate information for private users".
Both pieces of legislation must now be endorsed by the Council but this should be a formality in view of the agreement reached in December. Texts, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 13 January)

Euro
European Parliament marks ten years of the euro
2009-01-19 - 14:29
EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering welcomed ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, Eurogroup chair Jean-Claude Juncker, Economics Commissioner Joaquín Almunia and former French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing for a formal session marking ten years of the euro. In his opening speech, EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering called the common currency "a bastion of economic stability", saying that "the creation of the euro was a logical development for a growing economic community". "Today, in the European Parliament we are celebrating one of the most important historical decisions made in the European Union," he said.
In spite of scepticism surrounding the planned common currency, after ten years "we can see that the euro has created a lot of trust, and has offered a lot of benefits for EU citizens and companies", he said, adding that with the majority of trade being internal to the euro areas, it "is better prepared to protect Member States from external shocks".
The euro a "decisive element for stability"
Pointing to the worldwide financial crisis, the EP President said the euro has proved to be "a decisive element for stability", with the European System of Central Banks acting as "a stabilising factor". "The common currency has protected us from the worst consequences of the worst financial crisis since the 1930s", he said.
Hans Gert-Pöttering cited Ireland as a country that had been particularly hard-hit by the financial crisis, but its membership of the common currency meant it had been "defended from a much worse crisis".
A positive sign of EU integration
The creation of the euro was not solely an economic decision, he said. "It was a strong signal that the European Union can make far reaching decisions in order to create a common future based on prosperity. The common currency is seen as one of the most positive developments and a positive sign of integration of the EU by many citizens."
Today, more than half of the Member States have adopted the euro, with Slovakia becoming the 16th member of the eurozone. "I'm confident that when we celebrate the next birthday of the euro we will have yet more members and the goal should be that all Member States of the European Union, on the basis of the stability criteria, adopt the common currency."
Trichet: euro "one of the great achievements of Europe"
ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet told MEPs that the euro was "one of the great achievements of Europe... One day it will be seen as decisive step on road to ever closer union of peoples of Europe."
"Since the introduction of the euro, fellow Europeans have enjoyed a level of price stability which previously had been achieved in only a few of the euro area countries. This price stability is a direct benefit to all citizens. It protects incomes and savings, and it helps to bring down borrowing costs, thus promoting investment, job creation and prosperity over the medium and long term. The single currency has been a factor of dynamism for the European economy. It has enhanced price transparency, increased trade, and promoted economic and financial integration within the euro area and with the rest of the world."
"A large steady ship is better in turbulent waters"
"In recent months we have seen another benefit of the euro: the financial crisis is demonstrating that in turbulent financial waters it is better to be on a large, solid and steady ship rather than on a small vessel." We could, he said, be proud of the reaction of the European authorities to the crisis.
The euro, he said, was now firmly established as a stable currency with a sound central bank. Its future success would depend on how well Europe reacted to the weaknesses revealed in the global financial system, firm implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and constant efforts to render our economies more productive, while avoiding competitive divergences between Member States, as well as properly handling future enlargement. "This is certainly a time for celebration, but not for complacency," he said.
Juncker: Europe's determination to see ambitious plans realised
Eurgroup Chair Jean-Claude Juncker said "Europe has often showed the ability to develop ambitious plans and the necessary determination to see them realised. The EU itself is the best example of that, along with the internal market, enlargement - and Economic and Monetary Union." There had, he said, been many detractors of the idea of a single currency. Many people argued it was not possible or that it would be weak and have no future.
"On this anniversary, we pay tribute to creators of euro, their vision, determination and commitment to Europe. We have 16 Member States in the euro and for millions of citizens who use the euro it is the clearest sign of European integration, an anchor of stability, protecting us from the worst consequences of crises. It is an undisputed success."
Real tests for euro ahead
But, the real test for cohesion of euro was still ahead, he said. 2009 would be an extremely difficult year for the citizens and economies of eurozone. "Governments will have to act together to tackle the impact of the crisis and invest in structural factors to build for future."
Protection linked to credibility and implementation of prudent macroeconomic policies: "we must preserve that achievement."
"Externally too, we have to learn from the crisis." There was a need for a thorough reform of the global financial system and also to eliminate imbalances between consumption and saving around the world: this would need the cooperation of the United States and the major economies of Asia. Regarding the euro's external representation, Mr Juncker said that too often national interests dominated the stage and the euro area's real economic weight was not felt in international forums.
Almunia: EMU an "unarguable success"
The euro, and European Monetary Union are an "unarguable success" of which Europeans can be proud, and which are still providing strength and stability in the current crisis, said Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquín Almunia .
The euro, he said, had become the world's second currency, functioning, like the dollar, as an instrument for international trade and payments. For almost 330 million citizens in 16 countries, it is also a symbol of shared identity and a key part of the EU project, he continued, noting that stability and low inflation have driven trade and investment among euro-zone members, and helped to create 16 million jobs - three times as many as in the previous decade.
A protection against external imbalances
The euro also "protects us against external imbalances", said the Commissioner, stressing that without it, the crisis would have been far worse, inducing exchange-rate volatility and perhaps speculative attacks on currencies. At the same time, the European Central Bank took the necessary measures and led co-operation with other central banks that helped to prevent collapse, he added.
"We must now go on working with each other and with the international community to ensure our economies recover sustainable growth", said the Commissioner, stressing the need for budget vigilance and structural reform.
Giscard d'Estaing: biggest contribution since first EP elections in 1979
"This celebration is justified", said France's former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, because the euro has made "the biggest contribution to the European project since direct elections to the European Parliament were introduced in 1979".
The euro's success has exceeded the expectations even of its promoters, said Mr Giscard d'Estaing, noting that in10 years it had become the world's second currency, and stressing that "sound management is our shield in times of crisis".
"We look to monetary policy to limit the depressionary effects of the crisis and restore low-inflation growth", said the former President, paying tribute to the European Central Bank's expertise, determination and independence.
"We should nonetheless be wary of seeking a 'global dimension' for the euro", he warned. Whilst this might "flatter the vanity" of some, it would "lead to pitfalls", he said. The euro can nonetheless act as "a factor for stability in the concert of world currencies".
Work needed on financial supervision
Financial supervision needs "maintenance work", said Mr Giscard d'Estaing, who recommended starting with Maastricht Treaty Article 106, paragraph 5 (amendments to the Statute of the European System of Central Banks).
The euro's success should "redouble our courage to take the next step in building a united Europe under the treaty - and find the dynamics of success", concluded Mr Giscard d'Estaing.
Rapporteurs on EMU@10
The chairwoman of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, and co-rapporteur on ten years of EMU, Pervenche Berès (PES, FR) said that the euro was a success resulting from vision and political determination, not flowing from market: "It shows what Europe can do when all are mobilised to a single end." She was pleased the ceremony was taking place in "in this house of democracy – it is the currency of all of us, not just of the banks. It has been adopted by citizens as a symbol of belonging." The crisis, she said was making people think again about whether to be in or out: "We must encourage them in the process, according to the terms set out in the treaty."
In future, the euro, she said, "rich with ten years of experience must now open new areas": she mentioned economic cooperation on the world stage, the quality of public spending and supervision of financial markets, where the central bank should have a role.
Werner Langen (EPP-ED, DE), the other co-rapporteur on ten years of the euro, stressed Parliament's role in the creation of the euro and warned of the need to take seriously the stability and growth pace and strong coordination of fiscal policies, which were both essential in a unique project of having centralised monetary policy but decentralised budgets. Economic and Monetary Union had become "a fitness programme for Member States" and efforts needed to continue. "The euro has been well received," he said. "It has withstood a baptism of fire to become a means of integration for the peoples of Europe."
Political group speakers
For the EPP-ED group Jean-Paul Gauzès (FR) said "the euro is the symbol of Europe and the best possible proof that Europe is capable of long term decisions for a prosperous future." It had not always been easy: some retailers had rounded up prices at the switchover and as the euro rose on the exchange markets exporters made their concerns felt, while some challenged the ECB's independence. But all agreed that the ECB's decisions in the crisis had been timely, and that it would have been worse without the euro, he said – without it we would have faced a series of currency crises.
For the Socialists, Robert Goebbels (LU) said it was important that we could rely on a strong currency in times of crisis. The creation of the euro demonstrated, he said, that "All those who wanted a better Europe had no need to fear action agreed between governments wanting progress." Now even in the UK some were questioning their "splendid isolation." The euro had become a second global reserve currency: "perhaps we are heading to a bipolar system with the euro and the dollar."
Action to inject dynamism to the economy was not being taking by Member States acting together: they were scattered, but if they united, they could achieve spectacular results, he said. There was nothing to prevent better coordination of economic policy, especially on external representation.
Wolf Klinz (DE) spoke for the ALDE group. He recalled how some had said the creation of the euro was "mission impossible. Now it is a fact of life and a minor economic miracle." Over time it had been accepted with enthusiasm by citizens. Inflation had been lower than the average in Germany over the previous 50 years.
Only now, he said, was the euro showing its true mettle in a moment of crisis. He warned against action that distorted competition, and called for firm implementation of the stability and growth pact. We also needed, he said, to ensure the Eurozone can speak with one voice.
The UEN group was represented by its co-president Cristiana Muscardini (IT), who stressed the euro's "key role in international trade, as a reference currency for world." Despite hiccups, she said, "we now see a more stable level of prices." The euro was not created via "political hegemony or clash of arms – it was a reflection of a belief that it was a necessary step towards the political union which still lies before us as a goal to attain".
It had, she said, seemed impossible to have a financial policy divorced from economic policy, but there is coordination – even if this was not an easy task. Policymakers needed to work in tandem with ECB, she said, with a common economic policy, sharing strategic goals.
Alain Lipietz (FR), for the Greens/EFA group, recalled that his party had opposed the euro at the time of the French vote on the Maastricht treaty. However, "like all Greens, I am enticed by developments in economic and monetary policy in practice." There was effective price stability, the reformed stability pact allowed for counter-cyclical policies and there was proper dialogue between the ECB, the Eurogroup and the Commission. Still, there should be, he said, a better way to set exchange rate policy to reflect industrial needs and better account taken of the Lisbon and Gothenburg agendas.
Ilda Figueiredo (PT) spoke for the GUE/NGL group. She said blamed "neoliberal policies" for an increase in inequality, unemployment and poverty. It was "unacceptable to keep price stability as an ideological goal." Insistence on wage salary moderation meant real terms cuts for ordinary people, especially in Portugal. Now, in the financial crisis, we were seeing the nationalisation of losses and the privatisation of profits. There needed to be a clean break, to have real policies for social cohesion, she said.
Co-President of the IND/DEM group, Nigel Farage (UK) said he doubted there would be a euro to celebrate on the 20th birthday. He likened the preceding speeches to Soviet bureaucrats making announcements of success in the face of reality. "The euro is all about the political class imposing its will on the people of Europe. The only countries to have referendums on the euro – Denmark and Sweden – voted no." Now the eurozone would be tested with major problems in Italy and Spain, and in particular Greece, which he said was in "an economic prison" where a change of government could not lead to a change of policy because of the euro's straitjacket. In such circumstances, violence was not a surprise, he said.
Roger Helmer (non-attached, UK) said that all the half-dozen or so attempts at currency unions in the last 200 years had failed. Bond spreads showed, he said, that the markets anticipated a euro breakup. "We in Britain can thank Heaven we are not part of this slow motion train wreck," he said.

Latvian President tells MEPs: "We have a common history, but our destinies have been different"
2009-01-19 - 14:29
EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering introduced Latvian President Valdis Zatlers by saying: "For over 60 years your country awaited union with Europe. Our citizens enjoy benefits that our forefathers could only dream of. You have also felt the serious effects of the financial crisis and the gas dispute and have given your citizens cause for concern. It is during crisis that the purpose of the EU manifests. Together we are stronger and are in a better position to defend our own stance. In June of this year we are also staging the elections.
We will move together in a democratic union and together with all our Member countries we look forward to this project of unification being brought forward by these elections. I hope your country recognises the significance of being in Europe and comes to the polling stations."
Addressing the Parliament, Latvian President Valdis Zatlers spoke of Latvia's accession into the European Union and NATO, changes he had witnessed upon entry, the financial crisis and Latvia's economy and the future of Central and Eastern European dialogue. He also made a personal thank you to the European Parliament in its official commemoration of the victims of Stalinism and Nazism.
Latvia: "there will be no room for oppression or injustice"
Mr Zatlers opened by stating what a great honour he felt, stating "I am particularly delighted to address the European Parliament in my own native language, Latvian. That is all the more true because for five years now, Latvian has been one of the official languages of the European Union."
He stressed the fact that on November 18 of last year, "Latvia celebrated the 90 th anniversary of its declaration of independence. It once again demonstrated our unbending will to live in a country that is independent, free and democratic," said Mr Zatlers.
Quoting the 1918 Latvian declaration of independence, Mr Zatlers said: “All citizens, regardless of their nationality, are asked to help, because all human rights will be guaranteed in Latvia. This will be a democratic and just country, one in which there will be no room for oppression or injustice.”
A progressive future for Latvia
Mr Zatlers recalled Latvia's Soviet past stating that "there was peace among the countries of the Eastern bloc, but it was the peace of a prison yard – peace that was achieved with tanks, repression and threats."
He paid thanks to the European Parliament in their commemoration of the victims of this turbulent chapter in history stating: "This is a declaration which reminds all of the residents of Europe of the tragic events which occurred in the history of Latvia and all of Europe."
"We have a common history, but our destinies have been different. We must look into the past so that we can better understand one another and join together in looking toward the future," said Mr Zatlers.
Latvian economic and structural gains
Mr Zatlers moved on to speak of the changes he had witnessed as a result of Latvia's entry in the EU. He spoke of strengthened democracy, improved investment opportunities, free movement of people and goods within the EU. He finished by saying the EU has given Latvia a voice. "Latvia’s voice is heard in Europe, and Europe’s voice is heard in the world. We can be proud of the fact that such a unique mechanism for co-operation is at our disposal."
Speaking today on the 10th anniversary of the Euro currency, Mr Zatlers highlighted that "(Latvia) has not been sufficiently purposeful in trying to introduce the euro. That is one of the biggest mistakes that we have made in the process of European integration. Under the conditions of a financial crisis, this becomes harshly clear," he said.
Latvian strategies- the financial crisis
Enduring a current economic slump, Mr Zatlers focussed on the financial slow-down and what was being done in his country: "The development of events toward the end of last year showed that national governments must participate more actively in economic processes. The former approach was to doze off at the steering wheel of economic development, but that was an irresponsible approach. Sadly, we woke up too late – we could see the financial mess that was an obstacle in our path, but it was too late to avoid it," said Mr Zatlers.
He continued: "The global financial crisis has affected Latvia, too. It has been said that Latvia is currently experiencing one of the most dramatic operations for the rescue of a financial system in the history of modern Europe."
Latvia as a mediator for our Eastern neighbours
Wanting to remain positive, Mr Zatlers spoke of Latvia's ability to bridge cultural divides with former satellite states on behalf of the EU: "Latvia is and will continue to be an active supporter and implementer of the European Neighbourhood Policy, helping to establish bilateral relations with the European Union’s neighbouring countries to the East.
"In making use of these advantages, Latvia maintains active political dialogue with its neighbouring countries so as to promote a better understanding of the European Union and its values, as well as to explain the goals of the European Neighbourhood Policy and Eastern Partnership."
"I am certain that Europe’s interests will be well served if the Eastern Partnership is inaugurated during the Czech presidency of the European Union."
Concerns over energy- call for a common policy
Speaking about the Czech presidency of the Council, Mr Zatlers raised the matter of energy in light of the recent gas crisis in the Ukraine.
"Let us remember what has happened in the field of energy during the last several years. Deliveries of energy supplies have been interrupted, the amount of available energy resources has declined, and prices have shifted. This has promoted a unified understanding among European Union Member States of the need for a common energy policy", he said.
"The main requirement at the crossroads of energy and politics is to ensure energy supplies which are uninterrupted, sufficient, economic, sustainable and environmentally friendly. It does have to be said that the European Union’s successes in this regard have been uneven."
"We must not allow our dedication to melt away like snow in the springtime."
Visions of a unified and powerful European Union
“He who changes will survive,” the Latvian poet Rainis wrote 100 years ago, said Mr Zatlers. "The words are true today, as well. I am sure that Europe will undergo fundamental developments. It will become more powerful in its economy, welfare and mutual co-operation. It will strengthen its system of values. Each European will be proud to live in Europe whilst also belonging to his or her nation.
Unity in diversity, development, the preservation of values, and the responsibility of each citizen for his or her country and for the European community as a whole – that is the future of Europe. CV of Latvian President Valdis Zatlers audio, 29:01

Parliament calls for EU-wide commemoration of Srebrenica genocide
2009-01-19 - 14:29
In July 1995, the Bosnian town of Srebrenica fell into the hands of Serbian militias leading to "several days of carnage". In a resolution adopted by 556 votes to 9 with 22 abstentions, the European Parliament calls on the Council and Commission to commemorate appropriately the anniversary of the Srebrenica-Potočari act of genocide by supporting the European Parliament's recognition of 11 July as the day of commemoration throughout the EU. After the fall of Srebrenica , Bosnian Serb forces, commanded by General Ratko Mladić, and paramilitary units rapidly executed more than 8 000 Muslim men and boys, who had sought safety in the area. Moreover, nearly 25 000 women, children and elderly people were forcibly deported, "making this event the biggest war crime to take place in Europe since the end of the Second World War". Tragedy a symbol of international impotence Declared an act of genocide by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), the tragedy took place in a UN-proclaimed safe haven, making it "a symbol of the impotence of the international community to intervene in the conflict and protect the civilian population," the EP says. Urging all countries, including those of the western Balkans, to do the same, (Parliament commemorates and honours all the victims of the atrocities during the wars in the former Yugoslavia and expresses its condolences to and solidarity with the families of the victims, many of whom are living without final confirmation of the fate of their fathers, sons, husbands or brothers. An important step towards peace and stability In view of the fact that General Ratko Mladić is still at large almost 14 years after the tragic events, Parliament also demands that further efforts be made to bring the remaining fugitives to justice, stressing that bringing to justice those responsible for the massacres in and around Srebrenica is an important step towards peace and stability in the region. The EP stresses that reconciliation is an important part of the European integration process, a process in which the religious communities, the media and the education system play a significant role.

Transparency: EU institutions to set an example
2009-01-19 - 14:29
A report adopted by the European Parliament urges the EU institutions to do more to open up their registers and documents to the public. In the light of a recent judgment by the Court of Justice, MEPs call on the Council to hold all its debates in public and on Parliament to publish more information on its Members' activities. The report by Marco CAPPATO (ALDE, IT) on public access to EP, Council and Commission documents was adopted with 355 votes in favour to 195 against and 18 abstentions. MEPs believe that the EU and its Member States have moved towards recognising a genuine right of access to documents of the institutions and they point out that the rate of refusals to allow access is falling. However, shortcomings have emerged in the implementation of the regulation, owing to differing interpretations. They call on the institutions to take fresh measures to improve transparency, arguing that this is "a condition of their legality, their legitimacy and their accountability".
The House stresses that the European institutions have a duty to ensure that their activities are publicised, a principle underscored by the European Court of Justice in a judgment delivered on 1 July 2008 on a case brought by former MEP Maurizio Turco. The Luxembourg-based judges took the view that opinions of the Council's legal service relating to any piece of legislation should be made public. They also set limits to the grounds for refusing access to a document.
According to MEPs, this "historic" ruling requires the Council to ensure that all its documents and information are in the public domain, including the identity of members of national delegations and working parties.
A single European information portal
In addition, the committee argued that Parliament must take the lead on transparency and should embark on a special action plan ahead of the 2009 elections, with more information on MEPs' activities, their attendance at parliamentary meetings - in absolute, relative and percentage terms - and on their allowances and expenses.
MEPs in the committee add that "accessing information relating to the EU institutions still remains an obstacle-strewn path for ordinary citizens". An inter-institutional search engine should be introduced, together with "a single EU register / portal" for information and documents. The institutions are urged to improve transparency of the procedures for comitology and for agreements thrashed out at first-reading of the co-decision procedure through "trialogues".
Transparency in MEPs own activities
The report says that Parliament should be at the forefront of publicity, transparency and openness in the EU, and that, before the 2009 Parliamentary elections, it should launch an extraordinary action plan, for instance within the framework of the e-Parliament initiative, to ensure that more and easily accessible information is made available on its website, on:
– MEPs' activities, participation in and attendance at Parliamentary work, in absolute, relative and percentage terms, available and accessible to citizens also through search criteria
– Parliament's activities in plenary, committee, delegations and internal bodies: the Legislative Observatory should be improved by including references and links to all relevant documents; committee and delegation work should be streamed on Parliament's website as plenary work is, and also recorded, and made available and accessible to citizens through search criteria; internal bodies (such as the Conference of Presidents, the Bureau, the Quaestors, the Working Party on Parliamentary Reform, etc) should promote and ensure the highest level of transparency of their work vis-á-vis other members and citizens by making all their documents available,
– MEPs' allowances and spending, in conformity with the position taken by the European Ombudsman in relation to the fact that access to information should apply also to such data, as well as all declarations of financial interests for all MEPs, and that such information should be available in all EU official languages.

Security features and biometrics in passports
2009-01-19 - 14:29
Children under twelve should no longer have their fingerprints included on passports issued in the European Union, the European Parliament says in a co-decision report adopted with 594 votes in favour, 51 against and 37 abstentions. But they should have their own passports, so as to combat trafficking in children, say MEPs. Biometric passports will be introduced throughout the EU (+ Iceland, Norway and Switzerland) on the 29 June. The European Parliament adopted plans to amend a 2004 regulation laying down biometric features to be included in passports and other travel documents, including the holder's fingerprints. The European Parliament adopted a compromise position agreed with Council last year. In the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001, the Commission was asked by Member States to take immediate action to improve document security. The EU decided, therefore, to integrate biometrics in European passports. These identifiers comprise a facial image and fingerprints, making it possible to combat fraud and falsification more effectively. The regulation, already adopted, which will come into force in June, establishes technical specifications such as : • additional security features notably with a view to combating counterfeiting and falsification; • the storage medium and its security; • common quality requirements for the facial image and the fingerprints. However, during pilot projects carried out in some Member States it was found that children's fingerprints are not of sufficient quality, especially those of the youngest children, which can change greatly as they grow older. In its draft text, the European Commission therefore suggested to introduce an exemption for children under twelve. A similar exemption was agreed for people deemed physically unable to give fingerprints. The rapporteur and Council presidency agreed that fingerprints should not be taken from children under the age of 12. However, countries already taking fingerprints from children under that age, but not below 6, can continue to do so for four years . In cases where it is impossible to take fingerprints, Member states may deliver a temporary passport having a validity of twelve months or less. One person, one passport To combat trafficking in children, the draft legislation also proposes introducing the principle "one person, one passport": until now a passport issued to a parent has often also covered the children by adding their names - but the microchip contains only the parent's biometric data. The Regulation does not provide a legal base for setting up or maintaining databases for storage of these data in Member States. UK government position The UK is excluded from participation in this Regulation as it is a development of the Schengen acquis in which the UK does not take part. However, the Government supports the inclusion of fingerprints in passports and travel documents as a means of providing better identification. The UK has stated its intention to keep in step with the Regulation to ensure that UK passports are not seen as 'second class' compared with those issued by other Member States. Germany started collecting fingerprints in March 2007. The Netherlands are testing it since 2004. In France, it is available on request since April 2006.

Fundamental rights
Too many violations of fundamental rights in the EU, MEPs say
2009-01-19 - 14:29
MEPs express their concern over the "high number of fundamental rights violations in the EU", pointing to instances of serious discrimination against minorities and threats to privacy. They also urged EU Institutions and Member States to cooperate in the field of immigration and asylum. By adopting the report drafted by Giusto Catania (GUE/NGL, IT) by 401 votes in favour, 220 against and 67 abstentions, MEPs address fundamental rights in its various aspects, voicing recommendations on a broad range of issues like discrimination, immigration, social rights or gender equality. Excesses in the fight against terrorism MEPs point out that over these last few years, the fight against terrorism has often served to diminish the level of protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, notably the right to privacy, data protection and freedom from discrimination. They call on the EU and Member States to ensure full compliance with international standards in this matter. CIA activities in Europe: Member States deaf to EPs recommendations Concerning Parliament's report on CIA activities in the EU adopted in February 2007, MEPs stress that their recommendations have not been followed so far by Member States and EU institutions. However, they welcome the statement by US President-Elect Barack Obama on closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility and bringing the inmates to trial and call on Member States to declare their readiness to jointly find solutions for remaining inmates. Reproductive rights Members also ask to raise public awareness about the right for women to fully enjoy their sexual and reproductive rights. They ask for the facilitation of access to contraception, and to combat the practice of women genital mutilation. Call for legislation on living wills The EP asks Member States to introduce legislation on living wills to ensure that, as stated by the Oviedo convention, "the previously expressed wishes relating to a medical intervention by a patient who is not, at the time of the intervention, in a state to express his or her wishes shall be taken into account". Discrimination against Roma people: members oppose fingerprinting MEPs point to the "segregation" faced by Roma people in Member States and the "widespread anti-Roma sentiments" leading to "frequent denial of their rights by public authorities and their political under-representation". Moreover, they suffer "discrimination by the police (...) inter alia by taking fingerprints or other forms of data collection", MEPs say. They call on the Member States to "take measures to put an end to the practice of unofficial marriage of minors, often at a very young age". Same-sex couples: partnerships should be recognised The House calls on Member States to take legislative action to overcome discrimination experienced by same-sex couples by recognising such relationships. Member States with legislation on same-sex partnerships are invited to recognise provisions with similar effects adopted by others. Immigration and integration: the need to avoid exclusion "Rather than focusing all their efforts on preventing illegal immigration", which led to "deploying a growing range of frontier checks" MEPs say, EU institutions and Member States should introduce "effective, long term and legal migration policies" and "more flexible and coordinated rules" for asylum seekers. The Parliament also condemns "the lack of effective integration policies", causing "the exclusion of hundreds of thousands of non-nationals", putting them "in a vulnerable position, opening the way to radicalisation, trafficking and other forms of exploitation". Regional languages The European Parliament wants to promote regional or minority languages, as "the right to speak and to be educated in one's mother tongue is one of the most basic fundamental rights", MEPs say.

Agriculture
Global food security: more European initiatives needed say MEPs
2009-01-19 - 14:29
The European Parliament calls for “immediate and continuous action” to ensure global food security. It believes the aid of EUR 1 billion that the EU has decided to give to developing countries should be accompanied by fresh investment in agriculture and it calls for mechanisms to be set up to ensure that sufficient global food stocks are available. In the space of two years world food prices have increased by over 80% on average while cereal stocks have fallen in 2008 to a worrying historic low of 40 days’ supply, points out a report drafted by Mairead McGuinness (EPP-ED, IE) and adopted with 482 votes in favour, 24 against and 59 abstentions. According to the World Bank, over 860 million people in the world are facing chronic famine and this figure could rise by 100 million as a result of the current crisis. Commodity prices have fallen back to near-2006 levels but the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) and Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) fear they may fluctuate more, and global food demand is expected to double by 2050.
Ensuring adequate global stocks
Among the many measures proposed in the report, the European Parliament calls for the introduction of instruments to avert dramatic and damaging price fluctuations.
It argues that the EU should take the initiative by proposing a global food inventory regime, the creation of a worldwide stockholding obligation programme to ensure the availability of food and a better basic storage system for key production inputs (protein, fertilisers, seeds, pesticides) in developing countries, preferably based on private-sector players including farmers’ cooperatives.
MEPs also call for a global assessment of the impact of the increase in biofuel production on commodity prices. They stress the need for international and regional agreements to ensure that energy crops do not jeopardise food security and they urge a firm commitment from the EU to give priority to second-generation biofuels which do not compete with food production.
Redirecting EU development towards agriculture
The House regrets the reduction in the amount of development aid being devoted to agriculture, which was 17% in 1980 and only 3% in 2006, and urges the Commission to direct EU financial aid – including the European Development Fund (EDF) - towards agricultural-led growth and to do all in its power to induce governments of beneficiary countries to stick to their promise to devote 10% of national budgets to this sector. They also want new micro-credit facilities to be set up for small farmers, stressing the role such farmers can play in increasing production and in local food security.
To complement the other development measures funded by the EU, MEPs call for a permanent food-security fund to be created in support of the world's poorest people, under Heading 4 of the EU general budget.
CAP, climate change, financial crisis and European research
The European Parliament believes the common agricultural policy (CAP) must remain the cornerstone of EU food security policy now and beyond 2013 and that it should be further adapted to go further than the measures contained in the Health Check. It also calls for EU agriculture spending to be kept at a stable and constant level to guarantee a fair income for farmers and for effective insurance policies to be made available to protect producers against massive price fluctuations.
MEPs urge the Commission to look at the impact of climate change mitigation initiatives in the agriculture sector and to provide resources for this sector so that such initiatives do not depress EU farm output.
They also call for a detailed assessment of the impact on food security of proposed EU legislation on plant protection products and an analysis of the effects of the global financial crisis on the agricultural sector.
Lastly, the House calls for a programme of research and development on sustainable agriculture. Common Agricultural Policy and global food security Text, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 13 January)

Free movement of goods
European defence and security market strengthened: deal on public contracts
2009-01-19 - 14:29
Defence procurement, still essentially a national competence, is boosted by a new directive, seeking to create a genuine single market for defence and security equipment and services adopted by the European Parliament in Strasbourg. MEPs voted in favour of the text agreed before with the Council. The challenge has been to put in place a legal framework which will invigorate intra-Community trade in this field and which the Member States can apply without risking their security interests. The new legislation establishes a co-ordinated EU procedure for awarding contracts in the fields of defence and security. It should ensure that there is no discrimination between undertakings claiming harm in the context of a procedure for the award of a contract as a result of the distinction made by this Directive between national rules implementing Community law and other national rules. The EU's general rules on public procurement, set out in a directive in 2004, take insufficient account of the specificities of the defence sector. This is one reason why building a single market for defence goods is such a laborious task. A new directive, governing only public procurement of defence and security goods, should help to achieve this aim. This market is worth over €90bn and the new directive is important for all EU Member States even though 90% of the production of EU defence equipment is concentrated in five Member States: France, UK, Germany, Italy and Sweden. The Directive does not apply to contracts outside the EU or intelligence related contracts Not only defence but also non-military security has been included in the scope of the directive. The directive covers public contracts concluded between EU operators. It will not apply to contracts governed by specific procedural rules pursuant to an international agreement or arrangement concluded between one or more Member States and one or more third countries. Neither will it apply to contracts for which the application of the rules set down in this Directive would oblige a Member State to supply information, the disclosure of which it considers contrary to the essential interests of its security, nor to contracts for the purpose of intelligence activities. A list of types of contracts not included in the scope of the directive is provided in the directive. This Directive applies to contracts which have a value excluding value-added tax (VAT) estimated to be no less than the following thresholds: a) €412,000 for supply and service contracts; b) €5,150 000 for works contracts. What is an 'armament'? For the purposes of the Directive, the term “military equipment” should cover products which, although initially designed for civilian use, were later adapted to military purposes to be used as arms, munitions or war material, states the adopted text. The scope's definition still refers to the list of arms, munitions and/or war material agreed by Member States in 1958 (the Common Military List of the EU). The Internal Market Committee proposed that a contemporary interpretation be provided by using, in particular, the EU's annually updated common military list. This proposal is not included in the final agreement. But the list should be "interpreted in a broad way in the light of the evolving character of technology." Review procedure Parliament introduces a new review procedure which sets out that Member States must take the measures necessary to ensure that decisions taken by the contracting authorities/entities may be reviewed effectively and, in particular, as rapidly as possible. Member States must ensure that there is no discrimination between undertakings claiming harm in the context of a procedure for the award of a contract as a result of the distinction made by this Directive between national rules implementing Community law and other national rules. Offsets, research and transparency The new directive does not include specific rules on offsets, also called "industrial compensations". The provisions on subcontracting do not prohibit offsets but will help in preventing illegal offsets. They will also facilitate market access for SMEs. The new legislation strengthens transparency requirements to contractors, and does not allow combined research and production contracts for national procurements without a competitive stage. Entry into force The directive will enter into force on the day following the publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. Member States shall adopt and publish, at the latest two years after the entry into force of the Directive, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive. They shall forthwith communicate the text of those provisions to the Commission. One of the two key parts of the defence package The parliamentary report on the proposal was drafted by Alexander Graf LAMBSDORFF (ALDE, DE) 597 MEPs voted in favour of the resolution, 69 against, with 37 abstentions. This new directive forms one of the two key components of the defence package. Another text, focused on simplifying and harmonising the rules for granting licences to transfers of military equipment from one country to another was adopted by the European Parliament in December.

Restoring stability in the Horn of Africa: MEPs debate a boost to peacekeeping mission
2009-01-19 - 14:29
In a resolution that seeks to restore peace and stability in the Horn of Africa, MEPs demand the reinforcement of the peacekeeping mission in Somalia and the deployment of a UN stabilisation force in Darfur to join forces with the African Union troops already deployed in the region. MEPs also highlight the unresolved border conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea and between Eritrea and Djibouti, and demand that human rights and freedom of the press be observed in these countries. The unsolved border conflicts between Ethiopia and Eritrea and between Eritrea and Djibouti are negatively affecting peace and security in the Horn of Africa, says Parliament. The situation in Somalia has deteriorated into "one of the world's worst humanitarian and security crises", and the situation in Sudan is a major risk factor for security in the region.
MEPs call on the government of Ethiopia to formally endorse the Boundary Commission's demarcation by map coordinates between Eritrea and Ethiopia as final and binding, in accordance with the internationally brokered 'Algiers Agreements'. They believe that projects of common interest, such as energy supply, cross border trade and ports, could trigger functional cooperation between the two countries.
Reinforcement of peacekeeping operations
Parliament also urges the reinforcement of the African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM) and the deployment of the UN stabilisation force in a timely manner as soon as political and security conditions allow. Since November 2008, Ethiopia has been progressively withdrawing its troops from Mogadishu and all other locations in Somalia where they are still present.
Turning to the situation in Darfur, MEPs call on the Council and the international community to step up their support for implementation of the north-south Comprehensive Peace Agreement in Sudan and to secure the full deployment of UNAMID, the United Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur.
An EU Special Representative/Envoy to the Horn of Africa region should also be nominated by the Council, Parliament says.
Deterioration of humanitarian situation in Somalia
The resolution condemns the "ever more frequent attacks on humanitarian workers over the last few months, which have gravely constrained aid operations and have helped worsen the humanitarian situation in Somalia".
The Ethiopian government is urged to grant full access for humanitarian organisations to the Ogaden region of Somalia, and to provide all necessary conditions to enable aid to reach its beneficiaries throughout the region.
Violations of human rights in Somalia include the kidnapping of two Italian Catholic nuns, Maria Teresa Olivero and Caterina Giraudo. The EP calls on the Somali Transitional Federal Government to condemn the kidnapping of the two nuns and to take action to speed up their release and prevent further kidnappings.
Political and press freedoms must be guaranteed
Pointing to the lack of guaranteed freedom of the press, Parliament expresses its deep concern at the continuing imprisonment in Eritrea of the Swedish-Eritrean journalist Dawit Isaak, who has been held in jail since his arrest in September 2001 without having been tried by a court. The EP demands the immediate release of Dawit Isaak and other imprisoned journalists. Similarly, MEPs call on the Eritrean government to make a public declaration as to the whereabouts of the prisoners and their state of health and to either charge and immediately bring before a court of law all political detainees and imprisoned journalists, or release them immediately and without conditions.
MEPs also express their outrage at the imprisonment of the leader of the opposition party Unity for Democracy Justice (UDJ), Birtukan Midekssa, demanding her immediate and unconditional release.
The resolution was adopted by 570 votes to 11 with 27 abstentions. Text, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 15 January)

The EU strategy towards Belarus: MEPs stress the need for greater democratisation
2009-01-19 - 14:29
MEPs insist on five conditions to improve relations between Belarus and the EU in a resolution adopted in Strasbourg. Freedom for political prisoners, media NGOs and political associations are the main points underlined by the European Parliament to renew the period of six months during which travel restrictions imposed on certain Belarus Government officials have been lifted. In order to significantly improve relations with the EU, the European Parliament points out five conditions in a resolution adopted by 551 votes in favour, 15 against and 31 abstentions. According to MEPs, Belarus should: (1) remain a country without political prisoners, (2) guarantee freedom of expression for the media, (3) continue to cooperate with the OSCE on reform of the electoral law, (4) improve conditions for the work of NGOs and (5) guarantee freedom of assembly and political association. In October 2008, the Council had decided that the travel restrictions imposed on certain Belarus Government officials would not apply for a period of six months, which may be renewed, with the exception of those involved in the disappearances that occurred in 1999 and 2000 and of the Chair of the Central Electoral Commission. In order to end the country's self-imposed isolation from the rest of Europe, MEPs urge the Belarusian government to respect human rights by (1) making changes to the Belarus Criminal Code, (2) refraining from threatening criminal prosecution, (3) eliminating all obstacles to the proper registration of NGOs in Belarus, (4) improving the treatment of and respect for national minorities. Freedom of political association and media Parliament acknowledges that some efforts have been made by the Belarusian authorities, in particular the decision to register the ‘For Freedom’ movement headed by former Belarusian presidential candidate Aliaksandr Milinkevich. MEPs welcome the allowance of the printing and distribution of the two independent newspapers, Narodnaia Volia and Nasha Niva . Otherwise, they point out that there are still 13 independent newspapers awaiting registration. MEPs also welcome the decision by the Belarusian Government to discuss the international Internet media standards and to consult the Belarusian Association of Journalists. They ask for financial support to the independent Belarusian television channel Belsat and the official registration of this channel. Political prisoners and death penalty Parliament welcomes the release of political prisoners in Belarus but also criticises the fact that some other activists remain subject to various forms of restrictions on their freedom. MEPs also condemn the fact that Belarus is the only country in Europe which still has the death penalty and call on the authorities to respect freedom of religion. Cost of visas and ‘European Humanities University’ in exile Further steps should be taken to liberalise visa procedures for Belarusian citizens, especially by reducing the cost of visas to enter the Schengen Area and simplifying the procedure for obtaining them. The European Parliament deplores the repeated decisions by the Belarusian authorities to refuse entrance visas to Members of the European Parliament and national parliamentarians. MEPs also call on the Council and Commission to urge the Belarusian Government to enable the ‘European Humanities University’ in exile in Vilnius to return legally to Belarus and re-establish itself in Minsk. Parliament urges the Czech Presidency to make it a priority to negotiate an EU-wide agreement with the Belarusian authorities allowing children to travel from Belarus to any EU Member State organising such recuperation programmes.

Public intervention reassumes "pivotal role" in rescuing banks and transport industry
2009-01-19 - 14:29
In response to the difficult economic and financial situation currently affecting Europe and the world, public sector intervention is reassuming a "pivotal role, sometimes taking the form of outright nationalisation," says the European Parliament in a report adopted with 521 votes in favour, 47 against and 55 abstentions. Expressing concern at the unprecedented level of instability in the European and world markets, the report drafted by Donata GOTTARDI (PES, IT) points out that the crisis in strategic sectors, and especially in the fields of finance and transport, is spurring public investment in takeovers, without care being taken to limit those rescue operations to what is strictly necessary for sustaining and developing the European economy or to ensure they do not respond to national interests only. Appropriate supervision and sharing the tax burden The report stresses that it is in the interests of the public, the taxpayer and public budgets to ensure that every intervention and use of public funds for rescuing financial organisations is accompanied by appropriate supervision, concrete improvements in the governance and business conduct of the enterprise or institution, precise limits on the amounts paid to executives and clear accountability vis-à-vis the public authorities. The European Parliament also believes that rescue packages from the wholesale public sector will have repercussions for public finances and personal incomes, making it necessary for the tax burden to be suitably and equitably spread among all taxpayers. This would entail, on the one hand, the imposition of an appropriate level of taxation on all financial players and on the other, provision for a gradual and sharp reduction in the tax burden on mid to low-level salaries and pensions. Bring wage increases in line with inflation There needs to be a common approach on wage policies, which provides for wage increases in line with actual inflation and productivity, says the report, "since fiscal and wage policies are powerful and effective levers on demand and for economic stability and growth".

UCITS: MEPs back management company passport approach
2009-01-19 - 14:29
Parliament has approved a proposed reform of the UCITS directives, aimed at making the investment fund market in the EU less fragmented and at improving efficiency. MEPs inserted provisions for a "management company passport". The text has already been agreed with the Council, so this vote effectively completes the legislative procedure. The resolution was adopted with 589 votes in favour, 28 against and 38 abstentions. UCITS (undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities) are investment funds sold across the EU and elsewhere under a common set of EU rules for investor protection, cost transparency and meeting basic requirements on organisation, management and oversight of funds.
The investment fund can invest in shares, bonds, other investment funds, bank account or index tracking funds, for instance. They enable individuals to invest in a diversified portfolio without having to manage all the details themselves or to have a large amount of money available to start with.
The EU framework for these investment funds, originally set up in 1985 and updated several times since then, was intended to allow a real single market in investment funds to develop – since they UCITS funds all complied with the same rules, consumers could invest with confidence across EU borders.
A large market, but barriers to integration remain
The products have been a success: at the end of 2006 they accounted for over €6.4 trillion of assets in total which is equivalent to half of the Union's GDP and represents 11.5% of European household financial assets.
Too often, however, different national interpretations of the rules have impeded cross-border sales of UCITS products. The Commission is now proposing:
to remove administrative barriers to cross-border distribution of UCITS funds;
to create a framework for mergers between UCITS funds and allow the use of "master-feeder" structures;
to replace the "Simplified Prospectus" with a short "Key Investor Information" document;
to improve cooperation mechanisms between national supervisors.
Management Company Passport now included
A key point relate relating to the "management company passport" allowing funds authorised in one Member States to be managed remotely by a management companies established in another Member State and authorised by that Member State's financial supervisory authorities. This widening of the passport approach was not included in the Commission's original proposal pending a further consultation by the Committee of European Securities Regulators, in the light of concerns about possible risks to the "gold standard" of investor protection which the UCITS brand represents. This consultation has since been completed and MEPs, including the rapporteur, Wolf Klinz (ALDE, DE) are satisfied that it will be possible to open up the single market in investment products while at the same time maintaining the level of protection for retail investors. In agreement with the Council, therefore, they adopted amendments inserting the arrangements for the "management company passport" into the directive.
While MEPs welcomed the general approach, they also adopted, again in agreement with the Council, a large number of other amendments to improve the rules, notably with regard to mergers between different UCITS and the rules covering UCITS which collectively invest in other UCITS in a "master-feeder" structure.
Further steps
The directive still needs to be approved by the Council, but the informal agreement already reached means this is now a formality. Member States will need to enact national legislation to apply the main changes by 1 July 2011. Undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities UCITS: coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions (repeal. Directive 85/611/EEC).

Dichloromethane to be banned in paint-strippers
2009-01-19 - 14:29
The dangerous chemical compound Dichloromethane (DCM) in paint-strippers will soon be banned for consumers and many professionals, after the adoption of a legislative report by the European Parliament. Thanks to MEPs, a derogation for licensed professionals will be limited and the protection of workers during the industrial use of paint-strippers containing the chemical will be strengthened. The resolution was adopted with 674 votes in favour, 17 against and 8 abstentions. Dichloromethane (DCM) is a colourless chemical compound, classified as a carcinogen category 3. According to the Commission, between 1989 and 2007, 18 fatalities (9 for industrial use, 8 for professional use, 1 for consumer use) and 56 non-fatal injuries have been registered in the EU.
The Decision adopted by the European Parliament, will:
ban the use by consumers, who are least aware of the dangers of dichloromethane and who have least access to protective equipment;
ban in general the use by professionals operating outside industrial premises, but Member States can opt to allow further use for certain activities by specifically trained professionals under certain strict conditions (conditions have been strengthened on Parliaments request);
increase protection of workers during industrial use of such paint strippers (thanks to the EP the obligatory protection requirements have been strengthened);
avoid further divergent actions by Member States which create obstacles to the internal market without benefit for the protection of all European citizens.
When will the ban apply?
The decision will enter into force three days after its publication. It states that paint-strippers containing dichloromethane in a concentration equal to or greater than 0.1% by mass shall not be placed on the market for the first time after 18 months after the entry into force for supply to the general public or to professionals. Furthermore they shall not be supplied to them after 30 months after the entry into force and shall not be used by professionals 36 months after entry into force.
Background
Various alternatives to DCM-based paint strippers are already available on the market: physical/mechanical stripping, pyrolitic/thermal stripping, and chemical stripping involving other chemicals than DCM. Alternative chemical paint strippers are the most widely used.
A number of European countries have already put in place national measures to ban or substitute DCM (Austria, Denmark, Sweden) or are in the process of doing so (Germany). Text, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 14 January)

Fisheries
Ecosystem approach to fisheries management
2009-01-19 - 14:29
Parliament adopted a report on the Commission communication "The role of the Common Fisheries Policy in implementing an ecosystem approach to marine management". According to MEPs, this initiative is a "contribution" for guaranteeing exploitation of fisheries resources in a way that will create sustainable conditions from the social, environmental and economic points of views, urging however the Commission to reconsider the present system of TACs and quotas. The EP urges the Commission to reconsider the present system of total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas as the principal instrument for managing marine resources and its "usefulness" given the present fishing restrictions.
In a report drawn up by Pedro GUERREIRO (GUE/NGL, PT) and adopted with 557 votes in favour, 48 against and 12 abstentions, MEPs recognise that the existing fisheries management instruments, based on TACs, have a direct impact on catches and an indirect impact on fishing effort, adding, however, that "management of fishing effort is needed". They urge the Commission to study the different instruments for managing marine resources, "ensuring that the existing instruments will not be changed until an alternative that ensures a more adequate exploitation of fisheries resources has come up".
The House considers it "insufficient to measure fishing effort in a uniform way", without taking account of the diversity of fleets and gear. "Controlling fishing effort should take account of the various species, the various fishing gear and the assessed impact of catches on stocks of each species", states the report.
According to MEPs, one of the first tasks to be carried out in the area of fisheries management is to assess scientifically whether there are any over-large fleets and over-exploited resources, and which they are, so that suitable specific measures can be adopted.
Fisheries management measures - such as technical modifications to nets, the closure of certain areas and the reduction of fishing effort - should be "diversified, specific and adapted to each case".
Southern Hake and Norway Lobster off the Iberian Peninsula
The European Parliament propose that scientific studies be carried out capable of identifying the redistribution of marine species exploited by fisheries because of the impact of the recent change in the physical and chemical parameters of waters due to climatic change. According to MEPs, these studies should serve as a basis for reformulating a number of existing stock recovery plans, for example the recovery plan for Southern Hake and Norway Lobster off the Iberian Peninsula.
Parliament also stresses the need to apply mechanisms to subsidise or compensate fishermen affected by the economic and social repercussions of multiannual recovery and management plans and measures to protect ecosystems.
12 miles: derogation should be "permanent"
The House expresses its deep concern at the possibility of any change being made to the common fisheries policy (CFP) that promotes the concentration of fishing activity, in particular as regards the right of access to resources, and considers it vital to maintain the access derogation to the zone falling within territorial waters at least 12 miles, calling for this derogation to be "permanent in nature".
MEPs urge the Commission to study and propose more open control and supervision systems in respect of fisheries landings, illegal catches and the discarding at sea of by-catches. In order to maintain fish stocks worldwide, "upper limits must also be set on the number of days fishermen may remain at sea", they add.
The report urges greater decentralisation of the CFP, which will guarantee the involvement of fishermen, their representative organisations and fishing communities in the CFP and fisheries management. Text, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 13 January)

External/international trade
MEPs call for more economic cooperation between the EU and Western Balkans
2009-01-19 - 14:29
The political integration of the Western Balkans into the EU can only take place if there is "better, more intensive regional and international economic co-operation", says the European Parliament. In a report drafted by Bastiaan BELDER (IND/DEM, NL), the House states that the EU "must show genuine commitment to the Western Balkans" if its pledge to enable these countries to accede to the EU on schedule is to be fulfilled. "A serious prospect of EU membership for the Western Balkan states can act as a catalyst to encourage their population and governments to move away from regressive nationalism, sectarian violence and towards a future of integration with the rest of Europe," the report says. The report was adopted with 522 votes in favour, 12 against and 15 abstentions. "The EU has set aside almost €8 billion in support of the 2007-2010 period, but without appropriate co-operation and without creating a sense that everyone is working together towards a common goal, the hoped-for results will not be achieved," it adds. Call for deeper integration into world trade system The House calls on the Commission and the Council to implement all appropriate measures encouraging deeper integration of the Western Balkans into the world trade and economic system, "in particular through WTO accession for countries in the region which are not yet members". The report also recognises that the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) contributes significantly to the preparation of the Western Balkan countries’ accession to the European Union. Commission and Member States to provide additional financial resources In terms of funding, the report urges the Commission and the Member States to endow the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA) with the additional financial resources needed to develop projects tailored to real needs and to provide effective and focused assistance at local and regional levels. It also calls on the Council and the Commission to supply the states in the region with economic and administrative technical assistance by duly qualified persons, in cooperation with the international and regional organisations dealing with Western Balkan economic issues, in order to strengthen local public structures, establish a more efficient and diversified economic base and improve the penetration of local products into foreign markets, and into the European Union in particular. Structural Funds and better financing for SME-related projects The Commission and the Western Balkan countries should make sufficient financial resources available for infrastructure modernisation, says the report, and the Commission and the Member States should ensure that SMEs have access to EU Structural Funds and to provide better financing for SME-related projects. It stresses, however, that further financial assistance to the Western Balkans (and notably to Kosovo) should be conditional on the establishment, with the support of international financial institutions, of a comprehensive and realistic long-term economic development plan and calls on the Commission to set up an institutional framework to enhance cooperation between the Community and the private sector in the countries of the Western Balkans which will ensure the appropriate use of Community funds. Continuation of the Stabilisation and Association Process MEPs call on the Commission to monitor developments and, if necessary, to adopt adequate measures in order to guarantee the smooth continuation of the Stabilisation and Association Process, which in its view "is an important factor for stability in the region and in the best interests of the EU itself". In light of this, it urges Member States to conclude the ratification process for all the Stabilisation and Association Agreements (SAAs) as soon as possible.

Human rights
UN Human Rights Council: a mixed record so far says the European Parliament
2009-01-19 - 14:29
Parliament adopted a report welcoming the work carried out by the UN Human Rights Council in its first two years of existence but regretting that it has not yet achieved more in improving the UN's human rights record. The EU should play a more prominent role in promoting a clear vision, political agenda and long-term strategy for the UN body, say MEPs. The own-initiative report, drafted by Laima Andrikienė (EPP-ED, LT) and adopted today by 629 votes to 26 with 10 abstentions, sees strengths and weaknesses in the UNHRC, which superseded the UN Commission on Human Rights in 2006. Among the difficulties, the USA's absence from the UNHRC has left the EU with a greater burden of responsibility but the EU Member States are often outvoted by the African and Asian regional groups. Another concern is that “the principle of the universality of human rights is being increasingly put at risk” as some countries seek to restrict rights such as freedom of expression, or to “interpret human rights against a cultural, ideological or traditional background”. Credibility of UNHRC rests on Special Procedures Special Procedures is the name given to a mechanism for monitoring human rights violations in specific countries or examining a global human rights issue. The Andrikiene report argues that "the credibility and effectiveness of the UNHRC in the protection of human rights rests on cooperation with Special Procedures and their full implementation" and it condemns “the efforts made by several UNHRC Members to limit the independence and efficiency" of such procedures. The report also recognises the value of the Universal Periodic Review mechanism, which in principle assesses the human rights performances of all UN states, but "denounces the use of political alliances to shield certain States from scrutiny". The case of Tunisia is highlighted. In addition, the report highlights the importance of civil society organisations in the work of the UNHRC and calls on EU Member States and other donors to support them. And MEPs voice strong backing for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. EU must take a stronger lead Some EU achievements at the UNHRC are highlighted, such as its call for special sessions on Darfur, Myanmar and the East of the Democratic Republic of Congo, but overall the report regrets "the rather defensive attitude adopted by the EU in the UNHRC, in particular its reluctance to put forward resolutions on country situations". The EU and its Member States are urged to make better use of their potential influence as the leader of a group of democratic countries with solid human rights records. According to rapporteur Laima Andrikienė, "the EU has been a strong supporter and advocate of the establishment of the UNHRC, which is a testing ground of the EU's commitment to effective multilateralism." However, she highlighted the report's conclusion that "the EU must have a clear vision, political agenda and long-term strategy as regards the functioning of the UNHRC as well as the activities of EU Member States within that body, especially as regards the review of the UNHRC to be undertaken in 2011".

Human Rights: persecution of Shirin Ebadi, coup in Guinea, censorship in Kenya
2009-01-19 - 14:29
In three resolutions on democracy and human rights adopted at the end of this week's Strasbourg plenary session, the European Parliament strongly condemns the persecution of Nobel Peace laureate Shirin Ebadi in Iran, denounces the "seizure of power" by junta in Guinea and voices its regret at the signing of a bill, which could lead to direct media censorship in Kenya. Call to end persecution of Nobel Peace laureate Shirin Ebadi in Iran
Parliament, in a resolution adopted by a large majority, strongly condemns the "repression, persecution and threats" against the Iranian lawyer and 2003 Nobel Peace laureate Shirin Ebadi and expresses its grave concern at the intensified persecution of human rights defenders in Iran.
On 21 December 2008, Iranian police and security officials closed the Centre for the Defence of Human Rights (CDHR) led by Ms Ebadi as it was preparing to hold a celebration marking the 60th anniversary of Human Rights Day. Eight days later, her office was searched and documents and computers were removed.
The closure of the CDHR is "not only an attack on Shirin Ebadi and human rights defenders in Iran, but an attack on the entire international human rights community of which she is an influential and leading member", say MEPs
There is increasing evidence that the Iranian authorities' persecution of Shirin Ebadi has intensified because of her contact with UN human rights officials and their use of information provided by her centre in a UN report of 2 October 2008 on the situation of human rights in Iran.
MEPs urge that the Iranian authorities put an end to the repression, persecution and threats against Shirin Ebadi, authorise the re-opening of the CDHR, and allow the CDHR, the HROK and other human rights associations to function unhampered.
Intimidation of political opponents and human rights defenders
The EP also reiterates its concern regarding the persecution and imprisonment of citizens who engage in the defence of human rights and who campaign against the death penalty, which frequently leads to them being charged with so-called activities against national security.
One case for serious concern is that of Mohammad Sadiq Kaboudvand, a prisoner of conscience whose health has deteriorated since imprisonment. The resolution calls both for his immediate and unconditional release, and for an end to the "harassment, intimidation and persecution of political opponents and human rights defenders, including by releasing persons imprisoned arbitrarily or on the basis of their political views".
Appeal to respect religious minorities
Observing that believers of the Baha'i faith are harshly persecuted in Iran, the EP appeals to the Iranian authorities to "live up to the government's requirement to respect religious minorities". The resolution asks that Bahia' leaders who have been imprisoned solely on the basis of their belief be promptly released.
EU Trade Agreement depends on improvement of human rights situation
The resolution emphasises that any future conclusion of a Cooperation and Trade Agreement between Iran and the EU depends also on a substantial improvement in Iran's human rights situation.
Looking to the future, Parliament urges the Council and Commission to continue their examination of the human rights situation in Iran and to submit to it in the first half of 2009 a comprehensive report on the matter and to continue to raise specific cases of human rights abuses.

The coup in Guinea
In a resolution on Guinea, MEPs condemn the seizure of power "by a group of officers" one day after the death of President Lansana Conté, and welcome the decisions of the African Union and Economic Community of West African States to suspend the country for "as long as it has no democratically elected parliament or government".
Guinea is classified by Transparency International as one of the most corrupt countries in Africa. On 23 December, 2008, a group of officers from the military seized power the day after the death of President Lansana Conté, a president who had himself taken power by force in 1984.
The resolution demands that "free and transparent parliamentary and presidential elections complying with international norms" be held within the next few months, with the cooperation of African Union (AU) and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and with EU support.
MEPs also call for an inter-Guinean national dialogue with the participation of all political parties, trade unions and civil society organisations, to "pave the way for a democratic transition".
Measures to tackle corruption
Noting the political undertakings of the new Guinean leaders concerning, in particular, "a serious attempt to tackle corruption and the introduction of a transparent electoral system in Guinea", the EP calls for these undertakings to be acted on and for the opening of a political dialogue between the EU and the transitional authorities now in power in Guinea. This would be in the framework of Articles 8 and 96 of the Cotonou Agreement.
In the event that there is no democratic transition, the EP asks the Commission to be prepared to freeze all aid other than humanitarian and food aid, and to consider targeted sanctions against the members of the entities which have seized power.

Press freedom threatened in Kenya
Reiterating its commitment to press freedom and the fundamental rights of freedom of expression, Parliament, in a resolution adopted by 46 votes with 1 abstention, regrets the signing of the Kenya Communications (Amendment) Bill by President Kibaki, a bill which, according to the East African Journalist's Association, would introduce direct media censorship by the Kenyan government.
The two main problematic clauses are Sections 88 and 46 of the bill. Section 88 gives the Information Minister considerable powers to raid media houses that are deemed to be a threat to national security and to dismantle their broadcasting equipments, while Section 46 gives the state the power to regulate contents to be aired and published by electronic and print media respectively.
At the time of signing the bill, which amends the Kenya Communications Act of 1998, President Kibaki neglected to take widely reported reservations into consideration. Prime Minister Odinga has joined widespread opposition to the legislation and officials from the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) recently held crisis talks, claiming that the President had failed to consult the Prime Minister over the media law.
Call for bill to be compatible with freedom of expression
MEPs press the Kenyan Government to initiate stakeholder consultations in order to "build consensus on how to better regulate the communications industry without interfering with press freedom". President Kibaki and Prime Minister Odinga are asked to do their utmost to guarantee that any updated version of the new media bill be compatible with the principles of freedom of expression and information.
Kenya's culture of impunity to be addressed
Flawed presidential elections in Kenya last year led to street demonstrations which escalated into riots and ethnic clashes across the country, killing more than 1 000 people and leaving another 350 000 homeless. Parliament underlines the need to address the culture of impunity in Kenya in order to bring those responsible for the post-election violence to justice.
The EP also calls for the setting-up of an independent commission, consisting of local and international legal experts, to carry out investigations and prosecutions. While President Kibaki and Prime Minister Odinga have agreed in theory to create such a commission, it has yet to be formed.
Finally, MEPs welcome President Kibaki's recent move to revise the media law and his gesture to consider amendments to the legislation proposed by members of the media. Full text of adopted resolutions will appear here (click on 15 January 2009)
