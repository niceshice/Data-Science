He replaces Italian liberal Luigi de Magistris, who left the European Parliament to become mayor of the city of Naples. Mikael Gustafsson (GUE/NGL, SE) became the first man to be elected chair of the Women's Rights and Gender Equality Committee, also on Monday.
Mr Mulder was nominated by the ALDE group. After his election - to which no one objected - he said he intends "to allow every member to contribute to the debate and to raise the profile of the committee", as he feels its importance is sometimes underrated.
Deputy chair Bart Staes (Greens, BE), recalled Mr Mulder's long experience in the Budgetary Control Committee, of which he has been a member since 1994, with a break of only one year.
Mr Gustafsson was the first man to be elected chair of the Women's Rights and Gender Equality Committee since its establishment in 1984. After his election, by acclamation, he said: "I feel overwhelmed and honoured. The committee has put their trust in me, and I will do my utmost to live up to that trust".
Declaring that he would strive to continue the work of former chair Eva-Britt Svensson, Mr Gustafsson listed challenges he wants to work on, such as EU legislation to counter violence against women, strengthen their economic independence and boost their influence in politics.
