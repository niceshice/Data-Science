The cost of climate change?
Support for poorer parts of Europe and the developing world and measures to ensure security of food and energy. These were proposals in a resolution on climate change passed by MEPs on 10 April. MEPs also debated the wider impact of climate change. Thursday also saw votes on Tibet, investment to adapt to globalisation, Croatia and cultural industries in Europe.
The resolution says about climate change that "60 000 deaths per year are attributable to climate-related natural disasters" and that "climate change is a problem that concerns modern societies as a whole."
The chair of Parliament's Committee on climate change, Italian Socialist Guido Sacconi asked the Plenary, "How can we in the EU…give those countries more help that have less capacity to deal with the effects of global warming, sometimes devastating, that have already emerged".
He also called for more research: "We still don't know enough...about the effects coming from global warming which make it difficult to plan long-term policies to adapt and to forestall the worst aspects."
Europe's Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas said, "I hope we will reach an agreement on emissions in Copenhagen in 2009". He also said that climate change hits the poorest hardest: “despite not having really contributed to it, they are the ones who are the greatest victims of it". Many MEPs also stressed that poorer countries suffer the most and need help.
In its resolution MEPs call for:
additional resources for innovative solutions to address climate change
cooperation to support the poorer parts of Europe and the developing world
measures to ensure security of food and energy supplies
measures to ensure the availability, accessibility, use and conservation of water
action to strengthen the capacity of health systems to cope with the adverse effects of climate change
Polish MEP Jerzy Buzek for the centre-right EPP-ED group told the house that "the whole world would need to act to counter climate change" and that it is "much more cost-effective to invest in prevention". Greek Member Katerina Batzeli for the Socialist group said that "we have reached the very limit of sustainability (...) the crisis is also an economic crisis".
Tibet, cultural industries in Europe
Later MEPs adopted a resolution on the situation in Tibet, condemning the Chinese repression against Tibetan population and calling for the opening of an inquiry into the most recent riots. It also wants EU countries to clarify their position about whether to attend the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in Beijing.
Among other resolutions adopted Thursday: the recommendation on approving the aid from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for Portugal and Malta, cultural industries in Europe, the progress report on Croatia, including the positive results achieved so far, and efforts needed in the fight against discrimination and supporting the rights of national minorities.
