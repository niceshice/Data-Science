Financial and economic crisis: European Parliament response
Economic and monetary affairs
2009-05-14 - 15:03
Parliament has played a major role in shaping the EU response to the financial and economic crisis. As co-legislators, MEPs have passed new laws to ease the impact of this crisis and prevent another. They have made deals with Member States to get these laws into force quickly, and have inspired more, via formal requests to the Commission. The Commission has responded by tabling initiatives to, inter alia, enhance financial market transparency and co-ordinate financial supervision.
This background note looks at Parliament's role in shaping measures to combat this crisis and make new ones less likely , including improved co-ordination among national financial supervisory authorities, better financial market regulation, and stricter requirements on risk management, credit rating, and solvency.
It also looks at measures taken to stimulate economic recovery, including extending the globalisation adjustment fund, regional policy reforms, recovery plan energy projects, and help for small businesses.

An early call for better coordination at EU level and more transparency
In 2008, well before the Commission tabled proposals to deal with the crisis, MEPs were calling for better co-ordination between national financial supervisory authorities. Most MEPs see this as a first step towards implementing a supervision system at EU level to monitor the EU financial markets more closely and thus be better prepared for future cases of financial turmoil. Parliament also advocated increasing the transparency of financial markets, inter alia by requiring the disclosure of policies on remuneration for senior staff and the securitisation process (the selling on as investment products of loans by those who originate the loans).
Also in 2008, MEPs made a formal request to the Commission for new legislation to improve regulation of financial markets, in particular regarding hedge funds and private equity investors.

Legislating to improve transparency, financial stability and avoid future crises
New rules to avoid future financial crisis - Capital Requirements Directives
A law approved by the Parliament seeks to improve risk management and avoid a repetition in future of the current banking crisis, which saw bank failures putting pressure on other banks and leaving the whole financial system at risk.
The legislation aims to enhance both the efficiency and effectiveness of supervision and crisis management.
Credit Rating Agencies: partially responsible for the current financial crisis, say MEPs
Parliament made a major contribution to reaching an agreement with the Council of Ministers to adopt strict rules to improve the transparency and independence of European credit rating. According to MEPs, credit rating agencies failed to detect the worsening of financial market conditions and new risks in the credit market, such as from structured credit products (derivatives) and hedge funds.
The new regulation requires all credit rating agencies wishing to operate in the EU to register and comply with a set of rules designed to enhance the transparency, independence and good governance of credit rating agencies, thus improving the quality and reliability of credit ratings and consumer confidence.
Solvency II: better financial supervision of the insurance industry
The Parliament adopted a major overhaul of the supervisory framework to enhance the financial stability of the insurance and reinsurance industry: the so-called Solvency II legislation.
The law introduces more sophisticated solvency requirements which will take better account of the risks the companies must deal with: insurance risks as at present, but also market, credit and operational risks.
Increase in bank deposit guarantee
Parliament adopted legislation to raise the retail deposit guarantee to €100,000, to so that, if a European bank fails, citizens' savings are protected up to this amount. MEPs also decided that bank customers should be given faster access to their deposits in emergencies and that a mechanism should be established for cross-border co-operation in the event of another economic crisis.

Stimulating economic recovery
Extending the scope of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund to respond to the crisis
Parliament adopted a first-reading agreement with Council temporarily to broaden the scope of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which provides support to workers made redundant as a direct result of the global financial and economic crisis.
Increasing EU financial assistance for non-Euro Member States
MEPs voted to increase EU financial assistance capacity to help non-Euro area Member States face current global crisis. MEPs gave their support to the proposal to double the overall financial assistance ceiling from €25 to €50 billion.
Regional policy reforms: faster funding for economic recovery
A set of reforms to stimulate economic recovery by delivering EU funding faster and more flexibly to regional policy projects was approved by Parliament on 2 April, approved by the Council of Ministers on 5 May, and takes effect at the end of May. These reforms will provide immediate funding for "major" projects (costing over €50 million). About 900 such projects are planned for 2007-2013, with a total investment of €120 billion from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and Cohesion Fund. Smaller projects will be helped too, but cutting red tape, accelerating payments, and through flat-rate or lump sum payments of their overhead costs. Financial engineering schemes that combine grants with European Investment Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development loans to fund projects will be facilitated, and all EU Member States may use up to 4% of ERDF funds for national or regional schemes to improve the energy efficiency of housing.
Recovery plan energy projects
Gas and electricity infrastructure, offshore wind parks and carbon capture and storage projects will get €3.98 billion of the €5 billion available under the EU economic recovery plan, approved by MEPs on 6 May. Gas and electricity infrastructure will get €2,365 million (up to 50% of project costs), offshore wind parks €565 million, and carbon capture and storage €1,050 million (up to 80% of costs for 13 projects in 7 Member States). The Nabucco pipeline, to carry natural gas to the EU from the Caspian Sea, gets €200 million. Offshore wind projects include North Sea energy parks and plans to link North Sea and Baltic Sea parks to the onshore grid. Of the €3.98 billion total, €2 billion is to be made available in 2009 and €1.98 billion in 2010. Unspent funds may be used for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects.
Help for EU small and medium-sized businesses
MEPs have called on the Council and Commission to join them in making the Small Business Act legally binding. This measure would help EU small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which at present consistently underperform their American counterparts and larger companies on productivity, growth and innovation. The report also calls for mandatory, systematic and targeted impact assessments for SMEs, known as an "SME test".
MEPs have also approved the Statute for a European private company, specifically developed for SMEs. It gives firms the option of using a uniform set of rules for to establish themselves anywhere in the EU. This should reduce the cost of complying with different Member States' national laws.
Finally, Parliament has asked the Commission to table a proposal for a directive to facilitate cross-border transfers of registered offices within the EU, to enable business to take advantage of the single market.

Reflections and analysis
G20 Summit: MEPs concerned about remuneration and tax havens
Parliament adopted a resolution on the outcome of the summit welcoming the G20 pledge to reform remuneration schemes in a more sustainable way as part of the financial regulatory review. MEPs called on the next G20 Summit to agree on coordinated and concrete action both to close down all tax and regulatory havens and to close 'onshore' tax and regulatory loopholes.
A few weeks earlier, MEPs said that all EU Member States should agree to exchange full information on interest earned on saving accounts by July 2014.
Hearings with experts
According to MEPs and MPs from the 27 EU Member States and the candidate countries, who met in February to discuss “A New Deal for European Economic Recovery”, strong European leadership is needed to tackle the current crisis of confidence and would help soften the effects of economic slowdown.

Parliament’s role in economic and financial matters
Parliament has co-decision legislative power, with the Council, over all EU legislation concerning financial services. It also decides jointly with the Council on the EU budget and many of the spending programmes involved. The European Central Bank President appears before the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee four times each year to explain and be held politically and publicly accountable for the ECB's independent decisions on monetary policy. Taxation remains a largely national issue, and where there are EU rules (such as for VAT excise duties and savings taxes) they are adopted by a unanimous decision of the Member States in the Council. Financial market supervision is currently primarily organised on a national basis with coordination arrangements aiming for consistent application of EU law. It is for national governments individually to decide if their taxpayers' money should be used to rescue failing financial institutions within their jurisdiction.
