European Parliament wants to promote active citizenship and mutual understanding among young people across Europe. By adopting a co-decision report by Lissy GRÖNER (PES, DE) on the draft Youth in Action programme for 2007-13 in first reading by overwhelming majority (542 votes in favour, 76 against 12 abstentions), MEPs also ask for more funding than proposed by the Commission.
Instead of a €915 million budget, Parliament is proposing the figure of €1.128 billion which was already suggested by the rapporteur and the EP's Committee on Culture and Education on the basis of Parliament's position on the next long-term budget for 2007-13 - which was enshrined in the report by Reimer BÖGE (EPP-ED, DE).
Parliament points out that the appropriations indicated in the Commission proposal beyond the year 2006 are subject to the decisions to be taken on the next multi-annual financial framework. MEPs also call for project funding to be paid by the Commission within four months as a rule.
The programme is intended for young people aged between 13 and 30. However, Parliament insists that the main target group should be young people aged 15-28.
MEPs backed the rapporteur's repeated calls for young people with disabilities to be included on equal terms "so as to prevent any form of discrimination" .
The programme should also promote sport and cultural activities as a means of fostering social integration, tolerance and non-discrimination, Parliament demands.
In view of the success of European Youth Week, Parliament says this event should become an established part of EU youth policy, focusing on:
information on the work of the European institutions;
activities enabling young people to inform MEPs of their concerns
a prize-giving for the best youth projects promoted by the Youth programme. /AM 58/
Parliament also asks for the name of the Youth of the world action to be changed into Youth in the world.
