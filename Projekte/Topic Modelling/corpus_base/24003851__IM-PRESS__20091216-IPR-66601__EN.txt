"The European Union must stand firm on its climate change objectives and must not lose sight its offer of a 30% reduction in EU greenhouse gas emissions by 2020", head of the EP delegation to the Copenhagen climate change summit Jo Leinen said on Wednesday, after meeting the EU's Swedish Presidency.
"A weakening of the 30% target would put Europe's leadership in the climate negotiations in question," said Mr Leinen.
An official delegation of 15 MEPs are closely following the negotiations for a climate change agreement in Copenhagen.
"Globally binding climate change targets must be set for 2020, and should apply to all developed and emerging markets. Our targets for 2020 should not be watered down. Lowering the EU's targets for 2020 would encourage other states to move their own climate protection targets," said Mr Leinen.
MEPs in Copenhagen are having daily briefings with the negotiators from the EU's Swedish Presidency and the Commission as well as bilateral meetings with parliamentarians from countries outside Europe.
"Russia, Ukraine and the Central and Eastern European EU Member States need to finally to come into the negotiations. Transferring 11 billion tonnes of 'hot air' from the Kyoto Protocol to a new climate treaty would severely weaken the new deal. Therefore, unused emission permits should not be valid after 2013", said Mr Leinen.
The mandate and position of Parliament's delegation are outlined in a resolution entitled "EU strategy for the Copenhagen climate change conference", which was passed by an overwhelming majority on 25 November 2009.
