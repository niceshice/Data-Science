Video: profile of Jerzy Buzek As a young man Jerzy Buzek said he dreamed of being an MP in a free Poland. He would fulfil that ambition and later go on to be Poland's Prime Minister from 1997 to 2001. On Tuesday the 69-year old former scientists became President of the European Parliament after being elected by 555 of his fellow MEPs.
This video looks at the man and the issues he intends to pursue over the next two and a half years.
