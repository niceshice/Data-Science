Looking North: The Baltic Sea area in focus
Copenhagen, Stockholm, and St Petersburg - just three of the great and historic cites that lie on the Baltic Sea. Now it needs our help as pollution from chemicals, oil spills, and agricultural fertilizer washed into the sea are all taking their toll - there's even rumoured to be a sunken Soviet nuclear submarine down there. Last week MEPs approved a resolution with several recommendations they hope will clean up and one of the most polluted seas in the world.
The tide may be turning for the Baltic Sea: eight of the countries surrounding it are now members of the EU. Together they have 147 million people and are represented at an EU level by 228 MEPs.
Russia also borders the Sea - twice in fact: once around St. Petersburg, its former capital, and secondly through the polluted and impoverished Kaliningrad enclave, a Russian island surrounded by Poland, Belarus and Lithuania. This makes cooperation with Russia on the future of the Baltic vital.
Some of the measures for the Baltic contained in the resolution include: measures to reduce marine pollution from land and sea, more funding for the region, accelerating the building of water, air and road-related building projects, making border crossings more straightforward, developing links with Kaliningrad and finally intensifying cultural and educational exchanges. It was based on a report by Finnish MEP Alexander Stubb of the European People's Party
The report also aims to be included in the EU's "northern dimension" policy aimed at increasing cooperation between Russia, the Arctic and the Baltic regions. The policy has been the subject of several resolutions by the Parliament.
The Baltic region has its own cross-party intergroup at the European Parliament, which supports and promotes the region. Composed of 40 MEPs, its Chairman Christopher Beazley stressed during the debate in Parliament that for the countries around the Baltic there was a real message of achievement - "that a region dislocated by the Cold War can now have harmony, prosperity and stability restored".
