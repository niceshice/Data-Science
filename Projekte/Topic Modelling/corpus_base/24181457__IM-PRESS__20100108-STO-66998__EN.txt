The News: Oettinger to decarbonise Europe - Kallas full steam ahead - Backstage at the hearings Thursday saw MEPs grill six prospective European Commissioners on their priorities and competences. They were Siim Kallas on transport, Günther Oettinger on energy, Androulla Vassiliou on education, John Dalli on health, Johannes Hahn for regional policy and Neelie Kroes for the digital agenda.
Siim Kallas pledges 40% of EU transport budget to rail sector
The Estonian commissioner-designate for transport Siim Kallas said "free movement is one of the greatest freedoms of European citizens and modern transport makes a fundamental contribution to this freedom".
Regarding business interests in the only sector that has failed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the last 10 years, he stressed the need to strike the right balance between green regulation and profitability. Questioned on the use of body scanners, he said, "it is very bad that some Member States already use body scanners in the absence of any EU common standards".
On the liberalisation of rail transport, "I am in favour of open competition. It brings benefits to all sectors", he said, adding that he aims to "remove the obstacles" to the proper functioning of transport. He told MEPs that he would heed their request for a commitment of 40% of the EU transport budget for the rail sector.
Energy: Oettinger calls for decarbonisation and security
The German commissioner-designate for energy Günther Oettinger was quizzed on topics including the security of energy supply, energy efficiency, the role of nuclear energy and energy poverty.
In a calm and measured performance, Mr Oettinger said he would like to work on "the Europeanisation of our energy policy" over the coming five years. On improving energy security and solidarity he said that it was important to make raw materials "available to every national market and industrial purchaser, but on the same terms".
He also said that the "decarbonisation of the energy supplies" of the EU and greater energy security were two of his main priorities.
Androulla Vassiliou backs language learning and sport
Cypriot commissioner-designate for education, culture, multilingualism and youth Androulla Vassiliou told MEPs, "we owe it to all children to provide them with a proper education and training". She highlighted the importance of increasing training and mobility, and creating an environment that promotes culture and creativity.
Questioned on her position towards multilingualism Ms Vassiliou said that "learning languages is a tool for a better life".
"Cooperation and exchange of good practices, including setting benchmarks, is the way forward" to the disparities among Member States' educational systems.
She also said she considered sport "a vehicle to achieve positive things" such as good health and team spirit and she promised to pay attention to all sports, not just football. Developing sport at grass-roots level will be at the heart of her policies, she said.
John Dalli: "patients first, consumers first"
Maltese commissioner-designate for health and consumer policy John Dalli: said that consumers and patients will be "the underlying theme of my work: patients first, consumers first".
On consumer policy, Mr Dalli said he was in favour of clear, informative labelling to empower "well-informed" consumers "who can take educated decisions on the goods and services they consume". He also spoke about the need for a greater focus on prevention, forwarding the dossier on cross-border healthcare and working on issues like alcoholism, smoking and obesity.
Mr Dalli said he sees his role as "the guardian of consumers" and, in the case of the so-called Pharmapackage, he stated he wants to "bring more patient perspective in the proposal".
Johannes Hahn: "Regional policy is a success story of European integration"
According to commissioner-designate Johannes Hahn, "regional policy is a success story of European integration" and there is no alternative to continuing it.
He strongly advocated a strategic and integrated approach to regional policy, saying he would oppose any attempts to renationalise it. He stressed the need to invest more in education and creativity to boost competitiveness and innovation, adding that "no region in Europe can assume prosperity forever".
Mr Hahn promised continuing support for so-called "transitional" regions and said he would "support any kind of policy that transcends borders, any kinds of borders". He wants more active involvement of regional and local authorities.
Neelie Kroes: “We need 100% broadband availability”
Dutch commissioner-designate for digital agenda Neelie Kroes said Europe should invest more in developing information and communication technologies (ICT) and extend infrastructure to provide 100% safe and secure broadband access.
She also wants people to improve their computer skills: “We need 100% broadband availability because it will improve competitiveness and bring an excellent opportunity to create jobs, higher productivity and economic growth."
Because of cybercrime, which is not limited by borders, she wants Europe to become the safest place for internet consumers, but is not keen on the idea of an EU cyberspace regulator and prefers more cooperation and a stronger role for ENISA, the European Network and Information Security Agency.
After agreeing that new technologies should also be available to low income households, the disabled and the elderly, she added, "we are not just living with networks and digital media, but in them." Ms Kroes promised to do her best to accelerate the positive impact of information and communication technologies in areas like health, culture, trade, economy and energy.
