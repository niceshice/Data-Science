EuroparlTV "The death of Osama Bin Laden marks a significant success in the fight of the international community against terrorists," EP President Jerzy Buzek said Monday morning, following the news that Osama Bin Laden had been killed.
"Although this battle is far from over, we have made significant progress towards a more secure world," Mr Buzek said in a statement .
Bin Laden`s activities brought suffering and death to innocent people and families in the entire world: in the US, Europe, in Afghanistan, Pakistan and beyond, he said. "Nothing can justify his plots and deeds that violated the sanctity of life and human dignity."
"People of different faiths, language or race who believe in peaceful co-existence can feel more secure. The international community must continue its efforts to prevent terrorist acts and to bring their perpetrators to justice," he added.
