Conference "People and Parliament in the European Union in the context of the 2009 elections"
Journalists have the opportunity to follow up this conference with experts which examine different aspects that have an impact on electoral participation.

These are some of the questions that will be discussed, aiming to find answers to the paradox that while the European Parliament powers increase, participation of citizens in the European elections decreases. Results of a special 2007 Eurobarometer on how citizens perceive the role, image and functioning of the European Parliament, will be presented.
Journalists will also have the opportunity of posing questions.
