Reaction to swine flu "disproportionate"; MEPs discuss EU's response
Michele Rivasi on Thursday 3 March 2011in her office in Brussels The Environment Committee has criticised the EU's response to the outbreak as "disproportionate" Interview with French Green MEP Michèle Rivasi: Parliament's rapporteur on Europe's response Remember the swine flu scare of 2009-2010 with its attendant fear, panic and costly vaccination program? On Monday evening MEPs will look at whether it was necessary. The Environment Committee has criticised the EU's response to the outbreak as "disproportionate" and we spoke to rapporteur French Green Michèle Rivasi ahead of the discussion in Plenary on Monday and vote on Tuesday.
In your report you say the response was "Given that people died, wasn't it better to err on the side of caution?
According to the figures provided by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC ), influenza A(H1N1) 2009 caused 2,900 deaths in Europe by the end of April 2010. These figures are low in comparison to the official mortality estimates for seasonal influenza, which the Commission puts at 40,000 deaths in a moderate year and 220,000 in a particularly severe season. The moderate severity of H1N1 influenza was officially recognised by the World Health Organisation in May 2009, yet one month later, the WHO issued the highest level "pandemic" for H1N1 - based on the ability of the virus to spread, not based on its severity.
This maximum level alert triggered a raft of measures in the EU, in particular very costly vaccination campaigns in many Member States (e.g. the costs are estimated at €1.3 billion in the UK and between €700-760 million in France - compared with €87 million against seasonal influenza in France).
Spending billions of euros on vaccines against H1N1 influenza seems grossly disproportionate to the actual – and known – severity of H1N1 influenza.
What can we learn? What should have been done differently?
Our evaluation of the management of H1N1 influenza in the EU shows that we need more cooperation, more independence and more transparency.
We have asked for a revision of future influenza pandemic prevention plans to make them sufficiently autonomous and flexible.
The definition of a pandemic has to be revised to include severity. We support joint purchasing of vaccines, but we need to be sure that the full liability for the quality, safety and efficacy for the authorised indications of a medicinal product rest with the manufacturer.
Studies on vaccines and antiviral medications should be independent of pharmaceutical companies. Accelerated authorisation procedure stressed the problem of the scientific evidence available. We need complete transparency about the evaluation of medicinal products recommended in the event of health emergencies and all declarations of interest by the evaluation experts need to be published.

Europe's protein deficit under spotlight
Soy sprouts ©BELGIAN Total EU protein crop production (dried pulses, soybeans etc) currently occupies only 3% of the Union's arable land Supplies only 30% of the protein crops consumed as animal feed in the EU Falling protein crop production is concerning Members of the Agriculture and Development Committees who want a 1992 international agreement, in which Europe voluntarily decreased protein crop production in favour of imports, to be looked at anew. MEPs will consider the own-initiative report on the issue drafted by Green MEP Martin Häusling on Monday evening.
Total EU protein crop production (dried pulses, soybeans etc) currently occupies only 3% of the Union's arable land and supplies only 30% of the protein crops consumed as animal feed in the EU, with a trend over the past decade towards an increase in this deficit.
Speaking ahead of the debate Mr Häusling told us: "Farmers suffer from increasing prices for feed because of speculation in agricultural markets. Production of more feed locally would lead to more independence and higher income for farmers as well as better animal health and meat and milk quality."
According to the report, Europe became a leading cereal exporter and the US a leading protein exporter. This supported export-oriented meat production in Europe.
As Mr Hausling said, "the report underlines the important role protein crops can play in order to meet the new challenges like climate change and soil, water and biodiversity conservation and to develop a sustainable CAP. Moreover it shows how Europe could be less dependent on imports."
In this context, Members call on the Commission to
take a medium - to long-term view in reviewing its policy on proteins
submit a report on the possibilities and options for increasing domestic protein crop production in the EU by means of new policy instruments
establish a monitoring mechanism on the origin of protein crops imported into the EU.

Women's Day marked by MEPs
Some of the scenes from the Parliament's Chamber as Women's Day was celebrated Focus on involvement of women in politics Many advance made but equality and parity a long way off After discussing ways to ensure gender equality and fighting female poverty, MEPs commemorated the 100th anniversary of International Women’s Day on Wednesday morning.
Leading female MEPs and female European Commissioners were praised as many MEPs remarked on the invaluable contribution women have and are making to Europe's development.
After a film sequence retracing the history of fight for women's rights, Jerzy Buzek (EP), Enikő Győri (EU Council), José Manuel Barroso (European Commission) and Eva-Britt Svensson (Women's Rights Committee) honoured the role played by women.
On podium with 6 female Vice-Presidents, 2 Quaestors and the Chair of the Civil Liberties Committee, EP President Jerzy Buzek called national parliaments to adopt laws boosting women's presence in EP. He saluted women fighting for democracy and human rights: "We oppose women being stripped of their dignity in the name of any system or religion"
EP Women’s Rights Committee chair Eva-Britt Svensson said that "we will not wait another 100 years" for stereotypes that compartalize men and women to disappear. "The fight goes on every day of the year, not only 8 March".
While welcoming the achievements, female speakers from political groups underlined remaining obstacles and called for quotas to empower women in decision-making positions.

Action needed in Europe's manufacturing industry
Textile factory in Troyes, France ©SCIENCE Report says the EU must rethink its industrial policy because it provides jobs to almost 60 million Europeans. The EU needs an innovation chain - from industry-related research to innovation development and application Cars, television sets, textiles. These sectors have all been hit hard by the economic crisis. European industry generally faces tough challenges and to meet them needs to shift towards sustainable, eco-efficient, globally competitive and knowledge-based manufacturing, according to a report due to be debated in plenary Tuesday evening. It says the EU must rethink its industrial policy because it provides jobs to almost 60 million Europeans.
"Industrial Policy for the Globalised Era", to be voted on Wednesday, is considered a flagship initiative of the Europe 2020 strategy. Parliament's rapporteur on the issue is German Socialist Bernd Lange.
According to the European Commission "EU manufacturing growth is the lowest since the early 1990s and is bound to deteriorate further"
It goes on to say that the global economic crisis has affected EU industry making it difficult to adapt to challenges like globalisation, climate change, resources reduction, demographic change and innovation.
Some sectors are in permanent crisis as a result of competition from third countries that don't have to comply with EU rules on labour, environmental, intellectual and industrial property protection.
The report notes that Europe's major competitors like the US, Japan and China are pursuing a strong and active industrial policy supported by broad investment in leading edge products and services.
MEPs have just tabled 140 different recommendations, but Mr Lange sees 15 "cornerstones" including:
The EU needs an innovation chain - from industry-related research to innovation development and application
Europe must work on resource efficiency, sustainable production and clean energy production
Small and medium size enterprises should be more involved in industrial policy, they should have an easier access to public procurement
The EU needs long-term strategies to anticipate and address change, to include workers in decision-making and rethink its education policy to fit the job market better.
Europe's industry
EU industry accounts for a third of gross value added in the EU
Almost ¾ of European exports are from industrial goods
EU industry gives jobs to 57 million people (1/3 of all employment)
The largest industries are mining and quarrying, manufacturing, electricity, gas and water supply and construction,
Sectors most touched by the crisis: motor vehicles, metal machinery, electrical equipment and textiles
SMEs make up 2/3 of industry's employment.

Women's rights one hundred years on: the fight continues
A women walks past a women's day poster in the European Parliament in Strasbourg Parliament marked the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day President Buzek said "There are too few women in the EP: 35% is not enough, even though this is slightly more than in national parliaments. Parliament marked the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day (Tuesday 8 March) with a debate and vote on two resolutions tabled by the Women's Rights Committee: one on gender equality and the other on female poverty. A third resolution, on reducing health inequalities, was also adopted.
In a special ceremony held on Tuesday to commemorate 100 years of campaigning for women’s rights, EP President Buzek said "There are too few women in the EP: 35% is not enough, even though this is slightly more than in national parliaments. It is up to national parliaments to ensure higher representation in the EP. Member States should therefore adopt relevant decisions and a legal framework to boost the presence of women in the EP".
European Commission President José Manuel Barroso, the Hungarian Presidency's secretary of state for European affairs Enikő Győri, EP Women's Rights Committee chair Eva-Britt Svensson (GUE/NGL, SV) and speakers for Parliament's political groups also took the floor.
Tackling inequality
The need to narrow the gender pay gap, to get more women in decision-making positions and to raise the female employment rate are among key points in the resolution accompanying the 2010 annual report on equality between women and men in the EU, drafted by Mariya Nedelcheva (EPP, BG) and adopted by 366 in favour, 200 against and 32 abstentions. The importance of better child care facilities and child-related leave is also highlighted.
If women’s employment, part-time employment and productivity rates were similar to men’s, GDP would increase by 30%, says the resolution.
Only 3% of major companies are chaired by a woman. Member States should therefore take effective measures, such as quotas, to ensure greater representation for women in major listed companies and on the management boards of companies in general, say MEPs, citing Norway as a positive example, followed by Spain and France.
Parliament also calls for binding targets to ensure equal representation of women and men in politics, saying further efforts must be made at EU, national, regional and municipal levels.
Enforce equal pay
The pay gap between men and women still averages 18% in the EU and even exceeds 30% in one Member State, noted MEPs, urging EU Member States to implement equal pay for equal work laws properly and calling on the European Commission to impose sanctions on those that fail to do so.
Eliminating poverty
Nearly 85 million people in the EU were living below the poverty line in 2008, and 17% of all women in the EU were living in poverty, notes the second resolution - on the face of female poverty - drafted by Rovana Plumb (S&D, RO).
Macroeconomic, social and labour-market policies should be reformed, to guarantee a minimum income as well as economic and social justice for women. All EU common policies should have a gender perspective, stresses the resolution, adopted by a show of hands.
Economic crisis could widen health inequalities
In a third resolution adopted today, Parliament underlines that everybody should have access to healthcare systems and affordable healthcare. The specific needs of vulnerable groups such as women, older patients, undocumented migrants, ethnic minorities, need to be taken better into account.
Life expectancy has been shown to vary across EU Member States by 14.2 years for men and 8.3 years for women (Eurostat figures for 2007 and 2010 respectively), says the resolution, which was drafted by Edite Estrela (S&D, PT) and adopted by 379 votes to 228 with 49 abstentions. Also within countries, groups of different education levels and social situations have widely differing health prospects.

Dutch MEP Bastiaan Belder interviewed on his report in Iran
Dutch MEP Bastiaan Belder Interview with Dutch MEP Bastiaan Belder (EFD) who drafted a report on the EU's approach to Iran "We have to back the forces in Iran that want to fight to regain fundamental rights" Iran is facing an array of challenges – from power struggles between competing factions within the country’s ruling elites to social and economic difficulties as well as a turbulent regional situation. We talked to Dutch MEP Bastiaan Belder (EFD) who drafted a report on the EU's approach to Iran which will be discussed Wednesday from 1500 CET.
What worries you most in the current internal situation?
BB: We have big concerns about the growing influence and power of the Revolutionary Guards who are responsible for the grave repression of dissidents, protesters and intellectuals. We should target especially the institutions and the people that are close to and are the driving force behind the nuclear dossier.
With the background of what is going on in the Arab world, we have to back the forces in Iran that want to fight to regain fundamental rights and we deplore all the oppression.
The European Institutions should use all means of communication to let Iranians know what we are thinking about their future. The human rights of Iran are also our human rights. It is my heartfelt wish for them to have the same freedom as we do.
With the recent developments in the region, do you think Iranians will be ready for similar uprising in the near future?
BB: It has given a certain signal and now there are hopes for solidarity, to boost renewed attempts to recover and gain their own freedom and their fundamental rights. But we should also be realistic the repression is very grave.
The fear is very big, nevertheless thousands of people did go out on the streets. The spring is now coming here - the freedom spring is still alive in Iran. Europe should be condemning with one voice the grave violations of human rights and do everything to back these brave citizens.
We should not forget the grave social and economic situation and that is not due to the sanctions...There's a huge brain-drain with 150,000 young Iranians leaving every year. There's also a lack of a free economic climate and of a private sector.
Personally I think the only hope for a real future is the end of the Islamic Republic of Iran as it is very repressive and destabilising for the whole region.
What types of sanctions are feasible?
BB: The aim of sanctions is to make Iran understand that we want to have honest negotiations. Over the years, they have agreed to international proposals, but then gone back on their word, then agreed again. They are playing with time. Sanctions are not about punishing, though now EU and US have now imposed stronger sanctions. It's high time to have serious negotiations.

Hungarian President: We should unite not fight in the EU political arena
Hungarian President Pál Schmitt , European Parliament, Strasbourg 9 March "Our mission is to be an engine of the processes underway," Hungarian president Pál Schmitt told MEPs during a formal sitting Wednesday. The former MEP said responsibility and solidarity underpin the programme Hungary is pushing forward during its six months presidency of the Council of the EU.
Hungary aims to apply these principles in all areas from finance and energy security to responsibility for minorities and keeping the EU's doors open to new members.
Mr Schmitt said minorities will be given the right to be directly represented in the next Hungarian parliament. But, he also emphasized the constitutional duty of Hungarian politicians to stand up for the right to use the Hungarian language and the importance of self-government for Hungarian citizens living abroad.
Turning to the Roma strategy, he said that in the fight against poverty "it's indispensible to reject prejudices," which are not a question of money but "rather humanity and creativity".
Finally he said, Europe shouldn't fight on the political field but rather unite to "strengthen cohesion and to seek a compromise."

MEPs brand Gaddafi a criminal, demand a no-fly zone over Libya
MEPs call for no-fly zone Demand that rebels be recognised by European Union With Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's planes and tanks pounding rebel positions in the east of Libya, MEPs today demanded the enforcement of a no-fly zone over the country's territory and the recognition of rebel authorities to help the insurrection against the regime. Events in North Africa are a key test for the European Union said EP President Jerzy Buzek, emphasizing that the first priority should be to overcome the humanitarian crisis. ´
MEPs had no kind words for Gaddafi, talking about a criminal regime, terrorizing its own people. As Socialist leader Martin Schulz said "Gaddafi is a criminal. He is a murderer, who should be put in an international court. This man will not escape his punishment."
EU diplomacy chief Catherine Ashton said the European Union had a clear aim, namely to be at the forefront of efforts globally, in close coordination with all international partners, such as the UN, US, Turkey, Russia, China, Australia and Arab countries to ensure a rapid reaction to events with no duplication of efforts.
Mrs Ashton said that the EU has to respond very quickly to the rapid changes happening on its southern border "with creativity and determination" even if it is the countries themselves that will determine what happens and each one of them will move at its own speed.
How to stop Gaddafi?
In the debate all political groups except the leftist GUE/NGL supported no-fly zones, although they differed on the need for UN authorisation. In addition all political groups support the recognition of and establishing contact with the "national interim council of Libya" which represents the rebels .
Spanish MEP José Ignacio Salafranca (EPP) said the Gaddafi system must be stopped now, "we have to ratchet up pressure, with the imposition of a no-fly zone and neutralization of communications" he said.
Martin Schulz (S&D) said the European Union should not exclude any measures, including military ones.
Liberal leader Guy Verhofstadt called on Europe to paralyse Gaddafi by creating no-fly zones and recognising the national interim council (the rebel government) to help the opposition to Gaddafi.
Green MEP Daniel Cohn-Bendit told the House: "You need a cool head but also to choose which camp you are in" By enforcing a no-fly zone: "an airplane can be shot down so that we demonstrate to Gaddafi that Libyan cities cannot be bombed". Thus, he called on EU to "take the bull by the horns, recognise the interim government and ensure total isolation. Then Gaddafi's days will be numbered".
Bastiaan Belder (EFD) also supported imposing a no-fly zone - "we need to cut Mr Gaddafi's wings" he said.
Non-attached MEP Bruno Gollnish said dictators should not be pushed into fighting to the bitter end: "If you really want the dictators to leave you have to give them a way out, an escape hatch".
Guy Verhofstadt said aid should be intensified whilst Martin Schulz (S&D) proposed to create a "Marshall plan" for the region in order to give the people a perspective of "peace and democracy".
European duplicity?
Daniel Cohn-Bendit pointed out that European governments have for years been "complicit" with all dictatorships in the region.
Miguel Portas (GUE/NGL) criticized the European countries that for years had been exporting weapons to North African dictators and encouraged European leaders to support a democratic process. "Europe has got to change and understand its past", he said.
British Member Charles Tannock (ECR) said that vast energy revenues allowed Gaddafi to court other countries and cow his own population.
Catherine Ashton noted that many European leaders were forced by events to meet Gaddafi and other people they would otherwise have preferred not to meet but added that as a general principle engagement is better than isolation. However, "we may have brought Gaddafi out of the cold. It is now time to send him back to the cold".

Enlargement: slow progress by Turkey regretted, Montenegro's candidacy welcomed
In two resolutions adopted on Wednesday on the progress of Turkey and Montenegro in their EU membership negotiations, Parliament express concern at the "slow progress" on human rights and key reforms in Turkey in 2010, while welcoming Montenegro's official candidate status despite concerns over corruption.
The Cyprus-Turkey deadlock, lack of dialogue among Turkish political parties and the undermining of press freedom and other basic rights in Turkey are the key factors slowing down the country's EU accession talks, said rapporteur Ria Oomen-Ruijten (EPP, NL) during the debate.
The resolution, adopted with the support of a large majority of MEPs, welcomes Turkey's adoption of constitutional amendments but stresses that "an overall constitutional reform" is still needed to transform Turkey into a real democracy. MEPs also applaud the recent finalisation of negotiations on a readmission agreement to handle migration. Once this enters into force, the Commission should initiate "a visa dialogue, with particular attention to the matter of entry conditions for business people and students".
Among the main remaining challenges, MEPs list the worrying deterioration of press freedom, including self-censorship of national media and internet sites; the situation of women and rising rates of honour killings and forced marriages; and the lack of protection of religious minorities. "Only limited progress" has been made to ensure their legal protection so that they can own properties, open houses of worship or train clergy, adds the resolution.
The wording and specific demands of the text were hammered out in tough negotiations among Parliament's political groups. During the drafting process by the Foreign Affairs Committee, the EPP group agreed to withdraw an amendment calling on EU institutions to "study the possibility" of establishing a "privileged partnership" with Turkey, as an alternative to full EU membership.
In exchange, the committee avoided mentioning the "common goal of full EU membership" for Turkey, as the socialists would have wished. The final text instead has the same wording as last year, describing the opening of Turkey's accession negotiations in 2005 as the "starting point for a long-lasting and open-ended process".
Montenegro: MEPs favour EU accession talks, worry about corruption
In the second resolution, approved by a large majority, Parliament welcomes the European Council’s decision to grant Montenegro EU candidate country status, expressing hope that accession talks with Montenegro could begin this year. MEPs nevertheless voice several concerns, particularly about corruption, organised crime, discrimination and curbs on media freedom.
"I regret that the Commission insists on a gap between the granting of candidate status and the opening of negotiations," said rapporteur Charles Tannock (ECR, UK). "Montenegro should be judged solely on merit, facts and achievements. The onus is now on Montenegro to meet the EU’s expectations, especially in combating corruption and organised crime". "That said, Montenegro remains a good news story in the Western Balkans", he added.
Parliament welcomes the "general consensus and high priority given to European integration by the government and opposition parties", particularly the work done on finalising Montenegro's legal and constitutional framework and its "good track record in implementing economic reforms".
The resolution emphasises that "corruption is still prevalent in many areas, especially in the construction, privatisation and public procurements sector" and that organised crime, above all money-laundering and smuggling, remains a problem. The House is also worried that "women continue to be under-represented in decision-making processes and in leading positions." While welcoming the "generally good inter-ethnic relations and good general protection of minority rights in the country", MEPs call on the authorities to improve the living conditions of the Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian minorities.
The resolution also urges "further steps to ensure independence and professionalism of media outlets," and draws attention to the disproportionate fines that can be imposed for defamation, thereby hampering journalistic freedom and independence. MEPs are especially troubled by reported cases of intimidation and violence on journalists and civil society activists, and call for these to be investigated and the offenders prosecuted.

Roma: binding EU standards to integrate Europe's largest minority
An unidentified local Roma student reads from his textbook at a school in Patka, Hungary ©BELGA/AFP Europe's 10-12 million Roma should benefit from binding minimum standards at EU level to improve their access to employment, education, housing and healthcare, says Parliament in a resolution adopted on Wednesday.
The resolution, which seeks to influence the Commission's upcoming strategy for Roma inclusion, also calls for better protection of fundamental rights and use of EU funding.
Roma people have suffered systematic discrimination and are struggling against "an intolerable degree of exclusion" as well as human rights violations, severe stigmatisation and discrimination in public and private life, says the resolution, which was adopted by 576 votes to 32 with 60 abstentions.
Parliament's rapporteur Lívia Járóka (EPP, HU) said in the debate preceding the vote "with the adoption of this report, we have made a great step towards an EU-level effort to alleviate the poverty and social exclusion of our continent's largest ethnic minority. This EU-level strategy must place its primary emphasis on the fulfilment and promotion of the fundamental rights to employment, housing, health care and education".
Priority areas
MEPs set out the priority areas which will require more effort from local, national and EU authorities to integrate Roma people. The Commission, they say, should present a roadmap for introducing binding minimum standards at EU level for these priorities, which are education, employment, housing and healthcare. The Commission should also introduce award criteria in favour of compliant Member States and penalties for non-compliance.
Combating undeclared jobs, hiring Roma staff in public administration, increasing the number of Roma teachers and ensuring that Roma children receive education in their own language are other requests made to Member States and the Commission.
Fundamental rights
The "questionable repatriations" of Roma that have been taking place in several Member States have created "fear and anxiety amongst the Roma population as well as worrying levels of racism and discrimination", according to the resolution.
The EU strategy should address all forms of violations of the Roma's fundamental rights, including "discrimination, segregation, hate speech, ethnic profiling and unlawful fingerprinting, as well as unlawful eviction and expulsion". A dialogue between local authorities, judicial bodies, the police and the Roma community is also needed to abolish discrimination in the judicial sphere and combat ethnic profiling.
Better use of EU funding
Parliament calls for the creation of EU bodies under the supervision of the existing Roma Task Force to secure EU funding in support of good local initiatives and to identify and report misuse of funds in time. The scope of EU funding should be extended so that projects to improve public services are also eligible. Finally, dedicated funding should be allocated in the Cohesion Policy to support the strategy.
Next steps
The Commission is expected to present its proposal on 5 April and the European Council should adopt it at its meeting on 24 June. Roma inclusion is one of the Hungarian Presidency's priorities.

Libya: MEPs urge HR Ashton to recognise rebel Council as official
Refugees at the UNHCR tent camp in Ras Jdir, Tunisia, at the border with Libya, reach out for supplies on 05 March 2011. An estimate 10,000 of the refugees are from Bangladesh.. ©BELGA MEPs called on High Representative Ashton to recognise the Interim National Council as officially representing the Libyan opposition. The resolution, by all political groups, also calls on EU Member States to "stand ready" for a UN-mandated no-fly zone over Libya, to prevent the Gaddafi regime targeting the population, and to help repatriate or resettle migrants fleeing the growing violence there.
"EU governments need to stand ready for a decision in the UN Security Council on further measures, including the possibility of a no-fly zone", in compliance with a UN mandate and coordination with the Arab League and the African Union stressed MEPs in a widely-backed resolution (584 in favour, 18 against, 18 abstentions). During the debate, only the GUE/NGL group was against this idea.
To support Libyan rebels and lend them more international credibility, MEPs also called on the EU High Representative Catherine Ashton to "establish relations" with the rebels' representatives in the Interim Transitional National Council and "to start the process to make them official". The European Parliament condemned "in the strongest terms the blatant and systematic violations of human rights in Libya" by Muammar Gaddafi's regime and called upon him to step down immediately.

Concern at the growing humanitarian crisis which has forced over 200,000 migrants to flee Libya, Parliament appealed to the EU and Member States "to supply air and maritime transportation to help repatriate or resettle migrants, asylum seekers and refugees" from the country, as well as to offer the necessary assistance to the people crossing to Tunisia and helping with their repatriation to their home countries, in line with the International Organization for Migration's appeal.
At request of Italian and Maltese MEPs and despite some initial reluctance from other national delegations, the resolution calls for the principle of solidarity and shared responsibility (as established by the Lisbon Treaty) to be applied to border control. The European Commission should have ready all the necessary "financial, human and technical resources" to assist EU border countries in the event of a mass migratory movement, MEPs said.
Human rights
The United Nations General Assembly's recent unanimous decision to suspend Libya from the UN Human Rights Council, was welcomed by MEPs in a separate resolution on the Council's 16th session, taking place in Geneva until 25 March.
Condemning the gross and systematic human rights violations committed in Libya, they pointed out that some may be even crimes against humanity and ask for "the dispatching of an independent international commission of inquiry to Libya".
EU strategy - further steps
Adding to their recommendations on the no-fly zone and on how to handle migration, MEPs also proposed that EU governments take the following further steps at Friday's extraordinary Council meeting:
include a freeze on funds managed by the Libyan Investment Authority and the proceeds of oil and gas sales in the asset freeze imposed by the EU on the Gaddafi regime. Illegally-acquired assets must be investigated and returned to the Libyan people, and
develop a more ambitious and efficient Neighbourhood Policy that in future prioritises the independence of the judiciary, the fight against corruption, press freedom and respect for basic rights.

Iran: MEPs condemn Zahra Bahrami's execution and call for fresh EU sanctions
A demonstrator shouts slogans on March 9, 2011 during a protest against the Iranian regime on the Place des Nations, next to the United Nations offices in Geneva on the sidelines of UN Human Rights Council session.
©BELGA_AFP_FABRICE COFFRINI MEPs condemn the execution of Dutch-Iranian national Zahra Bahrami MEPs are "dismayed that the Iranian authorities denied consular access to Ms Bahrami" The execution of Dutch-Iranian citizen Zahra Bahrami was firmly condemned by Parliament in a resolution voted on Thursday. Future EU relations with Iran - including possible further sanctions - should focus not only on the nuclear dispute but also on human rights abuses since the 2009 presidential elections, they added.
Firmly condemning the execution of Dutch-Iranian national Zahra Bahrami in Tehran on 29 January, MEPs are "dismayed that the Iranian authorities denied consular access to Ms Bahrami and did not ensure a transparent and fair judicial process", says the resolution, drafted by Bastiaan Belder (EFD, NL). MEPs also call on EU Foreign Affairs High Representative Catherine Ashton to raise the cases of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani and Zahra Bahrami with the Iranian authorities. MEPs believe that the time has come for the EU to devise a new, broader, strategy towards Iran, which goes beyond the nuclear issue and addresses Iran's human rights record and regional role, say MEPs, who call on EU foreign ministers to impose sanctions targeting Iranian officials responsible for serious human rights abuses since the disputed presidential election of June 2009, in line with similar measures taken by the USA last September. Iranian nuclear threat Given Iran's continuing refusal to co-operate with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), MEPs consider that "additional sanctions have become the logical consequence". However, they also wish to ensure that Ms Ashton assesses the impact and effectiveness of all EU restrictive measures, in order to prevent Iran from evading the sanctions. Sanctions are meant to hit the blacklisted officials, not the Iranian population as a whole, they warn. Death penalty: a sad record Parliament regrets that the number of executions in Iran in 2009 was the highest in the past ten years, making Iran the country with the highest number of executions per capita in the world. They call on the government to impose a moratorium on these executions and also to abolish the execution of minors under 18 years old. Social unrest MEPs note the popular discontent that followed the 2009 presidential elections and the Iranian people's growing aspirations for democratic change. Iran's domestic problems continue to deteriorate, despite burgeoning oil prices, say MEPs, while President Ahmadinejad continues to embrace a radical anti-Western, anti-Israel agenda, they say. MEPs are also concerned that the growing military, political and economic role of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps in Iranian society is fuelling fears of a further militarization of the state, which in turn could lead to an escalation of violence and oppression of political opposition.
