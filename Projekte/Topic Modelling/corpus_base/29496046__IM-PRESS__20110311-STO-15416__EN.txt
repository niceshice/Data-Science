German Liberal MEP Nadja Hirsch has written a report on European Commission's proposals to boost learning throughout a person's life and to improve vocational training.
The report, which received the Committee's assent on 16 March, calls on countries to offer higher standards of training and for education to be oriented towards creativity and innovation and more tailored for individual needs.
In addition it says that in today's economic situation with Europe facing an ageing population there's a need for "mobile, flexible employees with international experience".
In terms of the financing MEPs believe that existing programmes (like the Lifelong Learning Programme, Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs) could be expanded.
Are several different careers emerging as the norm?
From the experiences that many of the users of the Parliament's Facebook page told us the problems presented in the report are real. Many people had to improve their qualifications to fit the job market. Wendy , who worked as a museologist in Museums before she moved to Europe from North America said she could not find work here. "I found that my field of expertise was quite different and I had to basically retrain myself" she wrote.
In addition, according to people's testimony it's almost impossible to work in one profession for your whole life. Klaus changed jobs a lot. "From a technician, to a care assistant, to physiotherapist" he recounted. Diana said she left her clerical job to join the army only "to find it was just as boring".
People who speak about working in a different country
Sometimes mobility is the answer. Tijana had enough of job searching in her own country. "The biggest change for me was leaving Croatia and my unpaid job to go to the UK to study and get a job working with young adults with Asperger's syndrome" - she wrote.
Angela had a similar experience: "8 years ago, I was a teacher. I left Romania with my son, a suitcase and 200 euro in my pocket. I came to Belgium, I worked hard, I made management studies, I learnt French, English, Dutch, Spanish. It was pretty hard, but I made it."
Those who travel to work in foreign countries point to continuing problems with the recognition of professional qualifications in one European country to another.
Luke had trouble after he moved from his home country to UK. "In European countries "graduate" doesn't mean the same. I'm just sorting out the situation with my diploma for which I've worked so hard" he said.
"Work, work, work. And never give up"
Getting a good education doesn't always help. Many of the contributors had similar problems finding a job after they had graduated from University. Berta struggled with unemployment. "I had an international University degree and knowledge of several European languages but I wasn't needed in Sweden" - she admits.
Sometimes they had to lower their expectations before they could work in their dream job. Tereza worked as a cashier in a supermarket before finishing her engineering studies. "Now I got admitted for my first job. Without having rich parents or too much luck. Work, work, work. And never give up" - she advises.
