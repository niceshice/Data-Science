The meeting voiced fears over climate change
Concerns over the environment of Northern Europe and in particular the warming of the Arctic dominated a recent meeting of MEPs and MPs. Opened on 28 February it was the first ever parliamentary conference of the "Northern Dimension" which brings together the EU, Iceland, Norway and Russia. The aim is to try and protect the environment while boosting economic growth in states that border the Baltic Sea, the North Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean.
A partnership not a policy
Explaining the aims of the Northern Dimension, Diana Wallis, member of the Liberal ALDE Group who chaired the meeting said that it covered issues such as "relations towards Russia, climate change in the Arctic, fish stocks, maritime policy and security of energy supply". She called it "no longer just an EU policy, but a partnership".
This is particularly so as the joint partnership of states supporting the northern dimension includes the USA and Canada who are represented as observers. Formally entering into force on 1 January this year it replaces previous Northern Dimension Action plans going back to 2001.
One of the key issues will be relations with Russia - both its former Tsarist capital St. Petersburg and EU-surrounded Russian enclave of Kaliningrad lie of the Baltic Sea. In the latter there are severe problems with poverty and pollution. Andrei Klimov of the Russian Parliament called for the problems of "nuclear proliferation, environment and illegal migration" to be "tackled together".
International Polar Year opens
The last day of the conference - 1st March - saw the opening of "International Polar Year" and it was the state of the Arctic which concerned many delegates. The melting of the ice was described as a "'warning area for climate change" and some delegates warned of the implications for the whole planet should the ice continue to recede.
The meeting was intended to prepare the ground for the establishment of a Northern dimension Parliamentary forum. At the meeting MEPs and MPs expressed the hope that a Parliamentary forum could meet every two years to discuss the issues that affect the region.
