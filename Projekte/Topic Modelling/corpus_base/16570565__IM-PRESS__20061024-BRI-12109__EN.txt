EP supports peace initiative in Basque Country and expressed solidarity with victims
2006-10-30 - 13:42
The European Parliament adopted a resolution by 321 votes in favour, 311 against and 24 abstentions on "the peace process in Spain", which expresses solidarity with the victims of terrorism and supports the fight against terrorism and the peace initiative in the Basque Country undertaken by the Spanish democratic institutions within the framework of their exclusive competences. Adopted by a very narrow majority, the resolution condemned violence as it is morally unacceptable and absolutely incompatible with democracy. The House expresses its solidarity with the victims of terrorism. The resolution was put forward by the PES, ALDE, Greens/EFA and EUL/NGL groups. An alternative resolution by the EPP-ED and UEN groups was not adopted (302 votes in favour, 322 against, 31 abstentions).
MEPs supported the statement by the President of the European Parliament, Josep Borrell, of 22 March 2006, to the effect that ‘this is good news for Spanish society and the whole of Europe, showing that terrorism can be fought by the force of democracy, that this is a time to show calmness and caution; a time to remember the many victims of terrorism; and a time for hope, for the unity of all the political forces of democracy.’

Debate preceding the vote - 25 October
In a highly charged atmosphere, MEPs debated the peace process in Spain. Opening the debate, Paula Lehtomäki for the Council Presidency said that the European Community was born out of the quest for peace and security and it is very important that these issues be discussed.
Finnish Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Minister Lehtomäki said: "In its meeting on the 23 and 24 March 2006, the European Council expressed its satisfaction with the reports given by the Spanish Prime Minister concerning the announcement of a permanent ceasefire made by the terrorist organisation ETA. The Presidency of the European Union is satisfied with all the actions implemented to ensure that ETA will give up terrorist methods and that a peaceful solution will be achieved in the framework of the democratic governmental bodies of Spain. The Council expresses once more its support to the measures taken by the Member States to combat terrorism in accordance with the principles of the rule of law."
European Commissioner
Commissioner Franco FRATTINI began by saying "terrorism is one of the worst imaginable threats to democratic society" as it is "an assault on our fundamental values: human rights, democracy and the rule of law". The Commission, he said, was committed, to bringing terrorists to justice and he pointed to measures brought in at EU level such as the European counter-terrorism strategy. He commended the attitude of Spanish society as exemplary. Its respect for democracy and the rule of law over the years in the fight against terrorism "had paid off with the weakening of ETA". He concluded by saying "we shall not be divided today, since this is a debate against a common enemy of Spain and Europe: terrorism".
Political group speakers
For the EPP-ED group, Hans-Gert POETTERING (DE) said "one of the noblest tasks in politics is the fight for peace". However, he highlighted the differences of opinion between the political groups - in particular the fact that two rival resolutions had been tabled on the subject under debate. The EPP-ED's position was that it "asked how we can trust ETA and Batasuna when they speak of peace" but "give no apology for their killings". He called on ETA to express "remorse and a wish for atonement" and noted that it was still on the terrorist list of the EU, had not laid down its arms and was "still a threat".
Martin SCHULZ (DE) , for Socialist group, stressed that the "terrorism is an attack on values" and is never justified. But, he went on, "we all face a challenge to find a way out". He "admired the courage of the victims" but he also admired "the courage of the Spanish government in trying to find a path to peace. He quoted the words of former Spanish prime minister Aznar who had said in 1998 that to achieve peace "we must open our hearts to hope and forgiveness". This, he said, was "the spirit we must build on". His group did not always agree with Mr Aznar, but this time "he was right". What the Spanish government was now doing was trying to build on the work of its predecessors. In conclusion, "we must work on a cross-party basis and seize this opportunity".
For the Liberals, Graham WATSON (UK) said "the EU has been described as the greatest example of conflict resolution in history". We must therefore "not turn a blind eye to the best prospect of peace in a generation". As with the Northern Ireland conflict, it was "occasionally necessary for politicians to take a risk for peace". "Building the house of peace will not be easy", he acknowledged, but his group wished to make an appeal to all sides to "set aside party politics" on this issue.
Monica FRASSONI (IT), speaking for the Greens/EFA group, said that her group had always supported the peace process to defeat ETA terrorism. My group, she said, rejects violence and offered support to all victims of terrorism. Mrs Frassoni said that the Spanish peace process did not exclude any option, and it was the responsibility of the Basque people to solve the problems. Discussing the issues in the European Parliament, she said, did not mean the Parliament was condoning violence, but rather the opposite, encouraging the peace process. Terrorism and violence, she said, affected all Europeans. The key to success was dialogue.
Francis WURTZ (FR), for the EUL/NGL group, said that his group had always been against all forms of terrorist attacks. Attacks on citizens could never be justified. It was important to remember the victims. His group, he said, looked forward to a definitive end to the violence in the region. It was necessary to take a responsible and open approach especially with regard to dialogue. His group, he said, would be supporting the joint motion for a resolution put forward by the PES, ALDE, Greens/EFA and his own group. "We all want a peace based on the rule of law".
Brian CROWLEY (IE), for the UEN group said: "We must look to the future and ensure that in the future there will be no more victims, because political solutions will be found for the differences which there are between the differing peoples within Spain, within France, and within the European Union as a whole. The opportunities which are now presented to us by this process should be grasped, should be seized, but it should not be predetermined that everybody will get what they want and I think the most important issue that we now face is not to point the finger of blame at somebody else from the Popular Socialist Party in Spain, but to encourage the main forces of democracy in Spain to unite together to find a solution for all of the people of Spain, not to be driven down the road of division and dissension. Opportunity comes to pass but not to pause. Let us grab that opportunity and give support."
Speaking for the IND/DEM group Jens-Peter BONDE (DK) said that within the Spanish peace process all democratic principles should be respected. He said that there were only 12 states in the world which matched their ethnic make-ups. The EU, he said, should not intervene in the internal matters of Spain and it was for the Member States to solve their own internal conflicts. Mr Bonde said that he came from an area of conflict on the Danish / German border and often conflict was resolved by referenda. The key to peace he said was giving more than you wanted based on compromise.
Jim ALLISTER (UK), a non-attached MEP said: "Coming from Northern Ireland, which has experienced what at times was euphemistically called a peace process, I see uncanny parallels and lessons to be learned. ETA Batasuna and IRA Sinn Féin are both revolutionary Marxist-based organisations intent on foisting their will and ideology on a civilian population through vicious violence as and when required. It is not surprising that deep terrorist links have existed between them. Learn from our mistakes. Therefore, do not be taken in by mere proclamations of commitments to peace by those whose stock and trade is duplicity and mayhem! Test them long and test them hard or you too will have your goodwill exploited."

MEPs give their views on outcome of Lahti Summit - innovation, energy and relations with Russia
2006-10-30 - 13:42
MEPs debated the informal Lahti Summit of Heads of State and government held on 20 October. The House gave its views on the meeting with President Putin, with many MEPs focussing on the murder of Anna Politkovskaya and the freedom of the press in Russia. Members also debated the future of the European Institute of Technology following the go-ahead given by European leaders in Lahti. Finnish Prime Minister Matti VANHANEN, on behalf of the Council Presidency, opened the debate on the Lahti meeting of EU heads of state or government which took place on 20 October. He reviewed the main issues covered at the summit and also at the working dinner with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the summit itself, the first issue was energy. Key points were the development of energy relations between the EU and Russia - where "openness, market-based solutions and reciprocity" were agreed to be crucial - the forging of closer ties with strategically important third countries and "the curbing of climate change through energy policy". For the latter, a renewed emphasis on sustainable energy and energy efficiency were needed. Next spring the European Council would adopt a "prioritised Action Plan on Energy Policy for Europe".
The next issue was innovation policy, where the main topics had been "intellectual property rights, particularly patents, cooperation between the private and public sectors, the European Institute of Technology and standards". The patent system must be made "more cost-effective and predictable" and some states must show more flexibility and "agree to simplify the language regime", he said. Regarding standardisation, he pointed to the success of the Europe-wide GSM standard for phones, which had enabled Europe to become a world leader in this field.
Turning to immigration, the summit had emphasised the need for both a rapid response to the "acute crisis we are experiencing" as well as a longer-term "coherent and comprehensive policy", which must include economic development of the countries of origin.
The leaders had also spoken of the need to develop the EU's decision-making system to enable the EU to respond more promptly to acute problems. In particular, he fully supported the call made at the summit by EP President Borrell for "more effective decision-making in justice and home affairs".
The summit had also discussed Darfur and agreed to "maintain pressure on the Sudanese government to end the fighting".
Lastly, turning to the working dinner with President Putin, Mr Vanhanen said the leaders had discussed "how to achieve the goal of energy cooperation" through a new agreement and he hoped the EU-Russia summit in November in Helsinki would agree to start negotiations on a new and comprehensive EU-Russia accord.
He himself had brought up the killing of journalist Anna Politkovskaya and made it clear on behalf of the Union "how deeply shocked were at the murder". Chechnya and Georgia were also discussed.
Above all, he stressed, "we are building a strategic partnership with Russia in a 'common space' in concrete ways and on an extremely wide range of issues". The EU needs to be able to speak to its partners with one voice and "at Lahti we succeeded in showing President Putin that the Union is united and determined". "This does not mean that Russia agrees with everything we say. We had a long discussion, where President Putin answered our questions in detail and also sought weaknesses in the EU’s action. We are used to this with Russia, it is part of normal dialogue".
The crucial question now, he concluded, was "how we translate our words into action".
European Commission President
President José Manuel BARROSO said that the Lahti summit must be seen as part of a process. Europe had an ambitious agenda and the Lahti summit was about putting this agenda into action. On innovation, the Commission President said that Europe was slipping behind. The Commission, he said, would be coming forward with fresh proposals on patents before the end of the year. President Barroso also welcomed the green light given by the Heads of State and Government on the European Institute for Technology (EIT). The EIT, he said, would represent a flagship for European excellence in innovation.
With regard to Russia, President Barroso said that European leaders had spoken with one voice demonstrating solidarity and coherence. On immigration, President Barroso said it was impossible to continue with the unanimity rule, it was a collective problem requiring collective solutions. On Darfur, the President said it was paramount to avoid further tragedy.
Lahti overall was a signpost on the road to equip Europeans for globalisation.
Political group speakers
Ville ITÄLÄ (FI) for the EPP-ED group said that despite negative warning in the Financial Times on President Putin's invitation to Lahti, EU leaders spoke with one voice. It was a small but an important step and the reaction to the murder of Anna Politkovskaya was bold and correct. The dinner at the summit, he said, would have been the perfect opportunity to raise the question of the Baltic Sea. Overall, he said, the summit was a success for Finnish Prime Minister Vanhanen.
Martin SCHULZ (DE), for the PES group said that Prime Minister Vanhanen had held a very successful summit. It was good that Mr Putin was invited and the reaction of European leaders was strong. Russia needed to be condemned if human rights were being abused in Chechnya. In a functioning democracy, one is able to criticise anything, this was not the case in Russia. As to innovation, he said, that if the speeches of Prime Minister Vanhanen and President Barroso were to be believed, then we would all think we were "living in an Eldora do."
For the ALDE group, Graham WATSON (UK) listed the key points discussed at Lahti - the European Institute for Technology, energy security, immigration and relations with Russia - saying these were strategic issues which "highlight the need for coherent policy-making". He went on: "What is the use of a European technology university producing innovative ideas if we are not able to agree on a quick and easy patent system? What's the hope for a collective climate change strategy if we're not prepared together radically to change our patterns of energy consumption and generation? What are the prospects for a common immigration policy if we fail to devise development and trade policies that bring relief from grinding poverty and misery?" He added "Europe is failing. We need more not less Europe". Lastly, referring to the murder of Anna Politkovskaya, Mr Watson said "the EU should sign no partnership and cooperation agreement with Russia until freedom, transparency and the rule of law are established and the legal certainty for investors which follows from them."
Monica FRASSONI (IT), co-president of the Greens/EFA group, said the Lahti Council had shown how closely internal and international policy were linked. Support for a democratic Russia and those like Anna Politkovskaya was completely in line with attempts to secure energy supplies, respect the Kyoto protocol and improve energy efficiency. Silence on Chechnya, corruption and assassinations in Russia was not a convincing policy, she said. “Appeasement does not increase Putin's reliability, just his determination to strengthen his grip on Russia's zone of power. We oppose any attempt to remove conditionality. We must keep the human rights clause in the agreement.” On energy, she opposed nuclear power, saying the Iranian and North Korean situation showed there was a link between nuclear energy programmes and weapons proliferation. Reductions in consumption and increasing efficiency were the best approaches. On immigration, she called for more support for developing countries, so that their best workers were not obliged to head for Europe.
Speaking for the GUE/NGL group, Esko SEPPÄNEN (FI) said human rights and media freedom could not be overlooked, but it was not possible to negotiate a deal on these things with Russia, just as another superpower across the Atlantic, he said, refused to negotiate on ending torture, wars or bringing American war criminals to justice in The Hague. “Russia is prepared to be part on an energy dialogue, but it is not clear if this is just a one way process. The summit did not resolve these problems... it was no more than foreplay for the next summit,” he said.
Brian CROWLEY (IE), for the UEN group, highlighted the plans for a European Institute of Technology. He said that while the majority of Parliament was in favour, it was time to ask what actual modality would make it happen. He also called for a patent system which provided proper protection for innovation, “otherwise, the best graduates will move to the US or Japan where there is bigger investment and better protection for their ideas.” Finally, he praise EU leaders for showing it was possible to speak with one voice to Russia.
Godfrey BLOOM (UK) of the Independence and Democracy group said energy was the life blood of nation state: “It is very difficult for people in the UK to accept that energy policy should be decided by foreigners.” He said the Battle of the Atlantic was still in living memory, when Britihs freedom had been on a knife edge, because “continental countries found it impossible to live together.” An agreement with Putin was ludicrous, he said, calling the Russian president “a gangster.” “Signing a agreement with him is as ludicrous as signing a piece of paper with Hitler,” he added. He said it was time to be honest, and state clearly that renewable energy technology simply did not yet work well enough to play a major role. “But honesty,” he concluded, “ is something we try to avoid in this chamber.”
Rysazard CZARNECKI (NA, PL) thanked President Borrell for his “important words to Putin. We cannot sacrifice human rights for energy (...) We cannot have double standards on human rights – we have system of values which we must bear in mind all the time and not just when it is convenient. Don't forget Lenin said capitalists will sell you rope to hang them with.”
British speaker
Timothy KIRKHOPE (EPP-ED, UK) said hearing Mr Bloom had been surprising, as “I thought dinosaurs had died out thousands of years ago.” He said the EU would need Russia's energy resources in the years to come and Russia would need access to European energy markets, so the stakes were too high for diplomatic grandstanding. “Russia,” he said, “must make a commitment to pluralism and the democratic process. It needs to have the same standards on democracy and human rights as we do.” Some said the progress made in Russia on these issues had stalled of late, said Mr Kirkhope, expressing the hope that more movement would now occur in the right direction. He was disappointed that the British Prime Minister had apparently failed to raise these issues.
Prime Minister Vanhanen's response to the debate
Replying to the debate for the Council, Prime Minister Vanhanen said he was glad to see that the presidency and the EP were on the same wavelength. The EU needed to devise common policies on all the key areas mentioned.
He referred to the decision taken at the summit to create a common European energy policy and said that was just as important as presenting a united front to Russia. However, it was important "not to caricature Russia as a monstrous dictatorship". After all, "they want to work with us too". President Putin himself had emphasised that "the Russians are dependent on us as much as we are on them". Europe must respond to Russia's appeal for investment but for this purpose there must be "common ground rules - for Russian companies as much as for European companies".
Lastly, touching briefly on immigration, Mr Vanhanen said he would come back in December with a document for discussion on this matter.

Address by Hungarian President to the European Parliament, 50 years after Hungary uprising
2006-10-30 - 13:42
The President of Hungary, László Sólyom, addressed the House at a formal sitting to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Hungarian uprising. His opening words were "Hungary and the world celebrate together the 50th anniversary of the 1956 Hungarian revolution and freedom fight. It is encouraging and elevating to feel that there is one event of commemoration with which everyone can identify." He added: "But the real reason for this commemoration and joy is that this joint celebration is taking place in a Hungary that is independent, sovereign and democratic, where there is rule of law, and where the country could become a member of international organizations such as the European Union of its own free will."
The President then made some pointed comments about certain Western positions at the time of the events of fifty years ago. He reminded his audience that "1956 questioned communist ideology and presented a dilemma to the left-wing, pro-Soviet section of the intelligentsia in Western Europe, by making them face facts."
However, he added, "politically, the Soviet Union had learnt that it could assert itself in the region" as was shown by the fact that "neither the American nor the French or British governments intended to intervene" and " they made this clear to the Soviet leadership".
Moreover, "they left the Hungarian government isolated and uninformed and the freedom fighters and population under a misapprehension, for the propaganda of the state-sponsored Western radio stations urged them to trust in the arrival of liberating assistance".
Turning to the positive side, the President said "the Hungarian Revolution and struggle for independence provided the first and weightiest evidence of the instability of the Communist regimes in the Central European states", which ultimately "led to the democratic transitions in Central Europe in 1989-90".
The President paid tribute to "the greatness of Imre Nagy", who assumed the leadership of his country for a short while before being removed from power and hanged in secret by the communists. He went on to praise and thank Austria and Germany for the way they had welcomed tens of thousands of Hungarian refugees, giving both practical and moral support.
Lastly, President Sólyom described the joy on people's faces which "radiated from every photo and reel of film" that had survived of the demonstrations of 23 October 1956. "Everyone who recalls these events speaks of these joyful faces". He concluded by quoting from the writer Géza Ottlik: "No feat of the poetic imagination, no heart throbbing with revolutionary fervour, not even the insight of genius can suffice to enable anyone who was not there from beginning to end to grasp what it was really like". "What shines in their eyes is joyful relief". "Nothing is more precious to them than the human dignity they have regained".

1956 Hungarian Uprising - European Parliament salutes bravery
2006-10-30 - 13:42
In adopting a resolution on the 50th anniversary of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution and its historical meaning for Europe, MEPs recognise the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 as one of the emblematic manifestations in the 20th century of the pursuit of liberty and democracy that defied Communism in the Soviet bloc. The European Parliament salutes the brave men and women of Hungary who, by their self-sacrifice, gave a beacon of hope to other nations under the stranglehold of Communist rule. MEPs underline that the democratic community must unequivocally reject the repressive and undemocratic Communist ideology and uphold the principles of liberty, democracy, human rights and the rule of law, and take a clear stand whenever they are violated. The House calls on all democratic countries to clearly condemn the crimes committed by all totalitarian regimes.
Finally, MEPs call for the establishment of a European programme to strengthen cooperation between research and documentation centres in Member States studying the crimes of totalitarian regimes.

Budget
MEPs adopt first reading position on EU budget for 2007 at €127.3 billion
2006-10-30 - 13:42
The EP adopted a 2007 draft budget substantially higher than that adopted by Council in its July first reading. Commitments are set at €127.3bn, payments are €122bn, equalling 1.04 % of GNI. Council had adopted a draft budget of €125bn in commitments and €114bn in payments, or 0.98% of GNI. With this vote, Parliament has stayed well within the margins of the Financial Perspective. The strategy of the rapporteur for the Commission's budget, James Elles (EPP-ED, UK), called "Value for Money", focused on the adequate funding of programmes considered as priorities of the EP.
The funding of Commission's posts for which Council had proposed a major cut was reinstated by the EP subject to a number of conditions.
James Elles said: "This budget is a prudent, coherent and forward-looking one and as the first under the new Financial Perspective takes a strategic approach. Most importantly, Parliament in this budget has ensured that the speed of globalisation and its wide-ranging implications for Europe's citizens are taken into account in our budgetary priorities. At the same time, through the innovative concept of Value for Money, we have made clear that we have to stop throwing good money after bad in programmes which are known to have weaknesses in implementation. This concept must become an integral part of the budgetary process."
Heading 1a & 1b "Sustainable growth"
Parliament has adopted a series of amendments for the old structural funds lines now in heading 1a & 1b. The EP has decided to increase payment appropriations for budget lines linked to cohesion in line with its policy priorities, also due to the fact that the level of funding agreed in the 2007-2013 multi-annual framework is much lower than anticipated in this domain.
For instance, ESF Convergence and regional competitiveness are increased to €1442m and €661m respectively from €1092m and €461m.
Importantly, another amendment sees €817.4m in commitments and €653.9m in payments go the reserve for TENs-Transport, until a political agreement is found with Council and the Commission on the control of funds. Another remark calls for the cross-border rail projects to be given new momentum.
Heading 2 "Natural resources"
The EP calls therefore for the re-establishment of the figures in the PDB for CAP spending, reduced after Council's drastic across-the-board cut in market expenditure of €525 million, based on accounting criteria and without taking account of Parliament's priorities. Parliament is also concerned with the fall in real terms of spending on rural development, despite the need to restructure the rural economy.
Heading 3 "Justice and Home Affairs"
Given the urgency of immigration matters, the Parliament proposes an increase for the agency managing EU external borders (Frontex plus €12.8 million in commitments and payments to a total of €34 million) as well as the funds for external borders (plus €7.6 million in commitment and €10 in payment for a total of €170 million for commitments and €87.5 million for payments.
Credits aiming to finance Schengen Information System II and visas are placed in the reserve, notably to wait for the clarification on the legal basis and their interoperability and for a series of databases. Parliament is waiting to be duly informed on the VIS system.
Another budget amendment foresees the creation of a pilot project on a Globe theatre which aims to promote an open space for European debate, culture and study.
An amount of €1 500 000 was included for the financing of the 50 anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, as part of the contribution for the financing of the "Europalia" Europa 2007.
Heading 4 "the EU as a global partner"
Parliament has stayed within the ceiling of heading 4, "The EU as a global partner". This means that, contrary to previous years, Parliament does not ask for the "flexibility instrument" (which can free up to 200m for non-recurring, unforeseen needs) to be used.
On the Common Foreign Security Policy (CFSP, or PESC in FR), Parliament reaffirms its willingness to be closely involved through a "dialogue" with Council, on the basis of the agreement of November 2002, whereby Council pledged to inform Parliament on CFSP actions.
50% of CFSP appropriations are cut and spread on a number of other lines of the heading. Funding for CFSP is now proposed at 72.6m in commitments and 54.6m in payments.
As far as the so-called "EU special representatives" are concerned, the EP proposed to transfer their 14m administrative budget to Heading 5. Doing so, the EP looks to have more control on their appointment. Among the regional lines, €100m in commitments and 90m in payments will go to funding of the reconstruction of Afghanistan. Funding the countries "east of Jordan" (including Iraq) has been left untouched at €108.6m in commitments and €80m in payments.
Heading 5 "administration"
On the question of the posts at the Commission, for which Council had proposed a major cut, Parliament has reinstated the initial funding put forward by the Commission in its pre-draft budget. 50m go in the reserve, though, which will be released if a number of conditions are fulfilled. One of these conditions features a "screening" of administrative needs to be done by the Commission as well as a redeployment plan. Another condition calls for Parliament's priorities to be reflected in the Commission's annual strategic policy.
This amendment deals with the line of "personnel in activity" at the Commission, funded to the tune of 1.526.030.000 excluding the 50m reserve (in both payments and commitments).
Pilot projects and preparatory actions
Concerning the pilot projects and preparatory actions (instruments aiming to finance temporary actions which are not covered by other community programmes), MEPs adopted, at this stage, a list of projects including: "Euroglobe" (a pilot project on a Globe theatre aiming to promote an open European space for debate, culture and study), and preparatory actions with China and India on management exchange programmes to operate in the university and research sectors.
Other institutions
The so-called "other institutions", for which Louis Grech (PES, MT) is the rapporteur, deal among others with Parliament's budget for next year. Mr Grech's approach to rebuke the cuts applied across the board.
The EP's draft budget set a level of €1.397 millions in commitments and payments.
The looming enlargement of Bulgaria and Romania is reflected onto Parliament's budget with 48m earmarked to cover new staff needs and collateral expenses.
Two new budget lines for the Visitors' Centre and the Web-TV are created, with the amount to be released at a later stage from a special information reserve. The 6.7m earmarked for Parliament's webTV will be released when, among others, the prototype and level of participation of political groups are presented to the EP's budgets committee.
Next steps
The next key step now sees Parliament and Council engaged in the 2nd conciliation on 21 November aiming to strike an agreement before the 2nd reading. The 2007 Budget should be approved and signed on 14 December in Strasbourg.

Freedom of the press in Russia: MEPs pay tribute to murdered Russian journalist
2006-10-30 - 13:42
In adopting a joint resolution on EU-Russia relations after the murder of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, MEPs paid tribute to the work and merits of Anna Politkovskaya, a highly respected investigative reporter known as the symbol of honest journalism in Russia, who was awarded many prizes, among others the Olaf Palme Prize. Anna Politkovskaya courageously stood up in defence of human life and dignity, exposed and objectively reported on various forms of crimes against humanity, especially in Chechnya.
The House expressed its sincere condolences to the family of Anna Politkovskaya and to her friends and colleagues in journalism and the human rights movement.
MEPs condemned in the strongest terms the murder of Anna Politkovskaya and call on the Russian authorities to conduct an independent and efficient investigation to find and punish those responsible for this cowardly crime. MEPs call on the EU and the Council of Europe to monitor these investigations closely. The House voices its deep concern over the increasing intimidation, harassment and murder of independent journalists and of other persons critical of the current government, and reminds the Russian Government that a continuation of this tendency will negatively affect Russia's overall reputation. MEPs call on the Russian authorities to fight actively against intimidation of independent journalists and human rights activists and to give full protection to independent journalists who expose serious cases of injustice in their country and to human rights organisations and their representatives who defend the victims of human rights violations.
The House urged the Council, in this context, to give serious thought to the future of relations with the Russian Federation, debating the subject with the European Parliament and civil society with a view to placing democracy, human rights and freedom of expression at the core of any future agreement and instituting a clear mechanism to monitor the implementation of all the clauses of such an agreement. Parliament calls for the EU-Russia Human Rights Dialogue to be stepped up so as to make it more effective and result-oriented, while fully involving the European Parliament at all levels, with a view to strengthening this element in the new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement due to be negotiated soon.
MEPs expressed their deep concern at the fact that under the new legislation on civil society organisations more than 90 non-governmental organisations have been forced to cease their operations in Russia. The House urges the Russian authorities to speed up the registration procedures allowing in the meantime those organisations to carry out their activities until their application is correctly dealt with and brought into the register. Parliament calls on the Russian Government not to use the vagueness of the rules of the new law as a pretext to stop the critical voices of civil society.
Finally, the House stated that it is aware that the only way to truly honour Anna Politkovskaya's passionate commitment to truth, justice and human dignity is to make common efforts to realise Anna Politkovskaya's dream of a democratic Russia which fully respects the rights and liberties of its citizens.

Alexander Milinkevich - winner of the 2006 Sakharov Prize
2006-10-30 - 13:42
Alexander Milinkevich is this year's winner of the Sakharov Prize. The Conference of Presidents - the political groups' leaders of the European Parliament - decided to award the prize for freedom of thought to the leader of the opposition in Belarus. Milinkevich stood in presidential elections last March, the results of which were condemned by the EU and the US. At an opposition rally protesting the results, Milinkevich was arrested and held for 15 days. In February, the Belarus opposition leader visited the European Parliament and asked MEPs for their support, but a delegation of MEPs wishing to monitor the elections were refused entry by the Belarus authorities. Milinkevich is 59 years old and studied physics and mathematics in France, Germany and the US. He was deputy mayor of his home town Hrodna in the early nineties.
The Sakharov Prize will be awarded during a formal plenary session of Parliament on 13 December. The prize comes with a certificate and a cheque for €50,000.

Human rights: Tibet, Guatemala, Uzbekistan
2006-10-30 - 13:42
Parliament adopted three resolutions on 26 October aimed at turning the spotlight on human rights abuses. MEPs condemned the incident in Tibet on 20 September when Chinese police attacked unarmed Tibetan civilians trying to seek refugee status in Nepal. They gave their backing to efforts to bring seven former Guatemalan dictators to justice. Lastly, they voiced concern about the situation in Uzbekistan but rejected a call for EU sanctions to be expanded to include President Karimov and others. Tibet
In the resolution on Tibet, adopted by 66 votes to 0 with 0 abstentions, Parliament condemns the events of 20 September this year, when more than 70 unarmed Tibetan civilians were fired upon by the Chinese police, killing at least one person.
The Tibetans were attempting to cross the Nangpa Pass in the Himalayan region of Tibet, to seek refugee status in Nepal. The Chinese People’s Armed Police fired upon the Tibetans, who included women and children. Video and photographic evidence shows that the group was moving slowly away from the Chinese forces firing upon them and did not represent a threat. A seventeen-year-old nun was killed and there are unconfirmed eyewitness accounts of other deaths. A group of Tibetans, including children, were arrested after continuing to flee.
The Chinese authorities have thus far not officially recognised that the incident at Nangpa Pass took place or that any individual was killed by Chinese forces.
In its resolution, Parliament "condemns the excessive use of force by the Chinese People’s Armed Police in firing upon unarmed Tibetan civilians, including children". It "strongly condemns the killing of an unarmed civilian who, being under 18 years of age, was also considered a child under international law" and "expresses its dismay at the imprisonment of Tibetan civilians, nine of whom are children".
MEPs urge the Chinese authorities "to guarantee that the Tibetans detained during the incident will not be ill-treated in detention and that international human rights and humanitarian law standards are being respected" and "to release immediately all children detained during the incident"
The resolution "urges the Chinese authorities to conduct a full investigation into the events at Nangpa Pass and ensure that those responsible for any crimes committed there are brought to justice".
It also calls on the Council and Commission to "make strong representations to the Chinese authorities on this issue within the framework of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue".
The Council and Commission are asked to reiterate their position that "only dialogue between the Government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and the representatives of the Dalai Lama can contribute to a peaceful and sustainable settlement for Tibet". Lastly, the Government of the PRC is urged to continue the dialogue with the representatives of the Dalai Lama in order to improve respect for religious, cultural, linguistic and political rights in the Tibet Autonomous Region
Guatemala - case against Rios Montt
In a resolution on Guatemala, adopted by a show of hands, Parliament calls on the authorities in the country to cooperate in investigations into the actions of seven former dictators, including José Rios Montt, who are accused of genocide and torture.
During the armed conflict in Guatemala, 200,000 people are said to have been murdered and 45,000 to have suffered enforced disappearances. In addition, 10% of the population was displaced and entire indigenous communities were eradicated.
Those accused of plotting and committing the above crimes have never been brought before a court and some of them continue to hold high political office, says Parliament.
In July 2006 a judge at the Spanish Audiencia Nacional issued an international warrant for the arrest of seven former Guatemalan dictators and military officers accused of genocide, torture and illegal detention. Before issuing the warrant, the judge travelled to Guatemala to carry out investigations which he was unable to conduct following appeals to the Guatemalan Constitutional Court and the Court for Conflicts of Jurisdiction by the accused persons' defence lawyers.
In the light of the above, Parliament's resolution "urges the Guatemalan institutions fully to cooperate and do everything in their power to shed light on the human rights violations and to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice and that the findings of the investigations are made public, as called for in the international arrest warrant issued by the Spain Audiencia Nacional on 7 July 2006 against Jose Efraín Rios Montt, Oscar Humberto Mejía Víctores, Angel Anibal Guevara Rodriguez, German Chupina Barahona, Pedro Garcia Arredondo and Benedicto Lucas Garcia, all of whom are accused of crimes of genocide, torture, terrorism and illegal detention".
The resolution also asks the governments and banks concerned to cooperate in the seizure of the goods and property of the accused. It urges Interpol and Europol to assist with any extraditions, if requested.
MEPs welcome the progress made in the application of the principle of universal jurisdiction in respect of crimes against humanity, genocide and torture, and they consider that, if these proceedings are successful, "the same procedure should be followed under similar circumstances in taking action against dictators and persons responsible for mass human rights violations".
Uzbekistan
Parliament's resolution on Uzbekistan, adopted by 41 votes to 26 with 4 abstentions, urges the government to observe democracy and human rights, release various detainees imprisoned following the Andijan massacre of 13 May 2005 and allow an enquiry into the incident.
MEPs point out that no independent enquiry has been allowed into the massacre, despite repeated demands by international bodies. Following the events the Uzbek authorities launched a crackdown, putting on trial hundreds of people suspected of involvement. There has been no news of the thousands arrested and those in detention are said to be at serious risk of torture.
Parliament insists that EU-Uzbekistan relations "must be based on mutual respect for the principles of democracy, rule of law and human rights, as is clearly laid down in the EU-Uzbekistan Partnership and Cooperation Agreement".
It wants Uzbekistan "to cooperate fully with the OSCE and with the UN, especially with regard to the call for a credible and transparent independent enquiry" into the Andijan incident.
The EU General Affairs and External Relations Council is expected to consider on 13 November 2006 whether to extend the sanctions adopted last year. Parliament says the government of Uzbekistan has not addressed the conditions the Council set out when sanctions were applied.
However, MEPs rejected a call to renew the existing sanctions policy for an additional 12 months and to expand it by including President Karimov and others in the EU visa ban. Instead the resolution calls on the Council "to make a considered decision with a view to improving future relations with Uzbekistan" but to "continue the embargo on arms sales and military transfers".
Parliament also calls on the Council "to take all necessary measures within the UN Human Rights Council to ensure the confidential '1503' procedure does not continue to apply to Uzbekistan and to subject this country to a public mechanism of scrutiny as recommended by Louise Arbour, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, in her July 2005 report on the Andijan massacre".
MEPs urge the Uzbekistan Government "to release all human rights defenders, journalists and political opposition members who are still in detention" and "to put an end to the harassment of NGOs", and they call on it to permit the reopening of the UNHCR Office in Tashkent (which was closed on 17 March 2006).
After the events in Andijan hundreds of Uzbek citizens were obliged to flee to the Kyrgyz Republic and other countries but many have been extradited to Uzbekistan. Parliament appeals to these countries "to fully respect the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, under which no refugees should be forcibly returned to their country of origin".

Fight against breast cancer in the enlarged EU
2006-10-30 - 13:42
In adopting a joint resolution on breast cancer in the enlarged EU, MEPs called on the European Commission to present without delay the progress report, which it called for by 2006 in its resolution of 5 June 2003, on the steps taken by the Member States to lower breast cancer mortality rates. The joint resolution was adopted by 641 votes in favour, 11 against with 4 abstentions. Every year 275,000 women in the EU contract breast cancer, and 88,000 women and 1,000 men die from it. MEPs adopted a resolution today on actions to combat this leading cause of death in women aged between 35 and 59 and the commonest cancer in women. MEPs call for measures such as nationwide screening programmes, interdisciplinary breast units, reintegration into the job market and research into breast cancer prevention and treatment.
The resolution is based on three oral questions on to the European Commission by three committees (Environment, Public Health and Food Safety; Employment and Social Affairs; and Women's Rights and Gender Equality), it follows up the European Parliament's resolution of June 2003 which calls on the Member States to set themselves the target of creating, by 2008, the conditions required for a 25% reduction in average breast-cancer mortality rate in the EU and of reducing to 5% the disparity between the Member States in the five-year survival rate. - breast cancer mortality rates very among the EU-25 by over 50 % and the mastectomy rate by up to 60 %.
Calls on Member States to introduce nationwide breast screening
The EP reiterates its call on the Member States to "introduce nationwide breast screening" whereby all women aged between 50 and 69 will be offered a mammogram in line with EU guidelines at two-year intervals. According to the WHO, mammographic screening can reduce deaths from breast cancer by up to 35 % in this age group. "With this form of early detection alone, we could save the lives of about 31 000 women a year in the EU", said MEP Karin Jöns (PSE, DE) co-author of the three oral questions in Tuesday's debate.
EU guidelines for breast cancer screening where first drawn up in 1992, still only 11 Member States offer nationwide mammographic screening (Belgium, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Sweden, Spain and the United Kingdom).
Interdisciplinary breast centres by 2016
The EP calls on the Member States to ensure nationwide provision of interdisciplinary breast centres in accordance with EU guidelines by 2016. Treatment in such centres has been proved to raise chances of survival and to improve the quality of life, and breast cancer care of guaranteed quality leads in the medium and long term to savings for the health care system (Now only the United Kingdom provides such centres, and even there it is not fully implemented)
MEPs note that specialised training of all medical staff is essential to the quality of early detection and treatment. MEPs therefore calls on the Commission to point out to the Member States to make use of the possibility to provide further training for medical personnel, in accordance with EU guidelines, via the European Social Fund.
Increasing number of younger women are contracting breast cancer
35 % of women with breast cancer are under 55, and 12 % even involve women under 45. Young women are particularly affected by problems such reintegration into the employment market and inadequate financial problems and specific life-plan problems The EP calls on the Commission to devote special attention the problems of young women with breast cancer by providing information geared to their needs.
One fifth of former breast cancer patients do not return to work, and women who do return to work are often faced with reductions in their income. The EP calls on the Commission to draw up a charter for the protection of the rights of breast cancer patients and chronically sick people in the workplace, with a view of requiring firms to make it possible for patients to continue in employment during their treatment and return to the employment market after it has finished.
Research on breast cancer prevention
The EP calls for stepped-up support for research into breast cancer prevention (including effects of harmful chemicals and environmental pollutants, nutrition, lifestyle, genetic factors, and the interaction of all these) and calls for the links between cancer and potential risk factors such as tobacco, alcohol and hormones to be investigated.

Recovery of Community Funds - OLAF should be fully independent
2006-10-30 - 13:42
Parliament adopted an own-initiative report on the recovery of Community funds. This technical report highlights the possibility of closer cooperation with Eurojust and Europol needs to be explored in order to strengthen the real protection of the Union’s financial interests, as well as an evaluation of the possibility of OLAF’s full administrative independence from the Commission and the other institutions. OLAF inquiries and national procedures
The Hosue notes that OLAF does not possess suitable information on the quantities of incriminated products, while undertaking the inquiries in a criminal law context has proved disastrous from the viewpoint of recovery, even if it is true that in strictly legal terms OLAF is entitled, on behalf of the Commission, to contest a national decision. MEPs also recall that, while in some countries recovery proceedings may be initiated even if a criminal action is under way, in others the criminal law has precedence over the civil law, so that the existence of an action on the part of a judicial authority makes it impossible to recover the disputed sums. The House deplores the fact that in some Member States irregularities and frauds are admitted only in respect of individually proven sums, that is, lot by lot, and that where no lot is present the operator is automatically deemed innocent.
The European Public Prosecutor
MEPs consider that the creation of the office of European Public Prosecutor will be a decision of major importance, since it will facilitate direct access to the national public prosecutor’s offices, thus working in the interests of a more ‘joined-up’ procedure. Parliament believes that this should help reduce complexity, since the result should be a converged use of the European Prosecutor’s services; recalls that, while OLAF enjoys powers of intervention in the context of its inquiries, it does not enjoy judicial powers.
Parliament notes that the project to establish a European Public Prosecutor must be regarded more as a long-term undertaking, and that, in order to achieve an improvement in the short term, coordination between Member States' public prosecutors must be central to plans to create added value, reducing OLAF's workload and protecting the financial interests of the Community.
The House welcomes the Commission's positive reply to Parliament's repeated demands - for public disclosure of the amounts received by and the names of the beneficiaries under the EU budget. MEPs regret, however, that the equivalent information regarding recoveries of Community funds are excluded from the transparency initiative. Finally, the House calls on the Commission to make available to the budgetary authority and ultimately to the public the names and amounts of recoveries due or credited to the EU budget, as well as the final destination of these sums.

Culture
MEPs adopt media and culture programmes
2006-10-30 - 13:42
Parliament approved a total of five second-reading recommendations on educational and cultural programmes for 2007. The House was keen for the agreement to be confirmed so as to get the programmes up and running in January 2007. With the adoption of one of the reports, the monthly Erasmus grant will increase from €150 to €200 from 1 January 2007. Doris PACK (EPP-ED) was happy to announce that after renegotiations with the Council the budget of the Lifelong Learning Programme was now €6970 million instead of the €6200 million agreed at an earlier stage. This programme consists of six programmes: Comenius (schools up to secondary level), Erasmus (higher education), Leonardo da Vinci (vocational training) and Grundtvig (adult education) plus a Transversal Programme (focusing on policy development, language learning tools, e-learning and the spread of best practice) and the Jean Monnet Programme (study, research and teaching about European integration). The Erasmus grant from 2007 will now be €200 per month, an increase of €50 from the previous programme.
Lissy GRONER's (PES, D) recommendation on Youth in Action was also approved without amendments. This programme is intended to foster active citizenship of young European citizens and has an agreed budget of €785 million.
Europe for Citizens is a programme to promote active European citizenship. Thanks to Parliament's first reading amendments, the programme's general objectives will include enhancing tolerance by promoting intercultural dialogue and the programme will be open to legal residents from third countries. Measures to keep alive the memories of the crimes committed by the Nazi and Stalinist regimes have also been supported by Council. Rapporteur: Hannu TAKKULA (ALDE, FI). Agreed budget: €190 million.
MEDIA is a programme to support the European TV and cinema industries. Previous MEDIA programmes have made major contributions to Europe's audiovisual sector and have delivered good value in doing so. Approximately 90% of non-national European films have been supported by the MEDIA programme. For every euro invested, the MEDIA Plus programme (2001-2006) has generated €5.75 in follow-up investment, €2.83 in education, €7.2 in distribution and €4.19 in development.
Rapporteur: Ruth HIERONYMI (EPP-ED, DE).
Agreed budget: €671 million.
Culture 2007-2013 seeks to promote the mobility of workers active in the field of culture, to encourage the cross-border circulation of works of art and of culturally significant objectives and to foster inter-cultural dialogue.
Rapporteur: Vasco GRAÇA MOURA (EPP-ED, PT).
Agreed budget: €354 million.

Development and cooperation
EU-South Africa relations - MEPs welcome strategic partnership
2006-10-30 - 13:42
In adopting a resolution on EU-South Africa relations, MEPs welcomed the Commission's approach which is to take steps towards an EU-South-Africa Strategic Partnership and to propose a coherent long-term framework for cooperation. The House emphasised that this Strategic Partnership should provide a single framework under which the existing cooperation instruments can improve performance in the interests of the South African population and economy. MEPs also emphasises that the Strategic Partnership should be complementary to the EU-Africa Strategy and incorporate existing strands of work on the Development Cooperation Instrument, Economic Partnership Agreements(EPAs) and other ongoing negotiations.
Parliament stressed that the Action Plan should have poverty alleviation as its overriding objective, in line with the Cotonou Agreement and with a view to achieving the MDGs, and takes into account the effect of the Strategic Partnership on the countries of the region and on the EPA negotiations.
The House also stressed that tackling the HIV/AIDS crisis, with a balanced approach between prevention (with an emphasis on sexual and reproductive health), treatment and cure, must remain a political priority for the South African Government. MEPs welcome the Government's decision in favour of a programme to deliver anti-retroviral drugs, but nonetheless insists that its implementation be urgently improved.

Economic and monetary affairs
Parliament praises ECB anti-inflation policy, but says caution needed when raising interest rates
2006-10-30 - 13:42
MEPs adopted a report, by 157 votes in favour to 49 against with 84 abstentions, praising the ECB’s handling of interest rate policy, while warning of the need for caution when raising rates to avoid endangering growth. It also calls for the publication of minutes of rate setting meetings and says Parliament should the right to approve the candidate nominated by the Council to fill vacancies on the Executive Board. Parliament praised the ECB’s policy of “concentrating on its most important objective, preserving price stability,” and says it was correct to increase rates in 2005. MEPs stressed that the Bank must be aware of the risks to growth of continuous rate rises, but also continue to anchor inflationary expectations.
Board appointments and transparency
On appointments to the ECB Executive Board, MEPs stress that nationality should be irrelevant. While stressing the treaty requirement for candidates with experience of monetary and banking matters, they also argue that it is important for a variety of backgrounds to be represented on the Board. Parliament says transparency and accountability would be improved if the Council evaluated several candidates and if the candidate proposed by the Council were then subject to a vote of approval by Parliament.
MEPs call, once again, for the publication of summary minutes of rate setting meetings, with clear statements of the arguments in favour and against decisions taken and the reasons why these decisions were taken. This should not, they say, replace the current press conferences by the ECB President after such meetings, which provide “an invaluable and timely insight for observers and market participants”.
Money supply and euro notes
The report asks the ECB to take action with regard to the “persistently high values of the M3 money supply” and to investigate developments in the mortgage and mergers and acquisitions markets.
MEPs highlight the nearly 21 per cent increase in the number of €500 notes in circulation, and say this needs to be analysed and the risks identified. They also say the next generation of banknotes should feature real living beings, landscapes, European human undertakings or personalities, since the current neutral images are seen as giving a cold image of monetary integration.
Exchange rates and hedge funds
The report emphasises the risks of rapid adjustments in international disequilibria. It invite the Eurogroup, ECB and Council to step up coordination of their action in exchange rate policy.
Parliament says it shares the fears expressed by the ECB about hedge funds and calls for the ECB to carry out analyses of the issue.

Environment
Toxic waste to Africa - MEPs want investigation into deaths
2006-10-30 - 13:42
In adopting a joint resolution on the export of toxic waste to Africa, MEPs called on the Commission, the Netherlands and Côte d’Ivoire to investigate the case where eight people have died so far and some 85,000 have been taken to hospital for treatment for nosebleeds, diarrhoea, nausea, eye irritation and breathing difficulties. The consequences of this dumping of toxic waste may be far-reaching, including soil contamination and surface and groundwater pollution. Toxic waste was dumped by a Greek-owned, Panamanian-flagged tanker leased by Trafigura Beheer B.V., a Netherlands-based company. Such sharing of responsibilities creates a systematic and unacceptable problem with regard to the enforcement of EC legislation. The Amsterdam port authorities found out about the hazardous nature of the waste upon unloading, and asked for a higher fee to complete the unloading, following which the tanker chose instead to pump the waste back on board. The Netherlands authorities allowed the ship to leave their territory despite knowing about the hazardous nature of the waste and about the captain’s unwillingness to pay for environmentally sound disposal in the Netherlands . The company had the opportunity to dispose of the waste in a legal and safe manner in Europe, but chose a cheaper alternative in Côte d’Ivoire,
MEPs called on the EU and its Member States to take all necessary measures to provide full assistance to the population affected and in particular to children, by using all available means of support, cooperation and civil protection.
The House considered that both EU legislation and international conventions were clearly violated in the case of the exporting of hazardous waste to Abidjan, and therefore calls on the Commission and the Member States to take all necessary measures to ensure full enforcement of the existing waste shipment legislation. MEPs ask the Commission and the Member States concerned to make public all the bilateral agreements they have concluded up to date with non-OECD countries for the shipping of waste. Parliament also calls on the Commission to make legislative proposals to close the loopholes in the current regime on hazardous waste so as to end shipments to non-OECD countries of waste electrical and electronic equipment and obsolete ships and vessels.
Parliament mandates the Commission to collect information on the illicit trafficking in, and dumping of, such hazardous wastes and products in African and other developing countries, to come forward with proposals for measures to control, reduce and eradicate this illicit trafficking, transfer and dumping of such products in African and other developing countries, and to produce annually a list of countries and transnational corporations engaged in the illicit dumping of toxic wastes and products in African and other developing countries.

Nairobi Conference on climate change
2006-10-30 - 13:42
In adopting a joint resolution on the EU strategy for the Nairobi Conference on Climate Change, MEPs urge the European Union to maintain its leading role in the negotiations at the COP 12-COP/MOP 2 Conference in Nairobi, and to maintain a high level of ambition in future discussions with its international partners. Parliament recalled its request that there should be no gap between the first and the second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol and that the time limit for reaching agreement on future climate commitments should be the end of 2008.
The House also recalled its support for the continuing use of flexible mechanisms, and for the long-term goal of a global carbon market based on cap and trade. Parliament Calls on the parties to COP 12-COP/MOP 2 to address the climate change impacts of international aviation and calls for a discussion on a global tax on flights at the upcoming negotiations at the COP 12-COP/MOP 2 Conference in Nairobi.
The resolution stresses that economic development is a right for all developing countries. Parliament emphasises, however, that developing countries do not have to repeat the polluting practices of the industrialised countries, and calls therefore for increased attention to be paid to technology cooperation and capacity building in the field of sustainable energy.
MEPs called on the Commission and the Council to make access to efficient and low-carbon energy technologies a priority within EU development cooperation. Parliament also emphasises the key importance of engaging the rapidly industrialising developing countries in a future international climate change regime, while fully respecting their vital concerns about promoting their economic development and fighting poverty. The House stresses that the impact of climate change upon society must be better understood. MEPs call on the Commission therefore to examine how to best organise workshops - in Europe and elsewhere with relevant stakeholders such as citizen groups, industry, farming communities, security experts and economists - to better understand the consequences of climate change in more detail.
Parliament insisted that individual EU countries, and the European Union as a whole, live up to their existing commitments under the Kyoto Protocol and the burden sharing agreement, since the EU’s leading position in international talks will be undermined if this cannot be achieved. The House believes that the EU delegation plays an important role in these negotiations on climate change, and therefore finds it unacceptable that the members of the European Parliament part of that delegation were unable to attend the EU coordination meetings at the previous Conference of the Parties.

Parliament backs substitution principle for perfluorooctane sulfonates
2006-10-30 - 13:42
The House adopted, by 632 votes to 10 with 20 abstentions, a report seeking to limit the use of perfluorooctane sulfonates (PFOS), a toxic, bio-accumulative substance previously present in everyday consumer goods such as carpets and textiles as well as some industrial products. There will be exemptions for specific uses where no substitute can be found for technical or economic reasons. The vote on this report, drafted by Carl Schlyter (Greens/EFA, SE), confirms a first-reading agreement between Parliament and Council. Under the agreement, the directive will ban the placing of PFOS on the market and their use as a substance or constituent of preparations in a concentration equal to or higher than 0.005% by mass. It will also outlaw the sale of PFOS or their use in semi-finished products or articles, or parts thereof, if the concentration of PFOS is equal to or higher than 0,1% by mass or, for textiles or other coated materials, if the amount of PFOS is equal to or higher than 1 µg/m2 of the coated material.
Under the directive, substances and preparations needed to produce photoresists or anti-reflective coatings for photolithography processes, photographic coatings applied to films, papers, or printing plates may contain PFOS in larger quantities. The same applies to suppressants for non-decorative hard chromium (VI) plating and wetting agents for use in controlled electroplating systems as well as hydraulic fluids for aviation.
Regarding fire-fighting foams, the initially proposed derogation was dropped. All new foams must be free of PFOS. Foams that have been placed on the market before the directive enters into force (probably early 2007) can be used until 54 months after its entry into force. Two years after entry into force, Member States must compile and send to the Commission an inventory listing the processes for chromium plating subject to derogation, the amounts of PFOS used in and released into the environment, and existing stocks of fire-fighting foams.
When reviewing derogations in the light of new information, the Commission ensure that: the uses of PFOS are phased out as soon as the use of safer alternatives is technically and economically feasible; a derogation is only continued for essential uses for which safer alternatives do not exist and where it has been reported what has been undertaken to find safer alternatives; releases of PFOS into the environment have been minimised, by applying best available techniques.
Lastly, the Commission will keep under review the ongoing risk assessment activities and the availability of safer alternative substances or technologies related to the uses of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and related substances and propose any measures needed to reduce identified risks, including restrictions of marketing and use, in particular when safer alternative substances or technologies which are technically and economically feasible are available.
Member States will have 18 months to enact the directive in national law, i.e. up to mid-2008.

LIFE+ : MEPs against delegated management by the Member States
2006-10-30 - 13:42
MEPs adopted with an overwhelming majority (525 in favour, 65 against and 25 abstentions) the report drafted by Marie-Anne Isler-Beguin (Greens/ALE, FR) on LIFE+. MEPs rejected the Council's common position intending to allocate at least 80% of the LIFE+ budget for 2007-2013 to delegated management to the Member States. They reaffirmed their wish to see the European Commission at the heart of the environment policy of the Union and avoid "re-nationalisation" of this policy. Contrary to the MEPs wishes, the European Commission, represented by Environment Commissioner Dimas, backed the Council's proposal to delegate management of LIFE+ to the Member States due to a lack of staff on the side of the Commission.
Funding Natura 2000 was the main topic of the first reading, particularly in the light of the negotiations taking place on the financial perspectives. The second reading focused on the allocation of budgetary resources.
In order to avoid a financial gap in case there is no agreement by the end of 2006, MEPs adopted an amendment "urging the Commission, in the absence of an agreement between the co-legislators on LIFE+ at second reading, to present a solution permitting the financing of activities falling under the institutional prerogatives that from 2007 onwards are due to fall under the LIFE+ programme". The amendment also "calls on the Commission to propose provisional measures for project activities in order to avoid a financing gap and to guarantee continuity of the Community’s environmental policy and sustainable development in 2007".
LIFE+ will now enter the final stage of co-decision, namely conciliation between the European Parliament and the Council.

EP backs compromise to extend Schengen Information System to new Member States
2006-10-30 - 13:42
The EP adopted, by a large majority, three reports on the legislative basis for a new Schengen Information System (SIS II ) which will allow new Member States to join the Schengen area as soon as possible. MEPs backed the Commission proposals but introduced some relevant amendments to improve the security and personal data protection standards of the second generation Schengen Information System. A first reading agreement on the dossiers with the Council is essential for the timely start of the updated system.
The European Parliament adopted two co-decision and one consultation reports by Carlos COELHO (EPP-ED, PT) on proposals for the establishment, operation and use of SIS II as well as the access to the system by the services in the Member States responsible for vehicle registration. The rapporteur sought to achieve a first reading agreement with Council and the compromise amendments adopted today had been formerly negotiated and accepted in informal trialogues with the Commission and the Council. However MEPs refused to introduce a last minute change requested by Council which would allow national intelligence services to have access to the information stored in SIS II.
"The proposal to give access to the SIS II to the intelligence services does not make sense as we cannot increase the demands on personal data and on the other hand open access to structures in the Member States which cannot be, fully or partially, under the scrutiny of the authorities responsible for data protection," the EP rapporteur Carlos Coelho (EPP-ED, PT) said during the debate. It is now up to the Council to decide whether it will approve the texts as voted by the European Parliament or will decide to re-open the negotiations.
"In the next few weeks, the Council will discuss the outcome of the plenary voting of Parliament. I believe that we can reach a solution with Parliament in the first reading. I want to emphasise that we are now very close to a solution in this important legislative issue," Finnish Minister Paula Lehtomäki said on behalf of the presidency before the vote in EP.
The SIS operates since March 1995 and it is a large-scale database that allows the competent authorities in the Member States to search for and obtain data on persons and objects. It can only serve a maximum of 18 Member States and it does not take advantage of the latest developments in information technology or possibilities for advanced searches. In order to accommodate the new Member States and Switzerland the updated SIS II system was necessary. It will be easier to manage, more flexible and secure and capable of integrating new data, new functions and the interlinking of alerts.
Use of biometrics
The use of biometrics and the interlinking of alerts are two new elements in SIS II that will be introduced to improve the reliability and enhance the capacities of the system.
Photographs and fingerprints can only be entered following a special quality check to ascertain the fulfilment of a minimum data quality standard. A search with biometrics should be excluded at the initial stage of the system and will be possible only when that is technically viable. The European Parliament will have to be consulted by the European Commission before the implementation of this biometric search. (Regulation, Chapter IV, Article 14 C)
In the future it will be possible to link, for example, the alert of a stolen car with the alert of a person wanted for arrest. If a policeman then discovers the stolen car he will have grounds to believe that the person wanted for arrest was or still is in the immediate vicinity of this car. The regulation however says that a member state is to create a link between alerts only when there is a clear operational need. (Article 26, Regulation)
To ensure that all data is accurate and up to date the use of national technical copies offline has been restricted and can be allowed for a period of up to 48 hours after which they are destroyed. (Regulation, Article 21).
Management Authority
One of the new compromise proposals is for a Management Authority, funded by the EU budget, to manage the operation of the SIS II central data base. It has to be operational within a maximum period of five years after the legislation enters into force. The Management Authority's personal data processing activities would be monitored by the European Data Protection Supervisor, who would be required to ensure that they are audited to international standards at least every four years. During a transitional period before this authority starts work the Commission will be responsible for the management of the SIS II central data base. It may delegate the management to national public bodies in two different countries. The European Parliament and the Council must be regularly informed about the conditions and the scope of that delegation. (Regulation, Article 12) and (Regulation, Article 31 a).
Personal data processing at national level would be audited by national supervisory authorities, but in co-operation with the European Data Protection Supervisor so as to ensure co-ordinated supervision. (Regulation Article 31 B)
Finally, each Member State would be responsible for setting up and maintaining a national data system that can communicate with the central SIS II and must designate an authority for that purpose. It would also have to take steps necessary to protect personal data. (Regulation, Article 10) The Member State issuing an alert shall be responsible for ensuring that the data is accurate, up-to date and is entered in the SIS II lawfully. (Regulation Article 24)
The codecision report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the establishment, operation and use of the second generation Schengen information system (SIS II) was approved with 517 votes in favour, 73 against and 66 abstentions.
The codecision report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council regarding access to the Second Generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) by the services in the Member States responsible for issuing registration certificates for vehicles was approved with 561 votes in favour, 39 against and 62 abstentions.
The consultation report on the proposal for a Council decision on the establishment, operation and use of the second generation Schengen information system (SIS II) was approved with 521 votes in favour, 72 against and 65 abstentions.

Go-ahead for European Payment Order
2006-10-30 - 13:42
MEPs approved a recommendation for second reading on the European Payment Order, a procedure designed to speed up the settlement of cross-border payment claims. The aim of the European Payment Order (EPO) is to enable individuals and businesses to enforce uncontested payments using an EU-wide standard procedure. Under the new regulation it will be possible, for example, to claim payment of unpaid bills for purchases made via mail orders or Internet retailers through a simple procedure.
The current situation is a burden on many businesses, which find it difficult to deal with unfamiliar legal procedures in foreign countries. They experience delays and unexpected costs in recovering debts.
Small businesses in particular should benefit from a simpler and cheaper procedure for pursuing payments across the EU. The EPO will only apply to cross-border cases and cannot be used for property disputes arising from a matrimonial relationships and wills.
At first reading, MEPs amended the Commission proposal to further simplify the procedure. They wanted to ensure that the application forms to introduce a European Payment Order, annexed to the regulation, were user-friendly, suitable for on-line use and required a minimum of free text.
Parliament is satisfied with the outcome of negotiations with Member States, as the Council accepted all Parliament's first-reading amendments. The draft regulation will become law at this second reading stage.

Making better use of inland waterways
2006-10-30 - 13:42
Europe should exploit more of its free capacity on inland waterways as part of the multi-modal transport links across the EU and neighbouring countries, says the European Parliament. MEPs are asking the European Commission to draw up a European Development Plan for the sector which should include an up-to-date inventory of the European inland waterway infrastructure. The House adopted an own-initiative report on NAIADES with 464 votes in favour, 5 against and 2 abstentions, the Commission's proposals for an integrated Inland Waterway Transport sector, Parliament stresses that the Commission should designate as soon as possible - and not later than the end of 2006 - a European Trans European Transport Network coordinator for inland waterway transport to support the implementation of priority projects, drawing on experience with existing coordinators.
MEPs say the reliability of the waterway network and the availability of multi-functional inland ports are the most important conditions for this vital transport sector. Improving infrastructure and the fleet is also crucial, so, in 2007, the Commission should submit a proposal for a European Waterway Transport Innovation Fund. MEPs also stress the need for the development of clean and efficient vessels under the 7th Framework Programme on Research and Development.
Finally, the House asks the Commission and Member States to provide incentives to accelerate the introduction and use of fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly engines in order to respect stricter limits for SOx, PM, NOx and CO2 emissions.

EU-Syria Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement - MEPs highlight human rights issues
2006-10-30 - 13:42
MEPs adopted an own-initiative report on EU-Syria Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement. The House is convinced that the association agreement could give a decisive impetus to the political, economic and social reforms needed to improve the country’s situation. Parliament reiterates, however, that respect for democratic values, human rights and civil liberties are prerequisites, and that, to this end, an effective control mechanism should be included in the agreement’s human rights clause. The report adopted by 453 votes in favour, 11 against and 15 abstentions calls, in particular, for greater respect for ethnic minorities and reiterates the need to maintain freedom of religion.
MEPs believe that anchoring Syria firmly within the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership will reinforce Syria’s relations with the Member States of the European Union and its partners in the Southern Mediterranean, and facilitate the Middle East peace process.
The House asks the Council to strengthen its initiatives with a view to deepening the cooperation between the EU and Syria and ultimately signing that agreement, while taking account of the following recommendations:
· encourage and support actions by the Syrian Government towards the establishment of a democratic system;
· call on Syria to respect Lebanon’s sovereignty and abstain from interfering in its internal affairs, in particular by stopping arms supplies and preventing Hezbollah militias from rearming in full cooperation with UNIFIL, and make renewed efforts so as to restart a credible peace process in the region leading to a comprehensive settlement and the restitution to Damascus of the Golan Heights;
· take account of the political signals emanating from the tenth regional congress of the Baath Party, of which the most conspicuous is the change in the leadership team to include younger figures close to President Al-Assad, as is shown by the appointment of Abdallah Dardari as deputy prime minister;
· give particular attention to the application of the clauses in the agreement seeking to make public contracts more transparent; call on the Commission to ensure that other bilateral or multilateral agreements follow that approach;
· call on the Syrian Government to adopt measures in the fields of democracy and human rights so as to comply with international human rights law as regards respect for freedom of expression, the protection of human rights defenders, the prevention of and the fight against torture and the abolition of the death penalty; in particular, draw attention to the necessary reform of the Syrian associations law so as to end all major restrictions as regards the activities of human rights organisations;
· nevertheless, put to the Syrian Government its serious concerns about the absence of progress in such areas as opening up to multi-party politics and respect for human rights and civil liberties;
· point out that respect for human rights constitutes a vital component in this association agreement and call on Syria to respect its commitments within the framework of the Barcelona Process and along the lines of the European Neighbourhood Policy; call on Syria in this perspective to do what is needed to immediately lift the state of emergency;
· call on the Syrian Government to reconsider the case of political prisoners and release all prisoners of conscience and peace activists, and to allow the existence of groups such as the signatories of the Damascus Declaration, signed on 16 October 2005 by five proscribed parties and by independent personalities, and the signatories of the Beirut-Damascus/Damascus-Beirut Declaration of 14 May 2006; call on Syria to ensure that detained or imprisoned persons are well treated, not subjected to torture and are given prompt, regular and unrestricted access to their lawyers, doctors and families; MEPs encourage the Syrian Government to cooperate fully with the Lebanese Government, in accordance with the agreement of 5 May 2005 between the Prime Ministers of Syria and Lebanon, to obtain concrete results in the cases of disappearances of Syrian and Lebanese nationals, within the purview of the joint investigative commission created to that end;
· denounce before the Syrian Government – as Parliament has done in its above resolution of 15 June 2006 – the wave of arrests in response to the Beirut-Damascus/Damascus-Beirut Declaration, the first joint initiative by Syrian and Lebanese intellectuals and human rights defenders, and call for their immediate release;
· address the concerns of the European Union with regard to respecting the rights of religious and other minorities, and of the Kurds in particular; call on the Syrian Government to report on the state of progress with these issues;
· re-open a genuine dialogue with Syria with a view to involving it in peace efforts towards an overall settlement of the Middle East conflict;
· urge Syria to play a constructive role in the implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions 1559 and 1701, and call on it specifically to step up controls on its side of the Syria-Lebanon border so as to prevent the supply of arms to non-state entities;
· point out that cooperation by the Syrian authorities with the UN International Independent Investigation Commission headed by judge Brammertz has improved, but insist that it is further stepped up and that practical action is taken to follow up the investigation and comply with its findings;
· insist that Syria fully complies with UN Security Council Resolutions 1559, 1562, 1680 and 1701 and with the European Council’s declaration on Lebanon of 16 and 17 June 2006, which call on Syria and Lebanon to delineate their common frontier to reinforce regional stability; call on Syria to make a positive contribution to the clarification of the final status of the Shebaa Farms area in accordance with the UN Secretary-General’s recommendations of 12 September 2006 and in compliance with international law;
· note positively in this connection the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanese territory; yet call firmly on the Syrian Government to establish formal diplomatic relations with Lebanon, which has so far been refused, and to stop supporting Hezbollah;
· call on the Syrian Government to give an account of its practical actions to combat the proliferation of weapons and against terrorism and al-Qa’ida and on the control of its frontiers to prohibit the smuggling of weapons and the crossing of terrorists into neighbouring countries;
· deplore in this connection the signing of a military agreement concluded with Iran on 15 June 2006 on strengthening mutual cooperation in the face of American and Israeli ‘threats’;
· draw the attention of Syria to the importance of its potential role in the Near and Middle East for the peaceful resolution of conflicts in the region; address the concerns over Syrian support to Damascus-based Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad at the expense of moderate Palestinian forces that seek coexistence and peace with Israel;
call on the Syrian Government to improve the living and environmental conditions of Palestinian refugee camps in Syria in accordance with international human rights standards;
· call on the Syrian Government to release Yacoub Hanna Shamoun, an Assyrian Christian who has been incarcerated for over twenty years without due process or a release date in the near future;
· exercise caution in the repatriation to Syria of immigrants and refugees belonging to religious minorities as long as repression continues; and, in any event, improve coordination of the different Member States’ national approaches to this issue;
· call for support for a dialogue between Syria and Parliament on these various points, so as to go forward with the cooperation between the EU and Syria with the expectation of signing the association agreement.
Finally, Parliament requests the Council to consider additional incentives and benefits for Syria, going beyond those granted through the association agreement, in order to encourage Syria to review its current foreign policy and regional alignment in ways that will help promote regional peace, stability and prosperity and, in particular, recognition of the State of Israel’s right to exist and support by Syria for progress in the Middle East peace process.

MEPs denounce and fully reject Transnistria referendum on independence / South Ossetia - MEPs call for a peaceful resolution to the conflict
2006-10-30 - 13:42
Parliament adopted two separate resolutions on Transnistria and South Ossetia respectively. On Transnistria, the House strongly denounced the attempt in the Moldovan region of Transnistria to establish its independence in a unilateral way by organising a so-called referendum. On South Ossetia, MEPs reiterated their call for a peaceful resolution of the conflict and its commitment to support the peace process. MEPs denounced and fully rejected Transnistria referendum on independence
In adopting a resolution on Moldova and Transnistria, the House strongly denounced the attempt in the Moldovan region of Transnistria to establish its independence in a unilateral way by organising a so-called referendum.
MEPs called on the Government of the Russian Federation to withhold its support from this move and in particular from the holding of so-called referenda on the independence of the region. The House calls on the Government of the Russian Federation to give its fullest support to the multilateral efforts to find a solution to the conflicts in its neighbourhood. Parliament calls on the Government of the Russian Federation, furthermore, to fulfil the commitments made in 1996 in the Council of Europe and reflected in OSCE Summit decisions (Istanbul, 1999 and Oporto, 2002) concerning the withdrawal of Russian troops and arms from the territory of Moldova. The House expresses concern over the lack of progress on this issue.
Parliament fully rejected the organisation and outcome of the 'referendum' on independence for the Moldovan region of Transnistria and its possible accession to the Russian Federation as this is in sharp contradiction with the internationally recognised sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova and as the repressive regime in Transnistria does not allow for the free expression of the popular will.
MEPs stress that the resolution of the Transnistrian issue constitutes a crucial element for promoting political stability and economic prosperity in the Republic of Moldova and in the whole region. Parliaement stresses the need for a peaceful solution to the conflict, in line with the UN Charter and Conventions and OSCE declarations, and with full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova within its internationally recognised borders.
Parliament calls on all parties to the conflict to refrain from any measures that would lead to a further escalation of the situation, and to return immediately to the negotiating table in the 5+2 format and work towards a speedy and transparent solution of the conflict.
The House calls on the Council, the Member States and the Commission to continue to give their fullest support to a political and peaceful solution of the regional conflicts in the neighbourhood which the EU shares with the Russian Federation, and urges them to discuss these matters at their next meetings with the President and Government of the Russian Federation.
MEPs call on the Government of Moldova to undertake confidence-building measures and put forward new proposals for the inhabitants of Transnistria, providing positive incentives in order for them to fully support a peaceful reunification of the state, with minority language rights and local autonomy being safeguarded.
South Ossetia - MEPs call for a peaceful resolution to the conflict
In adopting a joint resolution on South Ossetia, MEPs reiterates their call for a peaceful resolution of the conflict and its commitment to support the peace process, and call on all parties to act responsibly by refraining from unilateral steps and inflammatory and aggressive statements which serve to exacerbate the situation and may degenerate into violence.
The House reaffirms its full support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia and calls on the Russian authorities to fully respect the sovereignty of that country within its internationally recognised borders. MEPs strongly condemn the attempts by movements in the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia to establish independence unilaterally. Parliament calls on the Government of the Russian Federation to withhold support from all of these movements and to give its fullest support to the multilateral efforts to find a solution to the conflicts in its neighbourhood. The House condemns the fact that South Ossetia will hold a referendum on independence on 12 November 2006, and reminds the parties that a similar referendum on independence in 1992 was not internationally recognised.
MEPs call, in that connection, on both parties to sign the joint document on refraining from the use of force and on security guarantees and to engage in constructive negotiations in order to overcome the present stalemate. MEPs regret the fact that the meeting of the Joint Control Commission which took place in Vladikavkaz on 12-13 October 2006 did not yield any results.
Parliament stresses that neutral, effective and impartial peacekeeping operations are essential for resolving territorial conflicts in Georgia. The House looks with interest, in that connection, to new proposals concerning the existing tripartite joint peacekeeping force deployed in the conflict area around the ceasefire line between Georgia and South Ossetia. The House points out that a new force should incorporate an element of police support, to combat crime and lawlessness. MEPs underline that the EU should be prepared, if necessary, to commit troops to a new peacekeeping force.
MEPs call on the Russian authorities to rescind all the measures recently taken against Georgia and against the Georgian population on its territory. Parliament calls, further, on the Russian authorities to lift their unjustified import ban on products from Moldova and Georgia. The House calls on the Council and the Commission to include the question of frozen conflicts and their resolution on the agenda for the next EU-Russia summits.
Finally, the European Parliament welcomes the conclusion and the signing of the ENP Action Plan for Georgia. MEPs expect that its implementation will give a further boost to the political and reform process in that country. The House also welcomes the statements by the High Representative for the CFSP Javier Solana, who recently said that the EU intends to become more actively engaged in the resolution of conflicts in Georgia, and calls on the Council to provide the EU Special Representative for the South Caucasus with all the necessary means and resources to make this action more effective and visible.
