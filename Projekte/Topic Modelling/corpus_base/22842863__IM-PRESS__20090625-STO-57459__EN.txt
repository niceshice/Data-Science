The first steps: Greek MEP Michalis Tremopoulos (left) and Czech Member Edvard Kožušník at the EP in Brussels. A motto that resonates? Michalis Tremopoulos: "Let's save a little from the tomorrow that they are stealing from us."Edvard Kožušník: "The world is neither black, nor white. It is colourful". Edvard Kožušník (top) wants to concentrate on cutting down on EU regulation.For Michalis Tremopoulos the environment is the key. The escalator of political fortune has led to them both being elected for five years. Checking documents to ensure they have the right ones will be something to get used to, as will checking the post-boxes of Members on the 3rd floor to see if any mail has arrived! A stream of newly-elected MEPs have been arriving at the European Parliament in recent days to begin their life as new Members in earnest. We caught up with Greek Green Michalis Tremopoulos and young Czech Conservative Edvard Kožušník as they arrived and asked them a few initial questions about their new roles.
For ex-journalist Michalis Tremopoulos the environment and regional development will be two areas he will be focused closely on. Although worried about the carbon footprint of having to fly back and forth from his native Thessaloniki, he sees the interests of Europe being identical for Greece and therefore worth fighting for. He cites Che Guevara and Epaminondas Charilaos (president of Greece's Refugee Treasury Fund after the First World War) as people he admires.
A cyclist who opposes excessive regulation
Thirty-eight year old Edvard Kožušník knows Brussels well as his previous job for the Czech Senate brought him regularly here. Married with two young children he is planning to fulfil his promise to voters that if elected he would cycle the over 700 kilometres from Prague to the Parliament's first session on 14 July in Strasbourg. As an MEP he told us he would make reducing bureaucracy and regulation his priority.

MICHALIS TREMOPOULOS
EDVARD KOŽUŠNÍK
First impressions?
I see a well-organised system, many people who know what they are doing. I am waiting of course to go into the essence of things, because what interests me is the political views and the possibilities there are for somebody to be useful to his country and to Europe and the world.
First time in Brussels?
No. I have been before. We came two months before the European elections and presented to the MEPs subjects related to Greece, with the participation of representatives from both the Commission and the Parliament. This way I had the opportunity to get a foretaste of what I will do next.
What was your previous role?
I studied law. I was a journalist and researcher. It is hard for me to see working in an institution as a profession. I see it more as the right of every active citizen.
Into which areas would you like to put most efforts?
The environment, nutrition, quality of life, preventive health and regional development.
What picture will you hang first in your new office?
I will hang some photos of old Thessaloniki.
Your favourite qualities in a politician?
The way things are today, I would say integrity and an ability to support policies that promote the interests of the majority and the interests of the planet.
First speech in the Chamber - nervous, excited...?
It was many years ago that I overcame a fear of speaking in front of people.
How will you make a mark here?
As a person that sincerely promotes the long-term interests of his country, which are the same as those of the united Europe.
Your heroes in world history?
Che Guevara. Also Epaminondas Charilaos, a person that has made history in Greece. It is after him that was named the district "Harilaou" ( or Charilaou ) in which I live in Thessaloniki. I would like to write his biography one day.
Your favourite motto?
Let's save a little from the tomorrow that they are stealing from us.
MEPs need to be very mobile. Are you used to travelling a lot?
No, but it seems that I will be doing that a lot here! It bothers me, as this will burden my ecological footprint on the planet. I have to use a plane to go to Greece, I cannot move otherwise. I would like to be able to move by bicycle, to Greece but also to Strasbourg.
Which languages do you speak?
Greek and English.
What is your favourite occupation when not working?
I am interested in research and local history.
Do you think you will still have time for it?
We will see. I hope so!
Do you have a good sense of direction? Are you afraid to get lost in the building?
It is not a matter of direction. I am gradually finding my way, so soon I will know all there is to know.
First impressions?
Mixed. I like the old historic part of Brussels. But I have been here shortly before the elections when the European Parliament was closed and it looked like a ghost town. It is an open question whether having two Parliament buildings is a waste.
First time in Brussels?
No. I was head of office for the Chairman of the Czech Senate and thus I was coming here quite often, especially during the Czech presidency. I am looking forward to seeing the EP building in Strasbourg, because I promised to my voters that I will come to the first plenary session by bike from the Czech Republic (Circa. 770km).
What was your previous role?
During the last years I worked for the Czech Senate.
Into which areas would you like to put most efforts?
Reducing bureaucracy and regulation.
What picture will you hang first in your new office?
Certainly a picture of my wife and my children.
Your favourite qualities in a politician?
To have a vision and the will to organise people around oneself, so that they would work together to make that vision a reality.
First speech in the plenary: nervous or excited?
I certainly will not be excited and I certainly will be nervous .
How would you make a mark here?
I would like to stay in the minds of people as a reformer of Brussels bureaucracy . But most likely I will be remembered as the guy who came to Strasbourg by bike.
Who are your heroes?
My greatest hero is Jára Cimrman. (a Czech fictional character, elected "Czech of the Century" in a recent nation-wide poll).
Your favourite motto?
"The world is neither black, nor white. It is colourful." My dear colleague Michal Tošovský, who tragically died a few years ago used it a lot.
MEPs are very mobile. Are you used to travel a lot?
I have no problem with that, in the Czech Republic I am responsible for the promotion of beach tennis and so I travel all around the world. Moreover, I am in charge of the Czech-Spanish chamber of commerce.
Which languages do you speak?
Spanish and English very well, I can communicate with my German and Bulgarian colleagues. I also speak Russian.
What is your favourite occupation when not working?
I love to play beach tennis with my family.
Do you think you will still have time for it?
I don´t know.
Do you have a good sense of direction? Are you afraid to get lost in the building?
I have a good sense of orientation, but like any man, I am unable to do two things at a time.
