20% of all energy should be renewable by 2020
European Commission President José Manuel Barroso used a special sitting of the Parliament on Wednesday to lay out plans to make Europe "the first economy for the low-carbon age". The aim is a 20% cut in greenhouse gas emissions, a 20% increase in energy efficiency and to have 20% of energy from renewable sources - all by 2020. Assembled MEPs mostly reacted favourably to the plans, although there was some dissent. As the plans are digested, we asked some MEPs for their comments.
The Commission's plans aim for a complete overhaul and reform of the way the EU's 27 members combat climate change. The main proposals are as follows:
Emissions Trading scheme (ETS): extend this to include more greenhouse gases (currently it covers only CO2) and to all major emitters of greenhouse gases (including air traffic). Emissions allowances would be put on the market and their number reduced annually. They would be European rather than national allocations.
Renewing renewable forms of energy: Renewable energy currently accounts for 8.5% of final EU energy consumption. That means an increase of 11.5% to meet the 20% target.
Biofuels: the aim is to have 10% of Europe's transport sector powered by bio-fuels by 2020.
Carbon capture and storage: (storing carbon underground rather releasing it) the Commission plans a legal framework and guidelines for state aid.
Mr Barroso said the Commission's plans were "good for the planet, industry and our citizens". He told MEPs that work had to begin to half global emissions by 2050.
"We need courage"
Speaking to MEPs after the debate we found a generally positive reaction and realism about how difficult the road ahead could be. Last year a climate change committee was formed in parliament, its rapporteur, German Christian Democrat Karl-Heinz Florenz said, "the package is coherent...and takes into account the situation of European companies operating on the world market".
He went on to talk about the compromises and the pressure that European industry will exert. "We have to find a reasonable compromise that will safeguard the continent and our industries competitiveness. It’s an opportunity. We need courage!"
British Liberal Chris Davies said, "no-one ever said that meeting the challenge of global warming would be easy. We must grasp these measures as an opportunity, a low carbon economy will promote innovation, drive forward investment and create jobs".
Jobs and renewable energy - some MEPs see link
In Germany at present a quarter of a million people are employed in the renewable energy sector and in Spain 60,000 work in the wind energy sector alone. Danish MEP Britta Thomsen (PSE) drafted a report for the Parliament last year on renewable energy. She told us that the experience of Denmark and others had shown that thousands of jobs could be created by greater use of renewable energy. She also welcomed the Commission proposals as they upheld "the principle of fairness" between poorer and richer EU members.
Another MEP to bring up the possibility of job creation was Finnish Green Satu Hassi, who Chairs Parliament's Environment Committee. She compared it to the effect that telecom industries have had in the last decade. On the cost of the measures she said it would amount to €3 per person per week - "far less than the cost of in action".
Dispute over international impact
However, in the context of the Bali talks on international climate change, aimed at finding a successor to the Kyoto agreement, Ms Hassi said the target of 20% by 20% is a "pessimistic signal for international negotiations". She would have liked the 30% cut the EU pledged itself to last March.
Other MEPs were more optimistic about the effect this could have on the EU's role as an international example in the fight against climate change. Italian Socialist Guido Sacconi, who chairs the Climate Change committee, said that "thanks to the package, the EU will have confirmed and strengthened the leading role it played at the recent UN Climate Change conference in Bali".
He also gave a final clarion call as to where that work had to start "now it is up to the Parliament, as legislator, to show responsibility and coherence towards citizens, companies and international actors".
