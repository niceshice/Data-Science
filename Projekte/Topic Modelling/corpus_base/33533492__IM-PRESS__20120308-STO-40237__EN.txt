Candle 11 March is a memorial day in EU dedicated to those who lost their lives in terrorist attacks as well as their families and friends. The date was chosen as it is the anniversary of the terrorist bomb attack in Madrid in 2004 that killed 191 people and left 1,800 wounded. This together with last year's tragedy in Norway and the bombings in London on 7 July 2005 which killed more than 50, are among the worst acts of terrorism committed in Europe.
Spanish Christian-Democrat Teresa Jiménez-Becerril knows very well the reality of terrorism as her brother and sister-in-law were killed by ETA. "The voice and the memories of the victims are the best weapons to fight against terrorism. Terrorists want our silence, so society would forget their horrible actions and crimes. But if we keep remembering, we oblige them to accept their responsibilities and the victim's testimony will finally bring justice, which is what all victims want."
Ms Jiménez-Becerril said the EU could do a lot to stop terrorist acts: "The most important thing to do is 'prevention'. Security and safeguarding the lives of our citizens is sometimes seen as an attack on their freedoms. I think it is the opposite. The first human right is the right to live and that should always be protected."
British Conservative Sajjad Karim was in the Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai in November 2008 when attackers opened fire. He said: "Terrorism is one of the global challenges we face today. I have faced the bullets of extremists abroad and also witnessed the fear in my family when we were targeted at home. Victims of all outrages must know that they are not alone and this is the real power of remembrance day - to unite us all and stand shoulder to shoulder with those who have lost loved ones or had their lives affected."
