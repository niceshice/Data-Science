A European Commission proposal that would have allowed Member States to divert some Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) direct farm payments to rural development spending was today almost unanimously rejected by the European Parliament's Agriculture Committee.
The Commission proposal for a voluntary modulation scheme would allow 20% of direct payments to be diverted to rural development projects, at the discretion of each Member State. The report, authored by Lutz Goepel (EPP-ED, DE), warned that such a transfer could create distortions in competition between farmers from various Member States, and could also lead to a "renationalisation" of the CAP.
Parliament had already overwhelmingly rejected this proposal once, in a plenary vote on 14 November, 2006. But under Rule of Procedure 52, para 3, if the Commission does not withdraw a rejected proposal, the matter is referred back to the relevant committee.
The report is to be put to a plenary vote at the Strasbourg session of 12-15 February.
