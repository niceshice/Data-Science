Briefing - 10-11 October - Brussels plenary session
2007-10-04 - 16:11
Selected highlights of the Brussels plenary session 10-11 October 2007 include: Wednesday 10 October 2007
The freed Bulgarian nurses held in Libya will be present for the Brussels plenary session at the invitation of EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering. On 10 October, t he Bulgarian nurses will attend the opening of the session and will have meeting s with the President and the political groups. There will be a press-point after the meeting with the President which starts at 12.30pm and a photo opportunity with the 18 Bulgarian MEPs at 1pm.
The European Parliament called for a fair trial and opposed the death sentence several times, starting from the pre-accession reports by the EP rapporteur Geoffrey Van Orden (EPP-ED, UK). After more than eight years in prison in Libya the five Bulgarian nurses Kristiana Vulcheva, Nasya Nenova, Valentina Siropulo, Valya Chervenyashka and Snezhana Dimitrova , the Palestinian doctor who got Bulgarian citizenship Ashraf al-Haiui and the Bulgarian doctor Zdravko Georgiev returned to Bulgaria on 24 July 2007. They were detained by the police in Libya in 1999 on allegations of deliberately infecting hundreds of Libyan children with HIV/AIDS.
European Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering will open the session with a statement on the World/European Day against the Death Penalty (10 October) . In the resolution adopted at the last plenary, MEPs gave their "full support to EU institutions and Members States to declare, together with the Council of Europe, a European Day against the Death Penalty on 10 October each year". Parliament regrets "the lack of unanimity in the Council on this issue and calls on the future Polish Government to fully support this initiative that reflects the basic values of the European Union."
Just eight days before the crucial summit in Lisbon, MEPs will debate the preparation of the informal summit of heads of state and government . The current Intergovernmental Conference is due to complete its work as quickly as possible, and in any case before the end of 2007, so as to allow for sufficient time to ratify the resulting Treaty before the European Parliament elections in June 2009 .
The House will then debate a key report on the future composition and number of seats per Member State in the European Parliament . The allocation of seats approved in committee follows the rules established by the June 2007 European Council, which invited the European Parliament to present a proposal by October this year. The draft Reform Treaty lays down that the new EP composition will be decided by the European Council acting by unanimity, on the basis of Parliament's proposal and after obtaining its consent. The Nice Treaty and the Accession Treaties for Romania and Bulgaria allocated 72 MEPs for the UK for the 2009 European elections. In the EP report, the UK has 73 MEPs. For Ireland, there is no change with both Nice and the EP report allocating 12 MEPs to Ireland for the 2009 European elections.
MEPs will then debate on a resolution on the humanitarian situation in Gaza after hearing statements from the Commission and the Council. On 27 September, the Conference of Presidents made a statement saying that it "deplored the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip." The Conference was informed about serious declines in health indicators, such as increased rates of malnutrition and chronic diseases. The vote takes place on Thursday.
The financing of the Common Agriculture Policy comes under the spotlight with the Agriculture Committee saying it would like all national lists of recipients of EU direct farm aid to be published on the Internet and for links to be created from the Commission's website to websites of the paying agencies in the Member States. Currently thirteen Member States have set up on-line registers accessible to the public via the Europa website.
On the sidelines of the plenary, at 5pm , there will be a seminar on the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought . The three nominees are Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, Sudanese lawyer Salih Mahmoud Osman and Chinese dissidents Zeng Jinyan and Hu Jia. The leaders of Parliament's Political Groups will choose a winner in October The prize will be awarded in plenary in December.
Thursday 11 October 2007
The House debates and votes on two transport reports on Thursday. First, the Transport Committee recommends that the Parliament should give the green light to the EU-US aviation agreement which was signed at the EU-US summit of 30 April 2007 and which the Council endorsed and decided to apply provisionally as from 30 March 2008.
Second, the Transport Committee is calling for a "master plan" for enhanced airport capacity in order to promote and better coordinate any national and cross-border initiative for building new airport capacities and to make better use of existing capacities.

Preparation of key Lisbon summit on the new EU Reform Treaty
2007-10-04 - 16:11
MEPs will debate the preparation of key Lisbon summit on the new EU reform Treaty. The Presidency will be represented by the Secretary of State for European Affairs, Manuel Lobo Antunes (PM José Sócrates will come to Strasbourg in October (22 - 25 October) to explain the results of the summit. State of negotiations on the Treaty
At present, legal experts are concluding the technical work on the Reform Treaty. The Portuguese Presidency hopes that the open political questions will be dealt with by 15 October, the date of the last meeting of the EU Ministers of Foreign Affairs in Luxembourg. A round of negotiations on the Treaty is envisaged before the Informal Summit in Lisbon on 18-19 October between the Heads of State and Government.
Background to the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)
The problems encountered in 2005 during the process of ratifying the Constitutional Treaty led the Union to engage in a process of reflection on future reform. This resulted in June 2006 in an invitation from the European Council to the future German Presidency to prepare a report on the way forward.
This report, together with the work undertaken by the German Presidency, allowed the European Council at its meeting on 21-22 June 2007 to agree on the convening of an IGC in order to draw up a "Reform Treaty" amending the existing treaties with a view to enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the enlarged Union, as well as the coherence of its external action. The IGC is carrying out its work in accordance with the detailed mandate agreed by the European Council (see link).
The IGC is due to complete its work as quickly as possible, and in any case before the end of 2007, so as to allow for sufficient time to ratify the resulting Treaty before the European Parliament elections in June 2009 . As agreed by the European Council, the Portuguese Presidency is drawing up the draft Treaty text in line with the terms of the mandate and should submit it to the Summit.

Distribution of EP seats: Constitutional Affairs Committee approves proposal
2007-10-04 - 16:11
A proposal for the new allocation of seats in the European Parliament after the next legislative elections, in 2009, is being put forward by the Constitutional Affairs Committee . Committee members call for a revision of the proposed distribution of seats for the 2014-2019 parliamentary term. The following allocation of seats in the European Parliament for the 2009-2014 parliamentary term, as proposed by the two co-rapporteurs, Alain Lamassoure (EPP-ED, FR) and Adrian Severin (PES, RO), was approved in committee with 17 votes in favour, five against and three abstentions.

(1) Population figures as officially established on 7 November 2006 by the Commission in Doc. 15124/06 on the basis of Eurostat figures.
(2) "Nice": Distribution of Seats according to Art. 189 TEC as modified by Art. 9 of the BG/RO - Act of Accession.
(3) "New": New Proposal on the basis of Art. 9A TEU new ( I-20).
(4) The new figures concerning Germany and Malta derive automatically from the draft reform treaty provisions.
The allocation of seats approved in committee follows the rules established by the June 2007 European Council, which invited the European Parliament to present a proposal by October this year. The Council stipulated that the EP is limited to a total of 750 seats and that no Member State should have more than 96 seats or less than six. Finally, it also says that the distribution should respect the "degressive proportionality" principle.
The committee proposes that the "degressive proportionality" means that bigger Member States agree to accept fewer seats than they would receive if the total were divided according to population size, so as to allow for better representation of less-densely populated states. The two co-rapporteurs based their proposal on the EUROSTAT figures for the number of residents in each Member State, as approved by the Council.
UK and Ireland
The Nice Treaty and the Accession Treaties for Romania and Bulgaria allocated 72 MEPs for the UK for the 2009 European elections. In the EP report, the UK has 73 MEPs. For Ireland, there is no change with both Nice and the EP report allocating 12 MEPs to Ireland for the 2009 European elections.
Call to revise distribution in time for the 2014-2019 elections
In approving the European Council's draft decision, the committee asks that the proposed distribution be revised, well in advance of the beginning of the 2014-2019 legislative term, so as to set up an objective and fair system for allocating the seats in the EP, in order take account of demographic changes and "avoid the traditional political horse-trading between Member States".
Committee members also propose examining the political and technical feasibility of replacing the number of residents, as established annually by the EU statistics office, with the number of European citizens.
The committee proposes not to consider future Member States, such as Croatia, when allocating seats, so as to avoid pre-judging future enlargements. It also proposed that future accessions may be accompanied by a temporary increase over and above the 750-seat ceiling, as was done for Bulgaria and Romania.
According to current rules, as laid down by the 2005 Accession Act of Bulgaria and Romania, the number of MEPs should be reduced to 736. The draft Reform Treaty lays down that the new composition of the EP will be decided by the European Council acting by unanimity, on the basis of Parliament's proposal and after obtaining its consent. In the approved report, MEPs in the committee call on the Member States to adopt this proposal immediately after the Reform Treaty enters into force.

Freed Bulgaria nurses in Brussels for the plenary
2007-10-04 - 16:11
On 10 and 11 October the released Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor will visit the European Parliament at the invitation of President Pöttering. They will attend the opening of the session and will have meetings with the President and the political groups. There will be a press-point after the meeting with the President which starts at 12.30 and a photo opportunity with him and the 18 Bulgarian MEPs at 13.00 on 10 October. After more than eight years in prison in Libya the five Bulgarian nurses Kristiana Vulcheva, Nasya Nenova, Valentina Siropulo, Valya Chervenyashka and Snezhana Dimitrova , the Palestinian doctor who got Bulgarian citizenship Ashraf al-Haiui and the Bulgarian doctor Zdravko Georgiev returned to Bulgaria on 24 July 2007.
They were detained by the police in Libya in 1999 on allegations of deliberately infecting hundreds of Libyan children with HIV. Libyan courts of all instances have found them guilty although several international experts proved their innocence. About a week before their return the Supreme Judicial Council of Libya replaced the death sentence with life imprisonment. This cleared the way for their transfer to Sofia thanks to an intergovernmental agreement of the mid-1980s and the full support and involvement of the EU. Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov issued a decree of pardon for the six medics shortly after they landed in Sofia.
The European Parliament called for a fair trial and opposed the death sentence several times, starting from the p re-accession reports by the EP rapporteur Geoffrey Van Orden (EPP-ED, UK). Eighteen days after the accession of Bulgaria on 17th January the House adopted a joint resolution with 567 votes in favour, 1 against and 7 abstentions condemning the death verdict of the Criminal Court in Libya on 19 December 2006 and calling for a fair trial.

The humanitarian situation in Gaza
2007-10-04 - 16:11
MEPs will debate and vote on a resolution on the humanitarian situation in Gaza after hearing statements from the Commission and the Council. On 27 September, the Conference of Presidents made a statement saying that it "deplored the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip". The Conference was informed about serious declines in health indicators, such as increased rates of malnutrition and chronic diseases. A delegation of Development Committee MEPs, recently returned from the Gaza Strip, voiced its shock at the conditions of the civilian population there. As a result, the Conference of Presidents decided to add a debate to the agenda of Wednesday's mini-plenary in Brussels, so that the Parliament can express its view on this matter in a resolution, after statements by the Council and Commission.
The Development Committee delegation's report to the Conference of Presidents explained the deteriorating humanitarian conditions on the ground in the Gaza Strip. The Conference was informed about serious declines in health indicators, such as increased rates of malnutrition and chronic diseases. It was also briefed on the difficulties caused by the closure of border crossings, which have severely interrupted economic activity and the free movement of goods, as well as hampering international humanitarian organisations in their work. In addition, basic services such as sewage disposal, rubbish collection and clean water are completely disrupted or under heavy strain.
The resolution will aim at making recommendations to Council and Commission as to the strategy and next steps in implementing EU policy towards this humanitarian emergency.
The Chairpersons of the political groups also expressed the view that, in the meantime, immediate action is needed by the Commission and the Council in order to alleviate the suffering of the population in Gaza. Council and Commission statements

Transport Committee calls for master plan for enhanced airport capacity
2007-10-04 - 16:11
Within the EU, air traffic is growing at a rate of 5.2 % per annum. Thus, by the year 2025, the demand for flights will be 2.5 times higher than that of 2003. More than 60 airports would then be unable to handle the typical busy hourly demand without generating delays or unaccommodated demand (3.7 million flights a year would then be unaccommodated). The Transport Committee therefore calls for a "master plan" for enhanced airport capacity in order to promote and better coordinate any national and cross-border initiative for building new airport capacities as well as making better use of existing capacities.
MEPs in the committee stress that adequate airport capacity and efficient ground handling and use of capacity are vital to the European economy and must be ensured. The shortage of capacity and the increase in demand for flights will probably lead to demand for new major airports (up to 10 according to a Eurocontrol study) and medium-sized airports (up to 15 according to Eurocontrol).
Although the planning of new infrastructure remains within the competence of the Member States, the committee calls on the Commission to present before 2009 a master plan for enhanced airport capacity in Europe, in order to promote and better coordinate any national and cross-border initiative for building new airport capacities dedicated to international traffic and to make better use of existing capacities. Members took the view that only the cohabitation of various airport models according to national specificities (major hubs or regional airports through point-to point travels) will enable the EU to fulfil its need in this field.
Promoting environmentally-friendly growth
Despite progress as regards the environmental performance of aviation, MEPs argue that the growth in air traffic has resulted in a "sharp increase" in the total volume of greenhouse gas emissions produced by this sector (+100 % compared to 1990), and that airport congestion is contributing significantly to this. A more efficient use of airport capacity is therefore vital. Also, the growth of air transport will have to be accompanied by technical and regulatory schemes limiting the external costs of this mode, such as the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). However, the Committee points out that that the efficiency of measures designed to reduce the environmental impact of air transport also depends on the policies pursued by countries at global level and, that programmes with third countries are needed.

Transport Committee recommends approving EU-US Open Sky agreement
2007-10-04 - 16:11
The Transport Committee recommends that the Parliament should give its green light to the EU-US aviation agreement which was signed at the EU-US summit of 30 April 2007 and which the Council endorsed and decided to apply provisionally as from 30 March 2008. The agreement deals with, inter alia
• The possibility to operate flights beyond the European Union and the United States towards third countries ('5th Freedom') and to operate all-cargo flights beyond the United States to a third country, without a requirement that the service starts in the EU (7th Freedom - All Cargo).
• A unilateral granting by the United States to the EU of the so-called '7th Freedom rights for Passengers' to a number of non-EU European countries, i.e. the right for Community airlines to operate flights between a city in the United States and a city in these European countries.
• The possibility for any "Community air carrier" to fly between any point in the EU to any point in the US, without any restrictions on pricing or capacity. This freedom does not exist for the moment.
• Rights in the area of ownership, investment and control of US airlines by EU investors.
• The possibility for the EU to restrict US investments in Community airlines.
• A number of access rights for Community airlines to the US 'Fly America' programme for the transport of passengers and cargo financed by the US Federal government. Such rights have never previously been granted by the United States to a third country.
Parliament has given its first appreciation of the draft agreement in form of a resolution on 14 March 2007. In this resolution Parliament underlined that the issues not resolved in this first-stage agreement should be dealt with in the second-stage agreement. These issues are cabotage, right of establishment and ownership.
Furthermore, the Parliament proposes the concept of 'one stop security' and emphasised the need to reduce the negative environmental impact of aviation on climate change. Parliament wishes to be fully informed and consulted before and throughout the second-stage negotiations by the Commission. The EP underlines the importance of regular meetings between its Members and the US Congress.
Background
Air services between the EU and US presently operate on the basis of bilateral agreements between individual Member States and the US. These bilateral agreements contain provisions that the European Court of Justice ruled in November 2002 to be incompatible with Community law. Therefore it was decided to create a new legal framework for EU-US aviation relations and negotiations on an Air Transport Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, on the one hand, and the United States of America, on the other hand, were conducted by the European Commission under a mandate received from the Council in June 2003. This mandate set the objective of establishing an Open Aviation Area (OAA) between the EU and US, creating a single market for air transport between the EU and US in which investment could flow freely and in which European and US airlines would be able to provide air services without any restriction, including in the domestic markets of both parties.

A maritime policy for the EU
2007-10-04 - 16:11

Agriculture
Identifying farm aid beneficiaries to strengthen public support for the CAP
2007-10-04 - 16:11
European taxpayers view the management of EU farm aid as unfathomable and riddled with flaws, which undermines the legitimacy of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). So a European Commission proposal to improve the transparency and budgetary implementation of this aid is welcomed by the EP Agriculture Committee, although its members would like to go even further. In 2006 the European Union decided to make public the identities of recipients of aid granted under CAP. Last March, the Commission proposed amending the regulation governing the financing of the CAP, with the aim of putting this initiative on transparency into effect throughout the EU and also defining its scope more precisely. The proposal also seeks to tighten up the rules on penalties for any shortcomings in the Member States' control systems.
In a consultation report by Jorgo CHATZIMARKAKIS (ALDE, DE) the Agriculture Committee stresses that Parliament has been eagerly awaiting these measures. The report nevertheless makes some amendments to improve transparency even more, while still abiding by rules on data protection.
Measures to improve transparency
The Agriculture Committee would like all national lists of recipients of EU direct farm aid to be published on the Internet and for links to be created from the Commission's website to websites of the paying agencies in the Member States. Currently thirteen Member States have set up on-line registers accessible to the public via the Europa website. In the case of company-run farms, MEPs in the committee call for the names of the directors and investors to be published.
The committee also urges that data on payments under the Rural Development Fund (EAFRD) be broken down to enable the broad areas that receive funding to be identified. It also calls for other minimum criteria to be introduced in order to facilitate easier comparison of data published by different Member States. Member States should be free to publish even more detailed breakdowns of funds, in line with their priorities and national legislation but would only be "encouraged" to publish details of additional payments from national funds (top-ups).
Since transparency is a key factor in any improvement of budgetary control, MEPs believe the procedures regarding any failure to observe the rules on publishing information need to be clarified. They say that, in the event of "major errors", payments for the paying agency concerned should be reduced by a flat rate of 2%.
Data protection and other safeguards
At the same time, MEPs in the committee highlight the need to include provisions on data protection in the Council regulation itself, and not just in its implementing arrangements. For example, there should be advance warning to the individuals concerned before their data are published and people consulting or using the data should be required to register first.
Lastly, the Agriculture Committee wants the regulation to spell out that publication of this information is justified as part of the deal by which Europe's farmers receive fair compensation for the services they provide to society.

Budgetary control
Cigarette smuggling (EC-Philip Morris agreement)
2007-10-04 - 16:11
Bart STAES (Greens/EFA, BE ) for the Budgetary Control Committee will be tabling a non-binding report on cigarette smuggling (EC-Philip Morris agreement). The European Parliament, supported by the Council and the European Court of Auditors, is recommending that, in order to prevent fraud, transit movements be computerised, the legal framework be revised and the Commission and the Member States improve physical checks based on common risk analysis UK affected
The report observes that the House of Lords considers that approximately 4% of the UK's potential VAT revenue is being lost each year due to carousel fraud; notes the House of Lords' findings that, although it appeared more lucrative to commit VAT fraud in intra-Community trade, it can also occur in trade involving trade with third countries. The committee is deeply concerned about the House of Lords' explanations that, in the latter cases, the abuse of the Community transit system forms part of the classical pattern of carousel fraud.
The committee is grateful that the House of Lords addressed the vulnerability of the Community transit system to fraud, although the European Court of Auditors had not focused on the UK in particular. The committee warmly welcomes the House of Lords' recommendation "that Government works with other Member States to ensure that the European Court of Auditors' proposed changes to the Community Transit system are prioritised in order to attack the supply chain for this variant of (...) fraud."
The report calls on the other Member States to cooperate with the UK Government in order finally to make the Community Transit System fraud proof.
The agreement with Philip Morris
The report recalls that the agreement with Philip Morris to end all litigation between parties, under which Philip Morris was committed to pay US$1.25bn over a period of 12 years, and which aimed at combating fraud and illicit cigarette trade, was a major step forward.
The committee notes that, under the agreement, Philip Morris will enhance the tracing and tracking of its products so as to assist law enforcement authorities in combating illegal trade.
The report also notes that, under the agreement, Philip Morris has to pay compensation for loss of duties in case of seizures of cigarettes bearing the Philip Morris trademark. Finally, the Budgetary Control Committee calls on the UK government to join the agreement, the UK being the only Member State which has not yet signed it. In view of its work on fraud in the EU, the committee invites the House of Lord to support this request.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
EU action to tackle murders of women in Central America and Mexico
2007-10-04 - 16:11
An own-initiative report on the murders of women in Central America and Mexico is proposed by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. The report is part of a global strategy for the eradication and prevention of feminicide and proposes EU actions in the framework of partnerships agreements. The report drafted by Raül Romeva i Rueda (Greens/EFA, ES) is the outcome of a hearing held at the European Parliament in April 2006 on the subject of feminicide in Mexico and Central America, organised by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and the Subcommittee on Human Rights.
Feminicides : a global issue
According to the definition laid down in the report, the world "feminicide" should be understood as "any act or conduct, based on gender, which causes death or physical, sexual or psychological harm or sexual harm or suffering to women, whether in the public or the private sphere".
Central America and Mexico have witnessed a sharp increase in violent killings in recent years. The cases of two European women murdered in Mexico, Hester Van Nierop in 1998 and Brenda Susana Margaret Searle in 2001, have symbolic value.
However, violence against women has a global dimension and concerns all countries, Europe included, and this report, MEPs in the committee stress, should be considered as part of a global strategy for the eradication and prevention of violent deaths of women. The report urges the countries to take all necessary steps for the effective combating of violence towards women and to take measures to ensure full respect for human rights. However, the aim of the European Parliament's resolution is to "issue an invitation to take concrete steps to improve what it sees as unsatisfactory state of affairs in states" and does not constitute "any kind of accusation or charge sheet against states which are sovereign and considered as equal partners in the field of international politics".
Action at European level
In the report, MEPs in the committee ask the national governments in the framework of their bilateral relations with the countries of Latin America, and European Institutions within their strategic partnership, to support the prevention and protection policies relating to violence. They also insist that the European members of the EU-Mexico Joint Parliamentary Committee, as well as Parliament's delegation for relations with the countries of Central America, include systematically the issue of feminicide and impunity in the programmes for their visits to the region.
The report also stresses the need for the European Union to give priority to the restructuring and reinforcement of judicial and prison systems. Such actions should be conducted in partnership with the International Labour Organization and with the OECD's National Contact Point of Mexico in order to devise programmes aimed at ensuring safety, decent working conditions and equal pay for women.
The European Commission should, MEPs believe, coordinate the different European initiatives and submit such initiatives to Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. They also propose that EU representations and Member States' embassies organise a round table on feminicide and impunity and that a joint hearing be organised by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, the Subcommittee on Human Rights and the delegations concerned, before the EU/Latin America summit in Lima in May 2008, with a view to evaluating the measures in place.

Fisheries
Collection and management of data on the Common Fisheries Policy
2007-10-04 - 16:11
The House will vote on a report from the Fisheries Committee on collection and management of data on the Common Fisheries Policy. The Fisheries Committee will be recommending the EP to approve a Commission proposal amending Regulation 1543/2000, which establishes a Community framework for the collection and management of the data needed to conduct the Common Fisheries Policy. In the light of new thinking on fisheries management and to prepare for a maritime policy for the EU, the Commission proposes that this regulation is repealed and replaced by a new more comprehensive data collection regulation.
The new regulation should enter into force in 2008. However, in the interim, it is necessary to amend the existing Regulation 1543/2000 in order to prevent an overlap between the old and the new regulation and to avoid any unnecessary administrative burdens on the Member States and the Commission.
Specifically, this will obviate the present legal obligation on Member States to submit six-year national programmes for the collection and management of data from 2007 to 2012, according to rules that are soon to be replaced. Instead, transitional programmes covering the years 2007 and 2008 are to be drawn up.
The current Commission proposal makes these necessary changes and is consequently supported by the rapporteur, Paulo Casaca (PES, PT), without amendment.
