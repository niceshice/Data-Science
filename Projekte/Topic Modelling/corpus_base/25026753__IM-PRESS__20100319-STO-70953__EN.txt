The United Nations Security Council in New York Â©UN Photo/Paulo Filgueiras Lambsdorff thinks 1 EU seat on Security Council unrealistic Pleased about "lively dialogue" between MEPs and Governments Although the next General Assembly of the UN is not until September, the European Parliament has already started giving some consideration to the issues it would like to see raised. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff MEP is Parliament's rapporteur on UN issues and we spoke to the German Liberal about some of the issues likely to be on the horizon.
How realistic is it for the EU to eventually be represented with one seat on the UN Security Council?
It is not realistic in the near future, because one of the fundamental articles of the UN Charter would have to be changed for that purpose. But as a long-term political objective this is an important priority of the European Parliament. In the meantime we believe that the Security Council should be reformed anyway. It should become bigger and more representative and thus reflect the reality of the beginning 21st century.
Did the Lisbon Treaty strengthen the position of the EU in the UN?
Yes and no. It is now possible for someone to speak on behalf of the EU - the High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy (Catherine Ashton) - and this is very positive. We will see how the Lisbon Treaty will affect the workings of the UN otherwise. But, I believe that in the General Assembly it will be difficult to reconcile a permanent EU President (Herman Van Rompuy) with the rotating EU Presidency (currently held by Spain but in September by Belgium).
What weight does the Parliament's voice have in the UN?
Unlike in other policy areas, the Parliament is not a legislator in the domain of foreign policy. We are giving a clear message about what we think should the priorities be for the EU member states within the UN. I am happy about the fact that there is a lively dialogue between Parliament and the Council (where EU governments meet) about topics that are being dealt with in the UN.
I hope that some of our recommendations are being incorporated in the Council resolutions. We as members of the foreign affairs committee travel once a year to New York in order to attend the UN General Assembly and during this visit we hold regular talk with key stakeholders.
