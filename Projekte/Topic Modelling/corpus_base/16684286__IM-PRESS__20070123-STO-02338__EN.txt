Co. Louth, Ireland: EU regional funds for job creation
The European Union has now 27 different countries comprising over 250 different regions. As well as extraordinary linguistic and cultural diversity they have very different standards of living. London has the highest Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per person of any region whilst North East Romania is the lowest. Over the next six years the EU will devote over 37% of its budget - some â‚¬308 billion - to creating jobs and increasing the standard of living of its regions through its "cohesion" policy.
Unfortunately the enlargement of the EU to 25 states in 2004 and then to 27 with Romania and Bulgarian this year has increased, rather than decreased regional disparities.
This week MEPs in Parliament's Regional Committee have been considering a number of ways on how to tackle the problem of economic disparity between regions in the EU. One report - by Polish Socialist MEP Lidia Joanna Geringer de Oedenberg, makes a few recommendations on how to improve the situation.
"EU cohesion policy should identify the poorest regions"
In particular it suggests that "EU cohesion policy identify the poorest regions", calls for greater attention to the capacity of regions to "absorb" EU funds as many local authorities lack the experience to apply for them. It also wants the availability of funds speeded up.
In terms of where the money should be targeted - it calls for special efforts for those with disabilities and ensuring that men and women have equal opportunities.
Although regional disparities may exists - the relative growth of Ireland after it joined the EU in 1973 is often held up as an example of what can be achieved through regional investment.
