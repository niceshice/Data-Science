The Development Committee is demanding that Parliament retain the power of co-decision which is threatened by proposals from the European Commission to introduce a single instrument for development policy. Unless the Commission's proposals are amended, the European Parliament will lose its joint legislative power with the Council over the content of 16 regulations.
In a report by Gay Mitchell (EPP-ED, IE), the committee says Parliament must keep its co-decision rights on strategic priorities, geographical and thematic aid programmes, in other words these must not be determined by the comitology procedure, as the Commission wants. Co-decision must also apply to the multiannual financial framework.
Moreover, in line with the Millennium Goals, the Development Committee is seeking to restrict the scope of the instrument to the developing countries. Cooperation with the industrialised countries - those eligible for the Pre-accession Instrument or the Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument - should not be included, say MEPs.
On the question of aid funding, the committee states that budget support must be approved by the Court of Auditors and the parliament of the partner country. Any suspension of aid must be decided by the Council of Ministers by a qualified majority after the European Parliament has been consulted.
