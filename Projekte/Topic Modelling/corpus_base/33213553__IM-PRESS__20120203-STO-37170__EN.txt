MEP Nigel Farage He is known for asking tough questions, but this time it will be your opportunity to question him. Nigel Farage, the leader of the eurosceptic Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group, will chat with EP's Facebook fans on Wednesday 8 February at 1600 CET.
Mr Farage opposes a federal Europe as to him a national democracy and EU membership are incompatible. He hit the headlines in February 2010 after claiming the newly inaugurated President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy had the "charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of low grade bank clerk". He was subsequently reprimanded after he refused to apologise to Mr Van Rompuy.
The leader of the UK Independence Party disagrees with the way EU is handling the crisis and wants to have the peoples of Europe to have more of a say. "We believe in nation state democracy, we want a Europe of trade, we want a Europe of co-operation, we want a Europe that is responsible," he said.
The 45-minute chat will start on Wednesday at 1600 CET.
