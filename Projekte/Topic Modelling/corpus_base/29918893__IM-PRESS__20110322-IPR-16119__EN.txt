Europe & Me, an online lifestyle magazine created by young Europeans for young Europeans has been chosen as the UK entry for this year's Charlemagne European Youth Prize. Its motto is to “make Europe personal”, because Europe is often only identified with politics and bureaucracy.
The magazine was founded in September 2007 and first published in July 2008. New issues appear every three months at www.europeandme.eu. In January 2011, the magazine launched a regularly updated blog, the 6th Sense, to complement its three month publishing cycle.
The founding team comprised eight people with six different nationalities, and writers and readers now come from twenty different countries. Within less than three years, the magazine has published eleven editions, reached a European audience of more than twenty thousand readers.
The Charlemagne European Youth Prize, organised on an annual basis by the European Parliament and the International Charlemagne Prize based in Aachen, Germany, provides recognition for cross-cultural projects which foster a sense of a European and international integration and understanding.
Europe & Me will now compete with the nominees from the EU's 26 other Member States for the overall Charlemagne European Youth Prize 2011. Funding of between €2,000 and €5,000 will be awarded to the winning projects a ceremony which will take place in Aachen in Germany on 31 May 2011.
