In adopting a resolution on soft fruits and cherries intended for processing, MEPs also want the Commission immediately to devise and implement measures restricting excessive imports of soft fruits from third countries, particularly those which apply dumping prices.
The House calls on the Commission to take immediate steps to initiate cooperation projects and training measures for the farmers concerned and support for improvements to the marketing infrastructure in order to create better opportunities for growers of soft fruits and cherries in the EU to make a living.
Parliament calls for soft fruits such as strawberries, currants, raspberries, gooseberries, sour cherries and sweet cherries to be included in processing aid systems similar to those currently applied in the case of tomatoes, pears, peaches and citrus fruit, with a view to stabilising the market in these products more effectively. The House draws attention to the fact that these products are of strategic importance in certain regions of the old Member States and to the new Member States, where they are of social, and not just economic, value as well as enhancing the landscape.
The House calls on the Commission, in the long term, to consider adopting qualified market access for soft fruits, which would make imports of products from third countries conditional on compliance with environmental and social standards in their production corresponding to those of the European Union. MEPs considers that, if such standards are not complied with, a levy should be imposed on the imports to protect European producers against dumping and that the revenue from this levy should be used to finance rural development projects in the exporting countries concerned.
Parliament wants the Commission to take vigorous action with a view to including products which are subject to low customs tariffs (as is the case with soft fruits) on the list of sensitive goods and bringing soft fruits under special safeguard clauses (SSGs) and the entry price arrangements. The resolution calls on the Commission to enter discussions with the Member States with a view to introducing financial support for projects to take old soft fruit and cherry plantations out of production in the event of prolonged supply surpluses.
MEPs call on the Commission to simplify the relevant provisions and the crisis support arrangements for soft fruit and cherry producers suffering losses as a result of adverse weather conditions. The House takes the view that such simplification should in particular seek to ensure that compensation for the impact of adverse weather conditions does not require prior approval by the Commission, which would significantly speed up payments to farmers. The House calls on the Commission to introduce compensation arrangements for producers as part of the reform of the CMO in fruit and vegetables, to cover situations in which crops of soft fruits and cherries are not brought to market as a result of unforeseen and temporary difficulties stemming from supply surpluses.
The House calls for the introduction of a labelling system to indicate the country of origin of agricultural products used for processed foods, and for such labelling to be required on the end product as well, making it possible for consumers to choose whether to purchase regional products.
Parliament wants appropriate funds to be allocated, in connection with regulations seeking to promote agricultural products, to increasing consumption of high-quality European soft fruits and soft-fruit products.
Finally, the House calls on the Polish Government to eliminate the fiscal disadvantages suffered by producer groups so as to encourage producers to form associations to sell their products and so that they can make optimal use of the EU's common-organisation-of the-market budget for fruit and vegetables.
