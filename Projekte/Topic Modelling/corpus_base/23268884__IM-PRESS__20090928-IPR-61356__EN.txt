A draft EU-Guinea fisheries partnership agreement was rejected by a small majority in the Fisheries Committee on Thursday, after the Guinean government's use of force led to the deaths of over 100 civilians in Conakry on Monday. The deal would provide €450,000 a year in EU funding to develop Guinea's fisheries sector, and allow EU boats to fish in Guinean waters.
After a heated debate on whether to postpone the vote, MEPs rejected the deal with 11 votes against and 9 in favour. Their draft legislative resolution would have endorsed a new four-year agreement with Guinea, to pursue co-operation in place since 1983.
The draft agreement provides for EU funding of €450,000 per year to support the development of Guinea's fisheries sector. This could be supplemented by a further €300,000 per year if further fishing opportunities were granted. An additional €1.6 million would be available over the four years to strengthen the monitoring, control and surveillance system in Guinea's fishing zones.
On Wednesday, the Bureau of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly strongly condemned the use of force by the Guinean government to disperse the demonstrations that took place in Conakry, Guinea, on Monday, 28 September 2009, which led to the deaths of over one hundred civilians.
