Connie Hedegaard (top) sets out her Climate vision whilst Dacian Cioloş (Agriculture and Rural Development) called himself a reformer. The key Commission jobs of Agriculture and Climate were under the spotlight Friday 15 January as MEPs grilled Romanian Dacian Cioloş and Dane Connie Hedegaard on their abilities. Members from all parties in the Parliament probed the likely direction both candidates would push their departments in the coming years. Mr Cioloş called himself a reformer and Ms Hedegaard stressed the need for EU members to implement existing EU environmental legislation.
Dacian Cioloş: "European consumers expect safe and healthy food"
"European farmers want stability and predictability, European consumers expect safe and healthy food and European taxpayers need assurances that their money is spent in an efficient and transparent way", said Mr. Cioloş. He said that the main priority of his mandate was "to define the perspective of CAP after 2013". He also called himself a "reformer" stressing the need to reform the EU's Common Agricultural Policy.
Asked about measures to be implemented to improve competitiveness in the next three years Mr. Cioloş listed investment to help farmers adapt to new challenges, balancing out the use of direct payments and using international negotiations to help farmers to better use opportunities on the world market.
He also said that "direct payments should ensure a minimum level of farmers' income" and that the reform should re-balance the way aid is distributed among regions, farmers and Member States. The role of Commissioner for Agriculture is a highly sensitive one as the portfolio covers the lion's share of the EU's Budget.
Hedegaard: "climate must be mainstreamed into all relevant policy areas"
Despite hard questions about the lack of success during the climate change summit in Copenhagen in which she initially Chaired, Danish Connie Hedegaard delivered a balanced presentation of her Climate Action portfolio to MEPs Friday.
On the aftermath of the Copenhagen conference she said: "You can talk much about what went wrong in Copenhagen. But you cannot blame the EU or the Danes for the fact that a number of countries decided not deliver". She went on to say that it's vital that the U.S., China, India, Brazil and Russia, in line with the EU, acknowledged that they have responsibility."
Ms Hedegaard stressed that the EU had played a "tremendously important role" in paving the way for changes in the way we view climate changes. She told MEPs that much of the climate legislation needed in the EU is already in place and "must now be implemented properly", she said, adding the need to mainstream climate into all relevant policy areas.
