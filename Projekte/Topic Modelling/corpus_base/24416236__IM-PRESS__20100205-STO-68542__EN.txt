Parliament approves new European Commission The election of the European Commission by 488 in favour to 137 opposed and 72 abstentions brings to an end almost 5 months of delay due to wrangles in the ratification of the Lisbon treaty. Commissioners propose EU legislation on everything from trade and transport and there was a sense of relief in Strasbourg after the vote Tuesday (10 February). MEPs can only vote to elect the Commission en masse rather than individually so problems with the first Bulgarian candidate delayed matters.
A vital part of the process is the job interviews that the 27 candidates must go through in front of MEPs if they are to win approval. Some sailed through, some struggled.
The January hearings passed a few numerical milestones along the way:
3,300: Pages of translations
165: Accreditations granted to TV news crews to film the hearings.
2,000: Estimated articles were published in Europe's press during the hearings process.
300: Of which were about Bulgaria
81: Hours of hearings, with around 1,750 questions.
60: People a day filming the hearings (cameramen, producers, editorsâ€¦)
27: Candidates (including the 2 Bulgarians) Commission President Barroso was already elected.
1: Withdrawal - Rumiana Jeleva after political opposition.
