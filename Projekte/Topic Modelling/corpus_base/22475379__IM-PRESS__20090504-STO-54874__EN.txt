MEPs debated extending energy labelling to industrial products Tuesday morning ©Belga Any advertisement promoting technical specifications of fridges, washing machines or ovens should indicate the product's energy consumption, said the European Parliament as it amended the Energy Labelling Directive. A product's energy classification should only be valid for 3 to 5 years and the classification thresholds should be regularly updated, add MEPs. The legislative report was adopted by 566 votes in favour, with 28 votes against and 39 abstentions.
The energy label helps consumers to assess the running costs when buying new household appliances such as fridges, freezers, washing machines, driers, dishwashers, or ovens. Manufacturers are obliged to indicate the energy consumption irrespective of whether the product performs well (green “A” class) or poorly (red “G” class) on this measure.
Tax breaks to encourage efficiency
MEPs on Parliament's Industry Committee have already backed the intended changes. In particular MEPs support new rules saying that adverts for products must contain information about their energy efficiency .
On top of this they want tax credits for consumers using highly energy-efficient products and for industries that promote and produce such products. They are also in favour of reduced value added tax on materials and components that improve energy efficiency
In addition Members want public authorities to take a lead and use their procurement procedures to always select energy efficient products if the contract is for at least €15,000.
