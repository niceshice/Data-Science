Almost 4 million Europeans consume cannabis almost daily ©BELGA 4 million Europeans consume cannabis almost daily 4 million European adults used cocaine last year The drug problem in Europe is becoming more complex, Civil Rights MEPs were told Monday 15 November by the European Drug Monitoring Agency's Director Wolfgang Götz. The Lisbon-based Agency's annual report points out that levels of drug users are constant but changes in supply and use and the emergence of new drugs challenges Europe's drug control model. Cannabis remains the most popular illicit drug, followed by cocaine.
According to the annual report almost 4 million Europeans consume cannabis almost daily making it the most popular drug. A total of 23 million Europeans used cannabis last year. A connected problem linked to widespread domestic production (not a pot on the window sill but larger scale growing) is organised crime.
Cocaine is gaining in popularity according to the report, 4 million European adults used it last year - the increased appetite for cocaine has led to growing health concerns. Annually 1 000 cocaine-related deaths are reported in Europe.
Mr. Wolfgang Götz, Director of The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) said more attention should be paid to the danger of driving and drugs, and pointed to the effect of the economic crisis. "If cuts are unavoidable think of the cost effectiveness of certain measures."
A record number of new drugs were reported in 2009. The innovative and fast-moving market puts drug control models to a test. MEPs raised questions on "smart drugs" - a group of medicines used to treat neurological conditions such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Alzheimer's disease, and sleep disorders like narcolepsy, used illegally.
The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) was established in 1993. Inaugurated in Lisbon in 1995, it is one of the EU’s decentralised agencies.
The EMCDDA exists to provide the EU and its Member States with a factual overview of European drug problems and a solid evidence base to support the drugs debate.
