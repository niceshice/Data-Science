EP President Jerzy Buzek has expressed his condolences to the family of Andrei Kulagin, the Russian human rights activist who is now known to have been murdered. Mr Buzek called on the Russian authorities to carry out an "impartial and credible" investigation of the crime.
Jerzy Buzek, made the following statement after he learned about the tragic death of Andrei Kulagin:
"With great sadness I have learned of the tragic death of Andrei Kulagin. He is unfortunately the second Russian human rights activist about whose death we have been informed over the last week. The first victim was Natalia Estemirova.
Andrei Kulagin was involved with the human rights organisation 'Justice' (Spraviedlivost), which he led in the north-western part of Russia in Karelia. He was known for his active engagement in the field of better treatment for inmates in Russian prisons.
On behalf of the European Parliament I would like to express my deep condolences to the family and friends of Andrei Kulagin and insist upon an impartial and credible investigation conducted by the Russian authorities. People responsible for his murder need to face justice. The international community can not allow this case to add to the long list of unsolved murders of human rights activists in Russia".
