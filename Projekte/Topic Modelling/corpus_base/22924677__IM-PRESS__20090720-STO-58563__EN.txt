EuroparlTV on the election of new Chairpersons of Committees The Parliament's 22 committees are where key pieces of European laws are modified and take shape ahead of them being debated by the full Chamber. The vital role played in such committees by the Chair and Vice-chairs underlies the jockeying for position that takes place where they are elected every two and a half years - a process that has been taking place over the last few days. This video looks at the latest developments since the June elections.
As well as 20 permanent committees on everything from Fisheries to Foreign Affairs, the Parliament also has two sub-committees. Generally, the leadership of all of these is divided according to the political strength of each group. This video looks at the latest developments.
