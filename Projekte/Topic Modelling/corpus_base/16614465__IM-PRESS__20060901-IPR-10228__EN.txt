Regretting the suspension sine die of the Doha Round negotiations in July 2006, the European Parliament reiterates in a resolution adopted today its full commitment to the multilateral approach to trade policy and suggests institutional reforms of the WTO to increase accountability.
The EP is concerned that a failure of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) could lead to the collapse of the present multilateral trading system and stresses that a shift to bilateral/regional agreements would lead to unequal and less transparent negotiations, often putting the poorer countries at a disadvantage.
The EP therefore urges a strong commitment of all major players, including the EU, the US and the G-20, to come to a balanced agreement on each of the Roundâ€™s main negotiation topics, putting development at the heart of the conclusions and further evaluating the outcome in order to ensure that the DDA ultimately results in meaningful and sustainable economic gains, particularly for the developing countries. Parliament stresses that, in order fully to implement the Doha mandate, the positive achievements of the negotiations must be preserved and offers made to date on various elements of the negotiating agenda should form the basis of the negotiations.
The EP underlines the need for institutional reforms of the WTO enhancing the accountability and democratic legitimacy of the negotiations and organisation. MEPs are convinced that the multilateral process based on the bottom-up and transparent approach should be at the core of the negotiations. MEPs also stress at the same time the need for an inclusive process involving all members.
