The EU's economic recovery plan cannot work unless EU Member States put in fresh funds, said Budgets Committee MEPs on Monday evening.
"The recovery plan is a new plan and therefore it cannot be financed within the (old) multi-annual financial framework. The plan is impossible to manage without fresh money" said rapporteur Mr Lászlo Súrján after the committee's vote on the 2010 budget.
In three unanimous amendments, the committee called on the Council to include €1.5 billion in payments and €1.98 billion in commitments in the 2010 budget, to fund the economic recovery plan. Under payments, this means: €800 million for energy networks, €250 million for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and €450 million for the European offshore wind grid system.
This increase would be possible under articles 21 to 23 of the inter-institutional agreement (which allow budget ceilings to be raised). Having dealt with over 1,200 amendments in four days of meetings, the committee will now finalize preparations for the first-reading plenary vote on Thursday 22 October, where the reports will be adopted.
"Our main message to the Council is that the budget of the European Union can help a lot to manage the economic crisis, but only under certain conditions: we should have enough money and the Member States should be more active in spending the available money", Mr Súrján said.
The rapporteur also urged those using EU funds to prove that they are achieving the stated aims: "We want to see results. If a programme is said to improve the economy in a certain region, we also want to see that the economy in fact improves."
The full house is scheduled to vote on the 2010 budget in Strasbourg, on Thursday 22 October, preceded by a debate on Tuesday 20 October. 2009-10-05 Committee on Budgets In the chair Alain LAMASSOURE EPP FR
