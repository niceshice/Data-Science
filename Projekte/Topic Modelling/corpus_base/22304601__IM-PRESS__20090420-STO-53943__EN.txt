MEPs adopted a new legal framework for a European market in electricity, voted tougher laws to combat the trade in illegally logged timber and cut mobile phone roaming charges further. Transport policy and passenger rights dominated the afternoon's debates. Extending music copyright was on the evening's agenda.
Wednesday morning was devoted to a comprehensive debate on lessons and follow-up measures in response to the financial crisis.
One of MEPs guiding the legislation through Parliament, Romanian Liberal Renate Weber said, the reports "are not meant to solve the financial crisis, but we hope they will help us avoid making the same mistakes in future, and hopefully they will support a relaunch of the European economy".
MEPs approved new laws to reform the financial supervision and capital requirements of the insurance industry. Check out more on British Labour Member Peter Skinner's report on the issue below.
Members also discussed new rules for rating agencies , which assess the stability and credibility of companies and investments. Their methods have been much criticised recently and are seen by some as having failed in the build up of the financial crisis – read our interview with the draftsman Jean-Paul Gauzès.
Another report focused on legal obligations for documentation and reporting in company mergers .
Energy markets set to open further
MEPs endorsed a compromise on the so called 3rd energy market package. It aims to promote further opening of still largely national gas and electricity markets, fairer conditions for competitors of energy giants and improved consumer rights vis-à-vis gas and electricity suppliers.
The plenary also adopted new caps for mobile phone roaming charges from July 2009 and tougher rules to combat the import and trade of illegally logged timber.
In a debate on the 2007 expenditure of the Council of ministers, MEPs lambasted the body representing the Member States for apparently trying to escape parliamentary scrutiny and not to face the MEPs and their requests for information regarding the use of the Council’s budget.
MEPs broadly supported proposed legislation, guided through Parliament by Italian Member Gabriele Albertini (EPP-ED), to give bus and coach passengers rights similar to those of air traffic passengers, especially in case of delays or cancellations. French Socialist MEP Michel Teychenné also drafted a report on the rights of sea passengers.
In the evening Irish MEP Brian Crowley (UEN) presented the position of the legal affairs committee on the proposal to extend the copyright for music recordings to 95 years, during which time artists will receive royalties for their work. Parliament will vote on Thursday on whether to back the committee’s position, or opt for a different period of copyright protection.
