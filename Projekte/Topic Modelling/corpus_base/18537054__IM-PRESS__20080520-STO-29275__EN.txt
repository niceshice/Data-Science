The cost of pollution in Western France 2008. MEPs want tougher penalties
A one minute silence for a Spanish Civil Guard officer killed in a recent ETA bomb attack opened the May session of the European Parliament. First up Monday was punishment for polluters, notably criminal sanctions - up to and including imprisonment - for environmental lawbreakers. In the evening Members debated a consumer strategy for Europe and ways that e-shopping can be made safer - a move that could benefit small businesses.
Calling for a minute's silence for the murdered Guardia Civil officer, the victim of the ETA car bomb attack at the police barracks of Legutiano (Alava) in northern Spain last Wednesday, Parliament's President Hans-Gert PÃ¶ttering said "parliament condemns the disgraceful act in its most determined terms. On behalf of the EP I would like to express our solidarity with the people of Spain."
Polluter pays principle getting tougher
The possible introduction of EU wide criminal sanctions for polluters seriously damaging the environment was the first item tackled by MEPs. Under the proposed measures, polluters could face hefty financial sanctions or jail if they commit deliberate or negligent acts that cause injury to people, air, soil, water, plants or animals.
Parliament's rapporteur, German Christian Democrat Hartmut Nassauer, said in future offences against the environment should be punished in the name of the EU, noting that this is a far-reaching and remarkable step, as the Union does not have such powers under existing criminal law. A vote on the report will take place on Wednesday.
Online retail - more security will help small business, says report
According to the report on EU consumer strategy (2007-2013), by Finnish Socialist Lasse Lehtinen, one of the greatest obstacles to a fully operational internal market in retailing is lack of consumer confidence when shopping outside their home country or on the Internet. It calls for measures to make citizens feel equally safe when shopping via the internet or at the local corner shop in any EU Member State.
The report suggests simple rules to make life simpler for small and medium-sized enterprises. It also wants strong, independent consumer organisations to be the basis of a consumer policy. Another of its proposals is for the establishment of a special European Consumer Ombudsman in the European Ombudsman's office. The report also underlines the need for adequate funding for such organisations by the Commission and EU countries.
Speaking in the debate, Mr Lehtinen said, "this continent will not be able to compete in the global market if the constituent countries are not able to compete among themselves in the internal market".
