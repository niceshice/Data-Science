She argued for the EU to maintain momentum ahead of the next climate conference in Mexico at the end of the year and push for a legally binding deal.
The Commissioner was quizzed by the MEPs on the content and the aims of the European Commission's latest communication on climate change talks titled "International Climate Change policy post-Copenhagen - reinvigorating the international negotiations through immediate action". The communication was published on 9 March.
Managing expectations
Speaking in the debate Ms Hedegaard told the House that a final agreement may be delayed despite the EU being ready. She said that it was very important that expectations for Cancun are managed carefully, as failure may give a boost to those arguing that no deal is necessary.
Ms Hedegaard, a former climate Minister of Denmark said that we need tangible deliverables in Cancun, we must put pressure on US and China and must focus on content not form.
For the Parliament's largest bloc, the centre right European People's Party, Richard Seeber said "there is a confidence crisis in Europe as far as causes for climate change are concerned…you will know that there are polls saying that only 30 percent of European citizens believe that CO2 has an impact on climate".
Another Doha disappointment?
Speaking on behalf of the Socialists and Democrats group Jo Leinen said "we have to find a mechanism that would allow the exchange of information and positions on climate change issues, as both the European Parliament and Commission have wide-ranging contacts and meetings in this area. I am afraid that the climate talks will turn out as Doha trade talks, the final agreement delayed year after year."
For the Liberal ALDE bloc Chris Davies said that in climate change talks the EU is dependent on the goodwill of other parties and cannot sign a deal by itself, "you will need all the friends you can get". For the Green group in the Parliament Satu Hassi (Greens/EFA) said the EU must move beyond its 20% reduction by 2020 goal and aim for 30 percent reduction at least.
Finally for the European Conservatives and Reformists Martin Callanan said that in the absence of a deal, unilateral emissions reductions could harm the competitiveness of European economy.
