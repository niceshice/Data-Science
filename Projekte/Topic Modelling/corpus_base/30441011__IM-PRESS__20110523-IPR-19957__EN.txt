Sweden's nomination of H.G. Wessberg to join the European Court of Auditors was endorsed by Parliament's Budgetary Control Committee on Tuesday. Mr Wessberg would replace Lars Heikensten, who stood down after serving on the Court since 2006. Mr Wessberg's candidacy now goes to the full Parliament for a final vote on 7 June.
In preparation for the committee hearing, Mr Wessberg replied to a written questionnaire, which is included in the draft report on his nomination by Inés Ayala Sender (S&D, ES). He gave the committee a five-minute presentation, after which he replied to MEPs' questions. Mr Wessberg's appointment was supported by 11 committee members, while 3 voted against and 8 abstained.
Although it is the Council of Ministers that formally decides on the appointments, it has become standard practice for the Council to consult Parliament on appointments to the Court.
