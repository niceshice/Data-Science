This week the Parliament's website takes a look at how many male and female MEPs there are and how it compares to other legislatures. This comes ahead of international women's day which is being celebrated on Friday. To mark the occasion we ask a number of Members to explain what makes the day special for them.
On Thursday we report on a workshop which takes place this week in Parliament with MEPs and environment experts looking at biofuels. As Europe looks for alternatives to fossil fuels we look at biofuels and ask MEPs whether it really is the green alternative many believe.
The week online you can also read MEPs' reactions to the results of Presidential elections in Russia and find out more about a report on a conference on globalisation and employment. This week we will also be reporting on the reform of Europe's Common Agriculture Policy and improvements in car safety.
