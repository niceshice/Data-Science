"Transform priorities and time-lines into reform plans," the Foreign Affairs Committee urged Turkey, in its latest progress report adopted on Monday evening. The committee welcomed several recent legislative activities of Turkey, while insisting that the speed of reforms must pick up.
The report, drawn up by Ria Oomen-Ruijten (EPP-ED, NL), "welcomes the commitment of Prime Minister Erdogan that 2008 is going to be the year of reforms" and "urges the Turkish government to fulfil its promises" by implementing them. While the committee stresses that "modernisation is first and foremost in Turkey's own interest," it also notes that "further delays will seriously affect the pace of negotiations."
The role of the judiciary and the military in modern Turkey
The committee is "concerned about the implications of the AK Party closure case," and "expects the Turkish Constitutional Court to respect principles of the rule of law, European standards and the Venice Commission guidelines on the prohibition of political parties." The report also "considers the amendment on Article 301 of the Penal Code sent by the government to the parliament as merely a first step towards a fundamental reform of this article as well as other articles" and "urges the government and the parliament to carry out this reform without delay so that none of these articles can be used for arbitrary restriction of freedom of expression."
The report "welcomes the fact that in 2007 democracy prevailed over attempts by the military to interfere in the political process," and encourages the government to "make further systematic efforts to ensure that the democratically elected political leadership bears full responsibility for formulation of domestic, foreign and security policy" and that "the armed forces fully respect this responsibility by fully and unambiguously acknowledging civilian control."
The Kurdish question
The report urges the Turkish government to launch "a political initiative favouring a lasting settlement of the Kurdish issue," including a "comprehensive master plan to boost the socio-economic and cultural development of the south-east of Turkey." It also calls for "'real possibilities to learn Kurdish within the public and private schooling system" and its use in broadcasting, public life and public services. While considering that a possible ban of the DTP would be "counterproductive to a political solution," and deploring the "many court cases brought against elected mayors and other politicians for using the Kurdish language," as well as the recent conviction of Leyla Zana, the report "calls upon the DTP party, its members of parliament and mayors to distance themselves clearly from the PKK," and calls on the PKK to declare and respect an immediate ceasefire.
Gender issues
In light of the drafting of a new constitution, the committee stresses that it should "ensure gender equality, avoid the use of vague criteria such as general morality, refrain from perceiving women primarily as family or community members and reaffirm women's human rights." It also notes "the disappointment and concern of part of the population that the lifting of the ban on wearing headscarves in universities was not part of a broader package of reform based on a wide ranging consultation of civil society."
