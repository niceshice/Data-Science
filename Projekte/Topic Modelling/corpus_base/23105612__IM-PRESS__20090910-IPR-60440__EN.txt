The three contending films for the 2009 LUX Prize were revealed today at the 66th International Film Festival in Venice: "Eastern Plays" by director Kamen Kalev (Bulgaria, Sweden); "Sturm" by director Hans-Christian Schmid (Germany, Denmark, Netherlands) and "Welcome" by Philippe Lioret (France).
The LUX Prize winner will receive European Parliament funding to subtitle the film in the EU's 23 official languages and adapt the original version for visually or hearing-impaired people.
Since 2007, the European Parliament has supported the European film industry by awarding the prize annually to a film that makes a new and unique contribution to public debate on the EU and underlines the issues that divide us or bring us closer together.
You will find further information about the selected films as well as the LUX Prize in the accompanying press pack.
