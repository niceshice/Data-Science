Charlemagne Youth Prize 2008- EN The UK national winner of the Charlemagne Youth Prize for 2009 is the Talita Kum project, entered by Lewis Ross from Inverness. The other team members are Phi Macdonald, Mhairi McGowan, Kayleigh Berg, Daniel McWilliams, Fraser Kane and Sarah-Jane Savage - all from Millburn Academy.
This project, which has been going for six years, involves taking a group of senior school pupil volunteers from Millburn Academy in Inverness to the Jimbolia region of Romania. The object is to take children from some of the poorest families in Jimbolia for a two weeks summer holiday in a project organised with assistance from Romanian organisations and citizens. The camp offers a rare opportunity for the Romanian children to escape often difficult circumstances and to engage in entertainment and education, with the aim of helping them to reach their full potential.
The volunteers are responsible for raising the necessary funds, partly by organising events that themselves contribute to educating Scottish people about Romania.
The UK national winners now go forward to the European level. The Charlemagne Youth Prize for 2009 will be awarded in Aachen on 19 May.
The Charlemagne Youth Prize is for people aged between 16 and 30 who have been involved with projects helping to promote understanding between different European countries. Judges were looking for projects that would serve as role models for young people living in Europe. They wanted to see practical examples of Europeans living together, whether through the organisation of youth events, youth exchanges or internet projects with a European dimension.
´´The European Charlemagne Youth Prize´´ is awarded jointly and annually by the European Parliament and the Foundation of the International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen.
