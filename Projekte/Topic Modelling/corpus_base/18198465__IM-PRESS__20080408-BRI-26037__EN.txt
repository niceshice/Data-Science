The written declaration was put forward by Lidia Joanna GERINGER DE OEDENBERG (PES, PL) and currently 427 (out of 785) have signed it.
The declaration calls on the Commission to put forward a legislative proposal requiring public-service television broadcasters in the EU to subtitle all of their programmes.
MEPs consider subtitling of all public-service television programmes in the EU to be essential with a view to ensuring that all viewers, including deaf and hard-of-hearing persons, have full access to them; takes the view that this would also help with foreign-language learning.
MEPs point out that partial or complete loss of hearing is a condition that affects more than 83 million people in the European Union and given the ageing of the European population, this problem will continue to grow.
The declaration points out that universal access to television in Europe and to the fact that public-service television has a public-service mission consisting of, among other things, informing and educating viewers,
Finally, MEP recall that today's technology enables television programmes (including live programmes) to be subtitled as they go out, one example of this being the BBC, which has undertaken to subtitle all of its programmes from April 2008.
Written declaration on the murder of the human rights activist Munir Said Thalib adopted
The written declaration was put forward by Raül ROMEVA I RUEDA (Greens/EFA, ES), Eija-Riitta KORHOLA (EPP-ED, FI), Jules MAATEN (ALDE, NL), Glyn FORD (PES, UK) and Ana Maria GOMES (PSE, PT) and so far 412 out of 785 MEPs have signed it.
EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering announced the adoption of a written declaration on the murder of the human rights activist Munir Said Thalib given over half of all MEPs have signed it. The declaration calls on the Indonesian authorities to take all necessary action to ensure that those responsible for the murder at all levels are brought to trial and justice is delivered as quickly as possible.
In September 2004 leading Indonesian human rights activist Munir Said Thalib, founder of human rights organisations, died from arsenic poisoning on Garuda flight GA974 from Singapore to Amsterdam. The report by an independent fact-finding team into the Munir case, ordered by the Indonesian President, has never been made public. The only person to have been prosecuted in connection with the case, former Garuda co-pilot Pollycarpus Budihari Priyanto, had his conviction overturned by the Indonesian Supreme Court in October 2006.
The written declaration calls on the Commission and the Council to monitor the investigation into the murder of Munir, including the ongoing trials of former Garuda executives Indra Setiawan and Rohainil Aini, as well as the case review of the Supreme Court’s decision in the Pollycarpus case.

2008-04-15 - 15:37
The House voted in favour of approving the new Cypriot Commissioner Androula Vassiliou for Public Health, Food Safety, Animal Health and Welfare, with 446 votes in favour 7 against and 29 abstentions.

Now appointed, Ms Vassiliou will be in office at least until the appointment of a new Commission after the June 2009 European Parliament elections. The new Commissioner will take part in the debate later on combating cancer in the enlarged European Union.
During an earlier hearing in front of MEPs on 1 April, Ms Vassiliou said: "Health is wealth and I am determined to work hard towards ensuring high standards for our citizens, be they in Romania, Sweden, the UK or Cyprus."

Cancer: MEPs call for EU cancer task force to be set up
2008-04-15 - 15:37
The collection of data, the exchange of best practices, better information of citizens, information campaigns on cancer screening, the promotion of healthy lifestyles, the encouragement of research and innovation and the availability of cancer medicines are some of the recommendations of the European Parliament in a resolution on combating cancer in an enlarged European Union, adopted by MEPs with 621 votes in favour, 10 against and 6 abstentions. MEPs support the Slovenian Presidency, which has made cancer one of its priorities 2008 (and calls on all future presidencies to continue to make cancer a priority). They underline that according to estimates one in three Europeans is diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime and one in four Europeans dies from the disease. The WTO estimates that at least one third of all cancers are preventable and that prevention offers the most cost-effective long-term strategy for the control of cancer.
Call for a EU Cancer Task Force
The House calls on the Commission to set up an interinstitutional EU Cancer Task Force to collect and exchange best practice for prevention, screening and treatment and to provide leadership for improved cancer control in Europe. The EU Cancer Task Force should in particular promote new measures as well as existing screening projects to help to increase the part of the population taking part in screening measures by at least 50 % in each of the MS by 2018. Furthermore, Initiatives aiming to prevent cancer through the promotion of healthy lifestyles shall be promoted, putting a strong emphasis on children and adolescents.
Better information on screening and cancer treatment are needed
MEPs underline the importance to promote information campaigns on cancer screening and the exchange of best practice on the use of preventive measures. The Council recommendation on cancer screening has to be promoted and implemented effectively. The Commission should increase the information available to patients with cancer by encouraging initiatives which inform patients of their treatment and the ways to access such treatment.
Support for more research and innovation
The Commission should ensure that community legislation contains incentives for industries and researchers to secure ongoing research and guarantee new evidence-based medicines and treatments to combat and control cancer. Funds within FP7 shall be allocated to encourage research and innovation in the area of primary prevention screening and early detection and of new anti-cancer treatments and medicines.
Charter of Patients rights / Charter for protection of cancer patients in the work place
MEPs encourage Member States to adopt national Charters of Patients rights according to European guidelines. Furthermore they call on the Commission to draw up a charter for the protection of cancer patients and chronically sick people in the workplace.

Animal health requirements: UK and Ireland to get extension for pet passport rules
2008-04-15 - 15:37
Parliament adopted a report on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals as regards the extension of the transitional period. It extends the transitional period to 30 June 2010 (rather than 31 August 2009) for the entry of the pet animals listed into the territory of Ireland, Malta, Sweden and the United Kingdom, which will thereafter be subject to certain requirements. The Regulation introduced, inter alia, the pet passport for cats, dogs and ferrets when being moved from one Member State to another, which provides proof that the animal has been vaccinated against rabies. This is the sole requirement for pets to travel to all Member States.
Until 30 June 2010, Finland, Ireland, Malta, Sweden and the United Kingdom, as regards echinococcosis, and Ireland Malta and the United Kingdom, as regards ticks, may make the entry of pet animals into their territory subject to compliance with the special rules in place on the date on which this Regulation comes into force. This amendment aims at completing the list of countries applying already special requirements concerning ticks with Malta. By mistake in the Commission proposal the name of Malta had not been mentioned amongst those Member States having already a special regime in place regarding anti-tick treatment.
The House states that the proposed extension of the transitional period may not be sufficiently long to obtain agreement on a successor regime and a longer one is more appropriate given there is still no proposal on the table and the European Parliament will be dissolved for elections in 2009.
The third amendment replaces the date 1 January 2008 by the date 1 July 2010 for the same reason. Text of the resolution as adopted will appear here (click on 10 April)

Tibet: MEPs urge joint EU stance on Olympic Games opening ceremony
2008-04-15 - 15:37
In a resolution on Tibet following on from its debate of 26 March, Parliament condemned the repression by the Chinese security forces, demanded an independent inquiry under UN auspices and called for a common European stance regarding attendance by EU leaders at the Olympic Games opening ceremony in August. The resolution was adopted by 580 votes to 24 with 45 abstentions. Violence condemned, inquiry demanded
The resolution "firmly condemns the brutal repression by the Chinese security forces against Tibetan demonstrators and all acts of violence from whichever source". It calls on the Chinese Government "to guarantee adequate medical care for injured Tibetans and legal assistance for arrested Tibetans". It calls for "the immediate release of all those who protested peacefully, exercising their legitimate right to freedom of expression". And it demands "an open and independent inquiry into the recent riots and repression in Tibet under the auspices of the UN".
EU action? Parliament calls for united front
The key question is what action the EU should take. Here Parliament "calls on the EU Presidency-in-Office to strive to find a common EU position with regard to the attendance of the Heads of Government and of State and the EU High Representative at the Olympic Games opening ceremony, with the option of non-attendance in the event that there is no resumption of dialogue between the Chinese authorities and HH the Dalai Lama". In addition, the EP reiterates its call for the Council to appoint a special envoy for Tibetan issues to facilitate dialogue between the two sides.
China's promises on human rights
More broadly, the EP "criticises the often discriminatory treatment of non-Han Chinese ethnic minorities". It "calls on China to honour its commitments to human and minority rights and the rule of law" and, in particular, urges China "to respect its own public commitments to human rights and minority rights, democracy and the rule of law announced during the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decision to allow China to organise the Games".
Dissidents, media
China is urged "not to misuse the 2008 Olympic Games by arresting dissidents, journalists and human rights activists in order to prevent demonstrations and reports which the authorities view as embarrassing to them". Indeed, MEPs call on China "to open up Tibet to the foreign media and diplomats, in particular EU representatives" and "to immediately stop censoring and blocking news and information websites based abroad" as well as to release "all journalists, internet users and cyber-dissidents detained in China for exercising their right to information". Parliament also calls for the release of Hu Jia, a prominent human rights activist sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison on subversion charges.
Support for Dalai Lama's position: autonomy, not independence, for Tibet
Parliament welcomes the fact that "the Dalai Lama has called on the Tibetan people to protest non-violently and has rejected calls for Tibetan independence and instead proposed the middle way of genuine cultural and political autonomy, and religious freedom". The EP stresses its own support for "China's territorial integrity". It also endorses "the Dalai Lama's statement that the Olympic Games are a great opportunity for freedom for all the Chinese people". It regrets that talks between the Chinese authorities and the Dalai Lama have failed to achieve results and calls for "a constructive dialogue to be opened without preconditions with a view to reaching a comprehensive political agreement".
Plenary debate
In Parliament's debate on Tibet on 26 March, which paved the way for today's resolution, EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering said: "Every responsible politician must ask the question, whether he can take part in the opening ceremony if the Chinese leadership does not seek dialogue and compromise".
He also said: "We express our solidarity with the Dalai Lama" and "we cannot allow him to be linked to terrorism or demonised" and he called on the Beijing authorities "to negotiate with the Dalai Lama and, while respecting the territorial integrity of China, to reach an understanding that respects and guarantees the cultural and religious identity of the Tibetan people".

Croatia: progress towards EU
2008-04-15 - 15:37
The European Parliament stresses the need for Croatia to resolve outstanding bilateral border issues in a report adopted by MEPs with 588 votes in favour 39 against and 22 abstentions. The report on Croatia “congratulates the Croatian authorities on the positive results achieved so far, particularly with regard to the number of negotiation chapters which have been opened. ” It urges the government to “redouble its efforts to meet the benchmarks for the remaining chapters,” while also reminding the authorities that “it is now crucial to speed up the development of administrative capacity required in order to implement the new legislation.” MEPs commend Croatia for its “exemplary Constitutional Law on National Minorities.”
MEPs also address the Commission, calling on it to “step up its efforts and increase the resources allocated for preparing, processing and finalising negotiating material so that the EU can respond rapidly and efficiently to progress made by Croatia in meeting the relevant opening and closing benchmarks.” The House expressed its hopes that “increased efforts on the part of Croatia and enhanced support by the EU institutions can still lead to the finalization of an accession treaty in time for the European Parliament to take its final decision on the EU-membership of Croatia before the next European elections in June 2009, so as to start the ratification process as early as possible.”
Remaining concerns for Croatia
Members express their concerns about the further need to improve the judiciary in the country, as well as efforts to eradicate the “in some cases unacceptably high level of corruption, which undermines the economic development of the country.” While welcoming the fact that “Croatia continues to fully cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY),”, they called on Croatia to involve media and civil society in maintaining popular support for the court after the negative impact on public opinion of some of its rulings.
Another concern remains the country’s outstanding border issues with its neighbours, especially Slovenia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. In a similar vein, the European Parliament “shares with the Commission the view that, with increased efforts on the part of Croatia and continuous support by the EU institutions, accession negotiations should in any case be concluded in 2009.” At the same time, MEPs state that the accession negotiations “should not be used as a leverage to settle bilateral political disputes falling outside the scope of the acquis.”
MEPs welcome the decision of 13 March 2008 by the Croatian Parliament not to apply the Ecological and Fishing Protection Zone to EU Member States until a common agreement in the EU spirit is reached; is confident that, this issue having been finally resolved, decisions on the opening of new chapters can be rapidly taken.

Parliament adopts written declaration on ending street homelessness
2008-04-15 - 15:37
Parliament adopted a written declaration calling on the Council to agree on an EU-wide commitment to end street homelessness by 2015. The declaration calls on the Commission to develop a European framework definition of homelessness, gather comparable and reliable statistical data, and provide annual updates on action taken and progress made in EU Member States towards ending homelessness. MEPs urge Member States to devise ‘winter emergency plans’ as part of a wider homelessness strategy in the written declaration initially put forward by Mary Lou McDonald, Jacek Protasiewicz, Claude Moraes, Gérard Onesta, Jean Marie Beaupuy and signed by 405 MEPs so far. In order for a written declaration to be adopted it must be signed by more than half of all MEPs (393 out of 785)
Parliament points out that homelessness was identified as a priority by the EPSCO Council in 2005, and is a priority under the 'active inclusion' strand of the EU social protection and inclusion strategy. MEPs says access to adequate housing is a fundamental human right and access to shelter often the first step towards adequate and sustainable housing solutions for people experiencing extreme poverty and exclusion.
Every winter people freeze to death across the EU because of lack of emergency accommodation and outreach services catering for their needs. Street homelessness, says the written declaration, is the most visible form of homelessness, which can only be addressed effectively as part of a wider holistic strategy.

MEPs call for study on the economics of adapting to climate change
2008-04-15 - 15:37
Parliament adopted a resolution calling on the Commission to carry out "a study on the economics of adaptation", including a balance sheet of costs and benefits. It also asks the Commission "to consider including financial measures for adaptation in the next long term financial perspectives for regional policies and structural funds." The resolution was adopted with 516 votes in favour and 47 against. Development aid and technology transfer
The European Parliament regrets that the Commission's Green Paper "does not sufficiently address the need for co-operation on adaptation between the EU and developing countries; highlights in particular the need for technology transfer and capacity building"
The EU, MEPs argue, "has to undertake substantial efforts to increase technological development in adaptation" and to ensure the transfer of such technologies to the developing world. The Conference of the Parties in Poznan (COP 14) in December 2008, MEPs demand, should focus on this issue.
The resolution recognises "a conditional link" between development goals and mitigation and adaptation. "Climate change", it says, "must be mainstreamed into all EU development co-operation".
Water
The House says "gradual adaptation of the farming sector to the new needs raised by climate change" should also be examined. MEPs say that the farming sector can adapt to climate change through legislation that "reinforces sustainability and promotes new ways to use and manage water."
The resolution stresses the importance of an increased need for rational use of water by means of a ‘water demand management'. It calls on the Commission and Member States to promote "pilot projects which will help to reduce drought damage and flooding risks."
Emissions Trading System
The resolution Calls for significant and predictable financial instruments to be developed in the framework of EU policies, such as the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), in order to assist developing countries to adapt to the impacts of climate change as well as to provide funds for adaptation policies within Member States. Green Paper from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - Adapting to climate change in Europe – options for EU action {SEC(2007) 849} /* COM/2007/0354 final Text, as adopted by the EP, will appear here (click on 10 April)

Funding from globalisation fund for Portugal and Malta approved by MEPs
2008-04-15 - 15:37
The European Parliament adopted a report approving the release of aid from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGAF) for Portugal and Malta. The aim is to help 1,549 Portuguese car industry workers and 675 Maltese textile industry workers to retrain. The report was adopted with 555 votes in favour, 40 against and 35 abstentions. Portugal and Malta applied last year for aid from the EGAF, which was set up in 2006 to counter the adverse effects of globalisation. In December the European Commission approved these two applications on the technical level but the budgetary authority (Parliament and Council) still had to decide whether the use of the fund was justified and whether the total requested sum of €3 106 882 should be released.
Retraining of Maltese textile workers
MEPs welcome the application by Malta for €681 207 to fund an assistance plan for textile workers who had lost their jobs following the unexpected closure of two companies, VF Ltd. and Bortex Clothing. The total cost of the plan to reintegrate the redundant workers on the labour market is put at €1.3 million by the Maltese authorities.
This is the first time EGAF money has been used for one of the countries that joined the EU since 2004. It is also the first time that a special clause in the regulation governing the fund, relating to smaller markets, has been used. The 675 redundancies account for 0.4% of the working population of this country of 402 000 inhabitants.
Over €2.4 million for Portuguese automobile workers
The European Parliament also recommends giving the go-ahead to the transfer of €2 425 675 to retrain 1549 Portuguese workers laid off by three automobile companies (Alcoa Fujikura, Johnson Controls and a factory belonging to Opel Portugal). The plan of the Portuguese authorities, expected to cost a total of €4.8 million, provides for vocational retraining, aid for entrepreneurship and certification of the employees' qualifications.
MEPs ask for more detail
During a debate in the budgets and employment committees on 10 March, some MEPs expressed reservations about the scale of the administrative costs, which represent 10% of the total sum requested by the Maltese authorities. Some MEPs, notably from the Greens/EFA group, also voiced concern about the structure of the Portuguese plan, arguing that to grant a subsidy that which was largely equivalent to salary compensation was in breach of the regulation and could set a dangerous precedent.
In the end, however, the European Parliament decided that the use of the EGAF was justified in both cases. MEPs nevertheless adopted an amendment expressing concern about the measures used to reduce the number of people left without a job and needing support from the fund. They ask the Commission and the Portuguese authorities to ensure that the principle of not using the Fund for salary compensation is respected.
The EGAF, which was designed to help workers who lose their jobs following shifts in world trade patterns, came into operation in 2007. Three Member States have received funding from it so far: France, Germany and Finland. Further applications made by Italy, Portugal and Spain are in the pipeline.

Budget
Expenditure of the Institutions in 2009
2008-04-15 - 15:37
A report by Janusz Lewandowski (EPP-ED, PL) deals with the guidelines that MEPs would like to establish for the expenditure of the EU institutions other than the Commission in 2009, including the EP. This report refers to the issue of the ceiling of 20% of total EU administrative expenditure (under heading 5 - Administration) voluntarily imposed on itself by the European Parliament, given that the EP's powers and legislative activity will expand if the Lisbon Treaty enters into force. The new Members' statute (which will require Parliament to pay most of MEPs' pay and allowances) and the 2009 elections will also have an impact on the EP's budget. But MEPs believe it will be possible to meet these needs without going over the 20% limit.
Among the priorities for Parliament’s budget, as for the previous year, are the EP’s communication and information policies, notable three major projects which should be operational in 2009: a visitors’ centre, an audiovisual media centre and the web TV project. MEPs also want to see the rapid adoption of a statute for MEPs’ assistants.
On assistants, the House Supports the recommendations of the conference of Presidents and the Bureau to ensure the consistent implementation of Parliament's internal rules on the reimbursement of parliamentary assistance expenses and to charge the Bureau working party on the Members' Statute, the Assistants' Statute and the Pension Fund with assessing in detail and as a matter of urgency the operation of the existing rules and, given the importance of the matter, to put forward proposals for amendments to those rules.
The report calls on the working group set up within the Bureau to put forward, together with the competent Commission services, proposals relating to a statute for Members' assistants to be forwarded as a matter of urgency to the Council for adoption under the French presidency so that it can become applicable on the same day as the new Members' Statute.
MEPs believe that this proposed statute would ensure equal treatment of Members' assistants that is also transparent, and help ensure that tax and social obligations, such as salaries and social security rights, are fulfilled and welcome the decision of the Bureau of 10 March 2008 on Members' parliamentary assistance, as a first step towards complying with the request expressed in its resolution of 25 October 2007 on the draft general budget for 2008.
The House calls on the Bureau and its Secretary General to report on the progress on the matter in due time before the first reading.
MEPs also stress environmental matters as a key element of managing Parliament as an organisation, notably when it comes to buildings. They want to see the use of environmentally friendly vehicles and solar panels on roofs of EP buildings, among other points.
This report constitutes the first outline from the Budgets Committee, the estimates of Parliament's Bureau and the other institutions not being known as yet. Text, as adopted by the EP, will appear here (click on 10 April)

€400 million for research-driven SMEs as MEPs approve EUROSTARS programme
2008-04-15 - 15:37
Research and development performing SMEs will soon receive transparent and non-bureaucratic support for their research activities. The European Parliament gave its green light to a compromise package, negotiated with Council beforehand, to co-finance the EUROSTARS funding programme for R&amp;D-driven SMEs to the tune of €100 million from Community funds, participating countries will jointly provide €300 million. The compromise took on board most of the points raised by the Parliament's Industry Committee. "The negotiations in the European Parliament together with the Council were handled in a record time of five months", said rapporteur Paul Rübig (EPP-ED, AT). "We could obtain decisive improvements. EUROSTARS now has the potential to become a real showcase for the European Union", he added.
EUROSTARS will primarily fund research and development activities driven by one or more SMEs. However, research organisations, universities, other SMEs or large companies could also participate in the programme. The research programme was set up by the EUREKA intergovernmental network for industrial research last year. The EU's Seventh Research Framework Programme (FP7) is to co-finance it to the tune of €100 million, and the 25 participating EU Member States and five Associated Countries will jointly provide another €300 million.
Transparent and non-bureaucratic payments
The programme will finance R&D activities carried out in the entire field of science and technology. Independent experts shall evaluate the proposals for projects and establish a binding ranking list for the allocation of funds from Community and national budgets, says the new text.
The R&D performing SMEs who participate in a selected project are required to jointly contribute the larger part of the overall costs of the R&D activities. The compromise took on board MEPs call for "transparent and efficient" payments. To facilitate payments to participants in selected projects, Member States should, when ever possible, pay financial support in form of lump sums.
The monitoring of the programme's implementation should "not impose an unnecessary burden" to small and medium-sized enterprises either, says the amended proposal.
Use of Community logo in all publications
The compromise text equally took up the Industry Committee's suggestion to use the Community logo in all printed and electronic publications on the EUROSTARS Joint programme.
Participating countries
Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, the Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom as well as Iceland, Israel, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey.
The amended proposal was adopted by 626 votes in favour, 14 against and 6 members abstaining. The EU's research ministers are expected to endorse the compromise during their next meeting on 29 and 30 May. The legal act shall enter into force on the third day after its publication in the EU Official Journal. Text, as adopted by the EP, will appear here (click on 10 April)

New guidelines for coal and steel research programme
2008-04-15 - 15:37
The European Parliament backs the Commission's proposal to revise the guidelines for the research programme of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel (RFCS). However, MEPs stress that research in so called "clean coal technologies" must be improved. The report was adopted by 558 votes in favour with 61 votes against and 22 abstentions. The programme was established after the expiry of the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty and promotes the utilisation and conversion of resources, health and safety in mines, management of external dependence on energy supply, the use of coal as a clean energy source and reducing CO2 emissions. The RFCS has an annual budget of about €60 million, financed by the interest generated by the remaining capital of the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty. The European Commission intends to review the new guidelines every seven years but it could also propose any amendments to the Council before.
Promote clean coal technologies
The consultation report as approved today by Parliament highlights the importance of enhancing research leading to more efficient conversion of primary energy latent in coal into other energy forms, for example through the use of coal gasification and liquefaction which are considered "clean coal technologies". Products of gasification and liquefaction like hydrogen can be used as motor fuels, helping to reduce CO2 emissions.
The European Parliament also stresses that projects shall aim to make Community coal more competitive, especially on local energy markets, by cutting the costs of mining production, increasing the quality of products and reducing the risks while at the time guaranteeing an efficient use of local coal reserves.
Finally, MEPs support the Commission in its proposal to increase the financial support for pilot and demonstration projects from 40% to 50%. Text, as adopted by the EP, will appear here (click on 10 April)

Culture
MEPs call for sharper focus on jobs and growth potential of cultural industries
2008-04-15 - 15:37
Parliament adopted two reports on cultural industries, the first calls for a new task force on culture and the creative economy, a programme to support the culture industries and the second calls for more to be done to ensure that EU programmes reflect Europe's common cultural heritage. A new task force on culture and the creative economy, a programme to support the culture industries, less VAT and a sharper focus on training and mobility are proposed in an own-initiative report adopted by the European Parliament on the cultural industries' potential to contribute to the Lisbon growth and jobs strategy.
Cultural industries account for 2.6 % of the EU GDP (2003) and over five million Europeans work in the sector (2004). The cultural sector is growing faster than others, and thus has an important role in attaining the Lisbon strategy growth and jobs targets, says the report.
In the report MEPs welcome the readiness of the Commission and Council to acknowledge the central role of culture and creativity in promoting European citizenship and bringing the arts closer to the European public, as well as achieving the Lisbon strategy aims.
More support needed
MEPs make concrete proposals to the Commission and Member States, including setting up a task force on culture and the creative economy to look more closely into the relationship between culture, creativity and innovation in the EU policies.
They stress that adequate funding for the creative industries and communities is essential, and recommend mixed methods of funding and promoting a regulatory and fiscal framework that favours the cultural industries, specifically tax credits and reduced rates of VAT for all cultural products, including on-line works.
MEPs also ask the Commission to consider setting up a MEDIA- like programme that could support digital libraries, music, theatre and publishing, as well as the transnational distribution of works.
Intellectual property: consumers should not be criminalised
MEPs urge the Commission to rethink the issue of intellectual property in order to assure solutions that are equitable for both big and small actors and strike a balance between the respect of intellectual property and the access to cultural events and content. The House underlines that on the battle against digital piracy, the solution should not be to criminalise consumers who do not intend to make profit out of their actions. Furthermore, MEPs suggest campaigns to educate consumers and raise awareness of their responsibilities.
Mobility and qualifications
The European Parliament also highlights the importance of cross-border mobility, especially for artists, and the need for better statistics to enable countries to learn from each other and formulate policies. MEPs stress the need to improve qualifications, apprenticeship and training systems, and provide students in the arts with training that will better prepare them better for professional life and encourage synergies between businesses and schools.
Finally, the House suggests that culture should be better integrated in the Union's external policies.
Figures on cultural industry
- The sector turned over more than 654 billions Euros in 2003.
- The sector contributed to 2.6% of EU GDP in 2003. In the UK, 3% and Ireland 1.7%
- The overall growth of the sector's value added was 19.7% in 1999-2003.
- In 2004, at least 5.8 million people worked in the sector, equivalent to 3.1% of total employed population in Europe.
Sharper focus needed on European cultural heritage
The cultural sector in Europe plays an important role in attaining the objectives of the renewed Lisbon strategy, but more should be done to ensure that EU programmes reflect Europe's common cultural heritage, says the European Parliament in a report.
If Europe is placed in the vanguard of all the continents it is because of its cultural heritage, says the report, drafted by Vasco GRAÇA MOURA (EPP-ED, PT). Europe's cultural richness adds genuine value and has an identity-giving role that is vital for Europe and the EU, the MEPs point out, welcoming the Commission communication on a European agenda for culture in a globalising world from 2007.
" European Heritage" label
Although EU programmes in the cultural sector will contribute to cohesion, real convergence, economic growth, sustainable development, innovation employment and competitiveness, MEPs believe that the existing programmes do not fully reflect the implications of the European's common cultural heritage. The House therefore calls on the Commission to propose specific programmes to preserve Europe's cultural heritage, as well as a "European Heritage" label, to emphasise the European dimension of cultural goods, monuments, memorial sites and places of remembrance.
Identify threatened sectors
MEPs also want the Commission to identify threatened sectors such as the publishing sector, where they say high-quality writing is threatened by best-sellers, and the music sector which they say is threatened by digitisation and piracy. Members therefore call on the Commission to do what is necessary to enforce and protect literary and artistic property rights, especially in the digital environment.
Finally, the House recommends that to promote European cultural values, the Commission and Member States should start organising a European Year to commemorate significant European personalities and suggests that 2010 should be made a European Year to celebrate the composer Chopin, and that 2011 should be made a European Year of Greek and Latin Classics.

Fisheries
Simplification of the authorisation of fishing activities
2008-04-15 - 15:37
Parliament adopted a report by Philippe MORILLON (ALDE, FR) by 492 votes in favour to 107 against on a regulation concerning authorisations for fishing activities of Community fishing vessels outside Community waters and the access of third country vessels to Community waters. The amendments aim to clarify the scope of the regulation, the definitions of serious infringements and the IUU list, and that the regulation does not apply to overseas territories of EU Member States.
The rapporteur, Catherine STIHLER (PES, UK), voted against the content of the report as adopted in committee and decided to withdraw her name from the report. The report was adopted with 492 votes in favour and 107 against.
In the debate on 9 April, Ms Stihler explained: "I was compelled to remove my name from the report when the Committee on Fisheries rejected my key amendments. The report was supposed to simplify fishing authorisations. Instead, the Commission over-reached itself with an unnecessary article awarding itself the right to reallocate fishing quotas.
If supported unamended, this report will unjustly discriminate against northern countries and their historic fishing rights and jeopardise relative stability. To give the Commission carte blanche to reallocate fishing opportunities beggars belief, especially when fishing opportunities are scarcer. We have to ask ourselves whether we are facing a fishing free-for-all in the North Sea".
Existing provisions relating to the authorisation of fishing activities of Community fishing vessels outside Community waters are currently laid down in several different legal texts. The purpose of this proposal is to simplify and improve the procedures related to the management of fishing authorisations. It intends to do so by setting up general rules and conditions that can be applied to all requests for authorisation. It proposes a single procedure for the management of all fishing authorisations and fixes the general division of responsibility between the Commission and the Member States.
New eligibility criteria, sanctions and reporting provisions are also being proposed. For example, vessels failing to comply with EU provisions in the previous year will not receive any authorisations. Compliance with international obligations under the various Agreements is strengthened by introducing measures that oblige the Member States to prohibit a vessel from fishing if it has been involved in a serious infringement or in cases where it has been placed on an IUU list.

Fisheries
Rights-based management tools in fisheries
2008-04-15 - 15:37
MEPs adopted a report on rights-based management tools in fisheries, by Elspeth ATTWOOLL (ALDE, UK). The rapporteur looks upon both the advantages and disadvantages involved in rights-based management. These vary according both to the nature of the system currently in operation and the ways in which fishing rights are allocated and made transferable/tradable. MEPs welcome the fact that the Commission has opened a debate on Rights-Based Management (RBM) in fisheries in anticipation of the necessary modification of the existing management policy and that it has put out a call for tender to allow for a full study of the various management systems. The report was adopted with 538 votes in favour and 42 against.
Parliament recognises, however, even in advance of such a study, that "it is evident that there is a wide variety of such systems in place and that most, if not all, employ some form of RBM, if this is taken in its widest sense". It recognises, likewise, that "experiments with management through fishing rights in Member States which have applied such systems have had very positive consequences in many respects", for example in terms of capacity reduction.
At Community level and within at least some of the Member States, the forms of RBM employed are hybrid ones, in terms both of the allocation and transferability/tradability of the rights and of the way in which their extent is defined. The report notes the "degree of complexity involved and the difficulties this poses for movement toward a single system", whether achieved through harmonising the practices of Member States or by its administration at Community level.
Concerns that must be addressed prior to any move toward a single system
MEPs share the concerns of many stakeholders and consider it necessary to ascertain the effects which changes, particularly the introduction of Community-wide Individual Transferable Quotas and other rights-based access, might have in relation to the degree of concentration of ownership of such rights and the resulting socioeconomic consequences; advantages that could accrue to large companies at the expense of small-scale operators or community-based fisheries; the fear that additional costs may be involved, providing disincentives towards investment in vessels, gear, safety and working conditions; the likelihood of quotas being held at one remove from those actively engaged in fishing; the problems inherent in achieving an initial allocation and in conferring a windfall benefit on those to whom the allocation is made; the risk of an excessive concentration of rights.
"These concerns must be addressed prior to any move toward a single system, for example, the possibility, as shown by existing precedents, of setting a limit on the accumulation of fishing rights", concludes the European Parliament. Text, as adopted by the EP (Click on 10 April)
