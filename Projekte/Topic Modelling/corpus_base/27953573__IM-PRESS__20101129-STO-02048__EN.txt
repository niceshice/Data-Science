A press conference for the Environment State and Outlook report, (L to R) Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of EEA, Joke Schauvliege for the Belgian Presidency, EP President Jerzy Buzek, Janez Potocnik, European Commissioner for the Environment. CO2 emissions down Loss of habitat targets will not be met Air & water quality improves but still concerns over urban areas The European Union is on track to meet its target of 20% cuts in CO2 emissions by the end of the decade. Last year it was 17% below the benchmark 1990 figure according to the annual report by the European Environment Agency. However, loss of habitat, overfishing and resource efficiency relating to food and fuel remain problematic. The definitive report on the state of Europe's Environment was unveiled at the European Parliament on 30 November.
The report also found that water and air pollution across the 27 countries has improved although there are concerns about air and water quality in urban areas. In addition widespread exposure pollutants and chemicals is still causing concern.
"Most comprehensive report" to date
In addition the target of halting biodiversity loss by 2010 will not be met. Despite this the report recognises that the Natura 2000 project (which covers a fifth of all land in the European Union), is having a positive impact on the environment.
The Executive Director of the European Environment Agency, Jacqueline McGlade, told a press conference at the European Parliament that this is "the most comprehensive report that we have up to date on Europe's environment. Environmental legislation as we've known it is no longer able to meet these challenges" she warned.
The President of the European Parliament Jerzy Buzek stressed the urgency of the environmental challenges saying that "It's affecting our citizens, the quality of water we drink, food we eat, and the air we breathe. There's no simple solution. So regulators, businessmen and citizens need to act together."
"If we look after nature, it will also look after us"
That was echoed by the European Commissioner for the Environment Janez Potočnik. "If we look after nature, it will also look after us. We can't deal with any of these environmental challenges in isolation." He also stressed the importance of improving the efficiency of resources.
For the Belgian Presidency of the EU, Environment Minister Joke Schauvliege said that "these challenges are an opportunity to shift to a resource efficient economy that would boost the EU, create new business opportunities, drive innovation and provide a crucial contribution to green and sustainable employment. We can't put this report into our drawer, we have to use it, use it as a guideline" she urged.
