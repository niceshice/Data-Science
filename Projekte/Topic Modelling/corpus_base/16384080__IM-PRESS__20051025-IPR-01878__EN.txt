MEPs endorsed a report that calls for a doubling of student grants for the Erasmus exchange programme by 2013. At present students receive a basic rate of just €150 a month - a sum described by the report's author. German Christian Democrat MEP Doris PACK, as "particularly worrying" given that it has remained the same since 1993. Erasmus is the EU's flagship education programme with over 1 million students already having taken part - by 2013 that number will have doubled.
The report was adopted with 549 votes in favour 47 against with 23 abstentions. MEPs demand an increase in the monthly standard grant from €210 in 2007 to €300 in 2013, topping the Commission's figures of €200 and €250, respectively.
To increase cross-border university education and high school mobility, school exchanges and cross-border teacher mobility, Parliament also asks for an additional €757 million for the whole package over and above the multi-annual budget of €13.62 billion proposed by the Commission. The EP's Committee on Culture and Education originally asked for additional €980 million. The European Parliament figure for indicative appropriations now amounts to €14.377 billion.
The proposed increase is in line with the Parliament's position on EU's next long-term budget for 2007-13 which was enshrined in the report by Reimer BÖGE (EPP-ED, DE). Parliament points out that the appropriations indicated in the Commission proposal beyond the year 2006 are subject to the decisions to be taken on the next multiannual financial framework.
The new EU life-long learning programme package comprises Erasmus, Leonardo da Vinci, Comenius, Grundtvig and two other sub-programmes.
Parliament also agreed with the rapporteur to slightly cut back the budget share for the Leonardo sub-programme which supports vocational training. Ms PACK regarded the Commission target of 150,000 trainee placements in 2013 as "over-ambitious" and stressed the much higher monthly costs of a Leonardo placement (€3,644) compared to Erasmus (€1,775).
MEPs also want to increase the participation of pupils and teachers in the Comenius sub-programme, which is designed for schools, from 1 in 20 pupils to 1 to 15. Parliament also suggests a new sub-programme called Comenius-Regio to promote cross-border individual mobility of pupils and teachers, especially between adjacent regions. It should involve some 10 000 pupils and 10 000 teachers.
Other amendments focus on simplifying application and award procedures for grants, the teaching and learning of official, regional and minority languages, higher grants for disabled participants and support for sign languages and Braille.
