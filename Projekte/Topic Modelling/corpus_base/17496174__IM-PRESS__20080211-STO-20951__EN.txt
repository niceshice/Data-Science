Across the European Union over a quarter of a million people are fishermen and women. Tens of thousands more work in various aspects of the fishing industry. Annually the industry catches or produces 7.3 million of tonnes of fish. However, with fish stocks falling and many in the industry facing financial hardship, the stakes are always high when fishing quotas are agreed each year. We spoke to some MEPs on Parliament's fisheries committee and asked for their views of Europe's fisheries policy.
Six years ago the Common Fisheries Policy was given a complete overhaul to try and address over-fishing and falling incomes for fishing communities. A European Fisheries Fund was set up to try and make fishing more sustainable and environmentally friendly. It also attempted to provide support to people employed in the Fisheries sector.
French Liberal Philippe Morillon chairs Parliament's Fisheries Committee. He welcomed the 2002 reform and the emphasis it placed in science as the basis for assessing fish stocks. "The first priority is still to achieve durable development, which can't be reached without the participation of the fishermen and in their interests. It's a question of reconciling scientific expertise with the experience of fishermen," he said.
"No winners"
Irish Fine Gael MEP Avril Doyle is scathing about the policy. "The CFP has resulted in 20 years of inadequate quota systems and income for our fishermen, poor monitoring and enforcement on the one hand and on the other hand unsustainable fishing and damage to the marine environment - there have been no winners."
However, she sees some cause for optimism: "the introduction of special recovery plans for endangered fish stocks and an end to inappropriate subsidies is to be welcomed and has to be considered an improvement in policy". New measures like the policy on reducing unwanted by-catch and eliminating discards and the strategy to stop illegal and unregulated fishing "will ensure a sustainable future for our maritime communities," she said.
"Long term basis for fishermen in coastal regions"
Looking forward German Christian Democrat Georg Jarzembowski said that "for me it is most important to ensure the sustainability of the European fisheries policy, to stop illegal fishing beyond agreed quotas and thus to create a long-term basis for the livelihood of fishermen in coastal regions."
Greek Socialist Stavros Arnaoutakis sees new challenges from "climate change, water pollution, the reduction of fish stocks and the impoverishment of marine ecosystems (which) create the need to fight illegal fishing and destructive fishing practices."
"The most important aims in coming years are to develop new conservation models to improve the sustainability of fish stocks," said British Liberal Elspeth Attwooll .
