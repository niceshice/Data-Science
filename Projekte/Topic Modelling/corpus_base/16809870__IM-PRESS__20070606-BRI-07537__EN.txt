Opening of the session: welcome to Bulgarian MEPs, condemnation of ETA
Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering opened the session by welcoming the 18 newly elected Bulgarian MEPs freshly elected on 20 May.
Mr Pöttering referred to the announcement by ETA that it was abandoning its ceasefire. He stressed that the European Parliament "stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the Spanish people" and that it "condemns the use of violence as a means of achieving political goals". He added that the fight against terrorism must always take place within the rule of law and concluded by expressing the EP's "solidarity and sympathy with the victims of terrorism".
Parliament calls for clear roadmap on reforms in the constitutional process
Parliament will reject any agreement on a new treaty which does not improve democracy, transparency and citizens' rights. This is the message of the resolution on the EU's constitutional process which was approved by the plenary on Thursday, 7 June, by 469 votes in favour to 141 against and 32 abstentions on the June European Council to define a roadmap to reach a new agreement on institutional reforms.
MEPs debate crucial summit on the EU's future
Ahead of the forthcoming European Council on 21 and 22 June, in a debate with German Foreign Minister Steinmeier. MEPs expressed diverse views ranging from a new Treaty containing many elements from the Constitution, to a smaller Treaty, to no change to the status quo.
EU visa information system to help prevent visa shopping
The European Parliament adopted two reports from Baroness Ludford , (ALDE, UK) on the Visa Information System relating to the Schengen area. The first report relates to an agreement on a regulation setting up a database for exchange of data between Member States on short-stay visas and visa applications from third country citizens who wish to enter the EU's Schengen area.
Better protection for performing artists working outside their home country
The employment conditions for performing artists who move around Europe as part of their work should be improved, and they should be better informed on how to transfer their social rights. This was the message of the report adopted by the European Parliament, calling for better protection for artists and the introduction of a special electronic social security card.
MEPs concerned that UN Human Rights Council fails to address urgent human rights situations
In adopting a joint resolution from the PES, ALDE, UEN, Greens/EFA and GUE/NGL groups, the House welcomes the organisation of special sessions to respond to urgent crises. The EP is concerned, however, at the failure of the Human Rights Council (HRC) to take action to address many of the world’s most urgent human rights situations.
Rebuilding cod stocks in the Baltic Sea
Parliament adopted a report on a Commission plan for cod stocks in the Baltic Sea, in a consultation report. Cod is the most important fish species in the Baltic, but its current mortality is between two and three times target levels. MEPs aim to maintain an appropriate balance between rebuilding stocks and maintaining the conditions for fishing communities to continue their activity.
Transposition into EU law of control and technical measures adopted by North West Atlantic Fisheries Organisation
The House adopted a report by 576 votes in favour to 17 against with 7 abstentions on a proposal which incorporates into Community law, by updating and bringing together in a single regulation, the technical conservation and enforcement measures adopted by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO). Those measures are binding on the EU as a contracting party to the NAFO Convention and should therefore be implemented.
European Parliament's budget for 2008 - a budget for the EU tax-payer
Parliament adopted a report on the draft estimates of the European Parliament's revenue and expenditure (2008). The House recalls that the 2008 budget should be a 'budget for the EU tax-payer', aimed at responsible budgetary behaviour on the part of all actors involved in the process, with decisions on financial resources based on solid reasoning.
Prüm Treaty will allow EU27 to exchange DNA data to fight crime
The application of the Prüm Treaty, signed on 27 May 2005 by seven EU countries, should facilitate the exchange of data from DNA and fingerprint databases to produce "a stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism, cross-border crime and illegal migration", according to a report by Fausto CORREIA (PES, PT) and adopted by the European Parliament.
Fruit and vegetables: MEPs call for aid tailored to farmers' needs
Parliament voted on Thursday, 7 June for flexible forms of farm aid tailored to the needs of different types of fruit and vegetables, as well as the creation of a special crisis fund to boost competitiveness in this sector. These were the main points of a consultation report, adopted in plenary this Thursday, on reforms proposed by the Commission.

Opening of the session: welcome to Bulgarian MEPs, condemnation of ETA
2007-06-08 - 10:40
Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering opened the session by welcoming the 18 newly elected Bulgarian MEPs freshly elected on 20 May. "After coming through the period of communism, Bulgaria with this election seals its integration into the European family", said the president. "Let us work together on the further building of our common European home". Mr Pöttering then referred to the announcement by ETA that it was abandoning its ceasefire. He stressed that the European Parliament "stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the Spanish people" and that it "condemns the use of violence as a means of achieving political goals". He added that the fight against terrorism must always take place within the rule of law and concluded by expressing the EP's "solidarity and sympathy with the victims of terrorism".
Under changes to the agenda, it was announced that pursuant to Rule 81 of the Rules of Procedure, the House would vote on Thursday at the request of the Development Committee, on a regional strategy paper on Mercosur and Latin America.
Sophia IN 'T VELD (ALDE, NL) asked the President to demand explanations from the mayor of Moscow and Russian President Putin for the violent treatment suffered by herself, fellow MEP Marco Cappato (ALDE, IT) and others at the peaceful Gay Pride demonstration in Moscow last weekend. Mr Pöttering replied that he would take the appropriate steps.

Constitution
Parliament calls for clear roadmap on reforms in the constitutional process
2007-06-08 - 10:40
Parliament will reject any agreement on a new treaty which does not improve democracy, transparency and citizens' rights. This is the message of the resolution on the EU's constitutional process which was approved by the plenary on Thursday, 7 June, by 469 votes in favour to 141 against and 32 abstentions on the June European Council to define a roadmap to reach a new agreement on institutional reforms. By backing by a large majority the report by Enrique BARÓN CRESPO (PES, ES) and Elmar BROK (EPP-ED, DE), MEPs call on the June European Council to shortly convene an Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) to reach a settlement on institutional reforms - and they ask for Parliament to be fully involved in its work. According to the adopted text, the EP "will reject any outcome of the negotiations which, if compared to the Constitutional Treaty, would lead to a diminution of the protection of the rights of citizens (...) as well as to less democracy, transparency and efficiency in the functioning of the Union". In order to help reach a positive outcome, Parliament will maintain close contacts with national parliaments, as well as with the Committee of Regions and the Economic and Social Committee, throughout the whole IGC.
The House calls for the preservation of the basic principles of Part I of the Constitutional Treaty in the future agreement on the institutional reforms. The Charter of Fundamental Rights, whose inclusion in the new treaty is still being debated by governments, is one of the reforms the EP deems indispensable. In addition, the report lists the recognition of the Union's values, the clarification of respective competences at national and EU level, the respect of subsidiarity and an increased involvement of citizens in the EU's political life among the crucial achievements of the draft Constitution to be upheld.
MEPs say that the outcome of the IGC must take into account all questions raised during the period of reflection on the future of Europe. Particularly, they ask Member States to agree a common approach in the fields of climate change, energy security, migration policy, the fight against terrorism, enlargement, the European social model and the economic governance of the Euro-zone.
To facilitate the approval of the new agreement on the institutional reforms, MEPs also propose to Member States to coordinate their ratification procedures to approve the new text simultaneously by the end of 2008.
The approved resolution is Parliament's contribution to the June European Council, to be held on 21 and 22 June, dedicated to the institutional reforms.
Debate - 6 June 2007
In the first point on Wednesday's agenda, the House debated a report on the roadmap for the European Union's constitutional process. The report was drafted jointly by two senior Members of the Parliament, Enrique Barón Crespo (PES, ES) and Elmar Brok (EPP-ED, DE), who addressed the House in turn.
Co-rapporteurs
Enrique BARÒN CRESPO (PES, ES), co-rapporteur, argued that the period of reflection had proved useful, as it now enabled issues to be taken into account such as climate change, globalisation, the fight against terrorism and the dialogue between civilisations.
He backed the German presidency's efforts to plan an intergovernmental conference (IGC) to take place under the next presidency in the second half of this year, saying he believed that "it should be possible to find common ground". Above all, it was crucial that the European Parliament, the Commission and national parliaments be represented at the IGC. The aim must be to create "a political organisation in the first rank of democracies in the world".
Elmar BROK (EPP, DE), co-rapporteur, said it was important not to jeopardise the "success story" that was the EU. There must be no two-tier Europe and "no going it alone" on matters such as globalisation, fighting terrorism and energy security, on which action could clearly be taken more effectively at European level.
At the same time we must make it clear that the EU is not a state and does not seek to replace nation states. Among advances contained in the constitution which he highlighted were greater transparency, citizens' rights and new relations with national parliaments. He particularly stressed the value of majority voting in Council "in order to combat terrorism and crime more effectively". And since Europe is built on values, the Charter of Fundamental Rights is also crucial. Mr Brok's overriding concern was that the IGC must preserve the substance of the constitutional treaty.
Council
This a balanced report, which paves the way for future talks and is "consistent with the German Presidency's aims for the June summit", began German Minister for State for Europe Günther GLOSER , for the German Presidency. He agreed that Parliament's support was crucial and that it should be fully involved in any new intergovernmental conference.
The treaty architecture was still contentious but the institutional package must not be unravelled, and a willingness to compromise on all sides was required. Whatever the approach, "the outcome should be intelligible to the people". Public debate had highlighted many concerns that needed to be taken into account, including climate change, Common Foreign and Security Policy, and measures to combat organised crime. Polls showed that people were not against the EU per se, but they did want an EU that worked, i.e. one that delivered answers.
The aim was for the June summit to produce substantive guidelines for an intergovernmental conference, concluded Mr Gloser.
Commission
The European Commission welcomes the report, and "shares its main thrust", said Commission Vice-President Margot WALLSTRÖM .
Two years after the launch of the reflection period, the world, and the political context, was still changing. The EU had found a new consensus on some highly political dossiers and issues, such as agreeing a new financial package for the years to come, but the difficulties that the constitutional treaty sought to remedy "have basically not been solved", she said.
The constitutional treaty was "a compromise which at this stage is difficult to improve but easy to unravel". The intergovernmental conference needed a clear mandate and a clear goal, i.e. a new treaty to be in force before the 2009 European elections. If an IGC were convened, the Commission would be ready to bring forward its opinion in early July. A solution was needed that can "command a true and durable consensus". However, ambition is also essential - a "lowest common denominator" solution might bring short-term relief, but it could store up problems for the future. She agreed that Parliament should be closely involved in the IGC and that efforts should be pursued to engage citizens and civil society in an effective dialogue about the future of Europe.
The major part of work on the substance of the constitutional treaty remained valid, and its innovations needed to be protected. "The Community method must be protected, including the Commission's right of initiative". Among other key points were the single-pillar structure, the single legal personality, advances in qualified majority voting and "the enhanced role of the European Parliament". The Commission also remained attached to the binding nature of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Political group speakers
The first of the group speakers was Íñigo MÉNDEZ DE VIGO (EPP-ED, ES) who began by referring to a story by Hemingway, The Old Man and the Sea, in which a man catches a fish after a great struggle, but with "little flesh, only bones." Mr Méndez de Vigo said that "the European Parliament does not want to see this happen with the constitutional treaty." We need to listen to those people "who want to improve the constitutional treaty", he said, not just to "those who want to lower the bar."
For the Socialists, Jo LEINEN (PES, DE) said that "the substance of the constitutional treaty has to be preserved, but the presentation could be changed if necessary." The European Parliament is, he said, "against the idea of a mini-treaty." It is also against a treaty with "all sorts of important limbs hacked off." Mr Leinen concluded by stating that "we would like a constitutional treaty 'plus' rather than a constitutional treaty 'minus'"
For the ALDE group, Andrew DUFF (ALDE, UK) said the Parliament was looking forward to "playing a part in supporting the IGC" and to a "renegotiating and repackaging of the constitutional treaty." He believed that "the public mood is turning" and that despite the referendum results in France and the Netherlands, there was "a growing realisation that it is not in the interest of those countries to be inside a Union that is too feeble to act."
Brian CROWLEY (IE), for the UEN group, argued that it was "important to listen to all the citizens of the EU". Not only the French and Dutch people were worried about the Constitution. He believed the Brok/Barón Crespo report came at a good moment, when the Council needed to be "nudged" in the right direction. Like other speakers, he believed the "core of the text" of the Constitution must be preserved.
On behalf of the Green group, Johannes VOGGENHUBER (Greens/EFA, AT) strongly supported the report. He said "we must show governments we believe in fundamental rights and reform of the institutions". However, he warned, this Parliament has in the past "not been prepared to go to the wire". It must now "stand up for what it believes". The Constitution was "the right answer", including to those who wanted to safeguard a "social Europe".
Francis WURTZ (FR), for the GUE/NGL group, pointed to an apparent contradiction in the report: it sought both to allay fears, by stating that "Many of the misgivings expressed related to the context, rather than the content", and also to open the way to achieving a settlement "possibly under a different presentation"! Presentation was not everything, he stressed: "Neo-liberal free trade zeal" has consequences that are genuinely unacceptable to citizens. The solution was to hold a wide public debate and then put the outcome of the constitutional process to popular referenda.
For his group, Bastiaan BELDER (IND/DEM, NL) echoed Mr Wurtz's concern about the need to distinguish between "content" and "packaging", and said it would be unacceptable to change only the latter. The intergovernmental conference must be ready not only to debate content, but compromise, he said.
The truth, according to Bruno GOLLNISCH (FR), speaking for the ITS group, is that "you want to create a European superstate, despite what Mr Brok has said". A system which contains "endless powers which are no longer assigned to particular pillars", Mr Gollnisch added, "is a European state." Concluding, Mr Gollnisch stated "This is the reality; you're trying to conceal it. It is dishonest."
Jim ALLISTER (NI, UK), for the non-aligned Members, began by saying that "No is really not a difficult word to understand", adding that "France and Holland didn't express concern, they expressed rejection." The report, he continued, "will do nothing to move us on, because it still insists on everything that has been rejected." In conclusion, he said "you cannot force on us all a constitutional treaty already rejected, no matter how you might disguise or repackage it."
British speaker
Referring to Mr Allister's speech, Richard CORBETT ( PES, UK) argued that "equally, the word 'yes' is not difficult to understand", and that "we are in a situation where a large majority has said 'yes'." Mr Corbett said that "it is right to find a solution capable of ratification by all 27" but he added that "the issue of the substance of the constitutional treaty will have to be addressed." It is essential that we "try to keep those practical reforms...that make the EU capable of functioning as it continues to enlarge."
Council and Commission responses
For the Council, Mr Gloser said it would be "a shame if the work done over the past few years proved to have been all for nothing" He pointed out, however, that in parliamentary debates nothing was hidden and indeed, at the Nice IGC, parliaments from all countries had been represented, including those which were not yet Member States. So it was not true to say something had been "rammed down people's throats". Nor was it true that the German presidency simply "wants a success" for its own sake. It wanted a result because there were good practical reasons for having a constitutional treaty.
For the Commission, Mrs Wallström did not want to open a "Pandora's Box" with a new debate on the constitution, though she recalled pointedly that Hope had been the last thing to come out. She asked whether it was ultimately "about weighing No votes against Yes votes or about explaining the issues" to the public. She stressed that Europe now faced new challenges, for example on energy, migration and climate change. Decisions had to be taken about "who does what" and the institutional issues were inseparable from this political context.

European Council
MEPs debate crucial summit on the EU's future
2007-06-08 - 10:40
Ahead of the forthcoming European Council on 21 and 22 June, the House debated the much-awaited summit with German Foreign Minister Steinmeier. MEPs expressed diverse views ranging from a new Treaty containing many elements from the Constitution, to a smaller Treaty, to no change to the status quo. The debate followed on from the debate on 6 June on Parliament's own report on a roadmap for the EU's constitutional process. (See link)
The debate was opened by German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter STEINMEIER on behalf of the Council presidency.
Describing the summit as "a decisive event for the future of Europe", Mr Steinmeier stressed that the EU had so far been a "success story" and that "our model is envied throughout the world".
Expectations of the summit were high. Apart from the constitutional issue it would look at a "common integration policy", notably with the countries of north Africa; justice and home affairs, especially an extension of Schengen in 2008; the European Neighbourhood Policy, seeking to bind neighbouring countries closely to the EU in the areas of energy, transport and the internal market; and the "central Asian concept", which must focus not just on economic issues: political stability was important too and these were countries where "moderate Islam" exists.
However, the summit would be judged by its success on the constitutional issue. Here Mr Steinmeier congratulated the Brok/Barón Crespo report for "maintaining a delicate balance" and being "realistic". While the "point of departure" in his view was the 18 ratifications, he acknowledged that the No votes "reflect concerns not just in those two countries". Nevertheless, during talks it had become clear that everyone wanted to make Europe "more effective and more dynamic". Among experts on areas such as trade, justice and home affairs, energy and the social dimension, there was a consensus that "the progress achieved must be protected".
There was also "a broad consensus that the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made binding". Some people were concerned that this must not be to the detriment of the Member States' powers but the minister said believed an agreement could be reached.
On subsidiarity, he pointed out that some wanted to go further and have even more involvement of national parliaments. Regarding majority voting, the German presidency was still keen to reduce the right to use vetoes.
Mr Steinmeier stressed that everyone took the Berlin declaration seriously and wanted the constitutional issue wrapped up in time for the 2009 elections. While only cautiously optimistic, his impression was that "there is a new dynamism in the air". "Making Europe a success together" was not just a slogan, it was also what would underpin the summit.
Vice-President of the European Commission, Margot WALLSTRÖM, responsible for Institutional relations and communications strategy, said she first wished to look at three other issues which the summit must consider before turning to the "treaty settlement".
First was migration. Here "the increasing challenges must be addressed in a spirit of solidarity". We should seek to "reap the benefits for the labour market and society at large" but illegal migration required better coordination, and she backed moves to set up rapid border patrols. Second was HIV/AIDS. This was a "critically important public health issue for Europe". Political leadership was needed to ensure progress on prevention, research, surveillance, treatment and support. Third, climate change was not a concern of the forthcoming summit agenda but, in the wake of the G8 meeting, the EU "cannot remain silent".
Nevertheless, the key issue at the summit would be the "treaty settlement". The starting point must be that the EU was there "to respond to the needs of its citizens, to realise policy goals and to deliver results". While "democracy, transparency and accountability" were crucial, "we can't implement agreed policies with one hand tied behind our back".
The first place to seek solutions was the Constitutional Treaty which was "still pertinent". Ultimately, however, it was not sufficient to reach agreement between Member States and the institutions. The EU requires "a new narrative" to explain to its citizens why the EU needs a new treaty, said Mrs Wallström. The public expects action on issues such as climate change, migration and energy but "we have not yet succeeded in persuading them to see the connection between effectiveness in these areas and an appropriate treaty settlement".
Most Member States seemed to agree that a short IGC focusing on "a limited list of issues" was needed. She therefore concluded by saying "Hopefully we are now back on track. If we can hold our nerve and stay focused on the needs of an effective and democratic Europe, the result will give us a European Union which can face the challenges of the 21st century with confidence".
Political group speakers
Speaking for the Parliament's largest group the EPP-ED, Joseph DAUL (FR) said it was necessary to cerate an EU able to make decisions. An EU that is "more effective, more transparent, and more democratic". What comes out of the crucial summit would have to be agreeable to all Member States including those who said 'no' and those Member States where ratification is still pending. The new text should respect the principle of proportionality, a single legal personality for the EU, a stable EU presidency, the extension of qualified majority voting (QMV) and the legally binding nature of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Mr Daul called for a strong parliamentary voice in the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference (IGC), with both representatives of the European Parliament and the national parliaments. European Parliament President Pöttering would deliver this message at the European Council of 21-22 June.
Martin SCHULZ (PES, DE) said that the forthcoming European Council was about the EU's very own future. There is a risk, he said, that it could lead to a weaker EU, with divided Member States, "our strength is in our unity", he said. The EU had to face up to the challenges of globalisation including China and India which represent together one-third of the global population. Individual Member States were "pygmies" in comparison. He welcomed the work of Chancellor Merkel who, as a physicist, would have to bring "many disparate elements together". "The EU needs more than Nice, Nice was a flop, Nice will kill the EU," he concluded.
Graham WATSON (UK), on behalf of the ALDE Group said"' There is one thing we all know, those of us here and those protesting in Germany: the key challenges facing our people. Challenges like climate change, energy security, international crime remain unsolved, because our institutions of government are no longer fit for purpose.
Acting together, Europe could make a real difference where individual Member States meet only a brick wall. The detention of the Bulgarian nurses is a case in point .And yet on wider issues, matters of crucial importance well, as Mark Twain reminded us, when all is said and done much more has been said than done!
How can we protect our citizens from abuse of data? How can we ensure energy security? How can we manage migration policy if we fail to equip ourselves with the tools for the job? Are the naysayers really serious in saying they will sacrifice good governance for the sake of flags and titles? Can they really defend a system of national vetoes which, as President-in-Office Steinmeier, pointed out, castrates key initiatives? Co-decision and qualified majority voting must be the norm, not the exception, in European policy-making. That voice will argue against a de minimus compromise on the substance of the text. It will insist that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is too important to be downgraded in the manner proposed by the UK because that way lies differential membership, differential citizenship, differential rights which have no place in a Europe of equals. The path of the lowest common denominator outcome leads inexorably to a two-tier Europe. Let the faint hearts be warned. This is our best chance to make Europe work for our citizens. We must not and we will not let it go.
Brian CROWLEY (IE), on behalf of the UEN Group, said: "we do not need the Constitution to take immediate action to solve the humanitarian crisis for the people of Palestine. That can be done simply by agreement and by decision. Already we have made some moves towards that and there are other areas that we can move forward, so this idea that has been put forward that, without this final agreement, we will suddenly fall into a state of paralysis is incorrect. Mechanisms will be found to overcome the problems and the difficulties. But I also believe that there is an onus on us when we speak about what the people want to see us doing. The people do not want to see us taking on the new initiatives that we do not have the power to do at the present time. In fact, I was quite shocked that the President-in-office of the ECOFIN Council made such a bombastic and ballistic attack on a single country when he was supposed to be acting in a neutral position. Chancellor Steinbrück wrongly made an attack on Ireland and wrongly made an attack with regard to the arrangements that were put in place and agreed by the Member States and the European Commission.
Concluding, Mr Crowley stated that "when we look to the future of the European Union, the future that we must deliver to our children and our grandchildren, must be better than what our grandparents gave to us, and they gave it to us out of the ashes of the Second World War. Look at the beautiful child that they created. Let us make that child an adult fit for the 21st century."
Monica FRASSONI (Greens/EFA, IT) began by saying that "Parliament has accepted that this reform process will be an inter-governmental process" but that she was "frightened we'll see another Nice." Ms Frassoni added that "we must avoid giving into the temptation to go onto the defensive", because "in the past we had to adjust to compromises and we're footing the bill for those compromises today." Ms Frassoni was "convinced that we have to relaunch, in the context of the IGC, the whole idea of European electoral lists" and that "for 2009 we have to start preparing European elections with European lists."
Concluding, Ms Frassoni stressed the need for greater involvement for the Parliament at the IGC, adding that she was "not at all happy with the idea of having three of four MEPs as observers [.]" It is only through full participation of MEPs that "citizens will have an input on European institutional reform."
Referring to earlier in the debate, Helmuth MARKOV (GUE/NGL, DE) said that "Mr Steinmeier mentioned succeeding together...but together with whom?" With some people wanting more Europe, some people wanting less, Mr Markov said there was "a cacophony of noise but no-one knows where we're going." The Council, he added, "has been sticking to the idea of the Lisbon strategy of turning more and more spheres of life into market-run practices", resulting in a situation in which "political decision making is being rolled back."
On the G8 summit, Mr Markov said that "it's all very well for the heads of government to get together over a barbecue to debate the future of Europe" but the problem was that the "objectives of the big Member States and economic states are being described as what the world needs" when in fact "we don't have agreement among our 27 states."
Jens-Peter BONDE (IND/DEM, DK) said that the new constitution was being "revived by giving it a new name without any proper referendums." Mr Bonde added that "this constitution is on its knees." The EU, Mr Bonde continued, "can no longer be considered a parliamentary democracy", because there is "no doubt that legislation put forward by civil servants and lobbyists is bringing an end to parliamentary democracy." Concluding, Mr Bonde stressed the need to "get back to work" in order to produce a constitution that "represents a living, thriving democracy", and emphasised that it was crucial to "give the last word to our voters."
The constitution, said Ashley MOTE (ITS, UK), "totally reverses the relationship between the EU and Member States, and between the governors and the governed." The current EU reforms, Mr Mote continued, will lead to a situation in which "the state seeks to exist in its own right and have the people answer to it." Mr Mote said that "the original draft of the constitution...attempted to turn a Europe of nations into a nation called Europe" and that "this [new constitution] will not be a constitution in any real form" but instead a "1950s solution to a 1920s problem." Mr Mote concluded by saying of Europe, "you are our neighbours; you should be our friends, but nothing more."
Jana BOBOŠÍKOVÁ (NI, CZ) stated that "everyday that goes by shows that not adopting the constitution doesn't led the EU into a crisis." She added that "any new treaty must ensure just membership for all, regardless of size." Mrs Bobošíková stressed that "the legitimacy of the EU will depend on equality between Member States and equality between citizens", and that "there should be no watering down of subsidiarity."
British speakers
Andrew Duff (ALDE, UK) said: "What do you make of this latest craze for the simplified Treaty? Personally, it seems strange to me that those who support such simplification seek to delete what is the simplest article that we find in the 2004 package, which is the first article that sets out the principles for the Union's foundation. The problem is that in trying to simplify we end up by being simplistic, and in seeking to define an amending Treaty – rather than a consolidating Treaty – we are in the realm purely of semantics, and changing terminology and in suppressing the symbols we risk turning Euro-scepticism to Euro-cynicism.
The fact is that there is no way out of this crisis, except with strong democratic leadership and a clear vision of the common interest of Europe, and such leadership is certainly being provided both from the Presidency and from the Commission at present."
Nigel Farage (IND/DEM, UK) said: "I am surprised we have the affront to call this a debate because the Minister did not tell us any of the substance of the negotiations. But, of course, there is no debate, is there? There is no debate in the national parliaments, no informed opinion in the press, no debate at all – and why? Because this whole Treaty is being put together in secret and that is because you do not want to involve the citizens of Europe. You are fearful that the more they find out about your grandiose plans, the more likely they are to vote 'no'.
Worse still is the downright dishonesty with which this whole process is being pursued. For Angela Merkel to talk in a letter about the proposal to use different terminology without changing the legal substance is the stuff of Alice Through The Looking Glass. It is the twisting of language. It is the deliberate attempt to stop there being free and fair referendums in European countries.
It is your plan to act like a bulldozer: just to sweep aside the French and Dutch referendum results, to pursue your political goals without taking the people with you. I have no doubt that you think you are going to get away with it, but from a British perspective I have no doubt that Mr Blair, in his last act as the British Prime Minister, will sign up to virtually anything you want him to. But he will be handing to his successor something rather like a hand grenade with the pin pulled out, because the pressure on Gordon Brown in Britain to have a referendum on this Treaty is going to be enormous. In fact, I would go further. I am confident that this Treaty will not become British law without the Brits having a referendum, and when they have that referendum they are going to say 'no'.
But if you are proud of your European project, if you are true democrats, then you will join me in the call to let the people decide their own future. Do not foist it upon them."
Roger Helmer (Non-attached, UK) said: Mr President, a key focus of the German Presidency has been its determined attempt to revive the substance of the EU Constitutional Treaty, which was roundly rejected by the French and Dutch voters. We claim to be a Europe of values based on democracy and the rule of law, yet this attempt to resurrect the Constitution in defiance of the clear and expressed will of the voters demonstrates a vast contempt for democracy and for European citizens. And the methods proposed are deceitful and dishonourable.
You have heard this already but I shall say it again – we have Angela Merkel’s letter, in which she proposes different terminology without changing the legal substance, and replacing the Charter of Fundamental Rights by a short cross-reference having the same legal value. Mrs Merkel, this is downright dishonest! You should be ashamed. Our leaders will then fraudulently pretend that the new Treaty is wholly different and deny us a referendum.
I remind my country’s incoming Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, that he is bound by a clear Labour manifesto commitment to put the Constitution to the British people. He cannot pretend that a few cosmetic changes can escape that commitment."
Timothy Kirkhope (EPP-ED, UK) said "My text voices concern, as you might expect, that the Council meeting, which is a vital one, should not devote all its attention to the issue of the Constitution. I and my colleagues do not believe that a Constitution as such is necessary or that there is a massive crisis in Europe at this time that requires it. We hope that a solution will be found which does not require the Constitution to be pushed through regardless, following the views expressed by the people of France and the Netherlands. We hope that the Laeken Summit and what it stood for – which was to make the EU more transparent and less intrusive in the lives of our peoples – will be the basis of whatever comes out of that very important summit.
But I want to say how pleased I am that the Chancellor of Germany has taken such an interest in the issue of climate change and the need for us to work in a cooperative fashion to try to find solutions to global warming and, indeed, the global poverty which arises as a result of those changes. She shares with my party leader, David Cameron, a firm commitment to tackling one of the gravest challenges facing mankind today. It is in relation to that kind of hard policy that we all feel that there is a massive urgency and priority and that we can work together in the right way. We can act together in a way which actually enhances the EU in the minds of the people rather than making them suspicious of its intentions for their future."
Council and Commission responses
Replying to the debate for the Council presidency, Mr Steinmeier agreed with those speakers who had said "there can be no alternative to success at the summit". As to the remarks that the public relations dimension was "lacking", he stressed that if the summit produced new proposals, these would be made public and "there will be enough publicity!". He also stressed that the number of questions still to be resolved at the summit had been greatly reduced in the last few weeks and was now "manageable".
Mrs Wallström believed that the EU institutions "deserve a second chance but cannot afford a second failure". The institutions also had a common responsibility to explain to people how the method of intergovernmental negotiations would be combined with listening to citizens. Responding to a point raised by several MEPs, she reiterated the Commission's view that Parliament should be closely involved in the IGC. Lastly, referring to her earlier point about devising a "political narrative" to communicate with the public, she said this too must be a joint endeavour.

EU visa information system to help prevent visa shopping
2007-06-08 - 10:40
The European Parliament adopted two reports from Baroness Ludford, (ALDE, UK) on the Visa Information System relating to the Schengen area. The first report relates to an agreement on a regulation setting up a database for exchange of data between Member States on short-stay visas and visa applications from third country citizens who wish to enter the EU's Schengen area. The second report says that information obtained from the EU's proposed Visa Information System (VIS) should be limited only to "limited to those who 'have a need to know' and possess appropriate knowledge about data security and data protection rules", according to a report adopted by the European Parliament.
EU visa information system to help prevent visa shopping
The European Parliament backed a regulation setting up a database for exchange of data between Member States on short-stay visas and visa applications from third country citizens who wish to enter the EU's Schengen area. The text is the result of an agreement with Council so the legislative process has been completed at the first reading stage.
More than a hundred countries' citizens are required to have a visa issued by a Member State to enter the Schengen area. The Visa Information System (VIS) should improve the implementation of a 'common visa policy' in Europe. It aims: to prevent an applicant who is refused a visa by one Schengen country applying to others ("visa shopping"); to facilitate the fight against fraud and checks at external borders; to assist in the identification of those not meeting the conditions for entry, stay or residence in Schengen Member States; to ease the application of Dublin II regulation on asylum; and to help prevent threats to the internal security of Member States.
Information stored
The personal data from visa applications stored in VIS will include biometrics (photographs and fingerprints) and written information such as the name, address and occupation of the applicant, date and place of the application, and any decision taken by the Member State responsible to issue, refuse, annul, revoke or extend the visa. The regulation stresses that biometrics will be used under controlled circumstances, with the emphasis on first using the visa sticker number for verification, in conjunction with fingerprints, and with fallback procedures being put in place. Photographs will not be used for identification purposes as the technology is not yet ready.
Preventing terrorism
The draft regulation states that designated authorities from Member States and Europol may also access data contained in the VIS in specific cases and following a substantiated written request, if this can contribute to the prevention or investigation of terrorist offences and other serious criminal offences. This access will be indirect, via central access points which will have to check that all the relevant conditions for accessing the data are complied with. In exceptional cases of urgency, these checks can be made afterwards.
Transfer of data to third countries or international organisations may take place only "in an exceptional case of urgency, exclusively for the purposes of the prevention and detection of terrorist offences and of other serious criminal offences" and with the consent of the Member State who entered the data. Such transfers will be fully recorded and made available to national data protection authorities.
Strong data protection
The regulation contains strong data protection safeguards, something which has been a key goal for Parliament's rapporteur, Sarah LUDFORD (ALDE, UK), in her negotiations with Council.
Access to data by internal security authorities will be always controlled and will happen only under specific and justified circumstances. The Visa Information System database will be managed in the future by a permanent Management Authority - funded from the EU budget - which will gather information from all Schengen countries. Only duly authorised staff of the relevant national visa, border control, immigration, asylum and internal security authorities will have access to the VIS. Such access will take place only if needed for verification at external borders, to examine an application for asylum or for one of the limited number of other purposes set out in the Regulation.
Additional provisions which have been included to ensure adequate data protection and data security standards include the training of specialised staff to deal with data and mandatory scrutiny by national data protection authorities.
Finally, the regulation provides that each visa application file will be stored in the VIS for a maximum of 5 years.
Respect for human dignity
As a result of Parliament's negotiation with Council, an additional paragraph has been added to ensure that any processing of VIS data "will be proportionate to the objectives" and that "human dignity and integrity of the persons whose data is requested are respected". Use of the data cannot lead to discrimination between visa applicants or visa holders on grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion, disability, age or sexual orientation, MEPs added to the text.
The German presidency committed itself, through two political declarations, also to reach an agreement on two further dossiers linked to the VIS: the Framework decision on data protection and the Directive for the Return of illegal immigrants.
Second report on Visa information: personal ata should be obtained only in "clearly defined and monitored circumstances "
The information obtained from the EU's proposed Visa Information System (VIS) should be limited only to "limited to those who 'have a need to know' and possess appropriate knowledge about data security and data protection rules", according to a report adopted by the European Parliament.
The author of the report, Baroness Sarah LUDFORD (ALDE, UK), says that the exchange of such information "may be necessary for the purposes of preventing and combating terrorism and serious crimes", but that any requests for access to the VIS must involve "a verification whether all conditions for access are fulfilled."
Preventing serious crime
The report also states that "it is necessary to designate the competent Member States’ authorities", within which are " duly empowered staff with a right to access the VIS [.]" There should also be "a list of the operating units within the designated authorities" that have access to the information kept on the VIS.
These authorities, the report adds, should "only search data contained in the VIS when they have reasonable grounds to believe that such a search will provide information that will substantially assist them in preventing, detecting or investigating serious crime."
Data protection
The report stresses that "adequate provisions have to be provided for to ensure the necessary data protection", and that such data "shall only be processed for the purposes of the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences."
The report states that "personal data obtained...from the VIS shall not be transferred or made available to a third country or to an international organisation."
It is only in "an exceptional case of urgency [that] such data may be transferred", in which case, "Member States shall ensure that records are kept of such transfers and make them available to national data protection authorities on request."
UK and Ireland's participation
The Commission's proposal states that both Ireland and the United Kingdom are taking part in this Decision, in accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis. MEPs adopted a non-binding amendment which says that neither the UK or Ireland are taking part and are not bound by it or subject to its application.
As to access to information by UK and Ireland, the House adopted amendment whcih states: "In accordance with Framework Decision 2006/960/JHA, information contained in the VIS can be provided to the United Kingdom and Ireland by the competent authorities of the Member States whose designated authorities have access to the VIS pursuant to this Decision and information held in the national visa registers of the United Kingdom and Ireland can be provided to the competent law enforcement authorities of the other Member States. Any form of direct access for central authorities of the United Kingdom and Ireland to the VIS would, under the present state of their participation in the Schengen acquis, require an Agreement between the Community and those Member States, possibly to be supplemented by other rules specifying the conditions and procedures for such access."

Better protection for performing artists working outside their home country
2007-06-08 - 10:40
The employment conditions for performing artists who move around Europe as part of their work should be improved, and they should be better informed on how to transfer their social rights. This was the message of the report adopted by the European Parliament, calling for better protection for artists and the introduction of a special electronic social security card. In the own initiative report on the social status of artists by Claire GIBAULT (ALDE, FR), MEPs explain that many artists in Europe, be it singers, musicians or - like the rapporteur herself - conductors, have experienced problems when trying to perform in other countries, or trying to transfer their social rights. International co-productions of live performances, circus or audiovisual productions have been increasing the mobility of many artists, and thus increasing the need for a clearer legal status for the European artists.
Artists should be better informed
MEPs highlight the fact that in some Member States certain categories of artist do not enjoy legal status. Often, they are not aware of their rights under existing EU legislation. Therefore the Parliament urges the Commission - in cooperation with the sector - to draw up a practical handbook for European artists, where they can find information about sickness insurance, unemployment benefits and similar issues. The European Parliament also wants the Commission to launch a pilot project introducing a European electronic social security card, specifically intended for European artists.
In order to facilitate the mobility of the artists, the report proposes that the Commission and the Member states introduce a ‘European professional register’, in line with the Europass, an initiative launched in 2004 to make it easier to get qualifications recognised in other Member States. This register would list the status of the artist as well as his or her previous contracts.
The report also stresses the importance of the teaching of artistic activities and calls on the member states to step up training of arts teachers, and to create specialised training structures for those working in the cultural sector.
Visas for visiting artists from third countries
The report also raises the problems that third country artists are facing in getting visas and work permits, when for instance Russian musicians or Brazilian dancers come to Europe. Therefore, MEPs call on the Commission to reflect on a regime applicable to artists and begin to draw up Community rules in this area which could lead to the introduction of a specific temporary visa for European and third country artists, as it already is the case in some Member States.

Human rights
MEPs concerned that UN Human Rights Council fails to address urgent human rights situations
2007-06-08 - 10:40
In adopting a joint resolution from the PES, ALDE, UEN, Greens/EFA and GUE/NGL groups, the House welcomes the organisation of special sessions to respond to urgent crises. The EP is concerned, however, at the failure of the Human Rights Council (HRC) to take action to address many of the world’s most urgent human rights situations. MEPs regret in particular the weakness of the HRC resolution on Darfur, as well as the decision taken under the confidential procedure to discontinue consideration of complaints of human rights abuses by Iran and Uzbekistan under the ‘1503’ procedure. The House notes that the confidentiality under the ‘1503’ procedure has not triggered the expected deliverables in terms of better cooperation from the authorities concerned. MEPs ask for the introduction of more transparent procedures.
The House welcomes, in view of its condemnation four months earlier by UN General Assembly for human rights abuses and its lack of cooperation with Special Procedures, the fact that Belarus has not been elected to the Council.
The European Parliament calls for competitive elections in all regions in order to provide real choice among UN Member States. MEPs regret that some countries with problematic human rights records have been elected, owing to clean slates.
MEPs encourage the EU to continue to press for membership criteria for election to the HRC, as well as for monitoring of the actual implementation of the Member States’ election pledges.
The resolution stresses that the credibility and effectiveness of the HRC in the protection of human rights rests on cooperation with Special Procedures and their full implementation, as well as on the adoption of the reforms and mechanisms in a way which will strengthen its ability to address human rights violations around the world.
EU involvement
MEPs call on the countries which have entered into agreements with the EU that include human rights clauses to cooperate with the EU in increasing the potential of the Council to enhance human rights around the world. The EP calls on its interparliamentary delegations and assemblies to examine this aspect at their meetings.
Finally, the House recognises the active involvement of the EU and its Members States in the first year of work of the HRC and looks forward to a successful Presidency of the UNHRC by Romania.

Rebuilding cod stocks in the Baltic Sea
2007-06-08 - 10:40
Parliament adopted a report on a Commission plan for cod stocks in the Baltic Sea, in a consultation report. Cod is the most important fish species in the Baltic, but its current mortality is between two and three times target levels. MEPs aim to maintain an appropriate balance between rebuilding stocks and maintaining the conditions for fishing communities to continue their activity. The two cod stocks in the Baltic Sea are suffering from unsustainable levels of exploitation. The Eastern cod stock has declined to levels outside safe biological limits according to the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Approximately 35-45% of the cod landed in the Eastern Baltic Sea is caught illegally. The Western cod stock, although in a somewhat better state, is also exposed to very high levels of fishing.
The Commission proposes to lower quotas, reduce fishing effort and increase inspections. They say the package as a whole would gradually reduce the fishing effort by 50 to 75%. The total allowable catches (TACs) for cod in the Eastern Baltic would be reduced by 10% and the TACs in the Western Baltic by 6% compared to last year. If the proposal is not adopted before 30 June, a 15% reduction in the cod TACs will be applied in 2007. There would be a further 10% reduction in days at sea as compared to last year.
In its consultative report, the European Parliament makes the procedure for setting the size of the TACs more flexible, to bring the reduction in fishing days down from 10% to 8% and to increase the notification threshold of cod on board from 100 kg to 300 kg. Furthermore, following the line already agreed by fisheries ministers, MEPs increased the margin of tolerance in estimating quantities of fish subject to a TAC that are retained on board from 8% to 10% of the logbook figure.
The European Parliament also wants to increase the minimum size of cod caught in the Baltic Sea to 40 cm, to give the fish more time to breed and thereby strengthen the stock.
A recovery plan for the Eastern cod stock
According to MEPs, it is important to keep the division of the Baltic Sea into a Western and an Eastern zone since "they are separate ecosystems with totally different properties". Therefore the quotas need to be set for each of the two parts. For the Eastern cod stock there should be a recovery plan.
Need to monitor the socio-economic impact of the fishing restrictions
The Commission’s proposal is expected to have far-reaching consequences for both Baltic cod stocks and the fishing industry. "We are talking about cod here – a fish on which many families' livelihoods depend" said the rapporteur Zdzisław Kazimierz CHMIELEWSKI (EPP-ED, PL). The House approved an amendment requiring the Commission to monitor the socio-economic impact, particularly on employment and the economic situation of fishermen, shipowners and firms engaged in cod fishing and processing, and to report annually to Parliament on these issues from the second year onwards.

Transposition into EU law of control and technical measures adopted by North West Atlantic Fisheries Organisation
2007-06-08 - 10:40
The House adopted a report by 576 votes in favour to 17 against with 7 abstentions on a proposal which incorporates into Community law, by updating and bringing together in a single regulation, the technical conservation and enforcement measures adopted by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO). Those measures are binding on the EU as a contracting party to the NAFO Convention and should therefore be implemented. Founded in 1978, NAFO is an intergovernmental organisation which provides a framework for regional cooperation intended to promote rational management and the conservation of fisheries resources in the waters of the North-West Atlantic. The Community has been a NAFO contracting party since 1 January 1979.
Member States which operate fishing vessels in the area are Spain (36 vessels), Portugal (12), Estonia (9), Germany (1-5), Latvia and Lithuania (3), Denmark (1-2) and Poland (1).
The rapporteur, Luís CAPOULAS SANTOS (PES, PT), incorporates in the form of amendments any developments subsequent to the drawing up of the Commission text which for reasons of timing do not appear in the proposal, in particular the provisions contained in the most recent regulation on total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas (Regulation 41/2007 of 21 December 2006 fixing for 2007 the fishing opportunities and associated conditions applicable in Community waters and, for Community vessels, in waters where catch limitations are required).
The technical measures include provisions relating to minimum fish and mesh sizes, requirements relating to the collection of data and special provisions applicable to shrimp fishing.
The control measures include the establishment of a vessel-tracking satellite system and the requirement for vessels to carry impartial observers.
The supervision and inspection measures include the requirement for the contracting parties to accept a joint scheme for inspection at sea, including infringement procedures which they are required to implement.
The proposal also includes measures intended to ensure that vessels belonging to non-contracting parties which operate in NAFO waters and whose activities are regarded as illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities shall abide by the NAFO rules.
NAFO has 12 members, including the EU, France (representing St Pierre et Miquelon), the Russian Federation, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Canada, Cuba, Denmark (for the Faroe Islands and Greenland), Norway, Iceland, Ukraine and the USA.

Budget
European Parliament's budget for 2008 - a budget for the EU tax-payer
2007-06-08 - 10:40
Parliament adopted a report on the draft estimates of the European Parliament's revenue and expenditure (2008). The House recalls that the 2008 budget should be a 'budget for the EU tax-payer', aimed at responsible budgetary behaviour on the part of all actors involved in the process, with decisions on financial resources based on solid reasoning. MEPs proposes to set the budget at €1,427,400,000 representing an increase of 2.1% over the 2007 budget which is €64,000,000 lower than the draft estimates set by the Bureau.
Information policy
The House takes note of the proposals to allocate an overall budget of €41,800,000 to information policy, which will include €10,300,000 for an awareness campaign in view of the 2009 European elections, €9,000,000 for implementation of the Parliamentary Television Channel (WebTV), €15,700,000 for the Audiovisual Centre and €6,800,000 to complete the construction of the Visitors' Centre. MEPs note that the WebTV project is being substantially delayed to the autumn and emphasise that the appropriations allocated and entered in Chapter 10 4 (“Reserve for information”) in the 2007 budget will not be used as initially anticipated. The House considers that this amount may be carried forward to 2008, subject to final approval of the prototype, and consequently could cover the needs of the year. MEPs therefore consider that the EUR 9 000 000 requested for 2008 should be placed in Chapter 10 1 ("Contingency reserve") pending a more precise estimation of the cost of the project if approved, and further information as to the capacity of absorption of such an amount.
The committee considers that the development of a specific programme, similar to that for Visitors' groups, which focuses on small and local media would be of interest to Members as one of the most efficient means of raising Union citizens' awareness of the European Parliament's activities. The committee invites the Quaestors to examine the feasibility of providing each Member with proper means for inviting local journalists to come to the European Parliament.
Informatics
The European Parliament notes that the increase in IT expenditure over the last four years has reached 28%; considers that the current strategy was useful in modernising the European Parliament's IT systems, enhancing the services provided to users and developing a new internet website.
The report also notes that the estimate for telecommunications charges is approximately the same as the estimate for 2005, whereas the actual costs have been falling annually since 2004 owing to the use of new technologies and general price reductions in the sector, and in 2006 were €2,100,000 below the estimates. The House calls on the Secretary-General to report to the Committee on Budgets on the use of current VOIP technologies to reduce telephone costs.
Staff
MEPs consider that efforts can be made to limit the number of staff missions to Strasbourg and, where possible, to make better use of new technologies such as video conferencing.
Finally, the House is convinced of the need to reinforce the relationship between Members of the European Parliament and Members of EU national parliaments and democratically elected national parliaments of third countries; is willing to support the programme for information exchanges with national parliaments.

Prüm Treaty will allow EU27 to exchange DNA data to fight crime
2007-06-08 - 10:40
The application of the Prüm Treaty, signed on 27 May 2005 by seven EU countries, should facilitate the exchange of data from DNA and fingerprint databases to produce "a stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism, cross-border crime and illegal migration", according to a report by Fausto CORREIA (PES, PT) and adopted by the European Parliament. The Prüm Treaty was signed between Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Luxembourg, The Netherlands and Austria to ensure that precise personal information --including for the first time DNA and fingerprints data -- may be exchanged swiftly and efficiently by national law enforcement officers to help combating terrorism and cross-border crime, including illegal immigration. MEPs support the idea of applying the Prüm treaty to all Member States but have approved a number of amendments to ensure that the supplying of data is not made automatically but only "when necessary and proportionate, and based on particular circumstances that give reasons to believe that criminal offences will be committed".
Furthermore, MEPs introduced an amendment to ensure that data collected under this Decision will not be transferred or made available to a third country or to any international organisation. This article is particularly relevant taking into account recent transatlantic disagreements regarding data exchange in the frame of security and fight against terrorism (PNR, cooperation on CIA extraordinary renditions).
Information stored in DNA
The collection of cellular material "for a particular individual who is suspected of having committed such a criminal offence", the report states, "shall take place only on the basis of national law and only for a specific purpose and shall meet the requirements of necessity and proportionality."
According to the draft Decision, Member States will ensure access to DNA analysis files opened for the investigation of criminal offences, but each file will only include a reference number so the subject cannot be directly identified. Law enforcement agencies from all Member States will be able to access the databases and conduct automated searches by comparing DNA profiles. Only when the search shows a match between DNA profiles, authorities can then reveal the identity of the person or further personal data, always under the provisions of their national law (AM.
Access to fingerprints databases will follow the same rules. Finally, police authorities will also have access to vehicle registration data, with the possibility of conducting concrete searches only with the full chassis or registration number.
Other special categories of data concerning racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, sexual orientation or health should be exceptional and follow stricter protection safeguards, added MEPs. Other specific requests by Parliament are the right of the data subject to see and correct inaccurate information and the need to implement dissuasive sanctions if the confidentiality of data is infringed.
Sport events and Council summits
Parliament supported the article which foresees that Member States will supply one another with personal data at big sport events and Council summits, if any final convictions or other circumstances give reason to believe that the data subjects will commit criminal offences at the event or pose a threat to security. Again, such data exchange needs to be proportionate and made on a case-by-case basis, stressed MEPs.
Time limit on information held
Additionally, the Chamber emphasised with an amendment that once the information exchanged has been used for the prevention of a concrete terrorist offence, whether these purposes "have been achieved or can no longer be achieved ", then, "the data supplied shall be deleted without delay... and in any event after no more than two years from the date of supply. "Recorded data in general will be kept for three years .
Joint operations
Finally, the draft Decision foresees other forms of stepping up border police cooperation, such as joint police operations, for which it is necessary to refer to what Member State's law permits. Police officers involved in a joint operation in another Member State's territory will carry their usual service weapons and wear their own national uniforms with a distinctive sign and an accreditation document.
"In urgent situations", added MEPs, "officers from one Member State may, without the prior consent of the 'host Member State', cross the border between both and take any provisional measure to avert an imminent danger". In that case, officers will immediately inform the host Member State of their presence. It will be the host Member State who will assume responsibility for the measures taken by the officers crossing the border.

Fruit and vegetables: MEPs call for aid tailored to farmers' needs
2007-06-08 - 10:40
Parliament voted on Thursday, 7 June for flexible forms of farm aid tailored to the needs of different types of fruit and vegetables, as well as the creation of a special crisis fund to boost competitiveness in this sector. These were the main points of a consultation report, adopted in plenary on 7 June, on reforms proposed by the Commission. Falling consumption in the EU, rising imports and declining prices as a result of pressure from big distributors are the problems weighing on the European market in fruit and vegetables. The European Commission proposed in January to improve the competitiveness of this sector by giving producer bodies more influence, incorporating the various existing forms of aid into the single payment per hectare system (not linked to production volumes) introduced for other sectors in 2003, safeguarding the environment better and boosting consumption, especially among young people, while still remaining "budget neutral".
In adopting today the report drafted by María Isabel Salinas García (PES, ES), Parliament has given its go-ahead to the general thrust of the reform. However, it believes it is possible to provide more flexible aid, better tailored to producers' needs, especially in crisis periods.
Security fund to manage major crises
To enable producer organisations to manage major crises better (e.g. when prices fall), Parliament puts forward once again the idea of a security fund, which was supported by the EP in an own-initiative report in May 2005. It argues that Member States should set up funds of this kind, to be financed two-thirds by the EU (with a possibility of using up to 0.5% of national reserves) and one-third by producer organisations (POs), which would finance measures for withdrawal from the market, green harvesting, etc. These funds would also be open to producers who were not members of POs. MEPs also proposed that a body to monitor prices be set up, so as to anticipate crises better.
Strengthening producer organisations
To strengthen POs against the power of major distributors and to encourage more producers to join these bodies, Parliament is asking for Community co-financing of operational funds to be increased from 50% to 60% in more cases (merging POs, integrated production, etc). It also recommends putting a ceiling on Community aid to these POs of 6% of the value of the production placed on the market.
According to MEPs, the POs should also be able, on a voluntary basis, to finance operations to promote the consumption of fruit and vegetables, e.g. through campaigns in schools.
Flexible support tailored to different producers
MEPs want more flexibility in the way aid is decoupled from production, with transitional periods to allow the sector time to adapt, especially the processed foods sector (tomatoes, citrus fruits, etc.).
Parliament also voted for more effective controls on imports from non-EU countries by boosting the EU's ability to react to crises caused by floods of imports. A safeguard clause should be introduced, allowing extra duty to be slapped on such imports. MEPs also called for better quality and labelling standards.
The report was adopted by 526 votes to 95 with 32 abstentions. Its amendments are not binding on the Agriculture Council, which is hoping to reach a "political agreement" at its next meeting on 11 and 12 June in Luxembourg.
