In preparation for next week's plenary session in Strasbourg MEPs will be holding committee and political group meetings this week in Brussels, to prepare positions and debating points. Also this week President Hans-Gert PÃ¶ttering will be in Peru to meet political leaders in a bid to strengthen EU-Latin America relations. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the head of the International Monetary Fund will meet MEPs from the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee.
Here on the headlines part of the site this week we will have MEPs' reactions to elections in Serbia, where pro-European forces gained the upper hand. In addition we will have articles in our ongoing series about climate change and on the gas and electricity directives, which aim to separate the production and supply of energy. There will be a vote on gas directive 19 May vote in the Energy Committee.
We also take an in-depth look at the voluntary sector in Europe and how governments and the EU can encourage more people to get involved, following the adoption of a report last month.
Finally, 40 years ago in May, Europe witnessed a series of upheavals, which affected large parts of the continent: in Paris students took to the streets whilst in Prague the Soviet Army crushed the Spring uprising. We look back at the events of 1968 and ask what impact they have had on modern Europe. Read all this and more on the parliament's website site this week.
