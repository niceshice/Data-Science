Michaela FINDEIS BXL (+32) 2 28 31141 STR (+33) 3 881 72076 PORT (+32) 498 98 33 32 EMAIL tran-press@europarl.europa.eu MEPs voiced concern about evacuation procedure training on passenger ships and suggested limiting cruise ship size by law, in a Transport and Tourism Committee debate with Commissioner Siim Kallas on Tuesday. An investigation of the Concordia accident will help shape a revision of ship safety rules and new measures might be tabled before the end of 2012, Mr Kallas said. He also deplored EU Member States' "lack of enthusiasm" for stepping up the European Maritime Safety Agency's powers.
