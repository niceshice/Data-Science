No limits on working hours of self-employed lorry drivers?
2010-06-10 - 17:46
Should self-employed bus and lorry drivers be subject to the same rules on working hours as drivers employed by companies? The Employment and Social Affairs Committee says they should, but it will up to the full Parliament to decide when it votes in Strasbourg next week. Self-employed drivers were temporarily exempted from the rules of the existing EU directive on drivers' working hours but were due to come under those rules by March 2009 unless the European Commission proposed legislation to the contrary. The Commission did just that, seeking to exempt them permanently. But Parliament's Employment Committee voted on 28 April against any further exemption, citing health and safety concerns plus the need for fair competition in the industry.
If self-employed drivers are to remain subject to the same rules as employed drivers, they will also have to obey the same rules on loading and unloading, assistance to passengers, cleaning and maintenance, and police and customs formalities. Current EU law on employed drivers lays down an average limit of 48 hours a week, which can rise to 60 hours a week provided it does not exceed the average of 48 hours a week over a four-month period.
MEP Edit Bauer (EPP, SK), who drafted Parliament's report, supports the Commission's approach, which is to focus on the problem of 'false' self-employed drivers (those who are not really free to work for more than one client) rather than bringing genuine self-employed drivers within the legislation. She argues there is “no precedent for regulating the working hours of self-employed people”.

Clearer food labels for consumers
2010-06-10 - 17:46
Compulsory nutrition labelling to indicate fat, energy, sugar Groups split over "traffic light" symbols for unhealthy products Labels must include country of origin With health problems such as obesity and diabetes on the rise in Europe, Parliament will vote on substantial changes to EU food labelling rules to enable consumers to make better-informed choices. The proposed EU law on food information will merge, simplify and update existing nutrition and general labelling legislation. It would make nutritional labelling compulsory, with values for energy, fat, saturated fat, carbohydrate, sugar and salt content to be made clearly visible on the front of packaging. Environment Committee MEPs are calling for proteins, fibre and trans-fats to be added to this list.
However, the Environment Committee also wants to avoid information overload for consumers, and indeed excessive burdens for the food industry, particularly smaller firms.
Members of the committee were divided over the possible merits of a 'traffic light' approach to highlight such key values, narrowly rejecting a proposal to introduce such a system. Seen as grossly over-simplistic by some, but a highly-effective tool to promote healthy eating by others, the system would use green, amber and red symbols to indicate the relative quantities of energy, fat and sugar found in a food product.
Consumers also often want to know where food comes from, for example to gauge the carbon footprint of a product. The Environment Committee supports mandatory labelling of the country of origin for meat, poultry, dairy products, fresh fruit and vegetables and other single-ingredient products, as well as meat, poultry and fish when present in processed food.
Food information can also be a safety issue. The draft law as approved by the Environment Committee backs proposals to extend rules on flagging up allergens so they will also apply to restaurants, not only pre-packed food. Finally, the committee members also want any presence of nanomaterials to be highlighted in the listing of ingredients.

Translation rights for suspects in criminal trials
2010-06-10 - 17:46
A British football fan arrested in Portugal would have the right to interpretation during police questioning, court proceedings and communications with his lawyer, if Parliament approves a new law to guarantee EU citizens access to translation and interpreting services when facing a criminal trial in another Member State. MEPs have reached an agreement with Council to approve these rules on interpretation and translation throughout the EU, from the time a person is made aware that he is suspected of having committed a criminal offence until the conclusion of the proceedings. Member States will have three years to enact the directive and they will be responsible for bearing the additional translation costs, irrespective of the outcome of the proceedings.
The UK and Ireland have opted into this directive but Denmark has not.

Half of EU states to move forward on international divorce legislation
2010-06-10 - 17:46
EU to allow enhanced cooperation for first time 14 Member States will use it to approve law easing divorce for international couples Divorce between international couples is set to become the very first issue on which only a limited group of EU countries will legislate, thereby taking the lead over the rest of the EU. Parliament is being asked to authorise 14 Member States to go ahead with plans to allow international couples to choose which national law applies to their divorce. This would be the first use in EU history of the "enhanced cooperation" procedure, enabling some Member States to move forward on legislation that does not have Council's unanimous agreement. If Parliament authorises the 14 Member States to go ahead, the next step will be for draft legislation containing the substance of the new divorce law to come before Parliament for consultation.
These rules would allow international couples (those of different nationalities, those living apart in different EU countries or those living together in a country other than their home country) to choose which law applies if they are to divorce, so long as it is the law of a country to which they have a close connection (such as long-term residence or nationality).
For example, it would allow a Franco-German couple living in Belgium to agree that either French or German law should apply to their divorce (or they could choose Belgian law, as would be the case at present). "We are giving couples more freedom and choice over their divorce, which is a difficult moment in their lives", says rapporteur Tadeusz Zwiefka (EPP, PL).
The 14 participating countries are: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia and Spain.
Britain and Ireland have not signed up to this procedure.

Tougher rules as well as transparency for derivatives market
2010-06-10 - 17:46
The trade in derivatives - the often complex financial instruments widely criticised in the wake of the Greek debt crisis - must not only be made less opaque, it must also be regulated more strictly, says a draft resolution by the Economic Affairs Committee. A significant reduction in speculative trading is one of the resolution's demands. The Economics Committee also calls for derivatives to be centrally cleared to reduce risk, and proposes laying down standards to be observed by the clearing channels.
The resolution makes a number of proposals for regulating the trade in credit default swaps, including banning speculative trading. It also suggests ways to reduce the regulatory burden on corporate end-users of derivatives.
Widely criticised for the highly opaque way in which they are traded, derivative products are currently being discussed at national level, EU level and by the G20. Parliament's non-legislative resolution comes a few weeks before the European Commission publishes its draft legislation to regulate this area and can therefore be seen as a pointer to the way the EP would wish to shape that legislation.
In particular, the draft resolution suggests abandoning "the decades-old misjudgment that derivatives need very little regulation chiefly because they are used by experts and specialists". Instead, it says, stricter rules are needed to prevent dangerous levels of risk being built up by inexperienced users and speculators.

New EU satellites to help response to disasters
2010-06-10 - 17:46
EU earth observation satellite to be operational in 2014 Free data to help manage natural and man-made disasters A swifter, more effective response to earthquakes, floods, oil spills and other major disasters should be possible by 2014 thanks to a planned EU earth observation satellite system, once it gets the green light from Parliament. The new satellite system (known as Global Monitoring for Environment and Security, or GMES) would allow the EU to collect its own data instead of relying on data from American satellites as at present.
Parliament is set to give its go-ahead in Strasbourg for the system's initial operations and approve €107 million in extra funding for it to become fully operational.
Thanks to a deal struck with Council by MEPs from Parliament's Environment Committee, access to the data will be open and free of charge, to help all local, regional and national actors cope with any disaster. The satellite could also be used for monitoring climate change and for helping policy-makers take decisions on agriculture, forestry, energy, urban development, infrastructure or transport.
The EU funding earmarked for the three-year initial operational phase (2011-13) is €107 million, to be supplemented with €209 million from the seventh research framework programme's "space" budget for research measures.
Floods in Central Europe
On a separate issue, the EU response to recent floods in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia - which have caused extensive damage and claimed more than 20 lives last month - will be the focus of a debate and resolution.

Millennium Development Goals need new funding
2010-06-10 - 17:46
Innovative development funding mechanisms such as a financial transaction tax need to be backed by the EU - the world's leading aid donor - if the Millennium Development Goals are to be met by the 2015 deadline, says a draft resolution by the Development Committee to be put to a plenary vote on Tuesday. MEPs expect the June 2010 European Council "to agree on an ambitious and united EU position" ahead of the 20-22 September UN MDG summit in New York. The Council conclusions will be based on the twelve-point EU action plan proposed by the Commission on 21 April.
In any event, EU Member States must deliver on their 0.7% of GNI aid pledge by 2015, says the resolution drafted by Michael Cashman (S&D, UK). The risk that the MDGs will not be met is real, warns a recent UN report.
E-card event with President Jerzy Buzek
Right after the plenary vote, European Parliament President Jerzy Buzek will receive an e-card petition from UN millennium campaign co-ordinator Eveline Herfkens, also calling on EU leaders to present an ambitious plan at the UN Summit and keep promises to end poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.

Economic governance and EU2020 strategy: steep road ahead to growth and jobs
2010-06-10 - 17:46
MEPs will vote on a resolution on economic governance in the EU which will provide an insight into the main arguments the EP will be making over the coming months as work on reforming economic decision-making picks up speed. In a separate resolution on the EU2020 strategy, Parliament will aim to set its stamp on the strategy to be followed on economic growth and employment in the next ten years. In a series of resolutions adopted last plenary session (20 May), MEPs insisted that the completion of the single market, the sustainability of national debts and a grass-roots led EU cohesion policy were central to the success of Europe's economy and growth. However during that session the political groups could not reach a common position on the core of the EU2020 strategy. The EPP and ALDE groups therefore asked for a postponement of the vote in order to try to reach a broader consensus.
The resolution on economic governance will be put to the vote a day after MEPs get the chance to discuss the work and set-up of the Task Force on Economic Governance created by the president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy.

Updating EU trade ban on torture implements
2010-06-10 - 17:46
EU states should ban all trade in torture implements such as spiked batons, thumb-cuffs and body-worn electric-shock devices, believe MEPs. The EP foreign affairs and international trade committees will raise this issue in plenary, asking the Commission to update current EU law to add these objects to the list of banned or strictly regulated torture equipment. In their oral question to the Council, MEPs express concern that many EU countries have failed to apply the existing European legislation. When it came into force on 2006, it was the world’s first multilateral trade instrument to prohibit international trade in "equipment that has no other practical purpose than for capital punishment, torture and other ill-treatment". The plenary debate follows the publication of a report published in March 2010 by Amnesty International/Omega Research Foundation, which reported that a number of EU states are continuing to issue export licences for such equipment.

MEPs call for better oversight of credit rating agencies and deficit data
2010-06-10 - 17:46
MEP's will raise their concerns about the way credit rating agencies (CRAs) underestimated risks and even compounded the Greek crisis, in a debate with the Commission in Strasbourg. Separately, the plenary will debate the problem of poor deficit data submitted by Member States and the Commission will be questioned about its plans and views on this matter and the idea of giving Eurostat more investigative powers. On Tuesday a question will be put on deficit data and strengthening Eurostat's powers. MEPs ask the Commission if it has investigated whether any Member State has submitted false data either intentionally or accidentally. They also question the idea of Eurostat having the power to carry out "dawn raids" and to enquire into any organisation it wishes. A vote on a resolution will follow, with the draft text calling on the Council to live up to its statements of intent by granting Eurostat the powers it needs to avoid another situation like the Greek data reporting case.
On Wednesday and hot in the heels of the Commission's recent proposals for further regulating CRAs, the EP's political groups will each present questions to the Commission on some of the most crucial issues. These include what role CRAs should have in rating countries' debt levels, alternative models which could be envisaged for rating the economic situation of Member States, and the licensing and supervising of CRAs by public authorities. The questions will also bring up the issue of addressing the potential conflict of interest between CRAs and the financial market actors who commission their services.

Globalisation fund: aid to unemployed in Ireland and Spain
2010-06-10 - 17:46
Over 2000 former construction workers in Spain and nearly 600 ex-employees of Irish glass company Waterford Crystal and its suppliers could receive a total of €11 million in aid from the EU Globalisation Adjustment Fund to help with training, business start-ups and job guidance if Parliament backs the measures in Strasbourg. In Ireland, 598 former workers at glass manufacturer Waterford Crystal and its suppliers lost their jobs in early 2009. They will now be offered occupational guidance, help for business start-ups and training courses. These measures are expected to cost € 3,955,159, of which Ireland has applied for €2,570,853 from the EU fund.
The other two cases are in Spain. In the first case, 1600 workers who lost their jobs in the ceramics industry in 2008 and 2009 are now set to receive occupational guidance, training, workshops, apprenticeships and advice on how to set up a business. This will cost €10,151,900, of which EU aid will cover €6,598,735. The second Spanish case would finance similar measures for 557 people who lost their jobs in the door manufacturing industry. These would cost €3 million, of which the EU fund would cover €1.95 million.
In addition, MEPs will vote on whether to grant the Commission €1.11 million to cover the cost of activities relating to a mid-term evaluation of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, including studies, creation of a knowledge base, meetings between experts and further development of the website.
The EU Council of Ministers' approved the plans on Monday 7 June.

Bluefin tuna catch tracking to deter illegal fishing
2010-06-10 - 17:46
A new system for tracking bluefin tuna from catch to sale, so as to protect alarmingly depleted Atlantic stocks, will be put to a plenary vote on Thursday. The new rules will require documentation at every stage, including caging, harvesting, importing, exporting and re-exporting, so as to ensure complete and reliable traceability .
To thwart illegal fishing and improve fish stock control, the draft regulation transposes into EU law the recommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), to which the EU is a contracting party.
An international scheme to document bluefin tuna catches has been in place since the 1990s, but as worldwide traffic becomes increasingly sophisticated, the rules need regular upgrading. The Bluefin Catch Documentation Programme aims to get ahead of new ways to cheat on the origin of this high-value fish. The scheme is ICCAT's latest effort to counter growing overfishing of the Atlantic bluefin tuna. It supplements other stock management measures, such as restrictions on catches and limits on the fishing season.
Parliament and EU Member State representatives have already agreed informally on the final text. If approved in plenary, the new rules would take effect this year. Parliament's report was drafted by Raül Romeva i Rueda (Greens/EFA, ES) for the Fisheries Committee.

Border controls with Bulgaria and Romania to be lifted?
2010-06-10 - 17:46
Bulgaria and Romania are a step closer to having their border controls with the Schengen area lifted, as both countries are now deemed to comply with data security requirements for connecting to the "Schengen Information System", the sophisticated database used by border control agents to exchange information in the fight against crime and illegal immigration. Parliament is being consulted on the EU's plans to scrap the border controls and will state its position in Strasbourg this coming week.

MEPs decide tactics for 2011 budget negotiations
2010-06-10 - 17:46
The European Parliament will narrow down its priorities before giving a mandate to its representatives for the upcoming negotiations with the Council on the 2011 budget. The negotiations, based on the Commission's draft budget, will start on 30 June. The final agreement is not expected before November.
According to the Budgets Committee, Parliament should in particular focus its negotiating efforts on six "points of specific interest":
• Budgetary implications of the European Stabilisation Financial Mechanism
• Budgetary implications of the EU 2020 Strategy
• Youth related programmes
• Financial sustainability and manageability of heading 1a (competitiveness for growth and employment), also including the changes introduced by the Lisbon Treaty
• Heading 4 (external actions), including the setting up of the European External Action Service
• The limited margins in the draft budget for 2011 and the need for a revision of the current long term budget
At this stage of the procedure, MEPs do not suggest any changes in the figures proposed by the Commission. Instead, they indicate in a more general way how they would like to modify the draft budget.

A boost for aquaculture
2010-06-10 - 17:46
The European aquaculture sector needs clear rules, less red tape and a transparent labelling system, according to the EP Fisheries Committee. A stronger industry could help meet growing consumer demand and provide alternatives to wild species. However, safeguards are essential to prevent environmental and public health risks. How best to achieve these aims is the subject of a draft resolution on which Parliament will vote on Thursday .

Green light for Estonia's euro bid
2010-06-10 - 17:46
MEPs are set to vote in favour of allowing Estonia to adopt the euro on 1 January 2011. The Economic Affairs Committee commends the country's efforts at reducing budgetary deficits and urges the government to ensure that the introduction of the euro is not used as a pretext for hidden price increases. The MEP in charge of the recommendation, Edward Scicluna (S&D, MT) says the continued interest of countries in joining the euro at such difficult times says a great deal about the eurozone itself.

EU human rights policy and human rights defenders
2010-06-10 - 17:46
MEPs will quiz Catherine Ashton about the impact of the EU's human rights policy in 2008 and 2009 when they debate the EU annual report on human rights in the world on Wednesday. A draft resolution on practical measures to help and protect human rights defenders will also be discussed.
In response to the latest EU report on human rights and democracy in the world, produced by the Council and Commission, MEPs are expected to call for quantifiable indices and benchmarks to measure the effectiveness of the EU's human rights policy outside its borders. This report will serve as the starting point to prepare Parliament's own annual report on human rights in the world, which will be adopted during the December Strasbourg plenary session, when the award ceremony for the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought will also take place.
The draft resolution on human rights defenders recommends giving more visibility to the work of these individuals and urges practical measures such as emergency visas for them and their families as well as temporary protection and shelter in Europe. The EU should "systematically denounce and reprimand international companies" that provide "oppressive regimes with surveillance technology, thereby facilitating persecution and arrests of human rights defenders", says the resolution, drafted by Heidi Hautala (Greens/EFA, FI), chair of the Subcommittee on Human Rights.

The internet, a global public good
2010-06-10 - 17:46
The Internet should be run in the common interest and not be controlled by governments. Meanwhile, the issues and opportunities of the "internet of things" need to be assessed. These are the messages conveyed in two draft resolutions from the Industry Committee on which Parliament will vote in Strasbourg .
Governments should avoid involvement in day-to-day internet management and focus on issues vital to public policy such as security and privacy, while ensuring respect for the EU's fundamental values, argues the first draft resolution, which looks at "internet governance". MEPs support the current model for management of the internet by the Internet Corporation for Assigned names and Numbers (ICANN), a non-profit organisation subject to Californian law. However, they would like to see improvements, including a gradual diversification of the organisation's funding structure.
Meanwhile, the "internet of things" is set to "revolutionise person to thing and thing to-thing interaction". In future it will be possible for all the information on a product to be stored, received and transmitted in wireless mode via a chip stuck on the product and measuring just a few millimetres. The second draft resolution backs the Commission's plan to develop this new information technology, combining radio frequency identification (RFID) chips and internet addresses. However, it calls for a proper assessment of any consequences regarding health, privacy and personal data protection.

2010-06-10 - 17:46
MEPs are expected to approve EU contributions to the International Fund for Ireland (IFI) until the end of 2010, ensuring implementation of the initial agreement which provided for EU contributions of €15 million per year from 2007 to 2010.
The fund, established in 1986 by the Irish and British governments to promote cross-community projects in support of the peace process in Northern Ireland, receives €60m in funds from the EU as well as additional funds from the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
One amongst many projects funded by the IFI is "Football for Peace", which brings young people from different communities together, using football as a means to promote good relations through cross-border and cross-community partnerships. The IFI provides financial assistance of €527,954 for the project.
