Briefing - 9-10 May 2007 - Brussels
2007-05-04 - 15:45
The Brussels plenary session starts on Europe Day - 9 May. Before the plenary officially opens, at 3pm, the European Parliament will receive 13 European Nobel Prize winners to mark Europe Day in the EU's 50th anniversary year. The Northern Ireland peace process features strongly. Joint winners of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1998 John HUME (former MEP) and David TRIMBLE will be present. Betty WILLIAMS and Mairead CORRIGAN , who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1976, and who co-founded Women for Peace, which later became the Community for Peace People will also be at the one hour long ceremony which starts at 3pm on Wednesday 9 May.
The plenary session formally opens at 4pm on Wednesday. The debate and vote on roaming is postponed due to further negotiations between the three European institutions and maybe re-scheduled for the May plenary in Strasbourg (21-24 May). The first item for debate is the forthcoming EU-Russia summit to be held on 18 May in Samara . The recent heated debate between Estonia, the EU and Russia is likely to feature highly. The House will also vote on a resolution on this topic.
Later on Wednesday 9 May, the European Parliament will tackle the issue of reform in the Arab world . Any outside attempt to impose reforms, without the partner countries having a sufficient stake in the processes and means employed to achieve them, “is bound to fail”. This is the key tenet of a report on “Reforms in the Arab world: what strategy should the European Union adopt?”, in a report by Michel ROCARD (PES, FR) for the Foreign Affairs Committee.
MEPs also turn their attention to a legislative report on the retrofitting of mirrors to HGVs . The Transport Committee will ask Parliament to approve a first-reading report calling for blind-spot mirrors to be "retrofitted" to heavy lorries in operation since 2000. This would cost €100 - 150 per lorry but could save up to 1,200 lives in Europe by 2020.
Parliament will also be asked to vote at second reading on new rules on public passenger transport services by rail and by road which seek to rebalance the award of contracts for these services between the public and private sectors.
The House then turns its attention to plans to deregulate package sizes for pre-packed products . If this legislation is passed, many everyday consumer products could be sold in a wider range of sizes than at present. Parliament's report has been drafted by Jacques TOUBON (EPP-ED, FR) for the Internal Market Committee.
Malcolm HARBOUR (EPP-ED, UK) will lead the debate on Vehicle Type Approval . The Internal Market Committee will ask Parliament to back new rules on the manufacturing standards of road vehicles. These will raise environmental and safety standards as well as making it easier for producers to sell their vehicles Europe-wide. Thanks to MEPs, the legislation will take more account of the needs of disabled car users.
Diana WALLIS (ALDE, UK) will lead the debate on a resolution tabled by the Petitions Committee calling on Denmark to take belated action in relation to the health consequences of the 1968 crash in Greenland of a US plane carrying nuclear bombs.
The last item on Wednesday evening, MEPs will debate a report calling for minimum levels of duty for alcoholic drinks should be scrapped. Instead, says the Economic Committee, Member States should adopt a code of conduct that encourages them to move towards the EU average level of duty.
On Thursday 10 May , the session starts at 9am with three debates on regional policy focusing on housing, structural policies and EU cohesion and the innovative capacity of the EU.
The House will also vote on the composition of the new Temporary Committee on Climate Change (60 MEPs, one year duration). The House will also vote on a resolution on the strengthening of European legislation in the field of information and consultation of workers .

13 European Nobel Prize winners at European Parliament on Wednesday, 9 May
2007-05-04 - 15:45
In the EU's 50th anniversary year, 13 European Nobel Prize winners will be at the EP on Europe Day - 9 May. The Northern Ireland peace process features strongly. Joint winners of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1998 John Hume and David Trimble will be present. Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1976, and who co-founded Women for Peace, which later became the Community for Peace People will also be at the one hour long ceremony which starts at 3pm on Wednesday 9 May. At 3pm European Parliament President Hans-Gert PÖTTERING will make a statement opening the ceremony. This will be followed by a series of interventions from some of the prize winners.
Professor Tim HUNT who jointly won the Nobel Prize for medicine in 2001 "for the discoveries of key regulators of the cell cycle" will be present at the ceremony. Lech WALESA will take part in the ceremony. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983. He was unable to receive the prize himself, fearing that the government would not let him back in. His wife, Danuta Wałęsowa, received the prize in his place. Wałęsa donated the prize money to the Solidarity movement's temporary headquarters, exiled in Brussels.
Every year since 1901 the Nobel Prize has been awarded for achievements in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and for peace. The Nobel Prize is an international award administered by the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm, Sweden. In 1968, Sveriges Riksbank established The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, founder of the Nobel Prize. Each prize consists of a medal, personal diploma, and a cash award.
The ceremony will last one hour from one 3-4pm and thereafter there will be opportunities for the media to arrange interviews.

1984 - Physics
Prof Carlo Rubbia (Italy)
Carlo Rubbia (born March 31, 1934) is an Italian physicist. He and Simon van der Meer shared the Nobel Prize in 1984 for their decisive contributions to the large project, which led to the discovery of the field particles W and Z, communicators of weak interaction.
Rubbia was born in Gorizia, Friuli-Venezia Giulia. Around 1960, he moved back to Europe, attracted by the newly founded CERN where he worked on experiments on the structure of weak interactions. He was appointed professor of physics at Harvard University in 1970, but continued to travel to Europe frequently to work at CERN. In 1976, he suggested adapting CERN's Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) to collide protons and antiprotons in the same ring and the world's first antiproton factory was built. The collider started running in 1981 and, in January 1983, came the announcement, first from the UA1 detector, that W particles had been created. A couple of months later the even more elusive Z particles were also observed.
Carlo Rubbia is currently professor at the University of Pavia, Italy and works at a project on solar thermal energy plants in Spain.
1986 - Medicine
Senatrice Rita Levi-Montalcini (Italy)
Rita Levi- Montalcini (born 22 April1909 in Turin) is an Italian neurologist who, together with colleague Stanley Cohen, received the 1986 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of growth factors.

In August 1, 2001 she was appointed as senator for life by the then President of the Italian Republic, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. She actively takes part to the Upper House discussions, unless busy in other academic activities all around the world.
Levi-Montalcini is currently the oldest living laureate and, after Tadeusz Reichstein and Hans Albrecht Bethe, the third-longest-lived laureate.
1988 - Physics
Prof Jack Steinberger (Germany)
Jack Steinberger (born 25 May 1921) is a German-American physicist. He co-discovered the muon neutrino. He, with Leon Max Lederman and Melvin Schwartz, won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1988 for the neutrino beam method and the demonstration of the doublet structure of the leptons through the discovery of the muon neutrino.
Steinberger was born in the city of Bad Kissingen in Bavaria, Germany, but left at the age of 13, due to the increasing anti-Semitism of the rising Nazi party. He moved to the United States, where he lived for many years, before moving to Switzerland to work at CERN. He is well known for giving his Nobel Prize to New Trier High School of which he is an alumnus.
1994 - Economics

MEPs to debate forthcoming key EU-Russia Summit
2007-05-04 - 15:45
The session starts at 4pm on Wednesday 9 May (Europe Day) with Council and Commission statements on the forthcoming EU-Russia Summit. MEPs will debate the summit which will take place on 18 May in Samara, Russia. Russia's recent reaction to Estonia's decision to move a memorial statue is likely to feature strongly. MEPs have parliamentary co-operation committee with Russia and is chaired by Ria OOMEN-RUIJTEN (EPP-ED, NL). On the recent repression of demonstrations in Russia, on 26 April, the European Parliament strongly condemned the use of excessive force by the Russian anti-riot police during last weekend's peaceful demonstrations in Moscow and St Petersburg, and calls on the Russian authorities to comply with their international obligations and to respect freedom of expression and freedom of assembly.
Parliament adopted a resolution on 13 December 2006 on the last EU-Russia Summit held in Helsinki in November 2006. MEPs stressed that a robust defence of human rights and democratic values should be a core principle of any EU engagement with Russia; urges the Commission to send a clear signal to all parties involved that these values will not have a subsidiary status in the EU-Russia negotiating package. The European Parliament has invited Gary Kasparov to the European Parliament and he is expected to visit in May.
Russia is the EU’s largest neighbour, brought even closer to the EU by the 2004 enlargement. The EU’s main objective is to engage with Russia to build a genuine strategic partnership, founded on common interests and shared values to which both sides are committed in the relevant international organisations such as the UN, Council of Europe, and OSCE, as well as with each other in the bilateral Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. These interests and values include in particular democracy, human rights, the rule of law, and market economy principles.
Energy
Energy products represent more than 60% of Russia’s overall exports to the EU, which is equal to more than €60 billion annually. 60% of Russia’s oil exports go the EU, representing over 25% of total EU oil consumption. In addition, 50% of Russia’s natural gas exports arrive in the EU, representing over 25% of total EU natural gas consumption. Also, Russia is an important supplier of nuclear fuels to the EU. There is a strong interdependence between the EU and Russia regarding energy. Large amounts of investment are necessary in the near future in safe and efficient production and transport of energy, as well as in energy efficiency both in the EU and Russia. The required investment will only happen if favourable framework conditions are put in place. This is a joint challenge for the EU and Russia, and energy will therefore remain high on the EU-Russia agenda for the coming years. Council and Commission statements - EU-Russia Summit

Call to bring Europe's foreign policy in line with citizens' wishes
2007-05-04 - 15:45
The European Union must bring its foreign policy goals in line with its citizens' wishes, says a report being put forward by the Foreign Affairs Committee. It emphasises the need for internal steps, such as implementing certain measures proposed in the Constitutional Treaty, and external priorities, for example the fight against poverty, in order to have a common European voice in international affairs. The own-initiative report by Elmar BROK (EPP-ED, DE) on the annual report from the Council on the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) in 2005, suggests that the EU's foreign policy "should target a limited number of areas which better connect with the wishes and concerns of European citizens and their expectations of the role to be played by the Union in international affairs." It particularly emphasises that "much more should be done from an external action perspective to halt the spread of poverty in the world," while also naming energy security, democracy promotion and the fight against terrorism as important goals. On non-proliferation issues, the report specifically expresses its concern "regarding the first test of an anti-satellite weapon carried out by China in January 2007."
The Constitutional Treaty and CFSP financing
"Without the Constitutional Treaty, [...] the European Union cannot shape a foreign policy that can at least partially meet the most important challenges," says the committee. Members argue in favour of a mutual assistance clause, an office of Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the establishment of an EU Diplomatic Academy.
On the issue of the CFSP budget, MEPs in the committee regret that "that the specific article within the CFSP budget chapter devoted to European Union Special Representatives does not avoid the proliferation of envoys of that kind," which the committee thinks undermines the role of the Commission's delegations on the ground. Furthermore, the committee is unsatisfied with the fact that "the new Interinstitutional Agreement does not change the existing rules on ESDP operations, such as the principle that 'costs lie where they fall'," which in effect places the financial cost of any military operation on the Member State who provides the troops to accomplish it. This is a disincentive for governments to pledge troops, and could be avoided if such operations were financed directly from the EU's budget, the report argues.
Improving European Parliament oversight
The committee also stresses the need to involve the EP more closely in the elaboration and oversight of CFSP goals. "The Council's practice of merely informing Parliament and submitting a descriptive list of CFSP activities carried out in the previous year, instead of really consulting Parliament at the beginning of each year [...] constitutes a de facto infringement of the very substance of Article 21" of the EU treaties, says the report. It therefore calls for more active consultation of the Parliament on the CFSP in general, while also calling for additional powers, for instance "by conferring on Parliament the authority to appoint, and dismiss, the Counter-Terrorism Coordinator and the Directors of SitCen, the EU Satellite Centre (EUSC) and Eurojust."

Reforms in the Arab world: a European perspective
2007-05-04 - 15:45
Any outside attempt to impose reforms, without the partner countries having a sufficient stake in the processes and means employed to achieve them, “is bound to fail”. This is the key tenet of a report on “Reforms in the Arab world: what strategy should the European Union adopt?”, in a report by Michel ROCARD (PES, FR) for the Foreign Affairs Committee. As MEPs in the committee see it, the EU, in defining its position on reforms in the Arab world, must take account of cultural, historical and political differences, whilst at the same time respecting the will of Arab peoples. Forcing them to copy European models “may prove to be counterproductive” argues the Committee report. Change, in order to be legitimate, must be supported by the peoples concerned, and supporting the development of civil society and respect for fundamental rights “must not be confused with the choice of regime nor with the procedures for choosing leaders”, argues the report.
Given that the weakness of reform efforts in the Arab world stems partly from disputes between various states, reads the report, “the EU should make every effort to facilitate the political and economic integration of the Arab countries”, and in so doing, it should avoid “any feeling of superiority or the impression of giving lessons”.
Encouraging reform
Bearing these caveats in mind, the report goes on to urge the Commission “to give more encouragement in the Arab world to the movement for the reform of the rule of law by legal means” and to “political reform seeking to legalise the action of opposition movements on the basis of the existing institutions.”
Citing the need to engage with reform movements at the regional level, the report also calls for Europe “to give visible political support to the actors in civil society, in associations and in religious life, and in particular to those political organisations which promote liberal democracy by non-violent means, excluding sectarian forces but including, where appropriate, moderate Islamists and secular actors.”
The committee nonetheless stipulates that efforts to engage with the Arab world “should not include persons, organisations and states which condone terrorist activities and deny the State of Israel’s legal right to exist.” Elsewhere, the report notes that “the current path of political Islam does not appear to be providing appropriate answers to the problems of political reform”.
Freedom of religion and the fight against terrorism
The report voices hope “for greater commitment on the part of Arab countries to religious freedom, or the right of individuals and communities to freely profess their beliefs and practise their faith.”
Whilst acknowledging that the fight against terrorism is an important aspect of the Euro-Arab relationship, the report stresses that it is vital “that the fight against terrorism does not overshadow or hold back a host of other topics of common interest.” To this end, the Committee calls on the EU to encourage exchanges of students, teachers, academics and researchers between European and Arab countries and to facilitate such exchanges “through an adapted and more flexible visa regime”.

Blind-spot mirrors should be fitted to older lorries too, says Transport Committee
2007-05-04 - 15:45
The Transport Committee will ask Parliament to approve a first-reading report calling for blind-spot mirrors to be "retrofitted" to heavy lorries in operation since 2000. This would cost €100 - 150 per lorry but could save up to 1,200 lives in Europe by 2020. Each year, 400 Europeans - many of them children on bikes - are killed when lorry drivers changing direction at a crossing or roundabout fail to see them in a blind spot around the vehicle.
Under a 2003 EU directive, new lorries must be equipped with blind-spot mirrors from 2007 on. But the Transport Committee, endorsing a Commission proposal for a directive, says that these mirrors should be also be fitted to older lorries, i.e. those registered as from 1 January 2000.
At current replacement rates, the EU population of some 5 million lorries (not counting those owned in Romania and Bulgaria) would not be entirely replaced until 2023. Until then, the danger to vulnerable road users, particularly children, would continue. Rapporteur Paolo Costa (ALDE, IT) regards this as unacceptable.
The Transport Committee - which adopted Mr Costa's report by 38 votes to 0 with 3 abstentions - therefore wants owners to be legally obliged to retrofit these mirrors to heavy lorries in operation since 2000.
The committee also has a key difference with some Transport Ministers since it believes the implementation deadline - currently two years - to be too generous, given that Member States already have a year to transpose the directive into national law. To prevent any delay in retrofitting, the committee proposes a clear final deadline: 30 June 2008.
"Delaying the introduction of the measure would reduce its effectiveness and the beneficial effects of its implementation, which are to save lives. An extra 1,200 lives could be saved up to 2020 if implementation were to start from 2008, and the societal costs would be €2.4 billion", according to Mr Costa.
MEPs do not anticipate any practical problem in retrofitting lorries registered after 2000. The estimated cost would be € 100 - 150 per lorry, i.e. the cost of one stop at a petrol station.
The committee points out that Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark have already implemented national retrofitting schemes. It also favours accompanying measures, including awareness-raising campaigns for all road users, and would welcome the collection of data in order to provide a more comprehensive analysis and a better strategy for preventing blind spot accidents.
Finally, the committee says that a study should be commissioned on the desirability of bringing other types of vehicles, and in particular smaller goods vehicles, within the scope of this legislation.
A package of compromise amendments has been agreed with Council, which, if approved by Parliament's plenary, will allow the legislation to pass at first reading.

Transport
More competition in public transport - but with safeguards
2007-05-04 - 15:45
Parliament will be asked to vote at second reading on new rules on public passenger transport services by rail and by road which seek to rebalance the award of contracts for these services between the public and private sectors.
The aim of the regulation - which is prompted by the trend to greater involvement of the private sector in public transport - is to overhaul rules on the awarding of public service contracts for passenger transport by repealing old EU legislation and replacing existing national rules on competition in the public transport sector with standard Europe-wide rules.
EU rules would be laid down on: contracts between authorities and operators; compensation of operators for fulfilling public service requirements; exclusive rights; managing competition; and transparency. The key concept of “controlled competition”, which is half-way between complete deregulation and a closed market, would be introduced.
To prevent public authorities awarding long-term franchises to operators with whom they have close relationships, the draft regulation proposed that firms be invited to tender for five-year contracts.
At its first reading on 14 November 2001, Parliament adopted a package of amendments, designed partly to safeguard public services and the rights of transport workers. Among other things, MEPs voted for greater continuity of contracts, which they said should be allowed for eight years for bus services and 15 years for rail.
The Council, having been unable to agree a common position for six years, finally did so in 2006, partly as the result of a revised Commission proposal which takes account of Parliament's amendments and introduces greater subsidiarity for the Member States . On the question of length of contracts, it followed Parliament's thinking, going even further and stipulating a maximum of ten years for contracts for coach and bus services (but still fifteen years for rail).
Parliament's rapporteur, Erik MEIJER (GUE/NGL, NL), is now broadly satisfied with the situation and at second reading the Transport Committee is proposing relatively small amendments which are believed to be acceptable to Council.

Small manufacturers and disabled users to benefit from new road vehicle standards
2007-05-04 - 15:45
At a second-reading vote on Vehicle Type Approval, the Internal Market Committee will ask Parliament to back new rules on the manufacturing standards of road vehicles. These will raise environmental and safety standards as well as making it easier for producers to sell their vehicles Europe-wide. Thanks to MEPs, the legislation will take more account of the needs of disabled car users. European Community Vehicle Type Approval rules date back to the 1970s. The benefits include consistency of environmental and safety standards and a level playing field for companies wishing to sell across Europe, reducing potential barriers to trade.
Cars have been able to take advantage of a single European Type Approval legislation for a number of years; however the new legislation will introduce it for buses, coaches, trailers and trucks, where previously only national approval was available.
Overall this directive will have major benefits for vehicle safety, environmental performance and European competitiveness. It is a further important step in the completion of the internal market.
Higher safety standards
To obtain approval, manufacturers will have to comply with stricter technical requirements and some devices will become compulsory, including ABS (anti-blocking systems for brakes), new and more efficient rear mirrors, improved light-signalling, edge protection and anti-splashing devices for tyres.
Small manufacturers can produce more with simpler test procedures
The revised legislation will also benefit companies that produce cars at relatively low volumes - generally manufacturers of more specialist cars. They will now be able to produce 1000 cars per annum with simplified and less expensive test procedures; double the previous figure of 500. This will save small manufacturers from disproportionate costs and encourage newcomers to the market.
Special rules for wheelchair accessible vehicles
Under the new legislation, buses and coaches will have to provide easy access to persons with reduced mobility.
The Internal Market Committee and its rapporteur, Malcolm HARBOUR (EPP-ED, UK), have persuaded the Commission and Council to accept amendments to the legislation so that wheelchair accessible vehicles (WAVs) will have their own category of safety testing specifications, thereby giving them clear rules and unlimited production numbers.
According to Mr Harbour, "This is a fantastic result for the disabled consumer and for the manufacturers of these vehicles. We have given a boost to this important industry whilst ensuring that the safety of these vehicles is in no way compromised".
Lastly, the Internal Market Committee wants to bring the directive into line with the new rules on comitology, to ensure Parliament has a say in any technical details decided after the legislation is passed.

Consumers
More choice of package sizes for shoppers
2007-05-04 - 15:45
Parliament will vote at second reading on plans to deregulate package sizes for pre-packed products. If this legislation is passed, many everyday consumer products could be sold in a wider range of sizes than at present. Parliament's report has been drafted by Jacques Toubon (EPP-ED, FR) for the Internal Market Committee. By deregulating current rules for all but a few basic product groups, the EU is aiming to optimise competition for industry and provide more freedom of choice for consumers. The legislation would permit industry to produce goods in a potentially infinite range of sizes by preventing Member States from legislating on pack sizes other than those still regulated by European law. There is no question of banning the pint of milk: producers will be free to determine what sizes should be sold.
Changing consumer needs
In the 1960s different national rules on nominal quantities of pre-packed products (pack/bottle sizes) were a major barrier to trade in such goods between the EC Member States. There was thus a need to harmonise these sizes.
At the same time, there was a concern not to impose the new Community rules on companies that worked only on the national market and did not intend to export to other Member States. Harmonizing regulation was therefore “optional”: Member States had to adopt the Community rules but were allowed to keep existing national rules for the national market. Only products meeting Community rules could be sold freely throughout the EC.
However, for some products (e.g. wine, spirits) total harmonisation was introduced: Community sizes were made mandatory for everyone, i.e. all national sizes were abolished.
Given changes in the retail industry and consumer preferences, the European Union has taken a fresh look at the situation. The aim of the new directive is to relax the rules on pack sizes in general while keeping standard sizes for a limited range of products.
First reading: Parliament seeks more exemptions
In its original draft legislation, the European Commission had proposed to retain mandatory sizes for a handful of goods (spirits, wines, soluble coffee, white sugar and most products sold in aerosols).
At its first reading, the European Parliament welcomed the broad thrust of the legislation but voted to apply mandatory sizes to a further six product groups: drinking milk, butter, ground or unground roasted coffee, dried pasta, rice and brown sugar.
Second reading: MEPs seek to split the difference with Council
In its common position, the Council rejected Parliament's amendments, instead setting a transitional period of five years for phasing out existing national sizes for domestic production of milk, butter, coffee, dried pasta and rice, and six years for EU-wide rules on white sugar.
At its second reading on 10 April, Parliament's Internal Market Committee voted to accept most of these provisions but asked that national rules should also continue to apply to pre-packed bread and white sugar throughout the EU. All the institutions agree that mandatory sizes should continue to apply to wines and spirits.
The committee would also like the Commission to revisit the legislation at a later date in the light of market developments after the directive takes effect.

Taxation
Call to scrap mandatory minimum excise duties on alcohol
2007-05-04 - 15:45
MEPs will debate a report calling for minimum levels of duty for alcoholic drinks should be scrapped. Instead, says the Economic Committee, Member States should adopt a code of conduct that encourages them to move towards the EU average level of duty. In 1992, the then 12 EU Member States unanimously agreed to set minimum levels for excise duties on beer, spirits and other alcoholic drinks apart from wine. The aim was to reduce the market distortions caused by widely differing excise levels. The Commission is now proposing that these minimum levels (which were set as absolute amounts, not as a percentage) should be increased in line with inflation since 1992.
The Committee, however, in a report by Astrid Lulling (EPP-ED, LU), argues that the minimum levels have failed to achieve the desired convergence in excise duties, and that they should therefore be scrapped. Instead, MEPs in the committee are proposing a code of conduct which would encourage Member States with duties above the EU average to freeze and gradually lower them, and those with duties below the average to consider raising them by an appropriate amount. In both cases, Member States could take into account their general economic situation - which would enable, for example, those countries hoping to meet the Maastricht criteria for joining the euro not to increase their inflation rates by quickly raising excise duties on alcohol.
The report was adopted in committee with 19 vote in favour, 15 against and 2 abstentions and will now be debated and put to the vote by the full Parliament.
As is usually the case for taxation policy, Parliament's view is consultative and any decision on whether to increase, reduce or scrap the minimum levels of duty will require unanimous agreement between the Member States in the Council.

Petitions
Denmark urged to act over 1968 nuclear air crash
2007-05-04 - 15:45
The House will be asked to support a resolution tabled by the Petitions Committee calling on Denmark to take belated action in relation to the alleged health consequences of the 1968 crash in Greenland of a US plane carrying nuclear bombs.
On 21 January 1968, a US B-52 bomber with several nuclear weapons on board crashed near the Thule Air Base in North-Western Greenland, releasing several kilos of weapons grade plutonium. The plutonium contaminated the immediate snow and ice at the crash site and was carried by high winds and water over an extensive area.
After clean-up operations - in which Danish workers volunteered to participate alongside US personnel - the US conducted regular medical monitoring of its air force staff. No similar monitoring was conducted by the Danish Government of the Danish civilian workers or the Greenlanders, many of whom continued to work at the Thule base and live in the area for several years thereafter.
Petition to the European Parliament
Parliament is looking at this issue as the result of a petition sent in by a Mr Jeffrey Carswell, who was involved in arranging for the removal of contaminated debris, was later diagnosed with cancerous conditions relating to the oesophagus and stomach and has had eight major operations. He argues that his health problems are linked to radiation contamination following the crash and that many Thule survivors developed similar radiogenic conditions.
Mr Carswell complains that the Danish authorities failed to evacuate the workers from the site at the time, to warn them or to inform them about the extensive radiation, or to make the necessary follow-up medical tests and examinations, as required by Council Directive 96/29/Euratom on safety standards relating to ionising radiation. He also says Denmark has refused to allow public access to the 1968 scientific records of the case.
Recommendations of EP Petitions Committee
A key legal question is whether the Euratom Treaty applies to this case, as Denmark was not a member of Euratom in 1968. Both the European Commission and Denmark have consistently refused to recognise the applicability of this treaty. The Petitions Committee believes it does apply. In its draft resolution, the committee says it "doubts that the Kingdom of Denmark has fully complied with its obligations under Directive 96/29/Euratom in relation to the Thule crash and its after-effects". It therefore calls on Denmark to initiate surveillance and intervention measures in relation to the after-effects of the crash and to make arrangements for the monitoring of exposure.
The committee also calls on the European Commission to bring forward a proposal addressing the public health and environmental implications of the use of nuclear energy for military purposes, given that existing EU law appears to be lacking in this area.

European legislation in the field of information and consultation of workers
2007-05-04 - 15:45
On Thursday 10 May, the House will vote on a resolution on strengthening the European legislation in the field of information and consultation of workers. Parliament voted to add a resolution on this topic following the request by Stephen Hughes at the last plenary session in Strasbourg on 23 April. Stephen HUGHES (PES, UK) said: "Mr President, we are delighted that there will be a statement on Wednesday evening from Commissioner Špidla on information and consultation. We would certainly like an opportunity to table a motion for a resolution to recall the often-repeated position of this Parliament: we think that the European Works Council Directive needs to be reviewed. We understand the position of our Liberal colleagues, however. They would prefer to hear what the Commissioner has to say before pinning themselves down to a resolution. We therefore request that the motion for a resolution be attached to the statement, but not voted on until the next mini-session in Brussels." Stephen HUGHES PES GB Motions for resolutions

Development and cooperation
Committee on Development calls for African solutions to African conflicts
2007-05-04 - 15:45
The EU has an important role in helping strengthen "Africa’s ability to prevent, manage and resolve African conflicts", according to report produced by the Committee on Development. The report, written by Filip KACZMAREK (EPP-ED, PL) focuses upon EU relations in the Horn of Africa and stresses the need to "resolute steps to counter impunity in the region, arms trafficking, human rights abuses, violations of ceasefires and attacks on civilians, peacekeepers and humanitarian workers." The report also expresses "deep concern about the backlash, particularly in Ethiopia, "against opposition leaders, journalists, human rights activists and ordinary people [.]"
Developing "African solutions": A regional approach
In the report, the committee calls for the appointment of an "EU representative for the Horn of Africa ", as well as pressing for further progress to be made by Commission and the Council to establish "an EU Delegation to the African Union (AU) based in Ethiopia", alongside the Commission Delegation in Ethiopia. Regional representation is important in developing "solutions to be achieved with the involvement of the regional organisations in place, AU and Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)." The report however warns of the need to "strengthen these organisations through capacity and institution building", particularly in the areas of "conflict prevention and conflict resolution."
Reducing poverty
The states in the Horn of Africa have "a common development agenda which require common efforts to be made and the mobilisation of the political leadership and the societies in these countries", the report states. These concerns must be addressed through "conflict-sensitive joint actions aimed at finding common solutions", which can be achieved by "organising initiatives and regional cooperation around clearly identified issues of common concern [.]" Such concerns include "refugee flows, border control, food security, natural resources, energy, the environment, education, infrastructure, arms control and gender equality."
Climate change and sustainable development
The report is concerned about the "severe repercussions of climate change", in particular about specialists' predictions that "Africa...will suffer the most from global warming due to its underdevelopment and poverty." The sustainable management of natural resources must therefore be "integral part of development plans and of strategies for fighting poverty and preventing conflict in the Horn of Africa region."

Regional policy
EU funding for better housing?
2007-05-04 - 15:45
A lack of decent, affordable housing directly affects EU citizens, by restricting their options for social integration and mobility, in both urban and rural areas. But EU funding is available to help, e.g. in redeveloping public areas, improving safety, preventing delinquency, encouraging efficient use of water and energy, and supporting social integration. In the new Member States, it may already be used to make housing more accessible and this should be considered for old Member States, too. So says an own-initiative report drafted by Alfonso ANDRIA (ALDE, IT).
Many European cities face soaring housing purchase and maintenance costs. Yet at the same time report, urban sprawl is adding to mobility problems (congested public transport, reliance on private cars) energy consumption, and pollution.
Although the EU has no specific powers over housing, the European Regional Development Fund regulation for 2007-2013 would allow structural aid for housing in urban (re-)development projects, in areas of the new Member States that are threatened by physical deterioration or social exclusion, says the report.
This EU funding could help to revive urban areas with an integrated mix of measures to redevelop public areas, improve safety and prevent delinquency, and use water and energy more efficiently.
For the fifteen countries that were in the EU before 2004, the report seeks to reopen the debate on "extending access to Community funds for renovation of social housing to all Member States, in order to save energy and protect the environment, currently foreseen only for certain countries, given that housing needs are critical throughout Europe".
Structural fund aid should form part of an integrated strategy on housing, so as to ensure that any steps to promote access to housing, improve building quality, improve the quality of life and enhance the attractiveness of urban and rural environments are taken simultaneously.
The report advocates, inter alia, identifying EU-wide minimum quality indicators defining "adequate housing", strengthening the right to housing benefit so as to ease worker mobility , and giving cities a greater role in planning and managing the use of structural funds for housing projects.
It also encourages the EIB group and the Commission to establish a strategy for boosting the building sector, chiefly in the new Member States, which would constitute structural aid for developing housing and mobilise local and regional resources geared to urban projects.

Regional policy
Maximising the impact of cohesion policy?
2007-05-04 - 15:45
Recommendations for maximising the economic and social impact of cohesion policy in regions across Europe are set out in this own-initiative report by Francisca Pleguezuelos Aguilar (PES, ES). Cohesion policy is set to become the EU's largest budget item, and this report has one eye on the EU budget review agreed for 2008/2009. As approved in committee, this report, inter alia:
· stresses the need to develop an integrated structural policy, i.e. one that consistently combines support from the structural and cohesion funds with other Community policies. It also urges the Commission to explore new ways of combining structural policies with other Community policies, so as to build synergies that can boost competitiveness, research and innovation;
· calls on Commission and Council to assess whether earmarking at least 20% of structural funds for R&D and innovation for the next programming period is viable, not forgetting the small projects that drive sustainable development in less-favoured regions;
· proposes using local and regional "technology facilitators" (financed by the structural funds and using existing resources such as Euro Info Centres and Innovation Relay Centres), to foster innovation by firms;
· encourages the Commission to analyse the structural funds' leverage effect in attracting private investment, and underlines the need for public/private co-operation;
· urges all stakeholders to seek to secure a territorial balance between urban and rural areas, encourage an integrated strategic approach to the development of urban, suburban and rural areas, and exchange good practice, especially within networks for improving the management of funds;
· proposes using "relevant indicators" to measure the impact of structural policies on cohesion, and enabling the European Spatial Planning Observatory Network to do this. Suggested territorial cohesion indicators include employment rate and quality, GDP disparities among neighbouring regions, decentralisation and accessibility, infrastructure and transport provision, product diversity and the level of research/innovation, education and training activity, and
· calls on the Commission to consider ways to raise the visibility of support measures, including by monitoring the application of mandatory publicity measures more closely and taking steps to remedy any serious breach. Rapporteur Francisca PLEGUEZUELOS AGUILAR PSE ES Procedure : own-initiative

Regional policy
Regional policy recipe for EU innovative capacity
2007-05-04 - 15:45
Providing equal access to education at all levels, ensuring that thinkers have very cheap (or free) broadband internet access to scientific, economic, legal, cultural and administrative information, enforcing intellectual property rights, and fostering cross-border co-operation among regional academic and business stakeholders, are key ways in which regional policy makers can help build the EU's innovative capacity, says an own-initiative report by Mieczyslaw Edmund Janowski (UEN, PL).
"People should be the focus of all innovation action" says the report, and therefore it is essential to create the conditions which "boost people's ability to think in an innovative, creative way." This includes "the opportunity to develop their scientific and intellectual capacities, and also to provide comprehensive support for the advancement of young researchers."
Access to information
The report suggests that, with the increasing importance of the Internet, an "essential precondition for innovation capacity building" in Europe should include "unhindered and free – or extremely cheap – broadband access" to administrative, scientific, legal and cultural information, "subject to proper respect for intellectual property principles [.]"
In addition to broadband access, the report suggests that the flow of information could be improved by the creation of "joint one-stop information shops", set up by "regional and national authorities, in cooperation with sectoral bodies, such as Chambers of Industry and Commerce and other Infocentres."
Intellectual Property
As well as encouraging "invention-related activities and, by extension, to patent- and licence-related activities", the reports also calls for improved efforts to "introduce a European patent and ensure respect for copyright (intellectual property rights strategy), and to vigorously and effectively to combat plagiarism and counterfeiting, and to work towards global solutions in this area, based predominantly on European models."
European Institute of Technology
Establishing the European Institute of Technology (EIT) would present a "new opportunity that would prevent the 'brain drain' and give talented European researchers a unique chance to perform scientific research at the highest level", and "boost the Community's competitiveness and potential in the 'knowledge triangle' formed by innovation, research and education."
Public-private partnerships (PPPs)
Regional and local authorities should, the report says, looks for ways to "implement pro-innovation investments and projects", and in particular should "promote and make greater use of solutions involving public-private partnerships (PPPs)." The report adds that there is a strong need for "an extensive system of PPPs to supplement the public financing made available by the Member States and the Community [.]"
The role of national and regional authorities
The report stresses that "red tape should be radically reduced" and calls upon national and regional authorities to "make extensive simplifications and, wherever possible, standardise administrative procedures [.]" By taking the "innovative action that is essential in the services sector" and through the "effective implementation of pro-innovation policy", Member States can develop an "innovation-friendly environment" that will boost research and development within the EU.

Energy
50 years on, Euratom Treaty remains an "indispensable legal framework"
2007-05-04 - 15:45
The European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) Treaty, which was signed 50 years ago on 25 March 1957, continues to provide a "sound legal framework to govern the supervision of the use of nuclear energy in the European Union", according to a report drafted by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. The report, written by Eugenijus MALDEIKIS (UEN, LT) states that the Euratom Treaty has led to nuclear energy producing, in 2006, "32 % of Europe’s electricity, that is, the largest share of non-carbon electricity in the European Union and one of its most competitive sources." The report adds that the provisions laid out in the Euratom Treaty "make an important contribution to the safe operation of nuclear facilities in Europe [.]"
Flexibility
The Euratom Treaty remains applicable thanks in part to "the significance of Article 203 of the Euratom Treaty, in that it offers flexibility...to undertake legislative initiatives not initially provided for in the Euratom Treaty", according to the committee. Furthermore, there is "a need to examine how Article 203 could be used to develop new initiatives and, possibly, to make adjustments" to the Treaty in order to bring it in line with the nuclear industry as it exists today.
This ability to modify the Euratom Treaty in this way is important in addressing what the report identifies as an "absence of a legislative corpus on harmonised standards with real added value, particularly in comparison with the existing international framework, for nuclear safety, the management of radioactive waste and the decommissioning of nuclear plants [.]"
The energy debate
The provisions of the Euratom Treaty remain "at the heart of the debate on... energy issues (particularly from the supply angle), at a time when the European Union is seeking to define a European energy mix that is low-carbon, competitive and as far as possible ‘home-grown’ [.]" The treaty means that the nuclear industry must adherence to "specific nuclear control procedures", as set out in the "dedicated legal framework...which for 50 years has demonstrated the usefulness of all its provisions [.]" Rapporteur Eugenijus MALDEIKIS UEN LT A6-0129/2007 Assessing Euratom - 50 years of European nuclear energy policy Procedure : Own-initiative
