Open bin with food waste Â©BELGA_SCIENCE EP wants proposals before year-end Wants governments to encourage environmental awareness The EU produced more than 100 million tonnes of garden and kitchen waste last year and most of it went to landfill or was incinerated. MEPs want the EU to exploit the economic and environmental benefits of this waste through more recycling, separate collections and composting. On 6 July, they also called for EU-wide rules as some countries are lagging behind in recycling efforts.
Parliament's resolution follows a European Commission Green Paper on the management of bio-waste in the EU. MEPs argue that a specific directive for bio-waste would offer greater clarity, better monitoring and legal certainty.
What the EP wants
Separate collections for bio-waste unless impossible for economic or environmental reasons
More recycling of bio-waste
Classification of the different types of compost available from bio-waste
MEPs are also urging governments to "promote environmental awareness-raising activities" to change behaviour. They want new rules proposed by the end of the end of the year.
What is bio-waste?
biodegradable garden waste like grass
Food and kitchen waste from houses, restaurants and shops
Waste from food processing plants
Where do we stand?
The amount of bio-waste going to landfills has declined in the past 10 years because of EU rules requiring that bio-waste is diverted away from landfill sites. But l andfill/burying still accounts for about 40% of all EU bio-waste, with big differences between countries, for example Poland and Lithuania still bury around 90%.
Some 47% of bio-waste is incinerated in Sweden and 55% in Denmark.
There are separate collections in Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, parts of Belgium (Flanders), Spain (Catalonia) and Italy (northern regions). Austria and Germany have the highest composting rates.
Landfill has the worst environmental impact, while separate collection, incineration and composting are the best available solutions.
