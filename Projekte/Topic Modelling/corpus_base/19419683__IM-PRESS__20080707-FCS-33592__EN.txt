WTO head Pascal Lamy and IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn (bottom) Rising prices and the depressed state of the world economy has meant that economic issues have never been far from people's minds this year. Given this MEPs have frequently discussed rising prices and the economic slowdown and what can be done about it. Here we republish several stories that deal with the issues and interview some of the key international figures - such as WTO head Pascal Lamy - who are involved in them.
Inflation, rising prices and the role that international trade can play in reviving Europe's and the world's economy are just some of the issues dealt with in this focus.

MEPs Goebbels and Hökmark: inflation and how to curb it
The cost of eating is fuelling the cost of living - bread prices have tripled Rising food prices and oil at over $100 a barrel pushed euro-zone inflation to a record 3.6% in March. In the EU it is 3.8%. This is eroding wages and hurting people on fixed incomes. Speaking to MEPs on 21 April ECB vice-president Lucas Papademos said such euro-zone inflation would persist for some time. We asked two MEPs on the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee - Socialist Robert Goebbels and Gunnar Hökmark of the centre right EPP-ED - how Europe can curb inflation.
A sign of how fast inflation is rising is that in September last year it stood at 2.1% in the euro-zone. Across the Union as a whole there are wide differences with the Netherlands having the lowest rate at 1.9% and Latvia the highest at 16.6%.
Inflation "still comparable to 10 or 20 years ago"
Breakneck economic growth in China and Asia more generally is driving food and fuel prices higher. As Robert Goebbels - who has represented Luxembourg in Strasbourg since 1999 - says, "the Chinese and people in some other countries have started eating meat. Around 60% of the agriculture production goes into feeding cattle."
"Combating inflation will be difficult with the high food and oil prices. Governmental policies of fighting climate change by rising energy prices will finally affect consumers' spending," he said.
Swedish Member Gunnar Hökmark is more positive about current trends: "we still have rather low inflation thanks to better competition in number of markets and the effects of globalisation, which supplies more products for lower prices. Even if interest rates have been increased during the last one and a half year, they are still comparable to 10 or 20 years ago."
Call to keep VAT low
The Swedish MEP went on to say that "it is not a coincidence that some of our new member states have higher inflation. They have good opportunities to have high growth. Growing economies in the new member states need buildings, new factories, new investments and that creates a demand push. And thus they are contributing to higher average inflation EU-wide."
The role that governments and the EU are playing in pushing up inflation was stressed by Mr Goebbels. "Differences in inflation rates nationally partly reflect administrative price rises, taxes and governments pushing up prices on a local level. For example, Luxembourg adjusts the prices of certain public services twice a year on the basis of an index. This is why the inflation in Luxembourg is higher than in some neighbouring countries."
He added, "the EU should stop pushing for VAT raises for a while. The European Commission is asking new Member States to raise excise taxes on gas, oil and diesel to harmonise taxation within the Union. The European Commission should try to avoid tax increases and the increase in administrative prices."
Mr Hökmark urged governments to embrace reform - "governments play a most crucial role in keeping inflation and interest rates down over the long term. Reforms are needed to make sure that we have good competition in different sectors. The authorities should take public finances under control to stop them from stimulating inflation."
Are higher interest rates the answer?
Inflation increases when more money circulates. When interest rates increase, people invest less due to higher credit costs and prefer to save in banks which offer better savings rates. Higher interest rates can "suck" the money from the market, tackling inflation and cooling growth.
Mr Goebbels urged the ECB to continue keeping interest rates steady: "I hope they will stick to the current level of 4%. Imported inflation cannot be combated by raising interest rates!" Mr Hökmark would like to see politicians kept out of the decision-making process, "the ECB should judge by itself how to implement interest rate policy. This is not supposed to be a matter for political consideration. We need the most rational decision based on cold equations."
Should people get higher wages?
Whilst the rate of inflation is eroding s purchasing power, there are calls for higher wages to compensate. However, many economists believe that higher prices will stimulate higher prices and thus boost inflation in a "price-wage" spiral.
Mr Goebbels calls for a measured approach - "it is the Union's role to defend the purchasing power of ordinary people. But this could lead to a price-wage spiral. We need a balance".
Mr Hökmark ends on a moderately optimistic note. "In general the average purchasing power of EU citizens is increasing, mainly thanks to economic growth. Growing in purchasing power is counterbalanced to a certain extent by price-rises. However in absolute terms, we still can buy more then before. In the last decade we had more growth than inflation."
In June the president of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, will have a question and answer session with the Economic and Monetary Affairs committee - one of the four times he comes to the parliament a year.

IMF chief Strauss-Kahn: financial crisis will continue to hurt real economy
IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn on financial crisis: "worst news is behind us" The head of the International Monetary Fund Dominique Strauss-Kahn told MEPs on that the impact of the financial crisis would continue to be felt for some time. He said he thought the crisis itself had passed its nadir, although to avert new dangers renewed global financial regulation was needed. In a Q&A on 15 May with the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee he also voiced fears about the impact of high food prices and its impact on growing children. Here, in his own words, are his views.
Strauss-Kahn on the spread of the financial crises
It is a new type of crisis, which means we don't know what type of crisis we will have in the coming years. Housing prices in the USA are still going down. There is no sign of stabilisation. If the causes of the crisis are still there, then so are the consequences: bad debts, problems in the financial system and transmission from the financial systems to the real economy.
Neither Europe nor the emerging markets are de-coupled from the US economy and cannot therefore avoid the impact of the US slowdown. Though in the case of China and India, growth will still be huge, if slower than before.
And his forecast for the near future
Is the worst behind us - the worst of what? If we mean the worst of the financial crisis itself, than it may be the case. It was once famously said of the consequences of the French Revolution that it is too soon to tell. The same is true of this financial crisis. Nevertheless there is good reason to believe that the largest part of disclosure in financial institutions has taken place, especially in the USA but also in Europe. So the worst news is behind us.
The main problem is the linkage between this financial crisis and the real economy. And this is not behind us. These linkages are protracted - the influences on consumer and investment behaviour, the possible credit squeeze in different parts of the world. Optimists say until the end of this year, pessimists say until mid-2009. Nobody knows exactly.
His views on supervision of the financial markets
What can we do to avoid this crisis coming returning? The Financial Stability Forum has produced a very comprehensive report. They make recommendations for enhancing the resilience of markets and financial institutions, for example: strengthened prudential oversight of capital, liquidity and risk management, enhancing transparency and strengthening the authorities’ responsiveness to risks. But how to implement these and how make sure they are implemented?
It is not enough to implement them correctly just in developed countries, because of globalisation. If you do not have the same supervision elsewhere, you achieve almost nothing.
To implement this kind of practise you need a universal institution, like for example the IMF, to deal with this. We need to disseminate what has been done by the Financial Stability Forum all over the world and then the IMF should try to control or at least to supervise the implementation of these kind of new regulations or supervision practice.
Food crisis - "people are starving"
High food prices are a huge humanitarian problem. People are starving and children are having lack of food when they are young so they have the consequences for their whole life.
We all believe the market will solve the question ultimately, but when will that be? We don't want to wait so long. We need to do something. A very good example is Malawi, where agricultural production has more then doubled in two years because a rational policy was implemented, e.g. the use of fertilizers. We really need policies that are directed to this kind of questions. We need to implement correct agricultural policy.

Economic MEPs speak on financial market turmoil
The grim view from Frankfurt in January this year Leading MEPs on the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee have given a gloomy prediction of the state of the financial markets. "After 10 long months, we see no end to the crisis...it is spreading beyond the financial sector," was how Committee Chair Pervenche Berès described the situation. We spoke to two MEPs on the committee - Dutch Socialist Ieke van den Burg and Lithuanian Liberal Margarita Starkevičiūtė. Closer supervision and control of banks are just two steps they propose.
Margarita Starkevičiūtė : The financial system provides blood for the economy. Any disruption has an impact on the real economy. Now we feel some problems in the different sectors of the body of the economy, mainly in the housing and construction sector, which influence the wealth of people.
European Central Bank response: injections or transfusion?
Over the last 10 months the ECB has been injecting liquidity into the troubled financial market. Last August it committed a first huge €95 billion loan to head-off the crisis and to help the banks. These interventions have since continued on a regular basis.
Ieke van den Burg : These are liquidity injections to be paid back in the short-term. They are also available for banks outside the Euro zone. The ECB is solving a big part of the problems in the UK.
MS : In the EU we have two different banking models. The first relies mostly on retail deposits. With the assistance of ECB or national central banks these banks can manage the crisis well, because they still have a constant source of deposits.
The second model relies on wholesale markets and uses the originate-to-distribute model. Since the wholesales markets have been disrupted because of the subprime mortgage crisis in the US these banks cannot longer have access to financing and have to find new ways to make money. This is a huge, long-term problem and the ECB or other EU central banks should not bail out these banks and act as a remedy for their long term problems.
Banks gamble, but do we end up paying the bill?
An issue that has caused some disquiet among the public across Europe has been the extent to which governments may have to use public money to bail out banks - the majority of which are private companies that make large profits when times are good.
IvdB : This is what we call moral hazard: the rewards and bonuses are private, but the losses are transferred to the community. However, we can not just say: 'Let them solve it themselves and let the shareholders bleed'. For instance, in the case of Northern Rock, if it had collapsed, the consequences would have been disastrous. That is why governments need to take measures.
Will taxpayers have to prop up the existing system?
Ieke van den Burg and Romanian Liberal Daniel Dăianu are are currenly preparing a report on the Future Structure of Supervision. It analyses market, regulatory and supervisory failures which have been highlighted by the crisis and it sets out options for reforms.
IvdB : We need tighter control on the banks and that should be focused on the big players – they form the major systemic risk for financial stability. In the EU there are around 40 of them, based mainly in London. I would prefer supervision at European level.
MS : I am in favour of so called college of supervisors approach. We need better coordination for the supervision of banks that operate in several countries. For example in the Baltic States the Nordic banks are very active. The national authorities have to give appropriate resources and rights to national supervisory authorities to make those colleges operate efficiently. It is not possible to have one single regulator which could go into detail in all the 27 states because otherwise we would have to create a huge bureaucratic apparatus on the EU level.
Call on McCreevy to be "more pro-active"
IvdB : I really regret that Commissioner McCreevy (Commissioner for Internal Market and Services) is not more pro-active and ambitious: he proposed a roadmap for improvement but this is a non-binding exercise. The Council is too focused on national interests, e.g. the UK is afraid their financial sector may have to deal with more regulation and supervision and might turn its back on the City. They are obviously blocking progress.
How can we shore up consumer spending?
MS : We have to create a good comprehensive and coherent system of deposit insurance, so that if banks fall in future, the customers will be sufficiently protected and governments won’t have to intervene. Parliament is suggesting a national financial ombudsman, like in the UK. People could apply to him when they have problems with banks it would protect their rights. Financial problems are quite complicated and an ordinary citizen does not necessarily know everything.

WTO head Pascal Lamy says trade is key to food price stability
Pascal Lamy at the European Parliament in Brussels, 29 May As food prices and climate change spread alarm in many circles, we asked Mr Lamy - previously European Trade Commissioner and appointed head of the Geneva based WTO in 2005 - what role if any the WTO can play. He said rich countries must be aware of the impact of agriculture subsidies on the third world, adding prices are rising because the world needs a better fit between rising demand and supply. He said that trade acted as "belt" between the two.
He was in parliament on 29 May to brief MEPs on the trade and climate committees. One of Mr Lamy's key responsibilities is to conclude the Doha Development round of trade talks which were launched in 2001 and were due to finish in 2005. Here we asked him his opinion on a few issues that face the world.
How can the ongoing negotiations in the WTO and in particular on agriculture - affect rising food prices and the ensuing global crisis?
The food crisis has very different components. The key is poverty - something that is not new, alas. The higher prices make it even more difficult. What the WTO may do is to be useful in getting a better fit between demand - which is stronger than before, especially grain consumption - and supply, especially the ability of some countries, notably developing countries, to increase production. The gap between the two is trade. But it is obviously necessary that rich countries understand that the subsidies they pay damage production system in some Third World countries. They must accept additional discipline. This has been evident for a long time: this crisis puts it on the agenda at an important time in our negotiations.
The problem of access to natural resources is increasing international tensions (for example China in Africa, the problem of water in the Middle East and so on). How can the WTO contribute to a more balanced sharing of resources that are increasingly sparse? There are plenty of ways to do that. Moreover we are trying to do it - it's part of the objectives enshrined in the Charter of the WTO, which dates from 1994: the opening of trade to encourage sustainable development. The first way to do that is "a bit more trade rather than a bit less". If the Egyptians had to produce all the cereals they eat, which today is very expensive, there wouldn't be a drop of water in the Nile! So, trade, from time to time, is a way to use natural resources, where they are most readily available. In addition, there are lots of things we can do with tariffs: encouraging environmentally friendly goods through customs duties, further opening the environmental services market. There are plenty of Third World countries which now have the capacity to do that.
Finally, we can go with an agreement that one day perhaps, I hope, will return to post-Kyoto and issues of climate change. These are not being negotiated at the WTO...But it is clear that the day there is an agreement that will succeed Kyoto - and it will surely be broader and probably more demanding than Kyoto - we will have to adjust. As it is, roughly, the same countries that negotiate the rules on climate change and trade rules, a priori that should not be major difficulties.
So an increase in trade does not necessarily mean increased pressure on natural resources? In some cases this is true, but there are instances where it is exactly the opposite! Take the case of "foodmiles" (the distance food travels from field to plate), for example, which explains that roses from Kenya are not good for the environment because they are transported by air. It has been calculated - and in fact the European Parliament has done this itself and understands that roses from Kenya are better in terms of climate change then greenhouse roses that come from another EU country. So we must be wary of evidence and look at all the calculations. There are cases where the price of energy is not at a good level from the viewpoint of climate change, where trade has a bad impact on climate change. And there are plenty of other cases where trade has a positive impact.
