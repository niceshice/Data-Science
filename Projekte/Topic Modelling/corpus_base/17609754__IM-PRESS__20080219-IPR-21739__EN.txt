In adopting a joint resolution on the importance of supporting measures to improve international scientific cooperation with Africa, the European Parliament underlines the need to increase the involvement of African scientists in international collaborative science and R&amp;D projects in order to keep and develop R&amp;D knowledge in Africa, in particular in specific sectors such as food, health and energy.
The House acknowledges the increasing trend amongst policy-makers in Africa to prioritise science and technology (S&T) and innovation for development.
MEPs recognise the valuable contribution of the New Partnership for Africaâ€™s Development (NEPAD), its S&T consolidated action plan and the S&T programmes of the African Union, and calls for better implementation and fuller development thereof and for the relevant measures to be improved.
Research into AIDS
Parliament recalls the special relevance given to neglected diseases within the 7th Research Framework Programme and considers that special emphasis should be placed on research into AIDS in African countries.
The House calls for the reinforcement of existing research infrastructure in accordance with the indications of the African Union and the African scientific community, including the NEPAD Office for Science and Technology, programmes of the African Union and R&D projects, in particular in specific sectors such as food, health and energy.
The House urges Member States to promote knowledge and technology transfer between the EU and Africa, together with R&D projects, under a new coherent framework for action to achieve immediate and long-term goals for sustainable development, and accordingly develop policy and resources.
Finally, the European Parliament calls on the European Union and the Member States to ensure greater consistency between the EU's international science and technology policy and the basic needs of African countries, thus leading to the development of a new global framework for science and diplomacy with Africa.
