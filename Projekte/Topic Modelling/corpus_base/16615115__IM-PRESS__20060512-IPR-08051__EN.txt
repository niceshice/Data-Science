All the way for Marco Polo II
Transport
2006-05-17 - 17:57
If no action is taken, total road freight transport in Europe is set to grow by more than 60% by 2013. Parliament therefore adopted, by a large majority, the report by Reinhard RACK (EPP-ED, AT) on the Marco Polo II programme. This programme for 2007-2013 aims at shifting the average yearly increase of international road freight towards short sea shipping, rail and inland waterways. The adoption of this first reading report concludes the procedure and means that it will enter on 1 January 2007.
The environmental performance of the freight transport system is expected to improve substantially by Marco Polo II, which has a budget of €400 million. The Commission had proposed €740 million, but this amount was reduced to €400 million following an agreement between Council and Parliament.
Although the Commission proposals were warmly welcomed, the House adopted a range of compromise amendments tabled by EPP-ED, PES, ALDE, Greens/EFA and UEN groups aimed at strengthening the effectiveness of the programme. The reduction of the eligibility thresholds, for instance, should be reduced and SMEs should have better accessibility to Marco Polo II. The geographical coverage of the programme is the 25 EU Member States, the applicant countries, EFTA and EEA countries to the East such as Russia and Ukraine, the Balkan states as well as the Mediterranean region.
An important part of Marco Polo II is also traffic avoidance which involves encouraging the rationalisation of traffic, logistics and supply chains. The incentives have already been there for a long time in the industry. The EU's role here consists of providing encouragement and exchanging experience and best practice.
A new development is the introduction of the so-called Motorways of the Sea (MoS) action, which means any innovative action directly shipping freight from roads to short sea shipping or a combination of short sea shipping with other modes of transport. A proper use of the MoS should mean that traffic flows that normally go over land can be strategically diverted and brought closer to destinations.
The adoption of this first reading report in agreement with Council concludes the co-decision procedure after agreement was reached with Council and the Marco Polo II programme will enter info force on 1 January 2007 as planned.
