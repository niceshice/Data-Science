After a debate with the President of the European Investment Bank, Philippe Maystadt, MEPs adopted on Thursday a report which is, in general, strongly supportive of the Bank’s work.
MEPs are nevertheless presenting some suggestions for improvement, such as greater consistency in the EIB’s external mandate, a new environmental framework and the involvement of civil society organisations in developing social standards. The report was drawn up by Cristobal Montoro Romero (EPP-ED, ES).
