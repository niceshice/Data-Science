Alfred Nobel (1833-96): used profits from dynamite to set up peace prize
Thirteen Europeans who have been honoured with the Nobel Prize in the fields of peace, chemistry, physics medicine and economics will be at the European Parliament Wednesday 9 May. They will take part in a discussion on the past, present and future of the European Union from 3 to 4 pm. Taking place on Europe Day and just prior to the opening of the Plenary session, the objective is to focus on the scientific, intellectual and cultural achievements of Europeans since 1957.
Inaugurated posthumously by the 19th century Swedish inventor of dynamite, Alfred Nobel, the prizes are awarded annually. Some of the past winners include Albert Einstein (1921), Nelson Mandela (1993) and US President Jimmy Carter (2002).
Their invitation to the Parliament forms part of celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, the predecessor of the EU. Parliament's President Hans-Gert PÃ¶ttering will open the discussion with the Nobel Laureates. Among those who will attend are:
Prof. Paul Josef Crutzen who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1995, along with Mario J. Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland for their work in atmospheric chemistry, particularly concerning the ozone layer.
John Hume and David Trimble were joint winners of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1998 for their efforts to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in Northern Ireland. Notably the signature of the Good Friday Agreement that year. Mr Hume was the second leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), a position he held from 1979 until 2001. He has also served as a Member of the European Parliament and a Member of Parliament of Northern Ireland. Mr Trimble was the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party from 1995 to 2005 and member of Parliament in Westminister from 1990 until 2005. He was First Minister of Northern Ireland between 1998 and 2002.
Prof. Sir Timothy Hunt won the Noble Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2001, together with Lee Hartwell and Paul Nurse. He received the most prestigious honour in scientific research for the discovery of cyclins, a class of proteins that play a key role in regulating the process of cell growth and division.
Rita Levi-Montalcini was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1986, along with Stanley Cohen, for their discoveries of growth factors. For the last two decades, growth factors have been increasingly used in the treatment of hematologic and oncologic diseases like leukemia, aplastic anaemia and bone marrow transplantation.
Prof. Carlo Rubbia was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1984, along with Simon van der Meer, for their contributions to the project which led to the discovery of the field particles W and Z. These particles convey the weak force, one of nature's four fundamental forces.
Prof. Reinhard Selten was awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1994, along with John C.Harsanyi and John F.Nash Jr., for their contributions to game theory by their pioneering analysis of equilibria in the theory of non-cooperative games.
Prof. Jack Steinberger is a German-American physicist. In the early 1960s, Steinberger and co-researchers, Leon Lederman and Melvin Schwartz, discovered a new type of neutrino. This led to the development of a new scheme for classifying families of subatomic particles. In 1988, the trio shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery.
Prof. Martinus J.G. Veltman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1999, along with Gerard t' Hooft, for elucidating the quantum structure of electroweak interactions in physics.
Lech Walesa, one of the leaders of the Gdansk shipyard workers during the clash in December 1970 between the workers and the Polish Communist Government. In 1978 he began to organize free non-communist trade unions. He was kept under surveillance by the state security service and was frequently detained. In 1981 he was elected the first chairman of "Solidarnosc", the opposition movement which in 1989 forced the communist government to call semi-free elections. His efforts won him the peace prize in 1983. Mr Walesa became President of Poland in 1990.
Betty Williams was a co-recipient with Mairead Corrigan of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1976 for founding the Community of Peace People, an organization dedicated to promoting a peaceful resolution to The Troubles in Northern Ireland.
Finally Irene Khan will possibly represent Amnesty International , (it is to be confirmed) winner of the Nobel Peace Price in 1977. Irene Zubaida Khan (Bangladesh, 1956) is the seventh and current Secretary General of Amnesty International (since August 2001).
