European Parliament President Jerzy Buzek on Wednesday condemned last week's terrorist attacks in the Moscow underground and paid tribute to the victims of the Katyn massacre 70 years ago. Mr Buzek was speaking at the start of the special plenary session in Brussels being held to allow MEPs to debate the recent EU summit with European Council President Herman Van Rompuy and the Commission.
The special session was held to enable Parliament to discuss with Mr Van Rompuy and Commission Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič (representing President José Manuel Barroso, who was unable to attend) the outcome of the EU summit of 25-26 March which focused on economic growth and climate change.
Before turning to the summit debate, however, Mr Buzek referred to the terrorist attacks of 29 March in Moscow, saying he shared the pain of the families of the victims and he hoped the organisers would be brought to justice. He then spoke of the commemorations taking place this week to mark the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre of Polish officers in 1940, carried out on Stalin's orders. Today, for the first time, the prime ministers of Poland and the Russian Federation are paying tribute together to the victims, he said, describing this event as "an important step on the road to Polish-Russian reconciliation" and to the process of "rapprochement between the western and eastern parts of our continent".
