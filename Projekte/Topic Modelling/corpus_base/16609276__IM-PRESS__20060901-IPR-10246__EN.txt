The House decided to postpone the vote on the Martine ROURE (PES, FR) report on protection of personal data. The vote on the report will now take place during the second September Strasbourg session (25-28 September). Ms Roure proposed the delay at the request of the Finnish Presidency, so that the Council can address the issue during the planned debate on the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice at that session.
