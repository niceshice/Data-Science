Regional policy recipe for EU innovative capacity
Regional policy
2007-05-10 - 13:53
Providing equal access to education at all levels ensuring that thinkers have very cheap (or free) broadband internet access to scientific, economic, legal, cultural and administrative information, enforcing intellectual property rights and fostering cross-border co-operation among regional academic and business stakeholders are key ways in which regional policy makers can help build the EU's innovative capacity,
So says an own-initiative report by Mieczyslaw Edmund Janowski (UEN, PL), adopted by Parliament in plenary session on 10 May.
Joined-up thinking
Innovation is a "dynamic and interactive process [...] including regional and local stakeholders" says the report. So regional policy can help build the EU's innovation capacity, by combining measures in a wide variety of fields, e.g. scientific and technological, legal and financial, economic and commercial, organisational and administrative, and educational and social.
The report, inter alia:
· calls on Member States and the Commission to ensure in the EU regions equal opportunities for all citizens to access education at every level, which would boost people's ability to think in an innovative, creative way and help them to develop "ethical and pro-social behaviour patterns" ;
· calls on the Commission, Member States, regional and local authorities to maximise access to information and communication technology-based working ;
· calls on the Commission and Member States to foster the development of "clusters", as a means of establishing links among scientific research centres, education centres, business and local communities ;
· urges Member States to foster co-operation by setting up European technological platforms [...] to concentrate innovation activities by forging cross-border and cross-regional links between industry and business and scientific research and financial circles;
· calls on the Commission, Member States and regional and local authorities for comprehensive support [...] to small and medium-sized enterprises (including streamlining administrative procedures, the tax system and public supply procedures), since they are " the most creative and dynamic vehicles for technological and organisational innovation" and
· calls on the Council, the Commission and Member States to set up financing mechanisms that meet real needs, together with a system for managing the risks involved in innovative projects, and stresses the need to publicise the EIB/EIF financing initiatives JASPERS, JEREMIE and JESSICA at regional level .
