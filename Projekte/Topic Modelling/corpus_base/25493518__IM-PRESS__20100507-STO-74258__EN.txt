This year's European Parliament open day in Strasbourg on 9 May marked the 60th Anniversary of the Schuman Declaration and attracted thousands of visitors. The plenary chamber was fully occupied by "temporary" MEPs -students from all 27 EU member states, whose schools were participating in the Euroscola project giving them an opportunity to taste how European democracy works.
EP President Jerzy Buzek welcomed them, saying what a luxury it is to live in a time of peace. "We have replaced wars with European democracy."
Czech Euroscola teachers said, "we feel privileged to take part in the Euroscola project, otherwise it would be almost impossible for us to visit the European Parliament."
Among the many stands attracting long queues was that of the interpreting service. People were able to test their interpretation skills in real interpreter's booths, with speeches made in the EP by Gordon Brown, Angela Merkel, Hillary Clinton and Nicolas Sarkozy.
"I enjoyed the simulation in the interpreter's booth. This is a profession I would like to pursue, but I am not sure whether my language abilities are sufficient," Alessio, a student from Vicenza, said after trying it out.
Among other visitors, Alena from Slovakia said, "This is my first visit to the Parliament in Strasbourg and I am overwhelmed by the splendid architecture of the hemicycle" and Ioana, a Romanian student said, "It is great that Romania is part of this great European spectacle. I feel good for my country."
