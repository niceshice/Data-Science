Stay informed with RSS Since October, readers of the European Parliament's web pages have had access to RSS, which allows them to keep up-to-date with what is going on via a free subscription. At the moment, readers have access to parliament news and podcasts, but RSS will be extended to other parts of the site later. Find out more:
What is RSS?
RSS lets users know when there is something new on a site without having to connect to the site. To access the service, users have to subscribe. Subscription is free.
How do you subscribe?
Depending on your computer and preferences you can subscribe via an internet browser, a desktop-based aggregator or a w eb-based feed reader.
Web feed addresses are grouped under the RSS heading accessible in Europarl's tool box or via the link below.
What is available?
For the moment, you can access the headlines and press service parts of the site and audiovisual podcasts. RSS will be extended to other parts of the site in 2009.
