Temporary national measures to prevent the spread of rabies, tapeworm and ticks to Finland, Ireland, Malta, Sweden, and the UK are to be prolonged for the last time until December 2011. MEPs voted in favour of the prolongation on Tuesday.
These national measures apply in addition to EU-wide rules, which since 2003 have required cats, dogs and ferrets travelling between EU Member States to be identified by an electronic microchip or a clearly readable tattoo and accompanied by a passport giving proof of an anti-rabies vaccination.
To prevent the spread of echinococcus tapeworm and ticks, Finland, Ireland, Malta, Sweden, and the UK are also temporarily entitled to subject pets entering their territory to additional checks.
Without this prolongation, which was approved with 618 votes in favour, 17 against and 5 abstentions, all the measures would have expired in June 2010.
