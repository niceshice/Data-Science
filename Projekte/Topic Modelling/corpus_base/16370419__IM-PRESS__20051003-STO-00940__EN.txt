Ari Vatanen, former world rally champion turned MEP, has received the full backing of the European Parliament in his ambitious report on halving road accidents by 2010. Should the recommendations contained in the report become reality, then it could save up to 20,000 lives a year. Parliament adopted the report on 29 September after hearing an at times emotional speech by Mr Vatanen.
The MEP, who is Finnish by nationality but represents a French constituency, recalled his childhood experience of being in the car when his own father was killed: "I remember him leaning against the steering wheel...anxiety in my chest. I am sure this experience has left me with a bigger internal handicap than I dare to admit."
Road accident figures are stark and shocking. According to the European Commission's Road Accident data base (CARE), 40,000 lives are lost each year in the EU with a further 1.7 million people injured. Unfortunately, the gap between the best and worst performing EU members is widening - the Baltic States are 8 times more dangerous than the UK.
The Vatanen report advocates three approaches to improving road safety; better drivers, better roads and better cars. "If everyone wore a seatbelt, complied with the speed limit and did not drive under the influence of alcohol, fatalities would be cut by 60%," according to Mr Vatanen. This recognises that cultural and law enforcement issues (which are the preserve of EU members) greatly affect road safety.
The report also calls for more resources to be devoted to improving the design, construction and operation of the road network. This could mean greater simplification and standardisation of road signs across Europe to increase familiarity and safety. In a EuroTest 2005 survey, 91% of motorists said they would favour this move.
Although enormous strides have been taken in vehicle safety in recent years, the report advocates increasing the use of technology such as stability controls, seat belt reminders and speed limiters to improve safety.
Yet whatever practical steps may be taken, it is perhaps the culture of tolerating road accidents that needs to be changed. Addressing Parliament Mr Vatanen asked "why do we do so little" when confronted with the horror? He suggested that perhaps it is because "it's just one family crying here, another crying there." He contrasted it with the attention given to aircraft accidents.
In June MEPs lost one of their colleagues when respected Polish member Filip Adwent was killed in a car accident in Poland with his father and 19 year old daughter.
