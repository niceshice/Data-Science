Mrs Clinton was warmly welcomed by hundreds of young people from Europe and America Before the town-hall meeting with young Europeans Hillary Clinton had a formal meeting with the EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering Hillary Clinton: "I have never understood multi-party democracy. It is hard enough with two parties!" Hillary Clinton: I often find Europeans are confused about how the US government works Hillary Clinton on climate change: "The US has been negligent in facing its responsibilities" Gay-rights activist Max from Moldova caught Mrs Clinton's attention with his T-shirt The meeting room was so packed that many people had to follow the event via video conference or web streaming Over 800 young Europeans crowded into the European Parliament Friday morning for a Question and Answer session with new US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Clearly enjoying herself and buoyed up by the warm reception, she said that the US would lead on climate change policies and push for a two-State solution to the Israel-Palestine dispute. She also said that given the scale of the environmental and economic crisis this was a moment when European and Washington had to "come together".
Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering welcomed Mrs Clinton warmly: "At this critical moment we need leaders with vision, of tenacity, of experience and of judgment. Madame Secretary, I believe, that you are such a leader." In opening remarks the Secretary of State said that "Europe today is viewed by many as a miracle" as it is enjoying its longest period of peace since Roman times."
On the need for transatlantic solidarity she was emphatic: "This is one of those moments in history, when we do not have a choice, we have to come together."
Fielding questions from the floor
Mrs Clinton then held a Q&A session, fielding questions from a number of the audience on issues including the Middle East, climate change, the economy and gay rights.
On the environment she was asked by Bram, a young Belgian, how the US would reconcile economic growth with reducing CO2 emissions. Mrs Clinton said the issue of climate change could wait no longer: "Our new administration is 100% committed because you know our government had not been prior the change in the White House. We are making up the best we can for lost time."
She went on to stress the need for a concerted international response: "The question we all have to deal with is how to lead the entire world to Copenhagen. We've got to bring in China, India, Indonesia and other developing countries; it is not enough for Europe and the US to try to do something." She also quoted White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel who is on record as saying "never waste a good crisis".
Relations with Moscow
A question taken via the internet asked about the US and its likely relations with Russia. She replied that "our engagement with Russia in no way undermines our support for countries like Georgia, or the Baltics or the Balkans or anywhere else in Europe to be independent, free, make their own decisions and chart their own course without undo interference from Russia."
Referring to the recent gas crisis she said, "we also are very troubled by using energy as a tool of intimidation."
Two-State solution for Middle East
Asked about Israel-Palestine conflict by Daniel from Scotland she said supported a two-state solution, called Israeli settlements "unhelpful" and said that a Middle-East solution is her personal commitment.
Gay rights
Max from Moldavia, a gay rights activist who caught Mrs Clinton's attention in a T-shirt saying "I love Hillary" asked about the US policy concerning the rights of homosexuals.
"I can only hope that we all live long enough to see the end to this kind of discriminatory treatment and recognition that human rights are the inalienable rights of every person no matter who that person loves."
