Controversy over alleged CIA detention centres in Europe refuses to die down
After US President George W Bush revealed the existence of secret CIA detention centres in Europe for suspected terrorists, MEPs wanted clarification about the possible involvement of EU governments in the detention and transfer of prisoners by the CIA and the existence of CIA detention centres in Europe. We asked MEPs for their reactions to the latest revelations.
Following concerns that European countries were used by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners, the European Parliament set up a temporary committee in January 2006 to look into the involvement of EU governments. Just prior to the 5th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, President Bush said the CIA programme had saved innocent lives and helped to stop new attacks. He said locations of the centres will remain secret but denied allegations of torture being used in interrogations.
Shift in EP inquiry
This statement means a shift in the course of the EP committee's work. “At this stage, we should no longer be asking ‘if’ clandestine detention centres existed, but rather in which countries and with the complicity of which governments these prisons were created, and how many prisoners were taken there; and above all, what happened to them,” said Italian Socialist MEP Giovanni Claudio Fava, rapporteur for the CIA enquiry committee. He went on to say that “If it were possible, I would invite President George W. Bush to appear before our committee: he is now the best witness of the existence of the CIA’s secret prisons.” Carlos Coelho, co-chair of the committee and a Portuguese member of the Group of European People's Party-European Democrats (EPP-ED) said, “we have been criticized by many people saying our investigation was based on lies, now we have the proof that we were right."
Not all the members share their views on the implications of US President statements last week. The Italian MEP Jas Gawronski from EPP-ED group stressed that “George Bush did not admit anything, not with a sense of culpability. He just stated that prisons of CIA existed and continue existing and if they will find any terrorist they will put him there.”
Previous findings of the temporary Committee
The temporary committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for illegal activities (so-called "TDIP Committee") issued an interim report in July, part way through its investigation. The EP resolution based on this report says that the CIA was in some cases directly responsible for the "illegal seizure, removal, abduction and detention of terrorist suspects" in Europe and criticises the involvement and complicity by certain EU states. But, it also noted that the "temporary committee has so far not revealed any evidence or proof of the existence of secret prisons in the EU".
What is the TDIP Committee?
The Parliament agreed to set up a cross-party temporary Committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners during its plenary session in January. Its purpose was to ascertain whether any secret CIA detention centres were established on European territory, and whether any governments of EU states or candidate countries cooperated in the practice of “extraordinary renditions”. The temporary committee will hold its first meeting since President Bush admitted the existence of secret CIA detention centres on Thursday, 14 September, in the presence of Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos. The Committee's final report is due by February 2007.
