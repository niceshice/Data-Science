Air quality vote: MEPs declare war on dangerous dust

Power stations pump dust particles into the air
The car driving by you, the building site you walk past - these are just some of the things that pump dust into the air and into our lungs. This can cause breathing difficulties, illness and even premature death. Known as "particulate matter" (PM), levels are rising. On Tuesday MEPs agreed binding targets on the level of particles by 2015, which will also oblige EU authorities to measure and limit levels of dust particles.
Do I need to be a scientist to understand this?
No, particulate matter is solid or liquid particles that exist in the air. They occur naturally from wind-blown dust, sea spray, pollen grains, plants and insects. However, human activity also creates dust through the use of fossil fuels in industry. Mining, agriculture, construction and road traffic also contribute to the problem.
The smaller the more dangerous
PMs come in a variety of sizes, the smaller the more dangerous. They can enter the body through inhalation. While larger PMs are generally filtered by the nose and throat, smaller particulate matter can settle in the bronchi and lungs causing coughing and sneezing. The tiniest pieces can enter the lungs and even the blood system and may cause asthma, allergies, heart attacks, and premature deaths.
Larger particulates are regularly checked for and are found mainly in industrial areas although they can be blown to other areas. In the EU - Belgium, the Netherlands, Northern Italy, Germany and Central Europe have the highest rates. It is harder to measure the quanities of smaller PMs.
A report by the World Health Organisation said that "long-term exposure to current ambient PM concentrations may lead to a marked reduction in life expectancy due to increased cardio-pulmonary and lung cancer mortality".
New rules replace 5 existing pieces of law
The new legislation adopted Tuesday replaces and updates 5 existing laws. It obliges EU states to monitor and measure levels of dust particulates and introduces limits for air quality. MEPs and ministers have been discussing the new laws for over a year. German Liberal Holger Krahmer, who drafted the EP report on the issue, negotiated a compromise with EU Ministers.
Measures will be phased in as follows:
2010: target of maximum 25 micro grams per cubic meter of air over the year
2015: limit of 25 micro grams per cubic meter of air becomes binding.
2020 : limit should be reduced to 20 micro grams per cubic meter of air, subject to a 2013 review
Mr Krahmer said "the decisive progress which this recast of EU air quality legislation will bring about is that smallest particulates, will be regulated. All experts believe that they pose the greatest risk to human health".
