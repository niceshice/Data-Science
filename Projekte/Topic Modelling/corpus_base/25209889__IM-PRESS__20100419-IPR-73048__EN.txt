A written declaration calling for EU-wide breast cancer screening for women, initiated by MEP Liz Lynne (ALDE, UK) had been signed by sufficient MEPs to qualify as having been endorsed by Parliament, announced the President, thanking those who had signed.
The declaration calls for every EU member state to introduce nationwide breast screening, and for the Commission to draw up a progress report every two years.
Other MEPs sponsors of this initiative were Elizabeth Lynne, Michail Tremopoulos (Greens/EFA, EL), Lívia Járóka (EPP, HU) and Lidia Joanna Geringer de Oedenberg (S&D, PL).
Breast cancer is still the leading cause of death of women between 35 and 59, commented Ms Lynne, as she, too, thanked MEPs for their support.
