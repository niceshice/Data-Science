Marco Cappato favours the example of Gandhi
Tuesday saw MEPs debate Parliament's annual human rights report, which is partly a response to the Council of Ministers and the Commission's report on the subject published in October. The report aims to identify good and bad practices around the world. It highlights issues which the global community needs to focus upon. This year Italian Liberal MEP Marco Cappato was made human rights rapporteur. We spoke to him Tuesday prior to the adoption of the EP report Wednesday by Foreign Affairs MEPs.
Q. As we approach the Olympics, this report from the Parliament, like much of the media - devotes much attention to China's human rights. Similar problems occur in Burma but the result is not the same. Can you elaborate?
Marco Cappato: Burma has lesser strategic weight than China which has greater influence on all Asia. When we address problems in China and in Tibet, when we talk about freedom for the Tibetans, we also talk about all the Chinese. Democratisation in China would have a massive effect on the whole region - in particular Burma, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
Q. Despite the global moratorium launched by the UN last December on the use of the death penalty, this practice is still widespread around the world. Some countries even impose it for homosexual activities. What is your view?
MC: Last year was a very important one with the approval of the global moratorium on use of the death penalty and this has had a symbolic and political value because from now on these violations are part of the competences of the UN. Unfortunately, as the death penalty is an internal matter for each country, we can not work miracles. We have had some good indicators, for example in the USA, that public opinion is less and less favourable to the death penalty and also in China the crimes where the death penalty is applied are diminishing. Of course we want the abolition but we welcome all positive steps.
Q. You have proposed "Gandhian non-violence" to promote human rights. How effective could this be for ensuring that fundamental human rights are promoted and respected?
MC: This concept does not only mean non violence but it's something active like not collaborating with an authoritarian regime, a hunger strike or the sabotage of violence acts against the population. There are some successful stories like Gandhi, Martin Luther King and the Orange Revolution. I propose to declare 2010 the year of the non-violence in order to help all who fight for democracy and human rights to have the appropriate tools and capacity to allow the most efficient fight in favour of non-violence.
