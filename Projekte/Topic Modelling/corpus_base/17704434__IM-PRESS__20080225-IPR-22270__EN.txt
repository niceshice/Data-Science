Alyn Smith MEP and David Martin MEP debate Scotland and Europe
On the eve of its 40th anniversary, the Europa Institute of the University of Edinburgh was awarded funding by DG Communication of the European Parliament for the organisation of a major conference and essay competition for University students in Scotland on "The Treaty of Rome, the European Parliament and the Regions and Substate Nations of the European Union".
The funding was to highlight the specific issues related to the role of the European Parliament in the development of European Integration, in the context of the 50th Anniversary of the Treaty of Rome.
The Conference took place on Saturday 19 January 2008 at the Surgeons' Hall Complex in Edinburgh, with participants including Giuliano Amato (Interior Minister of Italy); Elspeth Attwooll, John Purvis, David Martin and Alyn Smith (Scottish MEPs); Sir Stephen Wall (former UK Perm. Rep. and Europe adviser to Tony Blair); Francis Jacobs, Head of the European Parliament Information Office in Ireland and Professor Sir Neil MacCormick (former MEP and special advisor to the Scottish First Minister).
The funded programme included an essay competition for undergraduates and postgraduates - the final essays can also be read at this site below.
