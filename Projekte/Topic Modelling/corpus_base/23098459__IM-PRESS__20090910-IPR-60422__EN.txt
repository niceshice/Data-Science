MEPs will vote on Wednesday 16 September on whether to appoint José Manuel Barroso for a second term as President of the European Commission.
The Conference of Presidents – the leaders of Parliament’s political groups and the President of Parliament – confirmed on Thursday that the vote would be held when they adopted the final draft agenda of next week’s parliamentary session in Strasbourg.
European Parliament President Jerzy Buzek said:
"Today's meeting of the Conference of Presidents came to a clear decision, which sends a strong signal to the citizens of Europe. In this time of economic crisis, we can not afford to continue in a political vacuum. We need to be able to move forward, deciding whether or not Mr Barroso will be Commission President for the next five years.
Mr Barroso will now seek the support of a majority of MEPs in the vote next Wednesday in Strasbourg. His 'political guidelines' and discussion with the individual political groups have been widely appreciated by MEPs and set an important precedent for the future."
Mr Barroso will debate his plans for a possible second term in office with Parliament on Tuesday. The vote on whether to elect him as Commission President will take place the following day at midday.
