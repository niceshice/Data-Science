Graphic about youth employment Growing unemployment especially among the young has been one of the worst consequences of the current economic crisis. Youth unemployment has risen to an unprecedented high level, especially in Eastern and Southern Europe, as can be seen in the infographic. This Wednesday MEPs will discuss what can be done to boost employment and kick-start the economy.
Topic of debate will be the Annual Growth and employment Survey in order to prepare the European Council meeting on the 1-2 March 2012.
The European Parliament underlined five priorities in the report on the contribution to the Annual Growth Survey 2012:
1. pursuing different growth-friendly fiscal consolidation
2. ensuring long-term financing of the real economy
3. promoting sustainable growth through more competitiveness and investments
4. tackling unemployment and the social consequences of the crisis
5. modernising EU public administration
The issue of increasing youth unemployment and inactivity was highlighted in the report EU Employment and social situation. French Christian-Democrat Jean-Paul Gauz√®s stressed in his report that tackling youth unemployment is a priority of the Parliament and he called on member states to develop comprehensive strategies for young people who are not in employment, education or training.
In her report Dutch Green MEP Marije Cornelissen called attention to the importance of reducing precarious forms of employment among young people, such as temporary contracts, part-time jobs and unpaid internships.
