The rights of bus and coach passengers in Europe were boosted by an agreement on new EU legislation reached on Tuesday night between Parliament and Council representatives. Compensation for delays or damaged luggage will be a key feature of the legislation. Thanks to MEPs, disabled people and those with reduced mobility will have more rights.
The regulation proposed by the Commission in December 2008 seeks to give bus and coach passengers rights comparable to those existing in other modes of transport, which are already covered by EU legislation on passenger rights.
In this latest legislation, MEPs took account of the economic realities facing road transport companies, many of which are small or medium-sized firms, but insisted they be obliged to provide assistance and information to passengers as well as compensation for death or physical injury. Compensation for lost or damaged luggage will be up to €1200.
Assistance in the event of delays
Bus service operators must inform their passengers of any timetable or route changes and provide meals and drinks if delays are long. If overnight accommodation is needed because a service has been suspended, the operator must pay for up to two nights (€80 maximum per night).
Refunds and compensation
If passengers are not allowed to board a bus or if departure is delayed by over 120 minutes, they can demand a full refund of their tickets or alternative transport to their destination. If the operator is unable to provide alternative transport, the traveller is entitled to additional compensation of 50% of the price of the ticket. Exemptions are allowed only in the event of natural disasters or extreme weather conditions.
Assistance for passengers with reduced mobility
MEPs defended the requirement for bus and coach companies to provide assistance to any person who is disabled or has reduced mobility, provided the passenger informs the company of his/her needs 36 hours before departure at the latest. If the operator is unable to provide suitable assistance, the passenger with reduced mobility may be accompanied at no extra cost by a companion of their choice. Any loss of or damage to wheelchairs or other assistance equipment must be compensated by the company or the management body of the station responsible.
Compensation rules applicable only to services over 250 kilometres
To secure an agreement with negotiators of the Member States - a "balanced compromise rather than an ideal one" in the words of EP rapporteur Antonio Cancian (EPP, IT) - MEPs agreed that the rules on compensation should apply only to long-distance services over 250 kilometres (as opposed to the 500 kilometres initially demanded by the Council).
The EP delegation to the negotiations was led by Vice-President Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou (EPP, GR). Last night's compromise will now be put to a plenary vote in February. The regulation will enter into force two years after publication in the EU Official Journal
