The Budgets Committee today approved €10.5 million in European Globalisation Adjustment Fund aid to over 3,000 people in the Netherlands who lost their printing and publishing sector jobs last year due to the economic crisis. It also approved €13 million in EU Solidarity Fund aid to Ireland, after severe floods in November 2009. Both decisions need to be confirmed by Parliament in plenary session and the Council.
Financial assistance to the 3,058 former workers in the publishing and printing industry in the Netherlands will total €16.2 million, of which the EU is to contribute €10.5 million from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF). The aid will help them to find new jobs through measures including recognition of prior experience, training and re-training, job-to-job accompaniment and support for business creation. Barbara Matera (EPP, IT), investigated the cases in six reports.
The €13 million in EU Solidarity Fund aid to Ireland will help remedy the effects of severe flooding in November 2009. The flooding caused severe damage to the agricultural sector, residential properties and businesses, to the road network and other infrastructure. The Irish authorities estimate the total direct damage caused by the disaster at €520,9 million. The Solidarity Fund will contribute support worth €13,022,500 million. Reimer Böge (EPP, DE), wrote the report on this case.
Following the committee's green light, the measures still need to approved by the full Parliament, in votes scheduled for the 22-25 November plenary session, and the Council of Ministers.
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was established to provide additional support for workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation or the financial crisis and to assist them with their reintegration into the labour market. Its annual ceiling is €500 million.
The Solidarity Fund is intended to show solidarity with the population of regions struck by disasters. Its annual ceiling is €1 billion.
