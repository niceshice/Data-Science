The Dalai Lama spoke to MEPs Thursday about the importance of happiness and universal human values. The Buddhist spiritual leader also touched on the plight of Tibet.
In the last event of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue at the parliament, the 14th Dalai Lama, speaking without notes, said that his main concern is to promote human values and religious harmony. Welcoming him to the Parliament, President Hans-Gert PÃ¶ttering said, "Your non-violent approach provides an extraordinary example of committed and peaceful campaigning for a worthy cause".
