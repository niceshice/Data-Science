Still a long road to Lisbon
How can Europe move forward to achieve the objectives set in Lisbon to be the most competitive knowledge based economy in the world by 2010? The European Parliament hosted a meeting this week to discuss "best practice" to ensure growth and jobs with 150 national parliamentarians from 29 countries.
National parliaments have a key role because many of the steps that will be needed to drive growth and employment will be at a national level. Some crucial factors identified at the meeting are to promote innovation, research and development and to involve citizens more in the process. " We can set objectives but we need people to believe ," said Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel, for the Austrian presidency. The meeting also highlighted energy, support for small- and medium-sized enterprises and the completion of the internal market, notably via the services directive, as key issues. The two-day conference was the second interparliamentary meeting organised on the Lisbon Strategy. The first meeting took place in March 2005.
When EU Heads of state- and government met in Lisbon in 2000, they set a target of 3% average annual economic growth and the creation of 20 million jobs by 2010. The results at the half way stage were disappointing. Consequently, the spring 2005 EU summit decided to refocus and relaunch the Lisbon strategy. An important aspect was to get commitment from all the main players, in particular the Member States, to take greater ownership of the project.
What is the situation in January 2006? The President of the European Parliament Josep Borrell noted that while estimated growth of 2.1% of GDP for 2006 is better than last year it remains below expected growth in the U.S. In addition, unemployment will be around 8.8%. Nevertheless, he identified some grounds for hope: " We have defined the Lisbon strategy in more specific and realistic terms. The open method of coordination has provided us with an instrument for public action that combines the European dimension with national realities. There is growing agreement on the benefits of the 'flexicurity' model [the combination of flexibility on the labour market with of social security for the individual]. We also know that social cohesion without competitiveness is unsustainable and that competitiveness without social cohesion is not viable ."
One of the main innovations of the revised strategy is the call for each EU country to draw up a national reform programme with a clear list of measures. All 25 have now been analysed by the Commission. Their main macro-economic priority is to deal with the viability of public finances in the face of ageing populations, while on the micro side they emphasise research and entrepreneurship. EU Commission President José Manuel Barroso told the meeting that "the plans are generally a sound basis for progress - and we will propose remedies for the gaps. "
The European Parliament will put forward its views on the Lisbon strategy ahead of the summit in March.
