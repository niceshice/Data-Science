The News: Cheap Internet for Europeans? After nearly 2 years of legislative work the Telecom Package is due to be put to a final vote in Parliament on 24 November in Strasbourg. Under a deal reached between MEPs and Council negotiators earlier this month public authorities will only be allowed to cut users' internet access after a “fair and impartial” procedure including the user's "right to be heard".
Long negotiations between the Parliament and Council have led to an agreement under which if an EU member state authority wants to cut a user's internet access, a judicial or administrative authority must apply strict procedures, securing the users right to defend themselves.
Only "appropriate" measures
From the start of negotiations, Parliament has demanded the establishment of adequate procedural safeguards for internet access, in line with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Restrictions on a user's internet access may now "only be imposed if they are appropriate, proportionate and necessary”.
Swedish Pirate MEP Christian Engström , who for years have been fighting for internet users rights, said after the compromise was reached: "To be honest, I never thought this would happen. It is not everything that we would have wanted in the best of worlds, and this is not the end of the fight for a free and open internet. But it is a much bigger step in the right direction than I would have dared to hope for."
What happens next?
Parliament's final vote is scheduled for 24 November. Parliament and Council may only approve or reject the current proposal, they may not amend it. If Parliament or ministers decide not to approve the legislation, the electronic communications framework directive will not be adopted. That means to make any changes to the existing rules, the Commission will have to come up with a new proposal.
