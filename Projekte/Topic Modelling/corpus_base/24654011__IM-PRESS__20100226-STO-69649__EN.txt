Graduates at the Rhenish Friedrich-Wilhelm University, Bonn, Germany ©Belga/J Schulzki Graduate unemployment is reaching unprecedented levels, partly due to the economic crisis, but there are other issues at play. So what is the problem and should businesses and universities cooperate to get the sort of degrees industry is looking for.
A European Parliament hearing on 23 February considered the issues. Hungarian MEP Pál Schmitt, who is drafting a non-legislative report based on a Commission Communication on "University Business Dialogue" said, "we are witnessing the greatest crisis since World War II with high unemployment 50% and in some countries 80% of the young graduates not getting a job in the first years after university which creates major problems".
"Is it a problem of the quality of the degrees or is it the private sector that has too high expectations?" he asked. Spanish Socialist Teresa Riera Madurell (who is drafting an opinion for the Industry Committee) said, "in time of crisis it is most difficult to find jobs. This is the time to truly boost the cooperation between universities and business."
"Time to rethink universities' strategy"
Professor Róbert Gábriel, rector of the University of Pécs in Hungary said "it is time to rethink the universities' strategy of how to serve society. Universities have to be much more flexible than they were before."
Mr Schmitt called for "mobility not only among students between countries, but also between businesses and universities."
"Companies could be involved in setting the curriculum in universities and in the practical training of lecturers, but could also organise in companies. That is a mutually efficient collaboration," Mr Schmitt said. He also stressed the importance of lifelong learning.
Culture Committee Chair Doris Pack said "the EU can offer a platform, an area in which we can get cooperation internationally, nationally and regionally. I hope we can promote this cooperation."
The Schmitt report is on the April 2009 Communication by the Commission "A new Partnership for the modernisation of Universities: the EU Forum for University Business Dialogue". The Culture Committee will vote on the report on 23 March.
