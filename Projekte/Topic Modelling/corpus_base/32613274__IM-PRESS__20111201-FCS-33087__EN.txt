MEPs voting in plenary The European Parliament is almost half way through its seventh term and it has been quite a turbulent two and a half years with the economic crisis. As we reach the mid-point between elections we look back at some of the key legislation approved by MEPs, including the economic governance 6-pack, financial supervision, wide-ranging consumer protection rules and passenger rights.
In the first section we look at a raft of legislation on economic and financial affairs, followed by sections on transport and consumer protection. We also ask if rules meant to cap bankers' bonuses were successful or not

Economic and financial issues

In September 2010 it approved three new supervisory authorities and a "Systemic Risk Board" to limit risk-taking by financial institutions, while a "six-pack" of measures to tackle dangerous fiscal deficits and surpluses in the member states got a final stamp of approval this September.
In September 2010, the EP approved three European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) and a Systemic Risk Board with the aim of creating a stronger and more stable financial sector in the EU. The ESAs have been operational since January 2011.
Supervisory authorities with decisive powers
The new ESAs for banking, securities and insurance and occupational pensions can impose temporary bans on risky financial products and activities and impose decisions directly on financial institutions like banks if national supervisors fail to act. They also monitor how national supervisors to ensure they are meeting their EU obligations and can issue instructions to them if necessary.
Early warning system to identify market risks
A European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) will be set up monitor economies and warn of the build-up of risk in the EU economy through a common set of indicators that will allow it to rate the risk of cross-border financial institutions. The aim is to identify risks in the system at an early stage and respond better to emergencies by reinforcing supervision at an EU level, helping to ensure financial stability.
Economic 6-pack
After tough negotiations with ministers the EP finally approved the "six-pack" of laws aimed at tightening economic governance in the EU in September of this year. The legislation deals with fiscal issues, including a reform of the EU Stability and Growth Pact and includes new regulations to detect and address macroeconomic imbalances within the EU and the eurozone. There will be increased surveillance, not only of deficit and debt levels, but also of macroeconomic imbalances like housing bubbles, loss of competitiveness and trade imbalances. The aim is to prevent problems and sanctions will be semi-automatic with fines for fraudulent practices. More on financial supervision Economic governance feature

Boat and bus passenger rights
New rules covering boats and buses mean passengers will be protected whatever mode of transport they take in the EU, particularly disabled people who have the right to free assistance at ports and bus stations.
From 2012, people travelling by boat carrying more than 12 passengers will:
have the right to be rerouted or cancel their trip and get a refund if a journey is cancelled or delayed for more than 90 minutes;
compensation of 25%-50% of a ticket price if a journey is delayed;
free accommodation of up to three nights at up to €80 a night for stranded passengers;
From Spring 2013, bus and coach passengers on journeys of 250 km or more will get:
compensation of 50% of a ticket price if a journey is delayed for more than 120 minutes, full refund in case of cancellation;
up to 2 nights free accommodation (€80/night) for stranded passengers;
refund, with a ceiling of no less than €1200, if luggage is lost or damaged;
Road charges for lorries
From 2013 member states will be able to charge lorries air and noise pollution costs with the revenue generated being used to improve the performance of transport systems and cut pollution.
On average, 3-4 cents per vehicle/km may be added to charges for using transport infrastructure to cover the external costs of road haulage, starting with air and noise pollution. The new rules will cover all motorways and all vehicles of over 3.5 tonnes.
Cross-border traffic offenders
In July MEPs approved new rules on information exchanges between member states about cross–border traffic offenders.
The new system will take effect in 2013 and fines and method of payment will be determined by the rules in force in the country in which the offence took place. These include speeding, drink-driving, non-use of a seat belt, failing to stop at a red light, driving under the influence of drugs, failing to wear a safety helmet, use of a bus lane and illegal use of a cell phone while driving.
Air accident investigations
Air accident investigations should be more effective and independent following legislation adopted in September 2010, which requires the investigation is conducted free of pressure from regulatory or other authorities.
It also aims to reinforce the rights of victims and their relatives requiring airlines to produce a list of those on board within two hours of an accident.

Consumer protection and healthcare

Online consumers better protected
Under new rules adopted by EP in June products ordered online must be delivered within 30 days and there can be no more hidden charges - the total price must be displayed before a sale is concluded. In addition, consumer will have a 14-day withdrawal period in which to change their minds and return goods bought online, aside from digital downloads like film, music and software.
Better labelling
In July, the EP approved rules meaning food labels will include information on nutritional value (energy content, fat, saturated fat, carbohydrates, sugars, protein and salt), allergens and country of origin . Existing rules on providing information on the origin of beef, honey, olive oil and fresh fruit and vegetables will be extended to fresh meat from pigs, sheep, goat and poultry.
In May, the EP voted to make to compulsory for labels on textiles to indicate whether they contain real fur or leather. Allergy sufferers, for whom fur is a potential health hazard, will be among the beneficiaries.
Raft of rules on health
Some 60,000 patients are on EU organ transplant waiting lists and every day 12 people on those lists die, but thanks to a directive approved by MEPs in May 2010 they should face shorter waiting times. MEPs insisted on "the highest possible protection of living donors" and said donations must be "voluntary and unpaid" to combat trafficking.
New rules, approved in February, should stop fake medicines from entering the legal supply chain. There are new safety and traceability measures, as well as penalties for counterfeiters, which also cover internet sales. In the event of fake medicines getting to patients, an alert must be given within 24 hours.
Pharmacovigilance of medicinal products for human use has been stepped up following a vote in September 2010. EU and national web portals will have to provide information about medicinal products and proven side effects. Patients will also be able to report side effects directly to national authorities.
Patients have the right to seek medical care in another EU country , according to rules adopted in January 2011. EU citizens will be reimbursed for healthcare received in another member states as long as the costs would normally have been covered in their own country. Authorities may require that patients seek "prior authorisation" for treatment requiring an overnight stay in hospital or specialised healthcare.
The rules concern patients who choose to have treatment abroad. For people who fall ill and require urgent treatment when visiting another EU country the European Health Insurance Card scheme applies.

Tougher rules on bankers' bonuses to rein in financial speculation
Skyline of the City of London at night ©BELGA_MOODBOARD Although many financial institutions are still in business only because they have been bailed out by taxpayers, their bosses continue to enjoy generous bonuses. The pursuit of short term profits by bankers, which would have the effect of boosting their bonuses, placed the stability of many banks at risk and was identified as one of the main causes of the crisis. The Parliament thus decided to rein in the bonuses, with 2011 being the first full year of the implementation of new rules.
Shifting focus to the long-term
"The EU law is directly designed to tackle the incentives for excessive risk taking which contributed to the financial crisis," says Arlene McCarthy, the British Socialist who guided the new rules through the EP. "By limiting the upfront cash portion of bonuses to 30%, 20% for larger bonuses, and requiring payouts to be linked to risk and adjusted if investments turn bad, bankers can no longer think just about the short-term rewards, they also have to take account of the long-term risks of their actions."
New rules mandate that in place of upfront cash, 40-60% of any bonus must be deferred and can be recovered if investments do not perform as expected. Moreover at least 50% of the total bonus should be paid as "contingent capital" - funds to be called upon first in case of bank difficulties.
EU does not regulate salaries
Despite the crisis, bankers are still earning a lot of money. One survey says that an average London banker will this year take home a bonus of around €23,000. Is this fair while most employees who, as taxpayers, have been bailing out the banks face stagnating wages and cuts? "EU law does not regulate peoples' wages, but introduces a structure to cut excessive risk taking , " McCarthy says, but she warns that banks must prioritise building up their capital to protect savers and taxpayers from losses, rather than paying out excessive bonuses.
Commenting on recent efforts by banks to put their business on a firmer footing by raising fresh capital, McCarthy says it is essential for Europe's economic health that banks meet capital requirements by retaining bonuses and dividends and not by cutting lending, as that will only drive the EU deeper into economic recession.
