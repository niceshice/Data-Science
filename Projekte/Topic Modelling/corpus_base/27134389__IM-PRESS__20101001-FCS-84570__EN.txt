Cuba's Guillermo Fariñas wins Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought

Cuban dissident Guillermo Fariñas awarded prize Barred from attending by Cuban authorities Empty chair marks his place Parliament's human rights prize since 1988 Named after Soviet dissident Cuban independent journalist and political dissident Guillermo Fariñas has become the latest international figure to win Parliament's Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. Unfortunately the Cuban authorities barred him from attending and his place was taken symbolically by an empty Chair. Nevertheless we were able to speak to him by phone from Cuba where he affirmed his determination to resist the Cuban regime. In this focus we carry that interview and look at other aspects of the prize.
The timing of the award (which is usually formally given in the December Parliamentary Session) is to coincide with the anniversary of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights which was signed on 10 December in 1948. The prize is named after Soviet scientist Andrei Sakharov who was internally exiled in the Soviet Union for his opposition to the USSR's nuclear programme and its repressive policies. He was later elected a member of the free Russian Parliament after the Soviet Union had collapsed.
Mr Fariñas has conducted 23 hunger strikes over the years to protest against the Cuban regime and censorship in Cuba. He was nominated by the European People's Party (EPP), the European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR) and by Edvard Kožušník and 91 other MEPs. The final award came after he received a majority of the votes cast.

Guillermo Fariñas: "Previous Sakharov awards to Cubans revived the opposition"

He was unable to come to Europe to receive the Parliament's Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought as the Cuban authorities are still barring the winner from leaving the country. Instead, a symbolic empty chair marked the spot. He spoke to us of his resolve to oppose Cuba's government regardless of the personal sacrifice that may involve. He also urged the EU to hold firm and take a tough stand against the regime. Mr Fariñas spoke of his unwillingness to seek exile in Spain as his "battle" for freedom lies in Cuba.
How do you feel about being awarded the Sakharov Prize and following in the footsteps of Nelson Mandela and Aung San Suu Kyi?
I feel very committed, especially about my country and my fatherland. I feel a great responsibility in receiving this prize.
Why did you choose the hunger strike as a tool of protest?
I turn to this method only if I have no other choice, because my health has deteriorated badly. I have a thrombosis on the left side of my body, so if I am forced to go on hunger strike, I will have little chance of surviving. Nevertheless if the regime's repression brings me to an unbearable situation, it doesn't leave me much choice but to die with the most dignity possible.
Do you think the EU should change its policy towards Cuba?
No, but I believe that the EU should toughen its policy. In particular, it should maintain its common position and not negotiate with a government that has already betrayed it. Remember that in the past it made commitments to the EU, before it received economic help from Venezuela, and began to improve human rights.
Then, just as Chavez's regime emerged, the Cuban government left negotiations with the EU and held to its autocratic position. I think that the EU should not fall into the same trap again and listen to the siren song of the Cuban government that they need time to change, but look for a series of objectives and say: "if you don't keep your promises, we will not negotiate with you".
You are the third Cuban to receive the Sakharov Prize in the past eight years. Do you think the previous awards changed the political situation in Cuba?
I think so. I believe that in the case of Oswaldo Payá, it forced the government to acknowledge that they did not respect their own laws or the Constitution. It was very important because, until that moment, this had never happened publicly. This showed the world that the Cuban government does not even obey its own laws, not to mention international law.
Regarding the other winner, "Ladies in White", the situation changed because after the wave of repression in 2003, the dissident movement was paralysed, especially the peaceful actions taking place in the street, so the Ladies in White established a pattern with their pain. Therefore, I think those were very important awards because they revived and reactivated the opposition movement, which with one blow, in three days, had been reduced to immobility. Ladies in White laid the foundation so that despite the injustices, despite threats, despite the exiles, people were no longer afraid.
What does the Sakharov Prize mean for you?
The main significance of this award is that for the first time the Cuban government, despite its manoeuvres to get the support of the Spanish government - and to some extent - the Holy See, was forced to cede on a humanitarian basis to internal factors, something that had never occurred before. The government always tries to show that its conflicts do not have anything to do with its own people, but with other countries or blocs. In this case, the imminence of my own death, and the international condemnation of Orlando Zapata's death, put the government in a very difficult position. Then, a fairly credible mediator such as the Catholic Church had to come and try to soften the discredit towards the Cuban state.
Why did you reject the option of exile in Spain?
I won't go to Spain or anywhere else. I do not aspire to be exiled under any circumstances. I respect all my brothers who decide to follow this path, but I believe that we have to battle here. God willing, I will stay alive; God willing, I will not be killed by the minions of the Castro dictatorship. But I think we have to battle here, since - speaking in military terms - the main hub is here, in Cuba.
There was an empty seat in the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony and now for the Sakharov Prize. How do you rate this?
We agree on having an empty chair, but that seat should bear a Cuban flag. I would like to send a message to all EU citizens who are represented in the EP: never stop watching and caring about the Cuban situation, because each day there are more signs of social explosion, even between Cubans who are not formally involved with the opposition movements. At any time, the Cuban government, made arrogant by 52 years of absolutism, is capable of slaughtering my compatriots and the EP and those it represents must stand ready to condemn and take action.

Empty chair in Strasbourg for Guillermo Fariñas
The place where Cuban dissident Guillermo Fariñas would have sat had he not been blocked from attending by Cuban authorities. He called on MEPs to "not allow themselves to be deceived by the siren songs of a cruel regime Calls for the release, without banishment, of all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience Cuban dissident Guillermo Fariñas, this year's winner of the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, had to be represented by an empty chair at the prize award ceremony on Wednesday as he did not receive permission to leave his country and travel to Strasbourg to receive the prize.
"Even though activists like Guillermo Fariñas are persecuted and are imprisoned, their voice cannot be silenced. The role of the European Parliament is to amplify that voice", said European Parliament president Jerzy Buzek.
"The Sakharov Prize is the trademark of the European Parliament in the fight for human rights all over the world. The empty chair for this year's laureate Guillermo Farinas is the best example of how important this fight is", added the president.
Addressing MEPs in a recorded message, Mr Fariñas expressed his gratitude to the European Parliament "for not abandoning the Cuban people in these more than 50 years of the struggle for democracy". He explained that he had accepted the Sakharov Prize for the Freedom of Thought "because I feel myself to be a tiny part of the rebellious spirit that nourishes the people I am proud to belong to."
Mr Fariñas criticised the government in Havana, saying "Unluckily for those who misgovern us in our own homeland the fact that I cannot leave and return voluntarily to the island where I was born is, in itself, the most irrefutable witness to the fact that unfortunately, nothing has changed in the autocratic system ruling my country."
He called on MEPs to "not allow themselves to be deceived by the siren songs of a cruel regime practising 'wild communism'" when analysing EU policy towards Cuba. According to Mr Fariñas, a change of direction in these relations should only occur if the following five pre-conditions are met:
the release, without banishment, of all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience, with a public commitment never to imprison non-violent political opponents;
an end to the violent beatings of and threats to the peaceful opposition;
an announcement that all Cuban laws that contravene the Universal Declaration of Human Rights will be reviewed and repealed;
granting the means, in daily practice, for establishing opposition parties, mass media not subordinate to the 'State socialism' system, independent trade unions and any other kind of peaceful social bodies;
public acknowledgment that all Cubans living in the diaspora have the right to take part in Cuba's cultural, economic, political and social life.
Guillermo Fariñas
A doctor of psychology and a journalist, 48-year-old Guillermo Fariñas has denounced the Castro regime. He is the founder of "Cubanacán Press," an independent press agency aimed at raising awareness of the fate of political prisoners in Cuba.
Mr Fariñas has spent years in confinement and has gone on hunger strike 23 times so far as a non-violent means of fighting oppression in Cuba. His efforts to secure free internet for all earned him a Reporters Without Borders Cyber-Freedom Prize in 2006.
In July 2010, Mr Fariñas nearly died after a five-month-long hunger strike he began on 24 February, following the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo, a fellow political activist who passed away after 80 days of hunger strike. He ended the strike after the Cuban government gave in to his plea and released 52 political prisoners.
Guillermo Fariñas is the third winner from Cuba to receive the €50,000 prize, after Oswaldo José Payá Sardiñas in 2002 and Ladies in White in 2005.
Empty chair ceremony - not the first time in the European Parliament
This is not the first time that the Sakharov Prize has been awarded in the absence of the laureate. In 2008 China's most prominent human rights activists, Hu Jia, was also not able to take part in the ceremony as he was incarcerated, but a video message from his wife Zeng Jinyan was played to MEPs. For other winners, such as Aung San Suu Kyi in 1990 and Damas de Blanco (Ladies in White) in 2005, close family members or representatives took part in the ceremony but up to now the winners have still not received the prize in person.

The Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, named in honour of the Soviet physicist and political dissident Andrei Sakharov, has been awarded by the European Parliament every year since 1988 to individuals or organisations who have made an important contribution to the fight for human rights or democracy.

Andrei Sakharov - the man behind the prize
Russian physicist Andrei Sakharov (1921-89) pictured in 1979, the year he criticised Soviet involvement in Afghanistan ©Belga 2010 winner decided by MEPs on 18 & 21 December Formal award mid-December Laima Liucija Andrikienė MEP to draft EP reaction to Annual Human Rights report By the time of his death in the Moscow winter 20 years ago, Andrei Sakharov had built an international reputation as a nuclear physicist, human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner His fears over the implications of his work led him to call for peaceful coexistence and later for human rights in the USSR. This led the European Parliament to found a human rights prize in his honour. In his 1968 essay on peace he wrote that "intellectual freedom is essential to human society".
Andrei Sakharov: A life in dates
1921: Born in Moscow on 21 May, his father was a physics teacher.
1942-47: Graduates with distinction in physics, awarded a PhD
1948: Included in a group of prominent Soviet scientists whose job was to develop the atomic then hydrogen bomb.
Late 1950's: Sakharov becomes concerned about the moral implications of his work. Steadily becomes an advocate against international nuclear proliferation and supports the 1963 partial test ban treaty.
1967-68: The turning point in Sakharov's life. In 1967 he writes to the Soviet leadership to urge them to accept US proposals for a rejection of anti-missile defence as he believes it will lead to an arms race and a greater risk of war. His pleas are ignored and the following year he puts these fears in an essay "Reflections on Progress, Peaceful Coexistence and Intellectual Freedom" in which he wrote: "Freedom of thought is the only guarantee of the feasibility of a scientific democratic approach to politics, economics and culture".
The essay's underground distribution and publication abroad turn him into a dissident: "I was removed from top secret work and 'relieved' of my privileges in the Soviet 'Nomenclatura,'" Sakharov recalled later.
1970: Helps found the Moscow Human Rights Committee.
1975: Awarded the Nobel Peace Prize - his wife Elena Bonner makes the acceptance speech.
1979-80: Criticism of Soviet invasion of Afghanistan earns him and his wife internal exile in the closed city of Nizhny Novgorod until 1985.
1986: Released from house exile by Mikhail Gorbachev under Glasnost and Perestroika.
1988: European Parliament founds a human rights prize in his honour.
1989: March: elected to the new Soviet Parliament, the All-Union Congress of People's Deputies.
December 1989: Dies of a heart attack in his apartment.
Building on the Sakharov Legacy - the EP and human rights
In Europe and the wider world, the European Parliament advocates respect for basic human rights, freedom and democracy. Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs, with its Subcommittee on Human Rights, directly addresses the issue of the defence of human rights outside the Union.
Each year the EP's Sakharov prize is awarded to individuals or international organisations who – like Sakharov – have distinguished themselves in the struggle for human rights.

Sakharov Prize 2010: Three finalists
The three finalists for 2010 Sakharov Prize are Breaking the silence, Guillermo Fariñas and Birtukan Mideksa. (Guillermo Fariñas photo ©BELGA_EPA_ALEJANDRO ERNESTO) Israeli NGO Breaking the Silence Cuban dissident Guillermo Fariñas Ethiopian politician Birtukan Mideksa The three finalists for Parliament's 2010 Sakharov Prize are Israeli NGO Breaking the Silence, Cuban dissident Guillermo Fariñas and Ethiopian politician Birtukan Mideksa. Shortlisted on 18 October by the Foreign Affairs and Development Committees, the 2010 Sakharov laureate will be selected by EP political group leaders on Thursday. Parliament's annual prize for freedom of thought will be awarded mid-December in Strasbourg.
The three finalists (in alphabetical order):
Breaking the Silence works to shed light on the injustices of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem. Established in 2004 by Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers and veterans, the NGO is dedicated to exposing the Israeli public to the realities of the occupation as seen through the eyes of Israeli soldiers and to stirring debate about the impact of the prolonged occupation on both the Palestinian population and Israeli society.
The NGO's stated mission is to "break the silence" of IDF soldiers who return to civilian life. It publishes written and videotaped reports on its website. Members have carried out speaking tours in Israel, Western Europe and the US. The Israeli government has protested against international government funding of the group.
"If we vote for Breaking the Silence were are voting for peace, we are voting for the honour of Israeli democracy and we are saying we are in favour of two states: the Palestinian State and the Israeli State...Awarding the prize, we want to give peace a chance", French Green Daniel Cohn-Bendit said .
Guillermo Fariñas , 48, was nominated in the name of all those who fight in Cuba for freedom and human rights. The doctor of psychology, independent journalist and political dissident has spent 11-and-a-half years in prison and conducted 23 hunger strikes to protest against the Cuban regime, censorship and human rights violations - "not in his own favour but in order to defend his compatriots", according to Spanish Christian Democrat José Ignacio Salafranca.
In July he ended a 4-month hunger strike to demand the release of imprisoned opposition activists in poor health. Doctors said he had been near to death.
A supporter of non-violence, Mr Fariñas is "a beacon of hope for dozens of journalists and activists who are currently in prison", according to the MEPs who nominated him. "Because he is defending dignity and democracy in his country, he is the ideal candidate for the Sakharov Prize," they say. Mr Fariñas was awarded the Reporters Without Borders Cyber-Freedom Prize in 2006.
Birtukan Mideksa , born in 1975, an Ethiopian politician and former judge, is the leader of the opposition Unity for Democracy and Justice (UDJ) party. She was arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment in December 2008, after speaking to journalists in Sweden. Ms Mideksa is involved in a "peaceful struggle for more democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law" in Ethiopia. She was released from prison at the beginning of October.
"The Sakharov prize should be given to those who need international visibility and protection. Birtukan Mideksa needs both. By awarding the Sakharov prize to Birtukan Mideksa, for all Ethiopian political prisoners, the European Parliament would bring hope and call attention to this young mother, one of the few female party leaders in Africa. It would also guarantee visibility for the struggle of thousands of forgotten political prisoners who fight for justice, the rule of law and democracy in Ethiopia," said Romanian Socialist Adrian Severin.

The winner was announced by EP President Jerzy Buzek in Strasbourg on Thursday. Nominated for all who fight in Cuba for freedom and human rights, the 48-year-old doctor of psychology will be invited to receive the €50,000 prize in Strasbourg on 15 December.
Mr Buzek said, "Guillermo Fariñas was ready to sacrifice and risk his own health and life as a means of pressure to achieve change in Cuba. I hope to hand over the award to him in person, here in Strasbourg, in December, which would be a tremendous moment for the European Parliament and for all Cuban prisoners of conscience."
He said that he hoped that Ladies in White (Damas de Blanco), the 2005 Sakharov laureate, also from Cuba, would also be able to collect their Sakharov Prize in person.
Fariñas' fight for freedom of expression and internet
Guillermo Fariñas, a former soldier, joined the opposition in 1989, giving up his membership of the Young Communist League. A qualified psychologist and journalist, he set up the "Cubanacán Press", an independent press agency, with a view to raising awareness in the rest of the world about the fate of political prisoners in Cuba. The agency has now been closed down.
A proponent of non-violence, he has spent years in prison and has chosen the hunger strike as a way of raising awareness about oppression in Cuba. He went on hunger strike in 2006 to protest against internet censorship, calling for freedom of access to the internet for all, for which he was awarded the Reporters Without Borders Cyber-Freedom Prize in 2006.
Near death after a recent hunger strike
In July Mr Fariñas ended a hunger strike that began 24 February one day after the death – condemned by the EP – of Orlando Zapata Tamayo, a prisoner of conscience, who died after a 3-month hunger strike. Doctors said Mr Fariñas - who has said he is ready to die in the struggle against censorship in Cuba - had been near death.
"Guillermo Fariñas’ struggle has been – and still is – a shining example for all defenders of freedom and democracy," MEPs backing his nomination said.
This is the 3rd time the EP has given the prize to Cuban dissidents, following Ladies in White and Oswaldo José Payá Sardiñas in 2002. Sakharov page EP resolution March 2010 Oswaldo Paya to La Une (2009) Sakharov to Ladies in white
