President Pöttering two and half year presidency of the European Parliament
Hans-Gert Pöttering will address the House at 12.30pm on Wednesday 6 May. The President will summarise the work and achievements of the European Parliament over his two and a half year term as President. The President will also focus on the forthcoming European elections (4-7 June). This will be followed by a round of statements from the political group leaders.
Flu outbreaks
The Commission will make a statement on Monday evening on the current lethal flu outbreak hitting Mexico and other parts of the world. The UN's World Health Organization has raised the alert over swine flu to level five - indicating human-to-human transmission in at least two countries.
Preparation of the European Council 18-19 June
MEPs will debate the forthcoming European Council 18-19 June to be held in Brussels. Alexandra Vondra will represent the Czech Presidency in the debate. This will be the first European Council after the European elections 4-7 June and the last under the Czech Presidency. EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering will address the Heads of State and Government at the start of the European Council. A nominee for the presidency of the European Commission may be announced at the June European Council.
No agreement reached on the Working Time Directive - UK to keep its opt-out
Parliament and Council could not find a compromise on three crucial points: the opt-out, on-call time and multiple contracts. This is the first time that no agreement could be reached at the Conciliation stage since the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty which significantly extended the scope of the co-decision procedure. The UK will therefore keep its opt-out and current legislation will apply. MEPs will debate the topic, there will be no vote.
Working time for road transport workers to be rejected?
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs recommends rejecting, at first reading, a proposal by the European Commission amending the existing Directive on "the organisation of working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities". The draft proposal does not take into account Parliament's demand of the full inclusion of self-employed drivers, MEPs say.
MEPs want to extend maternity leave to 20 weeks
MEPs want to extend the duration of maternity leave to at least 20 weeks. At present such leave varies in the EU between 14 and 28 weeks. In some cases it can be as much as 52 weeks, of which only part is paid. "The aim is to have a positive impact on the state of health of mothers, to enable them to recover more easily after giving birth and to establish a strong relationship with the child", explained rapporteur Edite Estrela (PES, PT).MEPs also say that a new EU directive on these matters should require 100% of salary to be paid for six weeks after birth, at least 85% of salary for the rest of the leave period and the introduction of paternity leave.
Boosting social protection of the self-employed and assisting spouses
The EP has called repeatedly on the European Commission for a revision of the existing EU directive, to improve the social security cover of assisting spouses and strengthen the maternity rights of self-employed women and assisting spouses, says the report by Astrid Lulling (EPP-ED, LU) adopted at first reading under the co-decision procedure by 23 votes to 0 with 2 abstentions. The EP Women's Rights Committee wants to make it compulsory for assisting spouses to have social security cover. MEPs are also keen to strengthen the maternity leave rights of self-employed women and assisting spouses.
Strict conditions on the placing on the market of seal products
MEPs will debate and vote on a report which has been agreed with the Council in first-reading, drawn up by Diana Wallis (ALDE, UK) on the rules concerning trade in seals products. The placing on the market of seal products should, as a general rule, not be allowed. It is permitted only where it is of an occasional nature and consists exclusively of goods for the personal use of the travellers or their families or products that result from by-products of hunting that is regulated under national law and conducted for the purpose of sustainable management of marine resources on a non-profit basis.
Telecom markets: Internet access the key issue
The agreement reached on the three telecoms reports covers the regulatory framework, including radio spectrum measures, users' rights, data privacy and the creation of a body to step up co-operation between national regulators to tackle telecoms regulation. The package aims to boost competition and consumer rights and should encourage investment in next generation fibre and wireless networks.
New rules to avoid future financial crisis
Parliament will debate and vote on the legislative report by Othmar Karas (EPP-ED, AT) which amends the "Capital Requirements" Directives to improve the transparency and the supervision of the financial system to ensure proper risk management in the banking sector.
Support programme for financial services, financial report and auditing
Friedrich Hoppenstedt (EPP-ED, DE), for the Economics Committee, will be putting forward a legislative report on the community programme to support financial services, financial report and auditing. The committee supports the general aim but amends the text to make sure good governance requirements are matched before providing the funds. Moreover, MEPs in the committee want to increase the budget proposed by the Commission.
Economic recovery plan: €3.98bn for energy infrastructure projects
The EU economic recovery plan will invest €3.98 billion in gas and electricity infrastructure, offshore wind parks and carbon capture and storage projects, according to a compromise reached between MEPs and the Czech Presidency, which will be put to a plenary vote. Unspent funds could be used for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, so say the legislative report by Eugenijus Maldeikis (UEN, LT) for the Industry Committee.
Better information on energy efficiency of products
Any advertisement promoting technical specifications of fridges, washing machines or ovens should indicate the product's energy consumption, says the Industry Committee as it amended the Energy Labelling Directive. Parliament will also vote on plans to change the existing 'A-G' energy label
European Globalisation Adjustment Fund
Gabriele Stauner (EPP-ED, DE) for the Employment and Social Affairs Committee will be putting forward a legislative report which amends certain existing provisions of the Regulation on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) with a view to enhancing its performance in terms of re-integrating into employment workers who are made redundant as a consequence of globalisation.
Renewed Social Agenda
In response to the Renewed Social Agenda presented by the Commission on 2 July 2008, MEPs in the Employment and Social Affairs Committee are proposing a report by José Silva Peneda (EPP-ED, PT) reaffirming the "importance of a strong social Europe" and asking for "an ambitious agenda" at the EU level in the social and employment field and call on the Commission to develop an ambitious social policy agenda in the context of the current economic recession.
Active inclusion of people excluded from the labour market
The Employment and Social Affairs committee advocates access to a minimum income and to social services as preconditions for integration into the labour market. MEPs approved the active inclusion strategy based on three pillars: adequate income support, inclusive labour markets and access to quality services in the report by Jean Lambert (Greens/EFA, UK) on the active inclusion of people excluded from the labour market.
Asylum policy: EP Civil Liberties Committee recommends approving "asylum package"
A package of measures to improve the way the EU asylum system works and strengthening asylum seekers' rights is being put forward by the European Parliament's Civil Liberties Committee. MEPs propose amendments to enhance solidarity between Member States when managing asylum applications. The five co-decision reports that make up the package will be debated on Wednesday (6 May).
MEPs call on the Council to develop a European Criminal Justice Area
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs is submitting a proposal to the Council for them to consider the development of a European Criminal Justice Area. Rapporteur, Maria Grazia Pagano (PES, IT) is calling for a number of measures, including the creation of legal instruments on procedural safeguards in criminal proceedings, evaluating the current levels of implementation, improving mutual recognition, and creating a centre for European judicial training.
MEPs support Commission's proposal to extend Member State powers to negotiate bilateral agreements in the area of family law
The Justice and Home Affairs Committee supports the Commission proposal to allow Member States to negotiate and conclude agreements with third countries in matters relating to parental responsibility, maintenance obligations and relevant laws. The procedure will be subject to Commission approval, and any agreement must not interfere with Community interests. This is a change from precedent, as currently, the power to negotiate bilateral agreements in this area is exclusively a Union competence.
MEPs call for changes to proposed regulation on bilateral agreements concerning sectoral matters
The Committee on Legal Affairs is putting forward a number of amendments to the Commission's proposed regulation on bilateral agreements with third party countries concerning sectoral matter, and applicable law in contractual and non-contractual obligations which would change the procedure for the authorisation of the conclusion of negotiations, and which ensures that the Parliament, Council and other Member States are kept fully informed of the process.
What is "fresh" chicken?
Poultry meat that has been frozen and then thawed should not be described as "fresh", says a report by the EP Agriculture Committee that is scheduled for a vote on Tuesday (5 May). The report also expresses strong disapproval of the use of substances such as chlorine to decontaminate chicken carcasses. Members of the Agriculture Committee agree with the Commission that only meat which has been kept at a temperature between -2°C and +4°C should be described as "fresh".
Laboratory research: limiting animal testing without hampering scientific progress
The of animals in scientific experiments needs to be limited and their welfare improved. But this must be done without hindering research in Europe into fighting diseases, says a report by Neil Parish (EPP-ED, UK) which will be debated on Monday (4 May). Around 12 million animals are used for scientific research in the EU every year. This number should be reduced to a minimum and any planned tests subjected to compulsory ethical assessment, to take account of the public's concerns, according to a draft directive that has be approved under the co-decision procedure by the European Parliament and the EU Council of Ministers. These goals are broadly endorsed in the report by Mr Parish.
Viable rules on the welfare of animals at the time of slaughter
Parliament will vote on plans to tighten up the rules on animal welfare at the time of slaughter. The Agriculture Committee is urging that unnecessary suffering by animals be broadly avoided but that an exemption be granted for ritual slaughter, on the grounds that religious freedom must be respected. Every year in the European Union, 360 million pigs, cattle, sheep and goats are killed, as are over 4 billion poultry birds and 25 million animals reared for fur.
Rosé wines and permitted oenological practices
Several MEPs will be putting questions to the Commission on rosé wines and permitted oenological practices. In the context of the discussion of the regulations implementing the CMO in wine, the Commission intends to rescind the provisions in force until 31 July 2009 concerning oenological practices so as to lift the ban on blending white wines with red wines without a protected designation of origin (PDI) or protected geographical indication (PGI) to produce rosé wine.
Lisbon Treaty: Increased powers for national parliaments
A joint debate on the Lisbon Treaty will take place on Wednesday evening at 9pm. A comprehensive review of the European Union's new institutional structure, should the Lisbon Treaty enter into force in 2009 as foreseen by the December 2008 European Council, is being put forward by the Constitutional Affairs Committee. A report by Jo Leinen (PES, DE) on the "New tasks and responsibilities of the EP for the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty" and another by Elmar Brok (EPP-ED, DE) on the "Development of the relations between the EP and national parliaments in the frame of the Lisbon Treaty" are two of the reports included in the package to be discussed.
Lisbon Treaty: balancing the EU institutional framework
The June European election results must be taken into account when nominating the President of the new Commission, says the Constitutional Affairs Committee. The legal implications and the changes to the institutional balance of the Lisbon Treaty, if and when it enters into force, are addressed in the report by Jean-Luc Dehaene (EPP-ED, BE)
MEPs to welcome the financial and institutional changes brought by the Lisbon Treaty
The Lisbon Treaty brings a number of "major changes in the area of the Union's finances, in particular as regards inter-institutional relations and decision-making procedures", according to a report by the Committee on Budgets. The rapporteur, Catherine Guy-Quint (PES, FR) welcomes the clarification of the decision making process, the increases in the power of the European Parliament and the improved "democratic scrutiny and transparency of the Union's finances."
European Parliament reform
Amendments to Parliament's Rules of Procedure, taking up changes agreed by the political groups in a third package of reforms to update its internal procedures, are being put forward by Richard Corbett (PES, UK) for the Constitutional Affairs Committee. These reforms complete a process begun two years ago. The first two packages, adopted in 2007 and 2008, dealt with plenary sessions, EP reports, the legislative process and inter-institutional relations.The Committee also recommends approving another report to provide for changes in Parliament's Rules of Procedure that would come into force if and when the Lisbon Treaty is ratified by all Member States.
Commission should put forward a proposal to adopt the European Citizens' Initiative, say MEPs
The Commission is being called on by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to prepare a proposal to adopt the European Citizen's Initiative, once the Lisbon Treaty has been brought into force. According to proposals laid out by rapporteur, Sylvia-Yvonne Kaufmann (GUE/NGL, DE), the Citizens' Initiative will, for the first time, allow citizens of the European Union a "direct role in the exercise of the European Union's sovereign power", and in the creation of legislative proposals.
Pollution at sea: MEPs vote for compulsory criminal law penalties
More effective measures to combat pollution at sea through stricter legal penalties in EU law are being put forward in a legislative report by the Transport Committee. Parliament and Council have reached a first-reading agreement that will be debated and put to the vote.
Airport slots: MEPs agree to suspend the "use it or lose it" rule
Airline companies hit by the economic slowdown will benefit from relaxed rules on the allocation of airport slots, allowing them not to lose unused slots, according to a report on a draft Regulation for the Transport Committee. Air carriers will be entitled to the same series of slots during the summer 2010 scheduling season as were allocated to them during the summer 2009 season, even if they use them less than 80% of the time this year, according to the draft Regulation revising rules laid out by the EU in 1993 (Regulation EEC No 95/93.)
Petrol vapour recovery during refuelling of passenger cars at service stations
Petrol contains volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that evaporate inside the fuel tank, filling the empty space in the tank above the fuel. As a vehicle is refuelled, these vapours are pushed out of the tank by the incoming fuel and, unless captured, escape into the atmosphere out of the top of the vehicle filler pipe. Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL, EL) will be putting forward a legislative report on vapour recovery during refuelling of passenger cars at service stations.
Situation in the Republic of Moldova
Parliament will vote on a resolution on the situation in the Republic of Moldova to follow up its plenary debate of 23 April after violent protests took place in that country amid claims by opposition parties that the parliamentary elections of 5 April were rigged. A delegation of MEPs went to Moldova from 26 to 29 April on a fact-finding mission.
Women's rights and empowerment for women are 'crucial' to the success of EU's external policy, according to MEPs
The Committee on Foreign Affairs states that as well as ensuring that gender mainstreaming is a priority in external policies, the EU can lead by example by increasing the number of women in high-level positions, increasing personnel working on gender issues and by providing gender-related training to key staff on European Security and Defence Policy missions. Women's rights are central to the success of the EU's external policies on aid, development, enlargement, neighbourhood policy, conflict resolution, security, peace-building and international trade, according to a report drafted by Libor Rouček (PES, CZ).
The democratic process in Turkey
MEPs will discuss the progress of democratic reform in Turkey in Strasbourg next week. In a plenary resolution adopted on 12 March this year, Parliament criticised reforms made so far as being insufficient and stressed the need for the Turkish government "to prove its political will to continue the reform process" to which it committed itself in 2005. The resolution also called for a settlement of the Kurdish question.
MEPs debate outcome of UN Conference against Racism
The outcome of the Durban Review Conference aimed at tackling racism around the globe, which was held in Geneva from Monday 20 April to Friday 24 April, will be debated by MEPs on Wednesday 6 May following statements by the Council and Commission. The 2009 UN World Conference against Racism in Geneva was also known as the Durban Review Conference or Durban II, being named after the first such conference held in the South African city in 2001.
Parliament assesses progress on human rights in the world in 2008
The gradual retreat of the death penalty round the world and the progress made on women's and children's rights are among positive developments noted in the EP's 2008 draft annual report on human rights being submitted to the plenary by the Foreign Affairs Committee. However, the European Union could promote human rights more effectively, says the report. Another question is whether the EU always lives up to its own principles, for example when dealing with terrorism and immigration.
MEDIA MUNDUS: European cinema goes global
Parliament is expected to approve a €15 million funding package aimed at boosting the worldwide competitiveness of Europe's audiovisual industry and fostering cooperation with non-EU countries. Parliament will be voting on a report from the Culture Committee. A first-reading agreement with Council is expected.
Human rights in the world
As usual the session ends with three debates and votes on human rights issues in the world. On this occasion, the topics are:
Fiji
Madagascar
Venezuela: the case of Manuel Rosales

Flu outbreaks
2009-04-30 - 16:21
The Commission will make a statement on Monday evening on the current lethal flu outbreak hitting Mexico and other parts of the world. The UN's World Health Organization has raised the alert over swine flu to level five - indicating human-to-human transmission in at least two countries. Regular coordination meetings
The Commission holds daily joint meetings of the Health Security Committee and of the EWRS component of the Network Committee under Decision 2119/98/EC to discuss Novel Flu Virus outbreaks. This includes representatives of EU member states, EFTA and accession countries, ECDC, and WHO.
In the fourth meeting on 28 April 2009, participants reached agreement on the case definition for the novel flu virus as well guidance on travel advice. People are advised not to make non essential travel to affected areas. These are defined as areas with sustained human to human transmission, such as Mexico. For visitors to affected areas, Member States have agreed guidance on specific actions that they can take to limit the risk of infection. More information can be obtained from the website of the ECDC and the WHO.
Other measures discussed include that the ECDC intends to adapt its specific surveillance platform for the monitoring of seasonal influenza to include data on the novel flu virus within the EU. The laboratory capacity for diagnosis of the Novel Flu Virus is also currently being reviewed. Commission statement - 04.05.2009 Latest on the flu outbreaks

Employment policy
No agreement reached on the Working Time Directive - UK to keep its opt-out
2009-04-30 - 16:21
Parliament and Council could not find a compromise on three crucial points: the opt-out, on-call time and multiple contracts. This is the first time that no agreement could be reached at the Conciliation stage since the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty which significantly extended the scope of the co-decision procedure. The UK will therefore keep its opt-out and current legislation will apply. MEPs will debate the topic, there will be no vote. During next week’s plenary session, Vice-President Mechtild ROTHE (PES, DE) will make a statement which will be followed by a debate (Monday, 4 May).
The Conciliation Committee, composed of delegations from Parliament and Council decided that it was not possible to reach an agreement. This decision was adopted by an overwhelming majority within the EP delegation (15 votes in favour, 5 abstentions and 0 against). The main stumbling block was the opt-out.
Opt-out
”Unfortunately, after five years of negotiations, it was not possible to reach an agreement. The EP negotiation team made several proposals on the opt-out so that it would become ‘exceptional and temporary’. The opt-out cannot be forever. On the Council side, any attempt to put an end to the opt-out was not acceptable”, said Mechtild Rothe (PES, DE), leading the EP delegation.
"This is very sad. However, a bad agreement would have worsened the situation of workers in general and of doctors in particular. We have left the future open and hope to have a solution with the new Commission and the new Parliament", said Alejandro Cercas (PES, ES), rapporteur.
"Despite all efforts from the Parliament, this decision makes it clear that a minority of Member States wants to bury some fundamental values that have existed since the origin and the development of the European social model", said the EPP-ED group shadow rapporteur Jose Silva Peneda (PT).
"It's a pity. I wished that the Council had moved on the opt-out to put an end to it", said Jan Andersson (PES, SV), Chair of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee, also a member of the negotiation team.
On call-time and multiple contracts
According to rulings by the European Court of Justice, on-call time should be regarded as working time. This position was defended by the European Parliament, in its vote on 17 December 2008.
The proposals from the Commission and the Council on the issue of on-call time went backward in comparison to ECJ rulings, MEPs said.
No substantive agreement on the issue of multiple contracts could be reached either. For workers covered by more than one employment contract, MEPs considered that working time should be calculated per worker and not per contract.
Next steps
Since there is no agreement, the current directive remains in force, though the Commission can draft a new proposal from scratch. Any new legislation would need to take into account the rulings of the European Court of Justice on on-call time.
Current legislation
The working time directive 2003/88/EC is part of the EU’s health and safety regulations to protect workers. It limits the average working hours per week to 48 hours, but allows Member States to opt out from that provision. It also regulates reference period resting time and on-call time.
European Commission statement
“I am sorely disappointed by the failure to reach an agreement tonight in the final round of the conciliation negotiations on the revision of the Working Time Directive.
The Commission did its utmost to try and find a compromise by putting forward many proposals to help bring both co-legislators closer to a final deal. But in the end, the positions were irreconcilable. In particular, the European Parliament insisted on an end date for the opt-out, something the Council could not accept.
I have said it many times before: no solution now is not a good outcome and probably not a long-term solution. We have not provided a solution for sectors with high levels of on-call work which face real problems complying with the ECJ judgments (SiMAP-Jaeger, Dellas). The likely outcome is that more – not less – Member States will start using the opt-out, not something I want to see happen. And there won’t even be more safeguards for workers who do use the opt-out.
My colleagues and I in the College of Commissioners will now need to reflect on this result, and decide what, if anything, we do next.” Rapporteur Alejandro CERCAS PSE ES A6-/2009 Organisation of working time (amend. Directive 2003/88/EC) Procedure : Codecision (3rd reading)

Employment policy
Working time for road transport workers to be rejected?
2009-04-30 - 16:21
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs recommends rejecting, at first reading, a proposal by the European Commission amending the existing Directive on "the organisation of working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities". The draft proposal does not take into account Parliament's demand of the full inclusion of self-employed drivers, MEPs say. MEPs adopted an amendment that rejects the Commission's proposal by 23 votes in favour and 17 against.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs adopted the report drawn up by Marie PANAYOTOPOULOS-CASSIOTOU (EPP-ED, EL) rejecting the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2002/15/EC on the organisation of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities. It calls on the Commission to withdraw its proposal and take appropriate steps together with Parliament to submit a new proposal.
"The European Commission proposal contradicts Parliament's demands for the full inclusion of self-employed drivers within the scope of the Directive after the transitional period by 23 March 2009 as laid down in directive 2002/15/EC. It also contradicts the recent motion for a resolution of October 2008 by the European Parliament which reaffirmed the demand for the full inclusion of self-employed drivers - the report by Alejandro CERCAS (PES, ES) on the implementation of social legislation relating to road transport - which also calls on Member States to implement the Directive as soon as possible in the interests of road safety and the health and safety of drivers", states the text adopted.
The Commission proposed to address the issue of false self-employed workers – drivers that are not tied by an employment contract but do not have the freedom to have relations with several customers. The proposal aims at better clarifying the definitions of mobile workers.
Directive 2002/15/EC became applicable on 23 March 2005. Its common rules ensure minimum social protection standards for mobile workers in the road transport sector and are perceived as an important step towards improving the health and safety protection of mobile workers in this area.
When adopting the Directive after a conciliation procedure, Council and Parliament agreed that it should in principle apply to self-employed drivers from 23 March 2009. In addition, the Commission is requested to present a report at the latest two years before that date to the European Parliament and the Council, followed by a legislative proposal based on the report, which would either define the modalities for the inclusion or exclude the self-employed drivers from the scope of the Directive.
The Commission report concluded that there was not a decisive case for including self-employed drivers under the directive, but that it was important to address the issue of definitions and make them clear through an appropriate amendment that the notion of mobile worker covered by the directive also included the so-called 'false' self-employed drivers.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
MEPs want to extend maternity leave to 20 weeks
2009-04-30 - 16:21
Members of the EP Women's Rights Committee are proposing that maternity leave be extended to 20 weeks. They also say a new EU directive on these matters should require 100% of salary to be paid for six weeks after birth, at least 85% of salary for the rest of the leave period and the introduction of paternity leave. The Women's Rights Committee adopted the report by Edite Estrela (PES, PT) by 18 votes to 6 with 5 abstentions. MEPs want to extend the duration of maternity leave to at least 20 weeks. At present such leave varies in the EU between 14 and 28 weeks. In some cases it can be as much as 52 weeks, of which only part is paid. "The aim is to have a positive impact on the state of health of mothers, to enable them to recover more easily after giving birth and to establish a strong relationship with the child", explained Edite Estrela.
In addition, of the 20 weeks, six weeks will have to be taken after the birth to encourage women to breastfeed as long as possible. On 3 October 2008 the European Commission proposed increasing maternity leave to 18 weeks, of which six would be taken after the birth.
Full salary to be paid for six weeks
To avoid penalising women who have children, most MEPs are proposing that it be compulsory to pay them their full salary for 6 weeks after giving birth. For the remainder of the period, 100% of salary should be paid, with a minimum figure of 85%. In addition, fully paid additional maternity leave should be granted in the case of premature childbirth, stillbirth, caesarean section, multiple births or children with disabilities.
The European Commission proposed the payment of a monthly salary during maternity leave equivalent to 100% of the last monthly salary or the average salary, but this would not have been compulsory.
Paternity leave
The current directive 92/85/EC uses the legal basis of health and safety at work. The Commission proposal for the latest directive adds a further legal basis: equal treatment. The rapporteur wants to use this new legal basis to introduce provisions on paternity leave.
A majority of the committee voted in favour of introducing paternity leave. This paternity leave - or co-maternity leave to take account of different family structures, an idea over which MEPs were divided - would be a compulsory minimum two weeks after the birth.
No sacking of new mothers
MEPs also want to ensure no-one can be dismissed from their job during maternity leave. Any sacking in the following 12 months would have to be justified in writing and not linked to maternity.
Lastly, MEPs propose amendments designed to enable women to have "equivalent" work on their return from maternity leave and to have flexible working arrangements. Employers will have to consider seriously any request for changes to working hours and patterns. They also voted in favour of time off work for breastfeeding equivalent to two one-hour breaks per day unless another arrangement has been agreed with the employer.
What are the existing periods and conditions of maternity leave in EU countries?

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Boosting social protection of the self-employed and assisting spouses
2009-04-30 - 16:21
The EP Women's Rights Committee wants to make it compulsory for assisting spouses to have social security cover. MEPs are also keen to strengthen the maternity leave rights of self-employed women and assisting spouses. The EP has called repeatedly on the European Commission for a revision of the existing EU directive, to improve the social security cover of assisting spouses and strengthen the maternity rights of self-employed women and assisting spouses, says the report by Astrid Lulling (EPP-ED, LU) adopted at first reading under the co-decision procedure by 23 votes to 0 with 2 abstentions.
Social security of assisting spouses: compulsory cover
The draft directive defines "assisting spouses" as the spouses or life partners of self-employed workers, when recognised by national law, not being employees or business partners, where they habitually participate in the activities of the self-employed worker. They are often found in farming, commerce, SMEs and the liberal professions.
The Commission is proposing that social security cover should be voluntary but the EP committee argues that Member States should ensure that assisting spouses become members in their own right of the same social insurance schemes as self-employed workers, covering sickness, invalidity and old age.
The contributions paid by assisting spouses should, say MEPs, be tax-deductible as operating expenditure, like the spouse's remuneration, if the services have been correctly provided and the remuneration is appropriate.
Maternity leave in adapted form
MEPs say Member States should ensure that female self-employed workers and assisting spouses are entitled to a period of maternity leave adapted to their needs.
The maternity leave should be of the duration of their choice provided that the total length does not exceed that specified in Directive 92/85/EEC on pregnant workers.

Strict conditions on the placing on the market of seal products
2009-04-30 - 16:21
MEPs will debate and vote on the rules concerning trade in seals products. The placing on the market of seal products should, as a general rule, not be allowed. It is permitted only where it is of an occasional nature and consists exclusively of goods for the personal use of the travellers or their families or products that result from by-products of hunting that is regulated under national law and conducted for the purpose of sustainable management of marine resources on a non-profit basis. The legislative report which has been agreed with the Council in first-reading has been drawn up by Diana WALLIS (ALDE, UK)
The Regulation establishes harmonised rules concerning the placing on the market of seal products. It is therefore without prejudice to other Community or national rules regulating the hunting of seals.
According to the Commission proposal, the evidence available suggests that most of these products originate from third countries, even though some production exists within the Community as seals are killed and skinned in Finland and Sweden, while seal products are produced in other Member States, such as the United Kingdom (Scotland), using seal fur skins coming from other countries. Within the Community, seals are killed and skinned in Sweden, Finland and the United Kingdom (Scotland) with a view to obtain products derived from seals, or for pest control reasons. Outside the Community, seals are killed and skinned to the same effect in Canada, Greenland, Namibia, Norway and Russia.
Conditions for placing on the market
The placing on the market of seal products shall be allowed only where the seal products result from hunts traditionally conducted by Inuit and other indigenous communities and which contribute to their subsistence. These conditions shall apply at the time or point of import for imported products.
By way of derogation from the above :
(a) the import of seal products shall also be allowed where it is of an occasional nature and consists exclusively of goods for the personal use of the travellers or their families. The nature and quantity of such goods may not be such as to indicate that they are being imported for commercial reasons;
(b) the placing on the market shall also be allowed for seal products that result from by-products of hunting that is regulated under national law and conducted for the sole purpose of sustainable management of marine resources. Such placing on the market shall only be allowed on a non-profit basis. The nature and quantity of such products shall not be such as to indicate that they are being placed on the market for commercial reasons.
Definition of Inuit
"Inuit" means indigenous members of the Inuit homeland – i.e. those arctic and subarctic areas where, presently or traditionally, Inuit have Aboriginal rights and interests – recognized by Inuit as being members of their people and includes Inupiat, Yupik (Alaska), Inuit, Inuvialuit (Canada), Kalaallit (Greenland) and Yupik (Russia)
Penalties
Member States will lay down the rules on penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented. The penalties provided for shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
Omega-3
MEPs point out that the existence of those diverse legal requirements may further discourage consumers from buying products not made from seals, but which may not be easily distinguishable from similar goods made from seals, or products which may include elements or ingredients obtained from seals without this being clearly recognisable, such as furs, Omega-3 capsules and oils and leather goods.
Entry into force
This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
The article on conditions for placing on the market enters into force nine months from the date of entry into force of this Regulation.
Background
According to EC proposal, Denmark and Italy are by far the two largest importers of raw fur skin from seal for further processing/sales on the Community market, and will thus also be affected by such regulation. Denmark imports the raw fur skins directly coming from Canada and Greenland (that are not categorised as goods in transit), while Italy imports the raw fur skins from Russia, Finland and the UK (Scotland). Greece also has a noticeable trade in raw skins originating in the two latter range states. Rapporteur Diana WALLIS ALDE UK A6-0118/2009 Trade in seal products Procedure : Codecision (1st reading)

The European Parliament and Council reach an agreement on the telecoms package
2009-04-30 - 16:21
The agreement reached on the three telecoms reports covers the regulatory framework, including radio spectrum measures, users' rights, data privacy and the creation of a body to step up co-operation between national regulators to tackle telecoms regulation. The package aims to boost competition and consumer rights and should encourage investment in next generation fibre and wireless networks. MEPs reached a political agreement with the Czech Presidency on the revision of the electronic communications framework (report by Catherine Trautmann , PES, FR), and on setting up of a new Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) (report by Pilar del Castillo , EPP-ED, ES).
Respect fundamental rights of internet users (Trautmann report)
On MEPs' initiative the compromise recognises the Internet as an essential tool for education and the practical exercise of freedom of expression and access to information.
The agreement, therefore, includes binding provisions stating that measures taken regarding users' access to or use of electronic communications services and applications must respect their fundamental rights and freedoms such as the right to privacy, freedom of expression and access to information and "the right to a judgment by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law and acting in respect of due process".
Moreover, the compromise asks the Commission to investigate the role of the internet in the practical exercise of fundamental rights.
Commission and national regulators to cooperate on market regulation
MEPs and the Czech Presidency agree that, before taking regulatory decisions, national regulatory authorities will have to consult the Commission and BEREC. BEREC will adopt an opinion in such cases by an absolute majority of its 27 members.
The regulator will have to take "utmost account" of any "serious doubts" expressed by the Commission and BEREC. In that case, BEREC, the Commission and the national regulator should cooperate closely in identifying "the most appropriate and effective measure" before the national regulator adopts the remedy, says the agreed text.
Functional separation as last resort
The compromise enables a national regulator to require an integrated incumbent operator to separate its network infrastructure from the units offering services using this infrastructure - a regulatory instrument known as "functional separation", which does now, however, change the overall ownership of network access and services. This "exceptional measure" should only be taken when any other regulatory tools have failed to achieve effective competition, says the agreed text backed by the Industry Committee.
Harmonise radio spectrum use
To improve cooperation, strategic planning and harmonisation of spectrum use among Member States, the Commission should table a legislative proposal for a multiannual radio spectrum action programme, MEPs and the Czech Presidency have agreed.
The reform of the electronic communications regulatory framework would introduce service and technology neutrality as binding principles, i.e. any frequency band may be used for any application so long as this complies with national frequency allocation plans. Applying these principles would, for example, allow for reallocating the spectrum dividend resulting from the digital switchover of broadcasting to provide wireless broadband services in the future. The switchover from analogue to digital terrestrial TV by the end of 2012 will free up a significant amount of high-quality spectrum which could thus be re-allocated to services other than broadcasting.
Investments in next-generation networks and infrastructure sharing
In future a dominant operator can be obliged to open the use of "network elements and associated facilities" such as building wiring (including inside buildings), masts, antennae, towers, and conduits to competitors, says the compromise.
National regulators should promote "efficient investment and innovation in new and enhanced infrastructures" such as new fibre-optic networks ("next generation access networks"), specifies the agreement. Any access obligation to open this new infrastructure to competitors will have to take "appropriate account of the risk incurred by the investing undertakings" and should allow for "cooperative agreements between investors and access seeking parties" to diversify investment risks, stipulates the agreement.
Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) (del Castillo report)
MEPs and the Council Presidency agreed that BEREC will be composed of a board of the heads of the 27 national regulators and a European Commission representative. BEREC will advise the Commission, and upon request the European Parliament and the Council. The board will adopt its opinions - e.g. on cross-border disputes - by a two-thirds majority.
A small secretariat will provide professional and administrative support services to BEREC. BEREC's office is to be funded by subsidies from the Community budget and voluntary financial contributions from Member States or their national regulatory authorities, states the text.
-----
Boosting consumer rights' in the telecoms package
Parliament and Council have reached a second reading agreement on the report by Malcolm Harbour (EPP-ED, UK) on electronic networks, personal data and protection of privacy.
The directive reinforces existing users’ rights and clarifies the definition of the universal service.
Fundamental requirement of universal service
The agreed text says "A fundamental requirement of universal service is to provide users on request with a connection to the public communications network at a fixed location and at an affordable price. The requirement is for the provision of local, national and international telephone calls, facsimile communications and data services, the provision of which may be restricted by Member States to the end-user's primary location/residence. There should be no constraints on the technical means by which this is provided, allowing for wired or wireless technologies, nor any constraints on which operators provide part or all of universal service obligations."
Member States wishing to implement measures regarding users' access to and/or use of services and applications must respect the fundamental rights of citizens, including in relation to privacy and due process, and any such measures should take full account of policy goals adopted at Community level, such as furthering the development of the Community information society
Disabled people's right
Certain aspects of terminal equipment, including consumer premises equipment intended for disabled end-users, whether their special needs are due to disability or related to ageing, should be brought within the scope of Directive 2002/22/EC (Universal Service Directive) in order to facilitate access to networks and the use of services. Such equipment currently includes receive only radio and television terminal equipment as well as special terminal devices for hearing impaired end-users.
Number portability within one day and length of contracts
The text of the compromise reads "number portability is a key facilitator of consumer choice and effective competition in competitive markets for electronic communications and should be implemented with the minimum delay, so that the number is functionally activated within one working day and the user does not experience a loss of service lasting longer than one working day."
Member States must ensure that contracts concluded between consumers and undertakings providing electronic communications services do not mandate an initial commitment period that exceeds 24 months. Member States shall also ensure that undertakings offer users the possibility to subscribe to a contract with a maximum duration of 12 months.
Missing children hotline 116000
Member States shall, in addition to measures of general applicability to all numbers in the "116" numbering and make every effort to ensure that citizens have access to a service operating a hotline to report cases of missing children. The hotline shall be available on the number 116000 Joint debate : Electronic communications - 05.05.2009 A6-0257/2009-Electronic communications networks, personal data and the protection of privacy A6-0272/2009 - common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services A6-0271/2009 - European Electronic communications Market Authority A6-0276/2009 - Frequency bands to be reserved for mobile communications

New rules to avoid future financial crisis
2009-04-30 - 16:21
Parliament will debate and vote on the legislative report by Othmar Karas (EPP-ED, AT) which amends the "Capital Requirements" Directives to improve the transparency and the supervision of the financial system to ensure proper risk management in the banking sector. The European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the European Commission delegations have agreed on a common text to have the new legislation approved before the end of current legislative term. The European Parliament must now debate and vote on this agreement.
The major change after negotiations is the inclusion of a review clause, asking the Commission to present a proposal by 31 December 2009, with an increase in the retention rate, if considered convenient after consulting the Committee of European Banking Supervisors and taking into account international developments.
1. Aim of the new legislation
The new legislation seeks to improve risk management and avoid a repetition in future of the current banking crisis, with bank failures putting pressure on other banks and leaving the whole financial system at risk.
The review of the "Capital Requirements" Directives represents one of the first legislative answers to the current financial crisis.
1.1 The main points of the proposed legislation:
Enhancing both efficiency and effectiveness of supervision and crisis management
Revisions of rules from previous directives, particularly on the large exposures regime and securitisation;
2. State of play in the procedure
The European Parliament and the Council of Ministers representatives agreed on a common text. The agreement will now have to be approved by the whole Parliament. The note here below reflects this agreement.
3. Supervision: colleges of supervisors to be established
To strengthen the crisis management framework over EU banking sector, Members supported the Commission proposal and agreed with the Council to establish the colleges of supervisors to facilitate cooperation among national authorities dealing with cross-border financial institutions.
According to MEPs, the colleges of supervisors are a further step forward in streamlining EU supervisory cooperation. They also believe that, in case of a conflict between members of a college, independent advice and a mediation mechanism at Community level should also be available.
Therefore, they ask the Commission to put forward a legislative proposal to achieve further supervisory integration by 31 December 2009, with a view to establish an EU level supervisory system by 31 December 2011.
4. Large exposure regime
4.1 What's at stake?
Banks usually spread their exposures between several clients, in order to not be dependent on one single client and to avoid the risk of loss due to the non-payment of a loan.
As the current turmoil showed, in cases where financial institutions are widely exposed to a single client, a bank or insurer could incur large losses as a result of the failure of an individual client or a group of connected clients. The same can happen when banks trade their exposures between themselves: the failure of one institution can cause the failure of others.
Therefore, there is need to reinforce the existing rules on large exposure regime, including inter bank exposures.
The aim of the new provisions on large exposure, agreed by all the three institutions, will apply to the whole banking system, from big institutes to small ones.
4.2 Stricter rules on large exposure
The new legislation reinforces existing rules on the large exposure regime, including interbank trading.
According to the agreed text, a bank would not be able to expose more than 25% of its own funds to a client or a group of clients. Exceeding this threshold will only be possible for exposure between credit institutions and for not more than Euro 150 million.
A review clause was also agreed, as requested by the MEPs, on the large exposure regime by end of 2011, also to seek further harmonisation of national provisions.
5. Securitisation: 5% of retention and review clause
The current crisis has also shown that risks are not always correctly assessed by the institutions proposing an investment, for example, when mortgages are packaged into investment products and sold on by the original lender.
The EP representatives agreed with the Commission's proposal to ensure that an institution issuing an investment retains a material interest in the performance of the proposed investment. The retention rate is, as agreed between the negotiating delegations, at least 5% of the total value of the securitised exposures.
In addition, the EP delegation asked and obtained a strong review clause, asking the Commission to come up with a possible proposal to increase the retention rate, by 31 December 2009, after consulting the Committee of European Banking Supervisors and taking into account international developments.
6. Credit Default Swaps: call for an EU clearing house
Credit Default Swaps (CDS), the most traded derivative in recent years, as well as all OTC (over the counter) products, also need to be regulated, according to the MEPs.
The agreed text therefore calls on the Commission to put forward, by the end of 2009, legislative proposals to enhance transparency in the OTC market and set up a central counterpart (CCP) or clearing house, supervised by the EU, to reduce the risks of these instruments.
7. Entry into force and other review clauses
The three institutions agreed that national governments will have to transpose the proposed legislation by 31 October 2010 and apply the new provisions from the end of 2010.
Finally, MEPs asked and obtained a review of rules on procyclicality, leverage and methodologies by the end of the current year.

Support programme for financial services, financial report and auditing
2009-04-30 - 16:21
Karsten Friedrich HOPPENSTEDT (EPP-ED, DE), for the Economics Committee, will be putting forward a legislative report on the community programme to support financial services, financial report and auditing. The committee supports the general aim but amends the text to make sure good governance requirements are matched before providing the funds. Moreover, MEPs in the committee want to increase the budget proposed by the Commission. Key committee proposals
Programme beneficiaries : the Commission should ensure that bodies that carry out activities in third countries, such as the Public Interest Oversight Board (PIOB) and the International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation (IASCF) do not benefit under the Community programme until neutral funding arrangements, including from third countries, form a majority of their total funding.
Lamfalussy committees : sufficient funding should be set aside for a Community contribution to the functioning of the level 3 Lamfalussy committees, to international accounting standard setting, and, in particular, to the IASCF, including the IASB and the European voice, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG).
Improved governance: Community funding of the level 3 committees and the EFRAG, the IASCF and the PIOB should, in particular in regard to the IASCF, be made conditional upon the practical fulfilment of the governance requirements laid down by the Community.

Economic recovery plan: €3.98bn for energy infrastructure projects
2009-04-30 - 16:21
The EU economic recovery plan will invest €3.98 billion in gas and electricity infrastructure, offshore wind parks and carbon capture and storage projects, according to a compromise reached between MEPs and the Czech Presidency, which will be put to a plenary vote. Unspent funds could be used for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, so say the legislative report by Eugenijus MALDEIKIS (UEN, LT) for the Industry Committee. The European Economic Recovery Plan allocates €5 billion in 2009 and 2010 to energy and broadband internet projects and to measures relating to reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. Industry Committee MEPs negotiated a political agreement with the Czech Council Presidency ahead of Parliament's first-reading vote on the report.
The European Energy Programme for Recovery will provide €3.98 billion to energy projects in the following fields:
• gas and electricity infrastructure (€2.365 million);
• offshore wind energy (€565 million);
• carbon capture and storage (€1.050 million).
The recovery plan will bear up to half of the costs of gas and electricity infrastructure and offshore wind energy projects. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) installations can be co-financed by up 80% of the costs.
€200 million for Nabucco gas pipeline
The programme reserves €200 million for supporting the construction of the Nabucco pipeline which will bring natural gas from the Caspian Sea to the EU.
Moreover, the recovery plan lists 13 CCS projects in seven Member States which can apply for funding installations to store CO2 permanently and safely underground.
The list of potential projects also includes offshore wind energy parks in the North Sea and projects to integrate future offshore wind installations in the North and Baltic Seas into the onshore grid.
Unspent funds could be used for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects
MEPs and the Council Presidency agreed that the Commission will monitor the implementation of the programme and publish a report each year together with its proposal for the budget of the following year. If this report in March 2010 identifies "serious risks in implementing the priority projects", the Commission should propose additional energy projects, says the agreement.
On MEPs' initiative, the Commission will declare its intention to propose using for energy efficiency and renewable energy measures those funds which have not been committed by the end of 2010 for gas and electricity infrastructure, offshore wind energy or carbon capture and storage projects.

Better information on energy efficiency of products
2009-04-30 - 16:21
Any advertisement promoting technical specifications of fridges, washing machines or ovens should indicate the product's energy consumption, says the Industry Committee as it amended the Energy Labelling Directive. Parliament will also vote on plans to change the existing 'A-G' energy label The energy label helps consumers to assess the running costs when buying new household appliances such as fridges, freezers, washing machines, driers, dishwashers, or ovens. Manufacturers are obliged to indicate the energy consumption irrespective of whether the product performs well (green “A” class) or poorly (red “G” class) on this measure.
Energy label for all energy-using and energy-saving products
In future, the label must also be attached to energy-consuming products for commercial and industrial use, such as cold storage rooms, display cabinets or vending machines, stipulates the Industry Committee. Additionally, the energy labelling obligation will apply to energy-related products, including construction products, which do not consume energy but "have a significant direct or indirect impact" on energy savings such as window glazing and frames or outer doors, says the directive, as amended by the committee.
Advertising must indicate energy consumption or saving
Any advertisement promoting technical specifications of a specific model will have to show the product's energy consumption or energy savings, for example, by reference to the energy class, says a provision proposed by the committee.
The committee also lays down that any technical promotional literature such as manuals and manufacturers' brochures - whether printed or offered in the Internet - should indicate the product's energy consumption or energy label.
Tax credits for highly energy-efficient products
Member States should only provide incentives for products meeting the minimum energy efficiency criteria, say MEPs, who recommend tax credits, both for consumers using highly energy-efficient products and for industries that promote and produce such products, and reduced value added tax on materials and components that improve energy efficiency.
Public authorities to procure the most energy-efficient products
The committee specifies that public authorities should aim to procure products of the highest energy efficiency class and in any event only those products that meet the minimum energy efficiency criteria. This condition applies for all contracts with a value of at least €15,000 (excluding VAT).
MEPs want the Commission to submit a list of priority products to Parliament and the Council no later than six months after the directive's entry into force. The technical details of the directive, such as the energy classes of specific products, will be determined by a Commission working group under the "regulatory procedure with scrutiny".
----
Keep energy label clear and easily-understandable
Parliament will also vote on two motions for resolutions to block the Commission's intent to change the format for the energy labelling of household refrigerating appliances and TVs. The proposed measure would sub-divide the highest energy class 'A' by adding new classes such as 'A-20%', 'A-40%', 'A-60%' etc.
Industry Committee MEPs oppose this new format since it could "add to confusion about whether class 'A' represents an efficient or an inefficient product". Instead the Commission should upgrade and re-scale the existing energy classes "with a view to reserve A-label status for the top 10 – 20 % best performing equipment", say MEPs.
MEPs recognise that "televisions are high-energy consuming appliances and consequently there is considerable potential for saving energy by adding this category to the energy labelling scheme". The committee therefore calls on the Commission to submit new draft measures based on a closed 'A-G' scale by end of September 2009.
"Regulatory procedure with scrutiny"
Under the current energy labelling directive, adopted by Parliament and Council in 1992, the Commission may set technical requirements, such as the energy classes for household appliances such as freezers, washing machines, driers, dishwashers, or air-conditioners. Parliament and Council may block such implementing measures under a "regulatory procedure with scrutiny".
To prevent the new energy classes enterinf into force, the whole Parliament will have to back the Industry Committee's resolutions.
MEPs will have to back the Industry Committee's resolutions by an absolute majority. Rapporteur Anni PODIMATA PES EL A6-0146/2009 Energy-related products: indication of the consumption of energy (repeal. 'Energy Labelling Directive' 92/75 Procedure : Codecision (1st reading)

European Globalisation Adjustment Fund
2009-04-30 - 16:21
Gabriele STAUNER (EPP-ED, DE) for the Employment and Social Affairs Committee will be putting forward a legislative report which amends certain existing provisions of the Regulation on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) with a view to enhancing its performance in terms of re-integrating into employment workers who are made redundant as a consequence of globalisation. The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is a response to a specific, European-scale crisis caused by globalisation. The Fund is an expression of EU solidarity with European workers left vulnerable because of the impact of globalisation. It provides one-off, time-limited individual support, geared directly to the redundant workers. Its objective is to reintegrate workers into the labour market, when they had been made redundant due to globalisation.
Current economic crisis
The agreed text with Council says the EGF will provide support to workers made redundant as a direct result of the global financial and economic crisis . The Member States applying for an EGF contribution under this derogation have to establish a direct and demonstrable link between the redundancies and the financial and economic crisis.
This derogation will apply to all applications submitted before 31 December 2011
From 1 000 to 500 employees affected intervention criteria
A financial contribution from the EGF will be provided where major structural changes in world trade patterns lead to a serious economic disruption, notably a substantial increase of imports into the European Union, or a rapid decline of the EU market share in a given sector or a delocalisation to third countries, which results in:
An amendment put forward says "at least 500 (reduced from 1000 previously) redundancies over a period of four months in an enterprise in a Member State, including workers made redundant in its suppliers or downstream producers."
The Stauner report recommends extending the period to six months to take the negative effects of the crisis into account. Rapporteur Gabriele STAUNER EPP-ED DE A6-0242/2009 European Globalisation Adjustment Fund EGF (amend. Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006) Procedure : Codecision (1st reading)

Renewed Social Agenda
2009-04-30 - 16:21
In response to the Renewed Social Agenda presented by the Commission on 2 July 2008, MEPs in the Employment and Social Affairs Committee are proposing a report by José Silva Peneda (EPP-ED, PT) reaffirming the "importance of a strong social Europe" and asking for "an ambitious agenda" at the EU level in the social and employment field and call on the Commission to develop an ambitious social policy agenda in the context of the current economic recession. Supporting EU social models
MEPs in the committee consider that it is not the time to reduce social expenditure but rather to reinforce structural reforms. The EU should support the infrastructures of the Member States' social models, including social services of general interest.
They also encourage Member States to provide for guaranteed minimum income schemes for social inclusion.
New demographic challenges facing the EU could be tackled by addressing the situation of women who live in poverty, with unequal and inadequate access to nutrition, housing, education, pay and who face difficulties in reconciling work, family and private life, MEPs say.
Education and employment
In the field of education, the EP committee calls for a more effective prevention and combating of early school leaving under the motto that "school pays off" and for the further promotion of and assistance to the concept of Second Chance Schools.
Social and employment policies should foster job creation and be quickly activated as a response to the current economic crisis. These policies should motivate people to look for job opportunities or start their own entrepreneurial activity, MEPs consider.
The EP committee also suggests that social partners at national level should discuss new methodologies for wage policies which could include higher financial participation of employees in companies' proceeds through the use of schemes that mitigate the impact of inflation.

Active inclusion of people excluded from the labour market
2009-04-30 - 16:21
The Employment and Social Affairs committee advocates access to a minimum income and to social services as preconditions for integration into the labour market. MEPs approved the active inclusion strategy based on three pillars: adequate income support, inclusive labour markets and access to quality services in the report by Jean Lambert (Greens/EFA, UK) on the active inclusion of people excluded from the labour market.
The best way out of exclusion is to be in work but the work needs to be sustainable, of high-quality and adequately remunerated, MEP say. A minimum income and access to high quality social services are preconditions for integration into the labour market, they consider.
Minimum income
MEPs in the committee call on the Commission and the Member States to implement the right to adequate income support so as to fight poverty and social exclusion. However, the committee rejected the idea of a directive on minimum income in the context of the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, as proposed by the rapporteur.
When the work is short-term, seasonal and precarious, MEPs in the committee advocate the development of systems which support individuals in a period of transition rather than penalise, discourage them or remove assistance too rapidly when an individual takes up work.
Access to social services
In times of economic downturn and growing unemployment, there is a risk of large numbers of people being made redundant, states the report. Social inclusion and related labour market policy must be pursued within the European Economic Recovery Plan and part of public funds should be used to maintain essential social services.
The EP committee considers that progress must be made on guaranteeing universal service obligations and a plan of action to establish an EU framework directive on services of general interest is necessary.
Education: a pre-requisite for employment
Quality education is a vital prerequisite for successful future employment and integration, MEPs say, calling on the Members States to eliminate any and all barriers to education. The situation of young people seeking for a job should be taken carefully into account asking for measures to foster the transition from education into the labour market.
Those who have been excluded from the labour market for a long time must have greater entitlements to funding for lifelong learning, especially where ‘key competences’ are concerned, they add.

Asylum policy
EP Civil Liberties Committee recommends approving "asylum package"
2009-04-30 - 16:21
A package of measures to improve the way the EU asylum system works and strengthening asylum seekers' rights is being put forward by the European Parliament's Civil Liberties Committee. MEPs propose amendments to enhance solidarity between Member States when managing asylum applications. The four co-decision reports that make up the package will come before the full Parliament in Strasbourg. The first piece of legislation is the report from by Antonio Masip Hidalgo (PES, ES) is intended to beef up the right of asylum seekers to adequate reception conditions: it lays down standards that must be guaranteed in terms of housing, food, clothing, health care, financial benefits, freedom of movement and access to work. The text also includes provisions on the protection of vulnerable people, such as minors, unaccompanied minors, pregnant women and victims of torture and violence.
Rules on the use of detention
According to the draft legislation, the use of detention should be decided on a case-by-case basis, and asylum seekers should not be held in prisons but in specialised detention facilities. Legal guarantees against arbitrary detention must be introduced. The detention of unaccompanied minors must be banned.
Free legal assistance for asylum seekers
Only the judicial authorities should have the power to order detention, says the legislation. Administrative authorities can do so only in emergency cases and their decision must be confirmed by the judiciary within 72 hours. In the absence of a decision, the asylum seeker concerned must be freed immediately. Asylum seekers placed in detention must be informed in a language they understand, or that it is reasonable to assume they understand, and receive legal assistance and free representation if they wish it. They must also be able to receive medical care and appropriate psychological support.
MEPs believe that the administrative procedures for asylum applications must be carried out swiftly and that delays which are not the fault of the asylum seeker cannot justify an extension of the detention period.
In addition, they believe that access to work must be guaranteed within six months after a request for international protection has been lodged. Minors must have access to education within three months.
Vulnerable people
Member States are required to check, as soon as a request for international protection is lodged, whether the applicant has special needs: vulnerable people, including minors, pregnant women and victims of torture and violence, or victims of female genital mutilation, must receive adequate attention, say MEPs. They add that torture victims must be directed quickly towards a care centre suited to their situation. Member States must also assist family unification and guardians must be designated to advise and protect unaccompanied minors.
Rehousing of asylum seekers
A second proposal in the asylum package seeks to improve the Dublin regulation of 2003. The purpose of this regulation was to ensure access to the asylum application procedure and guarantee swift processing of applications, while preventing multiple applications by one person in several different Member States. The proposals seek to guarantee higher standards of protection for individuals and tocope better with situations in which the reception capacity of asylum systems of the Member States are under particular pressure. It lays down deadlines to make the procedure for determining responsibility more efficient and quicker. It also includes provisions guaranteeing that all the needs of those applying for international protection are covered and that sufficient legal guarantees are laid down, such as the right of appeal against transfer decisions, including the right to legal aid, to representation and to family unification. It also reaffirms the principle that nobody may be placed in detention simply because they are applying for international protection.
The report by Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert (ALDE, NL), which was adopted unanimously, backs these principles. However, it proposes that solidarity between Member States be enhanced by means of compulsory instruments such as the formation of teams of national experts to assist Member States confronted with a large number of asylum applications, and the creation of a re-housing programme to enable beneficiaries of international protection to be received by a Member State other than the one which granted them this protection.
Improving the Eurodac fingerprint database
The Dublin system could not work without a system for identifying foreign nationals who have already lodged an asylum application in another Member State. This system is Eurodac, a digital set-up for comparing fingerprints, which has been in operation since 2003. The proposal in the asylum package seeks to improve the general functioning of the system, to clarify the different stages of its operation and to lay down rules on data protection. Member States will be required to delete data no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected. The report by Nicolae Vlad Popa (EPP-ED, RO), adopted by 28 votes to 4 with 3 abstentions, supports this proposal with some technical improvements.
An office to help Member States
Lastly, the Civil Liberties Committee proposes a report by Jean Lambert (Greens/EFA, UK) approving the creation of a European Asylum Support Office. This body will provide expert assistance to help implement EU asylum policy and will boost cooperation between Member States and help those subject to particular pressures. MEPs want this office to develop, in conjunction with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and relevant NGOs, training programmes on asylum for members of national civil services. The office must also put in place an early warning system to enable Member States and the Commission to anticipate large-scale influxes of applicants for international protection as well as a system of mandatory solidarity for rehousing beneficiaries of international protection of any Member States whose national asylum system are overloaded.
UK government
The UK has opted in to the Dublin system and the EURODAC fingerprint as these instruments help to tackle asylum shopping and abuse - ensuring asylum seekers seek protection in the first Member State they reach, and enabling the UK to transfer people back to another MS when they do not. The UK also supports the creation of a European Asylum Support Office, which would promote practical co-operation between Member States on asylum. The UK has not opted in to the Reception Conditions Directive due to concerns about extended access to the labour market and social assistance, and restrictions on detention.

Justice and home affairs
MEPs call on the Council to develop a European Criminal Justice Area
2009-04-30 - 16:21
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs is submitting a proposal to the Council for them to consider the development of a European Criminal Justice Area. Rapporteur, Maria Grazia Pagano (PSE, IT) is calling for a number of measures, including the creation of legal instruments on procedural safeguards in criminal proceedings, evaluating the current levels of implementation, improving mutual recognition, and creating a centre for European judicial training. Member States are responsible for the administration of justice, but once the Treaty of Lisbon comes into force, EU competences in judicial cooperation in criminal matters will be expanded. Therefore, MEPs are calling on the Council to explore the creation of a European Criminal Justice Area which would allow for some harmonisation of policies and would "prevent criminals from benefitting from differences in judicial systems." As mafias and organised crime have become a "transnational phenomenon", with cross-border impacts, so the response to them also needs to be transnational.
Extension of mutual recognition
The principle of mutual recognition has been a "cornerstone" of judicial cooperation since the Tampere European Council, but according to the report is has not been "satisfactorily achieved" and needs to be strengthened by the adoption of a harmonised set of guarantees and safeguards. Committee MEPs argue that where mutual recognition has been implemented, as with the European Arrest Warrant, it has had "great added value for judicial cooperation" across the EU.
If current levels of mutual recognition are to be improved, then there needs to be a common European judicial culture, "based on mutual trust, common principles, cooperation and a certain level of harmonisation." This implies a need for similar definitions of crimes and their sanctions, or perhaps a set of minimum rights in terms of conditions of detention and prisoners rights.
Evaluating the current European system
In order to increase mutual recognition and eventually create a European criminal justice area, the report recommends that "a committee of wise persons" is assembled to evaluate the similarities and differences between the current criminal law systems in all of the Member States. This evaluation could then be used as the basis of a proposal to create the EU criminal justice area. The committee also calls on the Commission, Parliament and Council to evaluate "the system of the implementation of EU policies and legal instruments", to assess current progress in Member States.
A further evaluation is being called for to look at the current state of judicial training across Europe, taking into account its weaknesses, strengths and to look at how it can be changed to promote a European judicial culture. The report also suggests that the Commission looks into the creation of a European Judicial School for judges, prosecutors, defence lawyers and all others involved in the administration of justice.
Adoption of legal instruments
The report calls on the Community to adopt "without delay", a series of legal instruments on the "procedural safeguards in criminal procedures", including clauses based on the assumption of innocence, the right to legal advice, the right for a suspect to have their rights and charges explained in a language which they understand and minimum standards for prisons. In order to protect victims of crimes, there should be a legal instrument which offers them the widest possible protection and adequate compensation.

MEPs support Commission's proposal to extend Member State powers to negotiate bilateral agreements in the area of family law
2009-04-30 - 16:21
The Justice and Home Affairs Committee supports the Commission proposal to allow Member States to negotiate and conclude agreements with third countries in matters relating to parental responsibility, maintenance obligations and relevant laws. The procedure will be subject to Commission approval, and any agreement must not interfere with Community interests. This is a change from precedent, as currently, the power to negotiate bilateral agreements in this area is exclusively a Union competence. In 2006, the European Court of Justice confirmed its opinion in the Lugano case, which stated that the Community has the exclusive competence to "negotiate and conclude international agreements with third countries" in areas relating to Title IV of the Treaty. The Commission is proposing this new procedure so that if there is not enough Community interest in replacing "all existing or proposed bilateral agreements" between Member States and third party countries, then Member States should have the power to conclude their own agreements. The procedure would be monitored by the Commission and each case would be considered on an individual basis.
Committee recognises the historical significance of some agreements
Committee MEPs are proposing to amend the text of the Commission to include an acknowledgement that some bilateral agreements in this areas "very often reflect historical links" between the Member State and the third party state. Therefore, in order to respect this, if the Commission analysis concludes that there is no Community interest in a certain area, then the Member State should be authorised to continue with the negotiations. The committee is proposing that Community interest should be seen to exist if five or more Member States have concluded or wish to conclude an agreement with the same third party state in the same area of law.
However, the committee MEPs believe that the proposed regulation should ensure that criteria for authorising Member States to continue, should strike a balance between the interests of the Community and the Member States. This means that any proposed agreement should not undermine or "render Community law ineffective." As this procedure is a departure from the norm, the rapporteur believes that there needs to be "very precise conditions."

MEPs call for changes to proposed regulation on bilateral agreements concerning sectoral matters
2009-04-30 - 16:21
The Committee on Legal Affairs is putting forward a number of amendments to the Commission's proposed regulation on bilateral agreements with third party countries concerning sectoral matter, and applicable law in contractual and non-contractual obligations which would change the procedure for the authorisation of the conclusion of negotiations, and which ensures that the Parliament, Council and other Member States are kept fully informed of the process. Currently, the area of civil justice is governed by a combination of Community law and bilateral agreements between Member States and third party countries. Many of these agreements were concluded before the Amsterdam Treaty came into force or before the relevant Member State became part of the EU, and therefore they may not comply with Community law. These agreements should be denounced if they are not compatible.
The 2007 European Court of Justice's judgement in the Lugano case established the idea that the Community has the exclusive competence to negotiate and conclude agreements with third countries. Therefore, the Commission has taken the view that the bilateral agreements concerning civil and commercial matters are now an exclusive Community competence. The rapporteur indicates that this view is not shared by all commentators, and in the Treaty, the areas of freedom, security and justice are considered to be shared competences.
Changes to the authorisation process
The Commission proposes that if a Member State wishes to make a bilateral agreement in this area, then they should inform the Commission of their intention before starting negotiations, at the conclusion of negotiations and before signing the agreement. In theory, the Commission could reject an agreement at the conclusion stage, despite the fact that the negotiations met all of the initial requirements. The committee is concerned by this, as they believe that a rejection could lead to "major diplomatic problems with the third country concerned." Therefore, the rapporteur is recommending a negotiating period between the Member State and the Commission, rather than an outright rejection.
The committee also proposes a number of changes which, if adopted, will simplify the procedure and adjust some of the time limits suggested by the Commission. The rapporteur is also suggesting a number of measures which will ensure that the EP, Council and other Member States are kept informed of possible agreements with third countries, so that they can declare a Community interest in the same area, and can monitor the process.

What is "fresh" chicken?
2009-04-30 - 16:21
Poultry meat that has been frozen and then thawed should not be described as "fresh", says a report by the EP Agriculture Committee that comes before the full Parliament in Strasbourg. The report also expresses strong disapproval of the use of substances such as chlorine to decontaminate chicken carcasses. The consultative report by Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL, PT) adopted by the Agriculture Committee on 31 March approves, with a few amendments designed to tighten up the text, a draft regulation adjusting EU rules on the marketing of poultry which date from 1990. The new regulation seeks to extend the rules to poultry meat preparations and products, and poultry meat in brine, to reflect changing consumer habits.
Members of the Agriculture Committee agree with the Commission that only meat which has been kept at a temperature between -2°C and +4°C should be described as "fresh".
Labels must indicate origin and date of slaughter
Among their amendments, MEPs call for a compulsory indication on labels of the origin or source of the meat to enable consumers to make a properly informed choice. They also want it to be mandatory to indicate the date of slaughter of the bird.
No to anti-microbe treatment
MEPs also want to delete from the Commission's draft regulation anything that might pave the way to allowing "chlorinated chicken" on the European market. They stress that meat intended for human consumption must have undergone no treatment other than refrigeration.
The Commission proposal was intended to make the EU definition of poultry meat more flexible in line with its parallel plan to authorise four anti-microbe treatments - including chlorine - to decontaminate chicken carcasses for human consumption. That plan was overwhelmingly opposed by the European Parliament in a resolution of June 2008 and then finally buried by the Council of Agriculture Ministers on 18 December.

Laboratory research: limiting animal testing without hampering scientific progress
2009-04-30 - 16:21
For obvious ethical reasons, the use of animals in scientific experiments needs to be limited and their welfare improved. But this must be done without hindering research in Europe into fighting diseases, says a report being submitted to plenary by the EP Agriculture Committee. Around 12 million animals are used for scientific research in the EU every year. This number should be reduced to a minimum and any planned tests subjected to compulsory ethical assessment, to take account of the public's concerns, according to a draft directive that has be approved under the co-decision procedure by the European Parliament and the EU Council of Ministers. These goals are broadly endorsed in the report drafted by Neil Parish (EPP-ED, UK) for the Agriculture Committee.
The committee supports a proposed ban on the use of great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and orangutans), who are threatened with extinction, except for experiments intended to conserve these species.
However, some aspects of the draft directive, which would drastically restrict the use of primates such as ouistitis and macaques, could penalise European research to the advantage of its American or Asian competitors, which are less strict on animal welfare. The committee therefore adopted amendments to the directive to make it better balanced and enable medical research to go ahead. At the same time it suggested measures to promote alternatives to animal testing.
Using fewer primates without compromising the fight against serious diseases
The reports rejects the idea that tests using non-human primates should be restricted to "life-threatening or debilitating" conditions, as this would seriously hinder research into, among other diseases, some forms of cancer, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. It points out that other European and international guidelines require that some drugs be tested on primates before they are approved, and says that tests using these animals should continue to be allowed in medical research as a whole.
Feasibility studies before animal captures are halted
The committee supports the goal of putting an end to the capturing of wild animals (F0 colonies, in the jargon) by using second-generation specimens born in laboratories (F2) instead, but MEPs' views differ over the possibility of setting up such colonies in the near future. They therefore want the Commission to carry out feasibility studies to check whether the supply of animals will be enough for EU research purposes. Meanwhile they believe a transition period of ten years is needed instead of the seven years envisaged by the Commission.
Classification of the severity of tests
The Agriculture Committee also adopted amendments to clarify the text of the legislation, giving definitions for the three categories of pain inflicted during a test ("up to mild", "moderate" or "severe"). To avoid repeated suffering, the Commission wants to allow the same animals to be re-used only if the test entails pain classed as "up to mild". MEPs, however, believe that applying criteria that are too strict would result in even more animals being used for tests, which would defeat the object. They therefore ask for animals to be re-usable if the test entails "moderate" pain. This would include blood tests or implants performed under anaesthetic.
More effort to devise alternative methods
One of the key features of the directive for reducing the number of tests on animals is the development of alternative methods. However, the directive is unclear about the role in this area of the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods. MEPs believe the centre should be expanded to give it a genuine role in coordinating and promoting the development and use of methods that can replace animal testing. They add that the Commission and Member States must provide material support for the development of such new experimental approaches.
More transparency without increasing red tape
Other amendments seek to spell out the requirements for transparency regarding any tests performed and to prevent red tape which would bring little animal welfare benefit.
In particular, MEPs want the prior authorisations required for animal tests to be limited to projects where the pain would be "severe" or to those carried out on primates.
Lastly, the committee does not want the directive to cover larval forms and embryonic or foetal forms other than mammals, because of the complications of counting and recording the thousands of eggs laid by some female fish or amphibian species.
Next steps after the elections
Due to end-of-legislature calendar constraints, it has not been possible to conduct talks with the Council of Ministers with a view to reaching a first-reading agreement before the European elections in June. It will therefore be up to the newly-elected Parliament to confirm or amend the outgoing Parliament's position and negotiate with Member State representatives to conclude work on this directive.

Viable rules on the welfare of animals at the time of slaughter
2009-04-30 - 16:21
Parliament will vote on plans to tighten up the rules on animal welfare at the time of slaughter. The Agriculture Committee is urging that unnecessary suffering by animals be broadly avoided but that an exemption be granted for ritual slaughter, on the grounds that religious freedom must be respected. Every year in the European Union, 360 million pigs, cattle, sheep and goats are killed, as are over 4 billion poultry birds and 25 million animals reared for fur. In its vote on a consultation report drafted by Janusz Wojciechowski (UEN, PL), the Agriculture Committee approved a European Commission proposal seeking to replace the 1993 directive on the protection of animals at the time of slaughter by a new regulation to improve animal welfare while allowing more uniform application of EU rules in Member States. Amendments adopted in committee are chiefly intended to clarify the rules so they can be more easily applied and protect animals effectively, to prevent red tape and to ensure that imports comply with EU standards.
Stunning before death, except for religious slaughter
The Agriculture Committee approves the principle that animals must be slaughtered only using methods that ensure death instantly or after stunning, except in the case of religious rituals, for which they called for the current blanket exemption to be preserved rather than allowing for exemptions to be decided at national level. An amendment by the rapporteur calling for special labelling of products of religious slaughter was rejected in committee, as were calls by other Members for stunning to be made compulsory before animals' throats are cut, something which religious communities oppose.
Avoiding practices that cause unnecessary suffering
To prevent unnecessary suffering, Agriculture Committee members voted in favour of restraining animals only if the person responsible for stunning or killing it is ready to perform his task and for bleeding to start as soon as possible after stunning to ensure the animal does not regain consciousness before death.
In addition, the committee approved the introduction of indicators to detect signs of consciousness or sensibility in animals during killing operations, so as to check the reliability of stunning procedures.
Clarifying responsibilities, cutting red tape
While the committee was in favour of the appointment of an animal welfare officer for each slaughterhouse, it stressed that responsibility for ensuring compliance with the rules must lie with the operator or company, not with an individual employee who cannot oversee enforcement of the rules. But to ensure small slaughterhouses remain viable, it decided that establishments slaughtering up to 50 livestock units per week or 150,000 units of poultry per year, should be exempted from this rule.
The committee also opposed the introduction of national reference centres in the Member States, the latter having already set up competent authorities.
Imports must comply with the rules too
The European Union's animal welfare rules are among the strictest in the world and this sometimes leads to higher production costs and distortions of competition with countries which are less careful in this area. Agriculture Committee members therefore believe the Commission should ensure that meat and other animal products imported from non-EU countries meet European standards. They call for inspections to be carried out in abattoirs authorised to export to the European Union and attestations that EU standards have been met to be supplied in addition to the health certificates already required for imports.
In addition, the committee highlights the need to provide adequate EU funding for European producers in order to compensate for the competitive disadvantage they would suffer.
Lastly, MEPs call on the Commission to present draft legislation on the use of mobile abattoirs by 1 January 2013. Rapporteur Janusz WOJCIECHOWSKI UEN PL A6-0185/2009 Protection of animals at the time of killing (repeal. Directive 93/119/EC) Procedure : Consultation

Rosé wines and permitted oenological practices
2009-04-30 - 16:21
Several MEPs will be putting questions to the Commission on rosé wines and permitted oenological practices. In the context of the discussion of the regulations implementing the CMO in wine, the Commission intends to rescind the provisions in force until 31 July 2009 concerning oenological practices so as to lift the ban on blending white wines with red wines without a protected designation of origin (PDI) or protected geographical indication (PGI) to produce rosé wine. In recent decades, wine-growers in many regions in Member States have made considerable efforts, accompanied by substantial investment, to develop high-quality rosé wines which are recognised as wines in their own right and which meet a growing demand.
These efforts have helped to achieve balance in local and regional economies and in land use. Operators in the industry in the regions concerned have expressed their strong concern, inter alia to Parliament through the Viticulture-Tradition-Quality Intergroup, about the serious economic, ecological and employment impact of a decision which will make it possible to produce cheap rosé wine. This measure is liable, in particular, to cause confusion between traditional rosé wines and blended wines and to give rise to unfair competition which, even in the short term, could destroy traditional production of rosé wines.
In view of these concerns and the possible disastrous impact of a hasty decision, will the Commission:
1. postpone the contested decision, which is scheduled for the end of April;
2. undertake a broadly-based consultation exercise with the industry on the basis of a thorough study of the possible economic, social and environmental impact of lifting the ban on blending;
3. propose options which will make European wines more competitive on the European market and in third countries, while safeguarding traditional rosé wines against unfair competition?

Lisbon Treaty: Increased powers for national parliaments
2009-04-30 - 16:21
A comprehensive review of the European Union's new institutional structure, should the Lisbon Treaty enter into force in 2009 as foreseen by the December 2008 European Council, is being put forward by the Constitutional Affairs Committee. A report by Jo Leinen (PES, DE) on the "New tasks and responsibilities of the EP for the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty" and another by Elmar Brok (EPP-ED, DE) on the "Development of the relations between the EP and national parliaments in the frame of the Lisbon Treaty" were approved by large majority.
A greater role for national parliaments
In the report by Mr Brok, the committee welcomes the new rights of the national parliaments, as agreed in the Treaty of Lisbon, which would enhance their role in the EU decision-making system.
National parliaments would also gain a new right to be informed on, inter alia, the evaluation of policies conducted in the area of freedom, security and justice, proposals to amend the treaties and new candidate countries' applications to join the Union.
Orange card: the right to object
National parliaments would gain the right to object to a proposal, by using so-called "orange cards", if they felt the subsidiarity principle had been breached (e.g. that a given result could be better attained by action at national rather than EU level).
In addition, a national parliament could seek to remedy an infringement of the subsidiarity principle by bringing an action before the Court of Justice, if allowed by national law.
More powers for the European Parliament in justice and home affairs
The report by Mr Leinen welcomes the fact that, with a few exceptions, the new Treaty would place the European Parliament on an equal footing with the Council as a lawmaker in areas where this has not been case so far, notably in setting the EU budget (the EP would enjoy full parity), agriculture policy and justice and home affairs.
Specifically, the committee welcomes new EU policies and the binding character that the Treaty gives to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, thus requiring EU institutions to respect citizens' civil, political, economic or social rights.
Call for agreement among the EU institutions on foreign policy and "work programme"
Among the new legal bases Lisbon would bring into force, committee members stress that the new provisions affecting foreign policy need a new inter-institutional balance, to ensure Parliament's right of scrutiny.
Finally, the committee calls on the other EU institutions to reach an inter-institutional agreement on the key objectives to be achieved by the European Union after 2009, forming a kind of "work programme" for the EU, and on the implementing measures needed to make "the new Treaty a success for the institutions and for European citizens".

Lisbon Treaty: balancing the EU institutional framework
2009-04-30 - 16:21
The June European election results must be taken into account when nominating the President of the new Commission, says the Constitutional Affairs Committee. The legal implications and the changes to the institutional balance of the Lisbon Treaty, if and when it enters into force, are addressed in the report by Jean-Luc DEHAENE (EPP-ED, BE) "The EP's Committee on Constitutional Affairs demands a political agreement between the Czech Presidency and the Parliament on the procedure for choosing the President of the next Commission", said committee chairman Jo Leinen (PES-DE). "The procedure of renewal of the Commission College ought to start only after the referendum in Ireland because only then will the exact number of Commission members be determined" he added.
If the new Treaty is ratified during this year, the European Parliament wants to be ready to address a number of issues arising from the new institutional framework. Among the many topics discussed, the committee proposes solutions on the composition of the new Parliament, the nomination of the Commission President and the Union's representation in foreign policy.
Nomination of the Commission President: election results must be taken into account
The European Council, when choosing its President, the President of the Commission and the High Representative for foreign policy, must take into account the relevant competence of the candidates and respect a gender and a political balance and the geographical and demographic diversity of the Member States, says the Constitutional Affairs Committee.
If Lisbon enters into force, the Commission President would be elected by the EP on a proposal by the European Council, which needs to take into account the results of the European elections and to conduct consultations with Parliament's representatives, say committee members, who ask the European Council to allow enough time for the consultation procedure to be completed informally.
The committee also proposes a timeframe to allow Parliament's prerogatives provided by the new Treaty to be respected. The newly-elected EP would need two weeks to establish itself, according to the proposed schedule, so consultations between the presidents of the European Council and the European Parliament could take place in the third week following the elections. Then, separate meetings would have to be organised between the President of the European Council and the chairs of the political groups. In the following week, the European Council could propose its candidate for Commission President, taking into account the results of the consultations.
Parliament's composition
EU leaders agreed in December last year on transitional arrangements concerning the composition of the Parliament, should the Lisbon Treaty enter into force and thus change the configuration of EP seats by temporarily increasing the overall number of Members so as to respect a demographic and representative balance.
Committee members therefore call on Member States to make all the national legal provisions necessary to allow the pre-election in June of the 18 supplementary MEPs, so that they can sit in Parliament as observers from the date when the Lisbon treaty eventually enters into force.
Balance and representation in foreign policy
The new Treaty, if ratified, will create new posts at the top of the EU, namely the President of the European Council and the High Representative for Foreign Policy, who will also be the Commission Vice-President.
To ensure that this complex system, designed to enhance the EU's political coherence, does not hamper its efficiency, the committee proposes that in the foreign policy sphere, the President of the European Council should represent the Union only at the level of Heads of State or Government. Political negotiations on behalf of the Union, at ministerial level or in international organisations, should instead be carried out only by the High Representative/Vice-President, it says.

MEPs to welcome the financial and institutional changes brought by the Lisbon Treaty
2009-04-30 - 16:21
The Lisbon Treaty brings a number of "major changes in the area of the Union's finances, in particular as regards inter-institutional relations and decision-making procedures", according to a report by the Committee on Budgets. The rapporteur, Catherine Guy-Quint (PES, FR) welcomes the clarification of the decision making process, the increases in the power of the European Parliament and the improved "democratic scrutiny and transparency of the Union's finances." Formalisation of the Multiannual Financial Framework
The Treaty grants formal status to the Multiannual Financial Framework, which determines the EU's expenditure and places limits on Union spending. Under the provisions of the Treaty, Parliament must jointly approve the MFF with the Council, but MEPs criticise the fact that this has not been extended to the full co-decision procedure. The committee therefore recognises that inter-institutional dialogue needs to be established from the start of the procedure if it is to be successful.
The report also welcomes the extension of the MFF to a five year period, as this will enable it to coincide with the terms of office of the Parliament and the Commission. This is significant as the current system means that some parliamentary terms have inherited financial frameworks which they have not been able to influence. However, the committee recognises that "a full coincidence" of all the terms may present difficulties and therefore recommends that there should be a negotiating period of one year, which will allow each new Parliament and Commission to "take fundamental financial policy decisions" during their terms.
Increasing Parliamentary powers in relation to the annual budget procedure
The abolition of the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory spending means that the EP now has equal powers with the Council when it comes to decisions concerning EU expenses, which is "warmly welcomed" by the committee. Changes to the annual budget procedure also mean that there will only be a single reading of the budget for each institution which raises the importance of inter-institutional negotiations and requires the Parliament to ensure that it has identified its political priorities at an early stage. Committee MEPs believe that informal dialogues between institutions will be "crucial to facilitating agreement before the procedure starts."
Cooperation with Member States and national parliaments
The report stresses that one of the main principles of the Lisbon Treaty is that Member States remain in charge of budget revenue through the Union's own resources. Committee MEPs also want to encourage further participation by national parliaments by inviting them to take part in an annual public debate on national and Community budgetary policy guidelines. This will allow the coordination of national policies, whilst taking into account contributions to the Community.

Amendments to Parliament's Rules of Procedure, taking up changes agreed by the political groups in a third package of reforms to update its internal procedures, are being put forward by the Constitutional Affairs Committee. These reforms complete a process begun two years ago. The first two packages, adopted in 2007 and 2008, dealt with plenary sessions, EP reports, the legislative process and inter-institutional relations. The Committee also recommends approving another report to provide for changes in Parliament's Rules of Procedure that would come into force if and when the Lisbon Treaty is ratified by all Member States.
Both reports were drafted by Richard Corbett (PES, UK). The report on the third reform package was approved in committee with 19 votes in favour, three against and two abstentions. The one on the Lisbon Treaty was approved with 20 votes in favour, three against and one abstention.
The changes approved include reforms to:
allow the use of joint committee meetings for complex legislative dossiers that cross committee boundaries,
make it mandatory for the Conference of Committee Chairs to give a recommendation to the Conference of Presidents on how to resolve any conflict of competences between committees,
generally increase co-operation between committees, notably by enhancing the role of opinion-giving committees; formalise EP s consultation with European civil society,
clarify the role of "intergroups", i.e. unofficial groupings formed on specific issues with Members from different political groups,
modify existing rules on debates in plenary,
introduce a motion to reject the Commission's proposal in first reading; and
formalise the negotiating procedure with other EU institutions (e.g. for "first reading" agreements).
These reforms complete a process begun two years ago, when a working group on EP Reform was proposed by Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering and established under the chairmanship of Dagmar Roth-Behrendt (PES, DE).
The first two packages, adopted in autumn 2007 and autumn 2008, related to the organisation of plenary sessions, the handling of EP reports, the operation of the legislative process and improvements in inter-institutional relations.
Changes relating to the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty
The approved amendments, which cannot enter into force unless the Treaty ratification process is successfully concluded, include reforms to:
regulate role of observers from accession countries,
establish a procedure to ensure respect for the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality,
establish a procedure for Treaty revision, including the Convention,
set up a procedure for the election of the President of the Commission, and introduce a secret ballot vote, and
set up a procedure for approving the withdrawal of a Member State. Rapporteur Richard CORBETT PES UK A6-0273/2009 General review of the Rules of Procedure Procedure : Regulatory

Constitutional affairs
Commission should put forward a proposal to adopt the European Citizens' Initiative, say MEPs
2009-04-30 - 16:21
The Commission is being called on by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to prepare a proposal to adopt the European Citizen's Initiative, once the Lisbon Treaty has been brought into force. According to proposals laid out by rapporteur, Sylvia-Yvonne Kaufmann (GUE/NGL, DE), the Citizens' Initiative will, for the first time, allow citizens of the European Union a "direct role in the exercise of the European Union's sovereign power", and in the creation of legislative proposals. The Treaty of Lisbon introduces the idea of European Citizens' Initiatives, where 1 million European citizens from a "significant" number of Member States can take an initiative to invite the Commission to submit a proposal "on matters where citizens consider that a legal act of the Union is required for the purpose of implementing the Treaties." Essentially, this means that 1 million European citizens are being granted the same right to request the Commission to submit a legislative proposal, which the Council and Parliament have already. The report stresses the fact that whilst the outcomes of an initiative and a petition may be similar, they are very different procedures as they are submitted to different institutions, and concern different areas.
Proposed procedure
Once organisers have successfully gathered 1 million signatures across a "significant" number of Member States, the initiative can be submitted to the Commission, who will then deem whether or not it is admissible. According to the procedure being proposed by the committee, an initiative will be considered admissible if it contains a request to the Commission to submit a proposal for a legal act, if it concerns an EU competence, and the request is not contrary to the EU's general principles. This decision must not under any circumstances be based on "considerations of political expediency." All successfully accepted initiatives must be made available on a publically accessible website.
After an initiative has been registered, and the organisation concerned has presented the issue to the Commission, the Commission must verify whether or not the initiative is representative. If an initiative is to be considered representative, it must have one million signatures, who are nationals of at least a quarter of all Member States and within each of these Member States, 1/500 of the population must have signed. This is to ensure that all proposed initiatives are fully representative of European opinion and not just one or two nations.
In the last stage, the Commission is expected to issue a formal statement on the initiative within three months; if it does not, then the Commission must report to Parliament and the organisers to explain why.
Transparency
Finally, the report emphasises the role of transparency, and calls on the organising groups to submit a report to the Commission of their sources of funding. This is seen as necessary because the initiatives are "a means of exercising public sovereign power in the area of legislation and is subject, as such, to the transparency principle." As a general rule, the Commission should not begin to address the content of an initiative until this report is received. Rapporteur Sylvia-Yvonne KAUFMANN GUE/NGL DE A6-0043/2009 Guidelines for a proposal of a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on the implementation of the citizens' initiative, pursuant to Article 11(4) of the Treaty on the European Union Procedure : own-initiative

Pollution at sea: MEPs vote for compulsory criminal law penalties
2009-04-30 - 16:21
More effective measures to combat pollution at sea through stricter legal penalties in EU law are being put forward in a legislative report by the Transport Committee. Parliament and Council have reached a first-reading agreement that will be debated and put to the vote. Minor cases or criminal offences
Pollution incidents that do not seriously affect water quality may be regarded as "minor cases" and should not be considered as criminal offences.
Under the terms of the present Directive, illicit ship-source discharges of polluting substances will be considered as a criminal offence as long as they have been committed with intent, recklessly or with serious negligence and result in a deterioration of the quality of water. Less serious cases of illicit ship-source discharges of polluting substances that do not cause a deterioration of the quality of water need not be considered as criminal offences. Under the terms of the present Directive such discharges shall be referred to as "minor cases".
But if the discharges are repeated, deliberate or caused by serious negligence, and lead to a serious deterioration of the water quality, then they must be considered criminal offences and punished with effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties.
The aim of MEPs was to deter the responsible parties in sea transport who would rather pollute because paying an administrative fine costs less than obeying the law.
The directive cannot determine the type or exact level of penalties, this being a matter for the Member States.
Background
The draft directive was brought forward following a 2005 ruling of the Court of Justice which stated that the European Community does have the power to ask its Member States to apply criminal law penalties in the transport industry. However, the directive cannot determine the type or exact level of penalties, this being a matter for the Member States.
Entry into force
Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive not later than twelve months following the date of its entry into force. Rapporteur Luis DE GRANDES PASCUAL EPP-ED ES A6-0080/2009 Maritime safety, prevention of ship-source pollution: penalties for infringements (amend.

Airport slots: MEPs agree to suspend the "use it or lose it" rule
2009-04-30 - 16:21
Airline companies hit by the economic slowdown will benefit from relaxed rules on the allocation of airport slots, allowing them not to lose unused slots, according to a report on a draft Regulation for the Transport Committee. Air carriers will be entitled to the same series of slots during the summer 2010 scheduling season as were allocated to them during the summer 2009 season, even if they use them less than 80% of the time this year, according to the draft Regulation revising rules laid out by the EU in 1993 (Regulation EEC No 95/93.)
The global economic crisis led to a significant reduction in air traffic over the winter 2008/09 scheduling season. More than 80% of European airports have seen a reduction in traffic since the beginning of the year and the summer season is expected to confirm this negative trend, with Eurocontrol forecasting a 4.9% fall in the number of flights.
The revised rules were therefore proposed by the Commission in March as an urgent measure to prevent airline companies from suffering the consequences in 2010 of their under-use of slots in 2009.
Future revisions of the rules
Transport Committee MEPs approved the Commission's proposal for the 2009 season, but refused to allow use of the "comitology" procedure - which would delegate decisions to the Commission without requiring new co-decision legislation - for future revisions of the rules.
Airline slots are allocated to companies each season (in November for the following summer season and in June for the following winter season) at the IATA (International Air Transport Association) scheduling conferences. They grant airports the right to schedule a landing or departure during a specific time period.
The Commission shall continue to analyse the impact of the economic crisis on the air transport sector. Should the situation continue to deteriorate during the winter 2009/10 season, it may propose to renew all or part of these arrangements for the winter 2010/2011 season.
Network airlines in favour, airports and low-cost companies critical
Representatives of network airlines, consulted by Parliament's rapporteur and Chairman of the Transport Committee, Paolo Costa (IT, ALDE), said the suspension of the "use it or lose it" rule is absolutely necessary in light of the sharp drop in demand. Airlines should not be forced to maintain operations at an uneconomical level in order to protect the slots, they told the rapporteur. Airline representatives also pointed out that the proposal would prevent European airlines, for which there have been no bail-outs, from losing slots to major competitors in China, India and Japan, who benefit from substantial state aids.
European airports reply that the proposed rules are anti-competitive, as they would create a barrier to efficient airlines wanting to enter the market. They told MEPs that there are many airlines waiting to take up slots at all major airports in Europe. The proposed measure would prevent airports from using scarce capacity in the most efficient way, they said.
Representatives of low-cost carriers, also severely hit by the crisis, expressed their fears that the measures will lead to fewer flights and higher ticket prices for consumers. Rapporteur Paolo COSTA ALDE IT A6.0274/2009 Alloation of slots at Community airports Procedure : Codecision (1st reading)

Petrol vapour recovery during refuelling of passenger cars at service stations
2009-04-30 - 16:21
Petrol contains volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that evaporate inside the fuel tank, filling the empty space in the tank above the fuel. As a vehicle is refuelled, these vapours are pushed out of the tank by the incoming fuel and, unless captured, escape into the atmosphere out of the top of the vehicle filler pipe. Dimitrios PAPADIMOULIS (GUE/NGL, EL) will be putting forward a legislative report on vapour recovery during refuelling of passenger cars at service stations. MEPs and Council have reached a first-reading agreement on this.
Petrol vapour recovery systems, currently being introduced by several European countries, will become compulsory at new or renovated service stations with great throughput in the whole of the EU as of 1 January 2012. All service stations will be obliged to install these systems by 31 December 2018 at the latest. Small service stations attending to only a few cars a day will be exempt from this rule. The Member States will draw drivers’ attention to the recovery systems by appropriate labelling of petrol pumps. According to Commission data, the EU numbers about 110,000 service stations that employ some 440,000 workers and have an annual turnover of some 250 billion euros.
Once released into the atmosphere VOCs react in the presence of sunlight with nitrogen oxides to form ground level ozone. This is one of the components of photochemical smog, which harms human health, vegetation and building materials.
Ozone is a highly irritating transboundary gaseous air pollutant, and exposure to it can be harmful to people’s health. Increases in levels of ozone have been associated with increases in general mortality rates and in respiratory-disease–associated hospitalisations. In addition to its effects on human health, ozone is known to have detrimental effects on plants and crop yields. Ozone also has a damaging effect on materials such as natural and synthetic rubber, surface coatings (such as paints and varnishes) and textiles. In combination with other pollutants it has been shown to damage metals and stone.
Benzene is a VOC and a component of petrol. It is also a known human genotoxic carcinogen and is associated with a heightened risk of illnesses such as leukaemia. Human exposure comes mainly from tobacco smoke, petrol vapour and from vehicle exhaust emissions.
In addition, the Commission recognises that a greater uptake on biofuels (such as bioethanol in petrol) may lead to greater emissions of petrol vapour (benzene, ozone and other VOCs), due to an increased vapour pressure of the resulting blends.
The Commission Proposal
The need to deliver cleaner air has been recognised for several decades with action having been taken at national and EU level and also through international conventions.
Improving the quality of our ambient air remains a major challenge to be addressed. The problem of air pollution can only be solved in the long term and within a European framework, particularly by stepping up cross-border measures. The long term objectives for health and the environment, as established by previous decisions, will not be attained on the basis of current policies, even by 2020, according to recent findings. The Thematic Strategy for Air Quality of 2005 and the legislation that followed (in particular directive 2008/50) proposed several measures to help deliver further progress towards the long term objectives, including additional measures at source, such as controls on the refuelling of petrol cars at service stations.
The Commission's proposal aims at recovering petrol vapour which is emitted to the atmosphere during the refuelling of passenger cars at service stations. An existing directive (1994/63) is already regulating the control of VOCs emissions from the storage of petrol and its distribution from terminals to service stations.
The rapporteur's amendments go towards the direction of strengthening the Commission's proposal, taking into account:
-that the level of emissions of VOCs from service stations is related to fuel throughput and human exposure is related to a person’s proximity to the emission source. Accordingly, the larger the service station and the closer a person is working or living to the vicinity of the service station, the higher the likelihood of encountering high concentrations of VOCs in the ambient air. Smaller petrol stations emit proportionately fewer emissions than other throughput categories, and
- the cost of installation. Whilst the benefits of any stage II system would usually be determined at the level of society as a whole, it is interesting to note that there are considerable distributional effects related to the economic value of the recovered petrol vapour. The recovery and sale of vapour as petrol over the period can offset these costs. A recent UK study indicated a net economic benefit, over the lifetime of the equipment, from the sale of recovered vapour for service stations.
Rapporteur's amendments
a. Extend the scope of the Directive to all motor vehicles.
b. Strengthen the level of protection by asking for the minimum permitted level of petrol vapour recovery to be equal to or greater than 95%.
c. Include all existing service stations under permanent living quarters or working areas which undergo a major refurbishment to the scope of the proposal, regardless of their throughput.
d. Reduce the required throughput of existing petrol stations and advance the compliance date for them.
e. Lead to achieving better compliance by testing, monitoring and inspections of log books of service stations and introduce a reporting duty for Member States.
f. Establish a workable and transparent procedure on sanctions for non-compliance, by introducing the "name and shame" system which shall ensure compliance with the rules laid down in the Directive.
g. Introduce a review clause, in order for the Commission to establish harmonised methods to measure the hydrocarbon capture efficiency, as soon as possible.
h. introduce an earlier transposition date in recognition of the Member States commitments to reducing emissions of VOCs under the Gothenburg Protocol and the National Emission Ceilings Directive for 2010.

Situation in the Republic of Moldova
2009-04-30 - 16:21
Parliament will vote on a resolution on the situation in the Republic of Moldova to follow up its plenary debate of 23 April after violent protests took place in that country amid claims by opposition parties that the parliamentary elections of 5 April were rigged. A delegation of MEPs went to Moldova from 26 to 29 April on a fact-finding mission. The allegations of human rights violations that followed the publication of results of the elections of 5 April in Moldova was the main focus of concern for a delegation of four MEPs, led by Marianne Mikko (PES, EE), who visit Moldova from 26 to 29 April.
In Chisinau, MEPs visited police stations and prison number 13 (Tuesday 28th).
The delegation's programme included meetings with local NGOs. These organisations have denounced human rights violations and the inhumane detention conditions of demonstrators (Monday 27th).
MEPs had high-level meetings with the Moldovan authorities (Tuesday 28th).
Composition of the delegation
Other members of the delegation were Marie-Anne Isler-Béguin (Greens/EFA, FR), Marian-Jean Marinescu (EPP-ED, RO) and Karin Resetarits (ALDE, AT). Debate Thursday, 23 April 2009 - Strasbourg Situation in the Republic of Moldova

External relations
Women's rights and empowerment for women are 'crucial' to the success of EU's external policy, according to MEPs
2009-04-30 - 16:21
The Committee on Foreign Affairs states that as well as ensuring that gender mainstreaming is a priority in external policies, the EU can lead by example by increasing the number of women in high-level positions, increasing personnel working on gender issues and by providing gender-related training to key staff on European Security and Defence Policy missions. Women's rights are central to the success of the EU's external policies on aid, development, enlargement, neighbourhood policy, conflict resolution, security, peace-building and international trade, according to a report drafted by Libor Rouček (PES, CZ).
Whilst Member States are adherents to "all major frameworks on gender equality and women's rights", the levels of practical implementation and financial support remain "weak" and "inefficient". Furthermore, despite significant improvements in the promotion of gender mainstreaming in the EU institutions, there are still not enough staff dedicated solely to this issue. Committee MEPs are therefore calling on Member States and the EU to increase their commitment to gender equality, and to ensure that there are sufficient levels of personnel to provide support.
Gender mainstreaming in external policies
Gender mainstreaming is "essential to the successful implementation of the EU's external policies." As such, the committee is calling on the Council and Commission to ensure that gender equality and women's empowerment are systematically included in their discussions with partner countries. This commitment should also be reflected in Parliament's delegations, who should address the issue when visiting third-country parliaments, and in the provision of support and funding for third-country legislatures to "introduce gender perspective into their legislative work."
The Commission is being called on to address in a more systematic way, gender inequalities in the programming and implementation of external assistance instruments. Gender-specific objectives and funding also need to become part of country-strategy papers, and a more holistic approach to equality should be taken in external assistance instruments such as the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance. Furthermore, the committee believes that in light of the EU's development policy commitments that the Community should be prioritising the issues of health, the prevention of sexual violence against women and ending human trafficking.
Truly effective gender mainstreaming requires increased cooperation between donors and actors, say committee MEPs. This means that better accountability and ownership of development projects by national governments is needed; one means of doing this is to encourage the involvement of civil-society organisations in political dialogues. Therefore, the committee is calling on the Commission to "channel adequate financial support" to NGOs in the area of women's empowerment.
Increasing female representation in EU institutions and provision of adequate training
The report states that the current levels of staff allocated to gender mainstreaming issues is inadequate as many of them are forced to dedicate their time to a number of other issues, and the committee also notes that there is a lack of women in high-level posts in the Commission and Council. Therefore, committee MEPs are calling for measures to increase the participation of women in high-level positions, and for the numbers of staff dedicated to gender issues.
The committee notes that there has been considerable effort to include a gender-sensitive approach in the culture of the ESDP, and they welcome the inclusion of a gender advisor to almost all ESDP missions. However, Member States should also include more women in ESDP missions and operations, say committee MEPs. Alongside this, there should be measures to ensure that the issues of gender equality are considered from the very start of the planning process for missions, through to the implementation.
Finally, the report commends the ESDP for creating initiatives for gender-related training to staff on their missions, and the Commission for making "considerable efforts" to train its staff. Committee MEPs believe that this training should be extended to all staff participating in EU external policies, and is calling on the Commission and Member States to ensure that this is provided.

The democratic process in Turkey
2009-04-30 - 16:21
MEPs will discuss the progress of democratic reform in Turkey in Strasbourg next week. In a plenary resolution adopted on 12 March this year, Parliament criticised reforms made so far as being insufficient and stressed the need for the Turkish government "to prove its political will to continue the reform process" to which it committed itself in 2005. The resolution also called for a settlement of the Kurdish question. In the resolution, which was drafted by Ria Oomen-Ruijten (EPP-ED, NL), MEPs regret that "freedom of expression and freedom of the press are still not fully protected in Turkey". They also argue that the amendment to Article 301 of the Penal Code adopted in April 2008 was not sufficient, as people continue to be prosecuted for expressing non-violent opinions, such as Leyla Zana, winner of the EP's 1995 Sakharov Prize. The resolution was adopted by 528 votes to 52, with 43 abstentions.
The ongoing polarisation within Turkish society and between the main political parties has deepened in the course of 2008, points out the resolution. It also regrets that "the initial effort to reform comprehensively the constitution resulted in dispute over the headscarf issue and generated further polarisation of society".
MEPs are concerned about the closure cases opened in 2008 against two parliamentary parties , especially the case still pending against the Demokratik Toplum Partisi (DTP). They emphasise the need to amend, as a matter of priority, the legislation on political parties.
Lasting solution to Kurdish question
In addition, the Turkish government should launch "a political initiative favouring a lasting settlement of the Kurdish issue", says the resolution. This would need "to address the economic and social opportunities of citizens of Kurdish origin, and to tangibly improve their cultural rights, including real possibilities to learn Kurdish within the public and private schooling system and to use it in broadcasting and in access to public services".
The resolution welcomes the launch of a 24-hour public television channel in the Kurdish language as of 1 January 2009.
State of play in Turkey's accession negotiations
Turkey has so far opened only 10 of the 35 chapters in its negotiations with the EU. In 2008, only four new chapters were started, including two under the French presidency of the EU (free movement of capital, and information society and media). Just one chapter (science and research) has been completed since talks began in October 2005. Commission statement - Democratic process in Turkey

MEPs debate outcome of UN Conference against Racism
2009-04-30 - 16:21
The outcome of the Durban Review Conference aimed at tackling racism around the globe, which was held in Geneva from Monday 20 April to Friday 24 April, will be debated by MEPs on Wednesday 6 May following statements by the Council and Commission. The 2009 UN World Conference against Racism in Geneva was also known as the Durban Review Conference or Durban II, being named after the first such conference held in the South African city in 2001.
Of the EU Member States, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Poland boycotted the Geneva conference from the start. The Czech Republic's delegate left the conference following remarks by Iranian President Ahmadinejad about Israel. All the other EU delegations present also walked out in response to the Iranian president's comments but most later returned for the rest of the conference.
In the end, the conference's final Outcome Document was adopted by consensus, including with the backing of all the EU delegations. The document is a declaration on combating racism and discrimination against minorities. Amongst other things, it warns against stereotyping people because of their religion, a key demand of Islamic states who said that Muslims have been unfairly targeted. However, it also contains provisions reaffirming the importance of freedom of expression and access to information in the fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. And it omits the controversial concept of “defamation of religion”, focusing instead on protecting the rights of individual believers, rather than belief systems.

2009-04-30 - 16:21
The gradual retreat of the death penalty round the world and the progress made on women's and children's rights are among positive developments noted in the EP's 2008 draft annual report on human rights being submitted to the plenary by the Foreign Affairs Committee. However, the European Union could promote human rights more effectively, says the report. Another question is whether the EU always lives up to its own principles, for example when dealing with terrorism and immigration. The draft report was prepared by Raimon Obiols i Germà (PES, ES) on behalf of the EP's Human Rights Subcommittee and adopted by the Foreign Affairs Committee on 31 March by 41 votes to 1 with 5 abstentions.
Progress on death penalty but mixed results for international arrest warrants
On some issues there is cause for guarded optimism. The report welcomes the fact that overall "the death penalty is in retreat" , although not in Iran, where its use has increased and where juveniles continue to be executed. China still carries out the greatest number of death sentences in the world but Belarus is pinpointed as "the only country in Europe that continues to use the death penalty".
More generally, China and Iran are among countries singled out for serious human rights abuses but the report also highlights problems in Russia, Uzbekistan, Zimbabwe and many other states. MEPs welcome the successful use of international arrest warrants in bringing to justice some individuals responsible for human rights abuses but note that such warrants have had mixed results in countries including Serbia, Sudan, Congo (DRC) and Uganda.
EU record on human rights not perfect
Reflecting criticisms that Europe applies its principles only where convenient, the report cites "Member States' practices in relation to the anti-terrorism policies" of the Bush Administration. It also says immigration policy represents a challenge to the credibility of EU human rights activities in the eyes of large segments of public opinion worldwide.
In addition, the report urges all EU Member States to ratify all UN and Council of Europe human rights conventions. For example, a number of Member States have failed to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture.
Work of global and European institutions
MEPs give qualified approval to the work of the UN Human Rights Council, while noting that EU Member States are "in a minority position in the UNHRC" and calling for the EU to build alliances with countries that continue to defend "the universal and indivisible nature of human rights", in other words rejecting cultural relativism.
The drive in 2008 by the Slovenian and French EU presidencies to finalise guidelines on children's rights is a step forward but more needs to be done to protect children caught up in armed conflict. Similarly, women's rights, including violence against women, became a priority under the French presidency but there are still gaps in EU policies in this field.
MEPs believe that human rights defenders, whose own lives are often threatened, should be granted emergency visas more easily to enable them to take refuge in EU states.
Overall, argues the draft report, the EU should use its combined weight to greater effect. Quantifiable indices and benchmarks need to be devised to measure the effectiveness of EU human rights policies. And the approaches to human rights of the Commission and Member States in their missions and embassies outside the EU should be harmonised.
The author of the draft report, Mr Obiols, will give a press conference in Strasbourg on Wednesday 6th May at 2.30pm in Room LOW N -1 201.
The European Parliament report is in part a response to the EU annual report on human rights 2008 published last November by the Council and Commission (see link below).

MEDIA MUNDUS: European cinema goes global
2009-04-30 - 16:21
Parliament is expected to approve a €15 million funding package aimed at boosting the worldwide competitiveness of Europe's audiovisual industry and fostering cooperation with non-EU countries. Parliament will be voting on a report from the Culture Committee. A first-reading agreement with Council is expected.
The MEDIA MUNDUS programme for 2011 - 2013 will:
strengthen international professional collaboration, through the funding of training programmes and exchange scholarships;
contribute to co-productions between EU and non-EU film companies by facilitating access to commercial financing and supporting script development and professional networking;
improve transnational film distribution through financial support for printing, subtitling, advertising, as well as cinema theatres and broadcasters.
Cultural diversity and business opportunities
MEDIA MUNDUS is expected to create new business opportunities and jobs for audiovisual professionals in Europe and around the world. The programme also aims to put European culture on the world scene and increase consumer choice, as more European programmes will be made available on foreign markets.
"By increasing the competitiveness of the EU audiovisual industry on international markets we will we will bring European culture to the rest of the world", said rapporteur Ruth Hieronymi (EPP-ED, DE) before the committee vote on 2 April.
Presenting the programme to MEPs in the Culture Committee, EU Media Commissioner Viviane Reding said: "We need to train the public to enjoy film diversity! The MEDIA MUNDUS programme is based on the principle of mutual benefit: more European films will be distributed around the world, and more international films will be shown on European screens."
A global response to a global market
International demand for audiovisual content has grown steadily these last years, stimulated by the development of new technologies and the emergence of new markets in Asia and Latin America. Taking stock of the situation, the European Parliament adopted the Media International Preparatory Plan in the EU's 2008 budget: €2 million were allocated to 18 international projects, ranging from joint training programmes for Indian and Italian documentary makers, to marketing and promotion workshops for French and Moroccan film producers, and financial support for a global network of cinemas.
At the 2009 Cannes Film festival, Gilles Jacob (President of the Cannes Festival) Jose-Manuel Barroso, Viviane Reding and EU ministers in charge of audiovisual matters asked the Commission to put forward a proposal to pursue the initiative: the result is MEDIA MUNDUS.
New technologies
Training in new technologies, in order to meet new market trends, should in particular be provided for in the programme, Members of the Culture Committee insisted. New distribution platforms such as VOD, IPTV and Web TV as well as new production and post-production technologies need to be focused on.
Background
The current MEDIA 2007 programme, which provides €755 million to the EU's film industry for the 2007 - 2013 period, has funded award-winning films such as Slumdog Millionaire (UK), Gomorra (Italy), La Vie en Rose (France).
