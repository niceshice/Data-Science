Several thousand people will form a human chain around the European Parliament this Friday to call on decision makers to propose a "credible response to the crisis". The event is held in the 2010 European Year Against Poverty, at the initiative of a coalition of social NGOs and with the support of the European Parliament.
The gathering will take place on Friday, 19 November at 12.15, starting from the open space next to Place du Luxembourg. The participants will highlight that 84 million Europeans live under the poverty line and will call on Europe to take further action against the consequences of the crisis, in particular in terms of access to services and accommodation, equality, employment and income.
"The fight against poverty matters to everyone who believes that solidarity is a fundamental value. The participation of civil society is essential in the process to reduce poverty", said Libor Roucek (S&D, CZ), vice-president of the Parliament, who is responsible for the 'Agora' event on crisis and poverty to be held in the EP 27-28 January 2011.
Isabelle Durant, EP vice-president and co-host of the Agora event, commented: "The year dedicated to fighting poverty is coming to an end, having organised many activities and borne witness to many personal accounts. The Agora will bridge this experience to the political and legislative work of Parliament. Now we need to take action, by supporting NGOs who are working to put millions of people back on their feet, people who have found themselves in a precarious situation that has been exacerbated due to the crisis."
