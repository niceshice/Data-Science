EuroparlTV Don't freeze EU budget for 2014-2020 Freezing future EU budgets at 2013 levels - as some Member States demand - "is not a viable option", says Parliament's Policy Challenges Committee. Its budget recommendations for 2014-2020 will be debated Wednesday and put to a vote Thursday, ready for future budget negotiations with Member States.
Charging lorries for noise and air pollution EU Member States would be entitled to set "polluter pays" road tolls to reflect the real cost of noise and air pollution by heavy goods vehicles, under a proposed change to "Eurovignette" rules to be put to a vote on Tuesday.
Vote on Bulgaria and Romania bid to join Schengen area Parliament will assess whether Bulgaria and Romania are ready to join the Schengen border check-free zone. The Civil Liberties Committee says they are, but also stresses that Parliament must be kept informed of additional measures to be taken in the Bulgaria-Turkey-Greece area to deal with any surge in migration pressure.
Debate on E. coli outbreak in Germany The outbreak of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) disease in Germany and other Member States, will be debated with the Commission on Tuesday. By 31 May, 10 people had died from the disease and a further 373 serious cases had been diagnosed, in Germany alone.
Hungary's new constitution The Council and the Commission will brief MEPs on Wednesday about how they plan to ensure that the revised Hungarian Constitution does not breach fundamental EU values and principles. Parliament will vote on a resolution at a later plenary session.
MEPs to review plans to ease visa rules with Moscow The recently agreed roadmap to ease EU's visa policy with Russia will be a key topic of debate with Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy Commissioner Štefan Füle on Wednesday, ahead of the 9 June EU-Russia summit in Nizhny Novgorod (Western Russia).

Parliament demands more accountability for credit ratings agencies
An investor watches an electronic board at a stock exchange. ©BELGA/ChinaFotoPress/MAXPPP Calls for the establishment of European Credit Rating Foundation Debated Monday, voted Wednesday In the years leading up to the crisis, credit rating agencies were enthusiastic about giving complex financial instruments high ratings leading investors to buy them up, usually with no questions asked. Despite their high ratings these products later proved toxic and created huge losses, so now taxpayers have to prop up the financial system. Agencies are back with the vengeance, warning countries to tighten up their belts if they don't want to see their borrowing costs explode. On Monday MEPs debated proposals making the agencies more accountable. They approved the proposals on Wednesday
The issue is politically charged, because after issuing faulty ratings, the agencies are now back with a vengeance, warning countries to tighten up their belts, if they don't want to lose the confidence of the financial markets and see their borrowing costs explode.
The Economics Committee approved a report by German Liberal Wolf Klinz 16 March that supports measures and initiatives that would make market players (investors, banks, central banks) more engaged in risk analysis, which would reduce their over-reliance on ratings.
It also demands agencies be exposed to civil liability in cases of gross negligence. Mr Klinz said, "we should attach liability to credit rating agencies for their ratings. The statement by agencies that ratings are mere expressions of opinion does not hold and more responsibility and accountability is needed urgently."
The report also calls for the establishment of a European Credit Rating Foundation to be financed by the financial services industry for the first five years at the most (left of centre groups would have preferred a public foundation). Mr Klinz said, "a European credit rating agency is only advisable if it is fully independent and free from influence from public or other bodies. The idea behind an independent European Credit Rating Foundation is to foster competition in the quasi-oligopolistic industry structure where three globally active firms dominate the market."
How it works
In terms of how it would work people would put their savings (for retirement) in mutual and pension funds which command huge amounts of money ready for investment in shares, bonds and complex financial products.
Investing in a complex financial product means lending money to the seller / issuer of the product and you expect to get your money back with interest. It is therefore of paramount importance to know how safe a particular product is. This is where credit rating agencies that issue opinions come in as investors rely on them.
The higher the rating the safer the product and lower the interest rate (i.e. people will lend you money on the cheap if they're sure you'll pay them back). The lower the rating, the higher the interest rate on a riskier product (i.e. people will lend you money, but with higher interest to compensate for risk of you going bankrupt and them not getting all their money back).
Where did it go wrong?
In terms of where Mr Klinz thinks the current system went wrong he identifies conflicts of interest. As agencies earn money by charging fees to sellers of products for rating the latter and sellers want the highest rating to be able to sell their stuff dearly. Therefore there is an incentive to give high ratings even to subprime products to attract business and earn more fees.
As Mr Klinz said, "the key problem however was that credit rating agencies both rated these assets and at the same time were rendering advice services to the clients who were paying for the rating. This conflict of interest is at the core of the problem. The new European Supervisory Authority on Securities and Markets, ESMA, is taking up its duties in supervising credit rating agencies directly this summer. "
Many see advice services as problematic because an agency can advise an investment bank how to structure a product to get the highest rating, although the product itself is thereby not made safer, it only looks like it is.
Such irresponsible but highly profitable behaviour made the crisis worse, so governments (i.e. taxpayers) had to go even deeper into debt to rescue their financial systems.
However, worried by this increase in debt the agencies are now downgrading countries and their bonds (the lower the rating, the higher interest rate and the higher debt burden), forcing the taxpayer to pay even more; governments respond with slashing spending on e.g. social services to placate "the markets". The Socialists and GUE/NGL group wanted to reduce the scope for agencies to rate sovereign debt, but the resolution only calls for more transparency on how ratings are arrived at.
Mr Klinz said, "there is also the corporate and public debt sector which did not exhibit the same faulty ratings as in the case of structured finance products. However, I agree that the repeated downgrades in particular in the case of Greece and Spain came too late and did not help calm the markets."

MEPs to vote on "beyond GDP initiative" Tuesday
Indicators should look at education, job opportunities Gross domestic product has been used as a measure of macro-economic activity since the 1930s and is often used as an indicator for development in general, but for some GDP has clear limitations - for example, it doesn't measure the environmental and social aspects of progress. The "Beyond GDP initiative" aims to develop indicators that are as clear as GDP but include other measurements of progress. Danish Conservative Anna Rosbach has drafted a report on the initiative, which wasvoted in plenary Tuesday. She told us more.
GDP has been used as measure of macro-economic activity for 80 years. Why is it no longer enough ?
It is not enough because, for example, there are some African countries that have a lot of raw materials like gold and diamonds, making the country very rich on paper, but when it comes to the individual citizens...people are extremely poor, they don't have electricity and water. Seen in GDP terms the country is wealthy, because the dictators are getting a lot of money, they have big pockets, but it never goes out to the citizens of the country. For me this is a misuse of GDP.
In your report you stress the need to develop additional indicators. What should they take account of?
I would like to see indicators covering things like what kind of education I receive and what kind of job I can get, what I can buy, how I am treated when I am ill, what my opportunities for a good quality of life are when I get older…
But this is just my opinion. These ideas are not in the report because at this stage we are trying to create a basic compromise document which, once adopted, will be sent to the Commission asking it to come up with concrete ideas that can be measured properly and that we can take on board.
We need things which can be measured by Eurostat (the EU's statistics body), and followed up every year. So they can't be dream issues, wishing for a happy state and sunshine every day....
When do you think that these new indicators will become a reality?
I hope in the very short-term because they are much needed. Many big member states, like France and the UK, are already discussing this, as are some other countries outside the EU. The EU is coming to this a bit late and in my view we have to step up the pressure. GDP and beyond draft report (Rosbach) GDP and beyond initiative Commission communication on GDP and beyond
Strasbourg session: historical events remembered, visit of Tajik president
Jerzy Buzek during opening of June's session Opening this week's Strasbourg plenary session, EP President Jerzy Buzek first welcomed President Rahmon of Tajikistan, who was on an official visit to the European Parliament. He then recalled that June 4 was the 22nd anniversary of the first partially-free elections in Poland but also of the Tiananmen Square Massacre in China. Later Mr Buzek made the opening statement in a debate to commemorate the deportations carried out by the Soviet authorities from the Baltic States in 1941.
Turning to the two major events of June 4 1989, Mr Buzek recalled that the authorities of the People's Republic of China had "brutally cracked down on protesters in Tiananmen Square". On the same day Poland had held the first partly free, general elections in Central and Eastern Europe. At the polls, victory had gone overwhelmingly to the democratic opposition candidates.
70th anniversary of mass deportations from the Baltic States
A short debate, with speeches by EP political group speakers, was held to mark the 70th anniversary this month of mass deportations by the Soviet authorities from the Baltic States, which had been occupied since 1940.
Launching the debate, President Buzek said the deportations were intended "to deprive the nations of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania of their social and political elites". It was our duty today, he stressed, "to cherish the memory" of these hundreds of thousands of victims of Soviet terror in the Baltic States. Nevertheless, added the President, the suffering of the peoples of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia had given them the determination and strength to push half a century later for independence and to return to a united Europe.
Two MEPs change groups

Update: Euro cash transport vote postponed
Aim to have single cross-border system in euro- zone ©BELGA/WESTEND61/P.Koschel The amount of euro cash in circulation is worth more than any other currency in the world, including the US dollar; but while people move easily across internal borders with their euros there is very little cross-border road transportation because of differing national rules. A vote on proposals for a single set of rules for cross-border cash transports was postponed Tuesday in Parliament, following a change to the agreed text by the Hungarian presidency.
More than 330 million people in 17 EU countries now use the euro and every summer millions of them roll southwards in search of beautiful beaches and sunny weather. They only stay a few weeks, but they leave billions of euros behind them.
What is a minor nuisance for the individual can become a real problem for the euro- zone. Regular cash transports are necessary to avoid serious cash shortages in some less touristy parts of the euro area. But a plethora of national rules makes land transport very difficult.
Under current regulations, it is very difficult to transport banknotes and coins between euro states, according to the Commission. Rules differ for example on whether security staff are allowed to carry firearms or how their vehicles should be armoured.
The problem worsened during the financial crisis when demand for cash grew in proportion to fears about bankrupt banks and frozen assets.
The EP wants a single set of rules on cross-border transport of euro notes and coins to avoid shortages in the future. MEPs will vote on a report from French EPP member Sophie Auconie on improving the current system and coming up with unified European regulations to facilitate transports, while guaranteeing the safety of the transport crew.
"We share a common currency. So it is high time to ensure that this currency can easily circulate inside the euro-zone," Ms Auconie said.
Keeping banknotes safe
banknotes transported in a container with a cash degradation system
once the transport has started staff cannot open the container
if forced open, banknotes in the container are "neutralised" with chemicals, colours or burned

European Arrest Warrant: a question of proportion
MEPS raise concerns on use of warrant ©BELGA/EPA/R.Weihrauch It was supposed to encourage mutual trust and provide a vital weapon in the "war" against terrorism and serious crime, but the European Arrest Warrant has come under scrutiny for its sometimes indiscriminate use for minor offenses. MEPs from across the political spectrum raised the issue Wednesday.
Introduced in 2004, following a European Commission proposal in the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001, the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) is a fast-track extradition procedure between EU countries, initially aimed at terror suspects and those accused of serious crimes. However the definition of serious crime has proven open to interpretation and subject to the different legal traditions of the EU states
Increasing use
The EAW allows member state authorities to request the arrest and extradition of suspects throughout the EU, irrespective of their country of origin, for a wide range of crimes even if the offence in question is not an offence in the country of which the offender is a citizen or which has to carry out the arrest.
According to the latest data, more than 70,000 warrants were issued between 2004 and 2010 and more than 12,000 have successfully been executed. The use of the EAW has shortened the average length of intra-EU extradition requests from a year to just 16 days where the offender agrees to the extradition and 50 days if they don't.
In 2009 Poland issued the most warrants with 4844, followed by Germany with 2433, Romania with 1900, France with 1240, Hungary with 1038 and the Netherlands with 530.
Growing concerns
Wikileaks founder Julian Assange is probably the best-known person arrested under an EAW but it has also been successfully used against terror suspects, armed robbers and drug smugglers.
However, they are not the only ones. Several cases highlight the potential for abuse, such as the warrants issued for the theft of two car tyres, a piglet and a bicycle, or "possession of 0.45 grams of cannabis", as reported by the Council, as well as cases where a warrant is refused but the suspect is arrested anyway once he crosses the border. The member states and Commission believe these cases undermine the credibility of the arrest warrant.
The Commission wants the seriousness of the offence, the length of the sentence and the existence of an alternative approach to be examined before a EAW is granted given that each warrant procedure costs the taxpayer around €25,000.
... and hard questions
In oral questions to the Council and Commission Wednesday, MEPs from all groups will raise the problem of the "disproportionate use" of the warrant for minor offenses; protection of the rights of the accused throughout the process - including the right to adequate legal representation in both countries; prison conditions; and the handling of cases where a warrant is refused, but the issuing state persists in its attempts to arrest the suspect.

E-coli: MEPs call for prudence and investigation
EuroparlTV In the continued uncertainty about the cause of the recent virulent outbreak of E. coli in Germany, MEPs called Tuesday for better coordination in the future and improved enforcement of rules on food labelling and traceability. After the unjust accusation levelled against Spanish cucumbers and possibly against soya beans, members also deplored the harm done to the EU fruit and vegetable industry.
Health Commissioner John Dalli called on member states to avoid premature conclusions not based on scientific evidence, noting that the ban on European products is disproportionate, as the source so far is limited to an area around Hamburg. Farm ministers will meet later Tuesday in Luxembourg to discuss the impact on agriculture and the hardship faced by farmers.
"It's not normal that Europeans go out for a salad and die," UK Socialist Linda McAvan said. She was one of a number of MEPs who raised questions about EU farming practices, the use of antibiotics , traceability and food labelling .
German Christian Democrat Peter Liese also raised concerns about antibiotic resistance in farming. He noted that this strain of E. coli is resistant to antibiotics.
"The precautionary principle must prevail...human lives should come before economic questions," said French Liberal Corinne Lepage , calling for better enforcement of labelling and traceability rules. German GUE/NGL member Sabine Wils said, the current food transport chain makes it impossible to trace where and how food is produced.
Not handled well
Mr Liese said warnings should be issued when human health is endangered but said in this case it was made public too soon. Ms Wils said Germany had failed in managing the crisis, both at regional and central level. The "complete confusion in Germany led to disastrous consequences", she said.
German Green Rebecca Harms said neither Germany nor the EU was ready for the outbreak and Germany had a communications problem in deciding whether ministers or labs were competent to speak on the issue. Ms Harms called for a central EU body to be set up, which would issue alerts if necessary.
Meanwhile, British Conservative James Nicholson said the focus should be on developing a long-term system to prevent a similar occurrence rather than on how things should have been done.
Compensation for farmers?

Road haulage: EP introduces "polluter pays" principle
EuroparlTV Revising "Eurovignette" road haulage tax rules will make it possible for Member States to charge hauliers for air and noise pollution costs, in addition to motorway tolls. A directive approved by Parliament on Tuesday will ensure that revenue from these charges is used to improve the performance of transport systems and cut pollution.
In the debate, Said El Khadraoui (S&D, BE), who is steering the legislation through Parliament, said that the compromise reached marks a cornerstone for the next decade of European transport policy as it "offers for the first time the possibility to Member States to charge external costs (...) and to make best use of a wide range of toll variations to improve mobility."
On average, 3 to 4 euro cents per vehicle/km may be added to charges for using transport infrastructure to cover the external costs of road haulage, starting with air and noise pollution. The directive will cover not only trans-European transport (TEN-T) networks, but all motorways, and will apply to vehicles of over 3.5 tonnes. If a Member State wishes to grant exemptions for vehicles of up to 12 tonnes, then it must notify the European Commission of the reasons why..
In exchange, Member States firmly commit themselves to invest 15% of overall revenue in TEN-T networks. The remaining amounts should be used to reduce damage to the environment and develop all transport systems sustainably. To promote transparency and public debate, MEPs inserted into the law a requirement that Member States report regularly to the Commission on the charges imposed and the use made of revenue from them.
Fleet renewal incentives
Lorries with the least-polluting engines will be exempt from air pollution charges until 1 January 2014 (EURO V emission class), and until 1 January 2018 for EURO VI. In sensitive and mountainous regions, the existing "mark-up" of up to 25% may continue to apply and may be added to the external costs charged for lorries in the heaviest pollution classes (EURO 0 to II). It may also be extended to the EURO III class from 1 January 2015.
Avoiding traffic jams
To manage traffic flows more effectively without generating more revenue, charges may be varied by up to 175% in congested areas, with the highest charges applying during five rush hours, and lower rates at all other times. To enable hauliers to calculate their costs and plan routes, the European Commission will make available a list of charges and the times whey they apply throughout the EU.
The new Eurovignette rules, approved with 505 votes in favour, 141 against and 17 abstentions, still need to be formally approved by EU Member States. They may be applied as of three months after their publication in the Official Journal.

MEPs call on Commission to put end to business directory scams
More than 400 complaints to the EP ©BELGA/ILLUSTRA/C.Laurent Has your business suffered from a fraudulent company guide scam, where bogus firms harass businesses about "free" directory listings they never signed up for? Since 2003 the Parliament's Petitions Committee has received more than 400 complaints about "business directory companies" and on Thursday MEPS reiterated their call to the European Commission to put an end to fraudulent practices and protect European businesses.
Thousands of mainly small businesses, NGOs, libraries and even schools have fallen victim to the widespread misleading practices of "business directory companies". After being lured in by a "free" offer and unintentionally signing up to a binding multi-annual contract for a listing in a business directory, they can be charged as much as €1000.
Business directory companies are often established in a different Member State than their victims, making it difficult for them to seek protection or redress from national authorities. The victims are often too small to be able to afford the fees to take legal action against the companies.
In a resolution, MEPs call on the Commission to ensure that Member States are enforcing the 2006 Directive on misleading and comparative advertising and to take action against those that aren't. It also wants the Commission to speed up rules blacklisting misleading practices by business directories.

Bulgaria, Romania ready to join Schengen area, says Parliament
Schengen currently has 25 members ©BELGA/EPA/R.Ghement Parliament on Wednesday gave its green light for Bulgaria and Romania to join the Schengen border check-free area. MEPs say they have met the entry conditions, based on progress reports, but add that Parliament should be kept informed of additional measures taken in the Bulgaria-Turkey-Greece area to cope with a possible surge in migration pressure. Parliament’s opinion will now be sent to EU homes affairs ministers meeting on Thursday in Luxembourg.
After considering progress reports on the two Member States and the findings of expert follow-up teams, MEPs concluded that although some remaining issues will require regular reporting and further attention in the future, they do not constitute an obstacle to full Schengen membership for Bulgaria and Romania.
"We are in a position to welcome Bulgaria and Romania into the Schengen area and I hope that the Council will adopt the same position as soon as they receive our positive opinion. (...) Their citizens should be regarded as fully European citizens, and should not be hostages of populist discourse", said rapporteur Carlos Coelho (EPP, PT).
Bulgaria - Turkey - Greece border area
However, Mr Coelho also stressed the need to acknowledge that illegal migration makes Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece one of the EU's most sensitive external border areas. This means Bulgaria must take some additional measures, including a special action plan, to be implemented when it joins Schengen, and working out a common approach with Greece and Turkey to coping with a possible surge in migration pressure.
MEPs passed an amendment asking that the Member States concerned inform the European Parliament and the Council, in writing and within six months of the entry into force of the integration decision, of any shortcomings in the implementation of these additional measures.
Next steps
Checking that new members have met all Schengen requirements (control of land, sea and air borders, issuing visas, police co-operation, readiness to connect to and use the Schengen Information System and data protection), is a precondition for the Council of Ministers to decide, after consulting the European Parliament, to abolish checks at internal borders with those Member States.
Parliament’s opinion, adopted with 487 votes in favour, 77 against and 29 abstentions, will now be sent to the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 9-10 June, which is to discuss the issue.
"Schengen is one of the biggest achievements of the EU. We must not destroy it with rash decisions. The Schengen system is providing the highest standards of border management. Romania and Bulgaria are meeting these standards today - hence, we must not delay their integration. I call on the Council to follow the recommendations of the vote expressed today by the large majority of the European Parliament", said EP President Jerzy Buzek.
Background
The Schengen area currently has 25 members: 22 EU countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia) and three associated non-EU countries (Norway, Iceland and Switzerland). Liechtenstein should soon become the fourth associated country. Video recording of the press conference Profile of rapporteur Carlos Coelho (EPP, PT)
2014-2020 budget freeze not possible unless agreed policies are slashed
Rapporteur Salvador Garriga Polledo during the debate on a new Multiannual Financial Framework The European Parliament has issued a challenge to the Member States who want to freeze the EU's next long-term budget covering the period 2014-2020. These countries should spell out which priorities they would drop as a consequence of the freeze, say MEPs. If all the objectives and policies agreed for the EU are to be completed, a minimum increase of 5% is needed compared to the 2013 budget, says Parliament.
"We have to put an end to this bad habit of entering into a political commitment without having enough funding to back this... Reducing the EU budget is not a viable option for those of us who believe in a competitive Europe" said Salvador Garriga Polledo (EPP, ES), the MEP responsible for the report on the seven-year budget, known as the multiannual financial framework (MFF) or financial perspective.
"The MFF needs to reflect the EU 2020 strategy and other agreed policies. When we are asking for increases, it is not because we are inventing things. We just want a realistic and implementable budget", added Jutta Haug (S&D, DE), chair of Parliament's Special Committee on Policy Challenges, which had worked for a year to produce the report. The resolution embodying the committee's conclusions was adopted on Wednesday by 468 votes to 134, with 54 abstentions.
Fears for research, infrastructure and other policies
MEPs feel that freezing future budgets at the 2013 level "is not a viable option". An increase of at least 5% over the 2013 level - as they propose - would mean that the EU budget would be roughly 1.11% of the EU's total GNI, compared to the 1.06% expected for 2013.
MEPs urge the Member States who advocate a frozen or reduced long-term budget to state exactly which policy priorities they want to drop in order to make room for a budget cut. Parliament fears that budget restrictions could jeopardise the already agreed boost for research and innovation (from today's 1.9% of GDP to 3%) as well as investment in infrastructure, foreign policy and enlargement.
Regional policy (cohesion and structural funds) and farm spending should remain at current levels, says the resolution. Regarding regions whose GDP per capita stands at between 75% and 90% of EU GDP, MEPs urge the Commission to establish an intermediary category for the next budget period to give these regions a clearer status and more security in their development. Furthermore, investment in energy infrastructure should go up. Savings could possibly be made on EU administration, for instance, if the European Parliament were to have a single seat.
New resources, no more rebates
MEPs criticise the current funding system, which relies almost entirely on national contributions and has become extremely complex. The EU Treaty says that the EU-budget "shall be financed wholly from own resources". The current funding method places disproportionate emphasis on net balances between Member States, contradicts the principle of EU solidarity, dilutes the European common interest and largely ignores the advantages of financing policies at EU level, they argue.
A system of real own resources would be "fairer, more transparent, simpler and equitable", say MEPs, whilst at the same time stressing that budget reform need not affect the size of the budget and would not increase the overall tax burden on citizens. They also call for an end to the "rebates, exceptions and correction mechanisms" that have accumulated within the current system.
Flexibility
One problem with the current MFF is the lack of flexibility it allows within annual budgets. If something new or unexpected comes up, it is hard to adapt the budget to accommodate it. MEPs would therefore like to see a "global MFF margin" to be created, consisting of unused margins, de-committed and unused appropriations from the previous year.
Next steps
Parliament is the first EU institution to set out its position on the next long-term budget. On 29 June, the Commission is to table two proposals, one on the next MFF and the other on own resources. Negotiations will then begin. The current multi-annual financial framework ends in 2013.

MEPs to debate nuclear stress tests
Stress tests to be extended to neighbours? ©BELGA/CTK/L.Pavlicek All 143 nuclear power plants in the EU will be re-assessed from 1 June, as agreed in March by European leaders following the nuclear tragedy in Fukushima, Japan. The test criteria cover potential threats like earthquakes, flood, human error and plane crashes but not terrorist attacks, which will be dealt with separately. Before the European Commission presented the criteria to the plenary Thursday we asked MEPs from across the political spectrum what they expect from the tests.
Will the tests do the job?
MEPs were mixed on the question of whether the tests will be stringent enough . Yes, said Industry Committee Chair Herbert Reul , "they even include plane crashes, while for acts of terrorism a separate working group will be established to discuss safety measures. What matters most now is how the tests will be carried out in practice."
Environment Committee Chair Jo Leinen is positive about the inclusion of natural catastrophes and human error in the stress tests, but "leaving out crucial areas such as terrorist or cyber attacks weakens the value and the significance of the tests considerably." While British Conservative Giles Chichester noted, "the extraordinary conditions experienced in Japan are unlikely to be replicated in Europe for reasons of geography".
Swedish Liberal Lena Ek finds the proposed tests "too weak...the criteria lack clarity on the independence and transparency of tests."
The voluntary nature of the tests is the biggest problem for German Green Rebecca Harms . "It is up to the Member States to decide which nuclear installations to include in the tests or to take part in the tests at all....The stress tests must not turn a blind eye to the serious deficiencies in the ageing EU fleet of nuclear reactors." She also wants storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel to be included in the stress tests.
Some favour closure
The stringency of the criteria should not be the focus, said Greek EFD member Niki Tzavela . "After Fukushima, we all know that nuclear technology is dangerous and unpredictable...we should begin the gradual phasing out of nuclear technology in Europe."
"Only closed nuclear power plants are safe," agreed German GUE/NGL member Sabine Wils .
What happens in the case of failure
The Commission has suggested that if a plant fails the tests it should close, but it will be up to the country to decide. MEPs again had mixed views.
Mr Leinen favours the closure "or at least a retrofit of plants that fail the tests", while Mr Reul thinks "the first option should be upgrading. Only if this is not feasible or economically viable for the company that runs the plant should a permanent closure be foreseen."
Mr Chichester said that it should be up to the responsible nuclear regulatory authority in each Member State to decide the fate of failing plants. Meanwhile, Ms Ek said nuclear stress tests should not be allowed to become "paper tigers" like bank stress tests after the financial crisis.
What about the plants in neighbouring countries?
The Commission is working to extend the stress tests to other countries, in particular Switzerland, Russia, Ukraine and Armenia. Many MEPs agreed it is important that neighbouring countries also reassess their nuclear plants, given that nuclear radiation knows no borders.

Prerequisites for future EU-Russia agreement
MEPs criticise repression of opposition leaders MEPs favour more ambitious trade, visa and cooperation agreements with Russia, but only if it does more to protect basic human rights, e.g. by ending "politically-motivated court decisions" against opposition leaders, removing curbs on press freedom, pulling its troops out of Georgia and allowing gay parades. This was the key message, in a resolution passed on Thursday, to government leaders at the EU-Russia summit in Nizhny Novgorod.
Aware of the two sides' interdependence in economic, energy and political relations, MEPs hope that the summit in Nizhny Novgorod (Western Russia), which started on 9 June, will give fresh impetus to negotiations for a new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Moscow, the recently-agreed roadmap for visa-free travel between the two regions and EU support for Russia's bid to join the World Trade Organization. However, in exchange, Russia must tackle sensitive trade and human rights issues, they add.
Repression of opposition leaders, corruption of judges
MEPs criticise "political interference" in Russia and the "politically-motivated court decision" against Mikhaiel Khordorkovsky. They also urge it to investigate further the incarceration and death of Sergei Magnitsky and other political prisoners.
They also object to frequent restrictions on the freedom of opposition parties to register for the elections, such as the 2011 Duma elections.
Finally the resolution voices concern about the lack of media freedom and of freedom of assembly, as shown by the decision to ban a gay pride march in Moscow for the sixth consecutive year.
Visa policy and conflict with Georgia
The political groups take note of the recently-agreed roadmap for visa-free travel between the EU and Russia, which, they say, must be "based on a step-by-step approach" and bring real practical progress, they say. In any event, EU foreign policy High Representative Catherine Ashton must persuade Russia to cease issuing passports to citizens of the occupied Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Russia is urged to respect its agreement with Georgia and withdraw its troops from the occupied Georgian territories.
Energy: avoiding another Fukushima
"The supply of natural resources should not be used as a political tool", stress MEPs, who urge governments to look for a "balanced trilateral EU-Russia-Ukraine solution on future gas flows to the EU" and make a joint commitment at the summit to run ambitious stress-tests on nuclear power plants so as to avoid situations such as the nuclear melt-down crisis at the Fukushima plant in Japan. An amendment by the Green group calling for the "immediate shutdown of Chernobyl-type nuclear reactors still in use" was rejected (180 votes in favour, 409 against and 25 abstentions).
Accession to WTO
Finally, MEPs hope the summit will help to overcome the remaining obstacles to Russia's joining the World Trade Organisation (WTO), including Moscow's ban on all imports of EU vegetables and its failure so far to rectify "trade irritants, such as the Russia-Kazakhstan-Belarus customs union, which has led to higher consolidated tariffs".
Schengen, Russia, E. Coli, budget in focus during 6-9 June session
Relations with Canada discussed MEPs backed the entry of Romania and Bulgaria into the Schengen area, got tough on the long-term budget, criticised the handling of the E. coli outbreak in Germany, debated the criteria for EU-wide nuclear stress tests and demanded that the EU not conclude trade agreements with third countries that fail to respect human rights and labour standards during the June Strasbourg plenary.
In a debate about the recent outbreak of E. coli in Germany Tuesday morning, MEPs called for better coordination and improved enforcement of rules on food labeling and traceability. After the unjust accusation leveled against Spanish cucumbers and soya beans, members also deplored the harm done to the EU fruit and vegetable industry.
Revising road haulage tax rules, MEPs Tuesday approved charges for air and noise pollution costs in addition to motorway tolls. The new polluter pays rules should mean the revenue raised is used to improve the performance of transport systems.
MEPs voted in favour of full Schengen membership for Bulgaria and Romania Wednesday. "We are in a position to welcome Bulgaria and Romania into the Schengen area...their citizens should be regarded fully as European citizens," rapporteur Carlos Coelho said. Home Affairs Ministers decided Thursday they would consider the countries' accession in September.
MEPs discussed the Commission's criteria for the EU-wide stress tests of nuclear plants Thursday. They stressed the need to close plants that fail to pass the test and called for the tests to be extended to neighbouring countries, particularly Switzerland, Russia, Ukraine and Armenia. Some MEPs said omitting the terrorist strikes from the stress test criteria diminishes their value significantly.
Multiannual Financial Framework The European Parliament rejected proposals by some member states to freeze the EU's long-term budget for 2014-2020. These countries should spell out which priorities they would drop as a consequence of the freeze, they said. "We have to put an end to this bad habit of entering into a political commitment without having enough funding to back it," rapporteur Salvador Garriga said.
The President of Tajikistan , Emomalii Rahmon, was welcomed to plenary Monday by EP President Jerzy Buzek during his official visit to the European Parliament. Later, he met MEPs from the Foreign Affairs Committee and Human Rights Subcommittee.
The failure to comply with basic international social standards constitutes a form of social and environmental dumping detrimental to European companies and workers MEPs said in a resolution on the external dimension of the EU's social policy . They want the EU to refrain from signing trade agreements with countries that do not respect human rights and core labour standards.
While welcoming deepening economic relations between the EU and Canada , MEPs expressed concern about the continued mining of asbestos in Canada and the grave impact on workers' health and warned that the CO2-intensive extraction of oil sands has a negative impact on the global environment and local biodiversity.
The Parliament adopted a report on the mid-term review of the EU's Seventh Framework Programme for research and technology but noted that the evaluation did not give the overall picture of member state and EU action. Plenary in photos on Flickr
