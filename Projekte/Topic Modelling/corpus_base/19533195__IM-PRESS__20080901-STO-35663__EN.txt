MEPs debate judicial cooperation, sharing asylum claims
Judicial cooperation
2008-09-01 - 13:15
Efforts to improve judicial cooperation are at the heart of Monday's debate The extent to which decisions made by judges in one European country should be recognised by authorities in another is one issue that MEPs will debate Monday in Brussels. Also on the agenda is a series of justice and citizenship initiatives such as increasing burden sharing between European countries when it comes to dealing with asylum applications. Also, MEPs will back Madeline McCann-inspired emergency cooperation measures for missing children between EU states.
Different countries have different legal systems and MEPs will debate the possible establishment of common EU rules for the recognition and execution of judicial decisions in one country issued by another in absentia - namely if a person does not appear. Some of the measures under consideration are more information for the defendant, the right to a retrial or appeal and the right to legal representation.
Eurojust should target expolitation of children say MEPs
Eurojust and the European judicial network are two organisations that have been established in the last 10 years to improve cooperation between EU judiciaries. MEPs will be debating ways of improving the workings of these bodies. Data protection - especially regarding countries that are not in the EU is one issue MEPs are concerned about.
In addition MEPs are likely to call on Eurojust to make the fight against the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography one of its priorities.
Asylum seekers - who should process their claims?
Five years ago the EU established the "Dublin" system establishing rules on which states should process asylum requests from non-EU citizens. Being debated is an own initiative report by British Green Jean Lambert, which notes disparities in the way that applications are treated. It wants greater sharing of the asylum burden between European states and for detention to be a last resort.
Finally, the Madeline McCann-inspired declaration on emergency cooperation between countries will be formally adopted by MEPs.
You can follow all of these debates live here from Brussels Monday from 1700 CET.
