Tasty: but how can we be sure they're organic?
With sales of organic goods growing by 30% a year and production expanding dramatically, MEPs have supported the creation of a European "organics logo" which would protect the special nature of organic food. Meeting last week, Parliament's Agriculture committee backed a report calling for a European logo for foods containing 95% organic ingredients. It also calls for organic food to be completely free of GMOs - current rules say that 0.9% of the product can be of GMO origin.
A need to "guarantee certainty for consumers"
The report adopted by MEPs is in response to a proposed regulation on organic production and food labelling that EU Agriculture Ministers are currently considering.
Marie-Hélène Aubert, the French Green MEP who acted as the rapporteur on the issue explained the need for action: "in the context of the ballooning demand for organic food in the EU and the resulting growth in supply, we need to guarantee certainty for consumers about the products they are buying".
The main thrust of her report is the call for a compulsory EU-wide logo for organic food on all products which satisfy the "organic" requirements. The report also calls for GMOs to be prohibited in the production of organic products.
Mrs Aubert would also like clearer labelling and closer inspection to determine the origins of goods so they can identified more accurately. For organic imported into the EU the report calls for an EU Agency or authority to independently certify the products.
The report would also like the proposed regulation legally changed so that the Parliament has a more powerful co-decision role instead of the existing consultative role. This is based on the fact it concerns food products which are sold in the EU's internal market.
What exactly is an organic product?
Organic products are those that are grown without fertilizers and pesticides and with respect to the environment and biodiversity. This involves crop rotation and the rearing of "free-range" livestock which are not force-fed hormones or antibiotics.
As well as the apparent health benefits of more natural food, the organic movement is a reaction against the perceived exploitation and intensity of post-war farming.
Although a booming industry, organic methods of farming occupied just 3.6% of the land in the European Union last year. In addition the practice differs widely in popularity across the continent - being much popular among farmers and consumers in Western Europe than in central and eastern European countries. Aware of the importance of the sector the EU adopted rules on organic farming in 1992 and in 2004 integrated it into the objectives of the reform Common Agricultural Policy.
The full Plenary of the Parliament will consider the Aubert report in March while EU Agriculture Ministers will further consider the regulation in June. As they consider the next steps to take Mrs Aubert reiterated the message of her report by saying "we need labelling rules that ensure the consumer knows both where the product comes from and under which quality standards it has been produced".
