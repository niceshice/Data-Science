Pre-Session Agenda: 11-12 November
Twenty years after the fall of the Iron Curtain: Václav Havel at the EP
Václav Havel will take part in a formal sitting of Parliament to celebrate with MEPs the 20th anniversary of the democratic change in central and eastern Europe. Eighty-nine young people born in November 1989, the month in which the Berlin Wall fell, have also been invited to Brussels to mark the anniversary of a new Europe.
On Wednesday 11 November, Václav Havel, former president of the Czech Republic, and Jerzy Buzek, former prime minister of Poland and today President of the European Parliament, who were both key actors in the political transformation of 20 years ago, will take part in a formal sitting of Parliament in Brussels.
Parliament debates EU summit conclusions on climate change, Lisbon Treaty
MEPs will evaluate the results of the EU summit of 29–30 October, which focused on the Copenhagen climate conference, the Czech request for an opt-out to the Lisbon Treaty and the economic situation. The summit also dealt with illegal immigration, the future European diplomatic service and an integrated strategy for the Baltic Sea region. The Swedish presidency and the Commission will take part in the debate.
Upcoming EU-Russia summit in Stockholm under the spotlight
Climate change and energy security are among the main topics to be discussed at the EU-Russia summit taking place in Stockholm on 18 November. MEPs will hold a debate and vote on a resolution on these and other issues on the summit agenda.
Research on Alzheimer's: pooling resources
Research into neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's needs to be better coordinated across Europe to maximise the benefits of funding and scientific knowledge, MEPs will argue in a debate on Wednesday.
European Ombudsman's work in 2008: transparency the main issue
Parliament will give its annual verdict on the work of the European Ombudsman over the previous year when it votes on a resolution on Thursday. The draft resolution calls for more visibility for the Ombudsman's work and points to the high number of complaints about a lack of transparency within the EU institutions.
Political situation in Honduras ahead of elections
The political situation in Honduras, following the ousting of President Zelaya and ahead of elections in late November, will be the focus of a debate on Wednesday. The Commission will brief MEPs about the latest developments in the country. Following international pressure aimed at ending the crisis, an agreement was reached on 30 October with the de facto government which could lead to the reinstatement of President Manuel Zelaya, although at the time of writing this agreement appears to be in jeopardy.
Focus the EU's crisis aid on people most in need, say MEPs
MEPs are concerned about the impact of the financial crisis on the most vulnerable population groups. In an oral question, they call for the EU to ensure that crisis aid provided to its own Member States is used to strengthen social safety nets in those countries.
Lisbon Treaty: EP's new budget powers should be respected from day one
Parliament's beefed-up powers over the EU budget should apply in full from the day the Lisbon Treaty enters into force, without waiting for detailed implementing legislation, say MEPs. They are calling for transitional rules to ensure Parliament can play its new budgetary role straight away.

Václav Havel tells MEPs Europe is "homeland of our homelands"
Václav Havel: "The fact that I feel myself to be a European doesn’t mean that I stop being a Czech". Former Czech dissident turned President Václav Havel used his speech to the European Parliament on Wednesday (11 November) to lay out his vision of Europe. He said that a dual European and national identity was natural and that the EU must not "retreat in the face of evil" and offer support to victims of tyranny. He also called for Europe to be more than economics and for it to assert "its spiritual foundations and values". He was in Brussels to mark 20 years since the fall of the Iron Curtain.
Introducing Havel, Parliament's Speaker Jerzy Buzek called him "a writer, an intellectual and a wonderful human being - a friend to all those fighting for freedom and human rights".
Mr Buzek said, "let us not forget that Communism was overthrown by ordinary people: writers, workers, academics; millions of people behind the Iron Curtain who never gave in to oppression". He also praised people who had helped from the other side of the Iron Curtain. He said that "Vaclav Havel was, and remains, a hero to them all".
Havel: No-one prepared for Iron Curtain's "rapid collapse"
"No one was completely prepared for such a rapid collapse of the Iron Curtain" as "communism ruled just once in modern times," Mr Havel said. But "the West went about things in the right way." Another approach could have given rise to nationalists and populists, he said. "Many of those who until recently wielded a flag with a hammer and sickle would be capable, without much ado, of reaching for a national flag instead."
Havel called for solidarity with these who are confronted by totalitarian regimes, warning against the temptation to compromise and appease . "One must not retreat in the face of evil…because it is in the nature of evil to take advantage of every concession. Our support can help open-minded people or outspoken witnesses to the situation in North Korea, Burma, Iran, Tibet, Belarus, Cuba or anywhere else, much more than we think."
In this context, Havel commended the European Parliament for awarding the 2009 Sakharov Prize to the Memorial organisation, which fights for press freedom in Russia.
Europe is a "homeland of our homelands"
Europe is the "homeland of our homelands", said Havel, pointing to the wealth of cultural and national diversity in Europe. "What should the relationship be between national and European sovereignty? The answer is obvious: the two should complement each other. After all, the fact that I feel myself to be a European doesn’t mean that I stop being a Czech."
He added, "European integration is truly a unique attempt at the democratic union of states. Hopefully it is an experiment that will prove instructive for others too!"
Building on this, he told MEPs that "cooperation on supranational level should be fostered but must be based on mutual equality and sincerity." A relationship where there are fears that the oil or gas supplies might be disrupted and where we forget about the murdered journalists "is not a relationship of partnership, because it is based on duplicity". He said the EU should clarify where it is geographically and what its external borders are.
Europe's "spiritual foundations and values" stressed
He also touched on the institutional questions. "The European Parliament should have somewhat greater powers than it does at present, since it is the only body elected directly by all Europeans." He also proposed the creation of another body where each State would be equal and would meet only rarely. This could make the composition of Commission and Council easier.
Havel concluded by saying the EU should not only to be dealing with the economy and money but it "place greater and more evident stress on ...its spiritual foundations and values as Europe’s rich spiritual and cultural history – combining elements of Antiquity, Judaism, Christianity, Islam, the Renaissance and the Enlightenment - has created an array of indisputable values".

EU-Russia ties to be strengthened under certain conditions, says Parliament
Ahead of the EU-Russia summit on 18 November MEPs reiterated the importance of human rights during their debates Climate change, energy security and a new general cooperation agreement between the two blocs are among the topics that the Swedish Presidency should discuss with Russia at the upcoming Stockholm summit on 18 November. MEPs are concerned about the human rights situation in Russia (the EP recently awarded its Sakharov Prize to the Russian human rights organisation Memorial), says a resolution adopted by show of hands on Thursday.
Parliament insists that safeguarding of human rights should be a key item on the agenda for the EU-Russia Summit and part of the new EU-Russia agreement.
Parliament's decision to award the 2009 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to the Russian civil rights defence organisation Memorial illustrates MEPs' concerns about the lack of independence of the judiciary, increased state control of the media and the inability of police and judicial authorities to find those responsible for the murders of journalists and human rights defenders.
MEPs condemn the brutal assassination of Maksharip Aushev, a popular human rights activist and an opposition figure, who was shot dead in Ingushetia. The murderers of Natalia Estemirova, Andrei Kulagin, Zarema Sadulayeva, Alik Dzhabrailov, Maksharip Aushev, Stanislav Markelov, Anastasiya Baburova and Anna Politkovskaya must be found and brought to justice, reiterates Parliament.
On climate change, Parliament calls on Russia to reconsider its request for a rising emissions target, in keeping with its large mitigation potential and the IPCC recommendations, with a view to facilitating an agreement in Copenhagen.
PCA and WTO
The conclusion of a new general framework for political and commercial relations (Partnership and Co-operation Agreement) remains of the upmost importance, says the resolution. With this in view, MEPs reiterate their support for Russia to join the WTO. This would help substantially to improve economic relations between the EU and Russia. The current PCA expired end of 2007.
Russia is asked to remove the remaining obstacles to its WTO accession, namely Russian export duties, the level of railway fees for goods in transit through Russia, road charges on goods vehicles and the restrictions on imports of meat, milk and plant products.
Early-warning mechanism on energy security
Parliament highlights the importance of establishing an early-warning mechanism with Russia on energy security covering notification, consultation and implementation. MEPs call on the Presidency and the Commission to work with the Russian authorities, Gazprom, the Ukrainian authorities and Naftohaz Ukrainy to avoid any repetition of the supply shut-offs that have occurred in recent years.
Russia's recent decision to withdraw its signature from the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) complicates relations and raises concerns regarding the ongoing energy dialogue and future developments.
On Georgia and its breakaway regions, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Parliament points out that the European Union Monitoring Mission, which has a country-wide mandate, has so far been denied unhindered access to these regions.
MEPs also ask the Presidency and Russia to address topical international and regional issues such the Iranian nuclear issue, Afghanistan, South Caucasus and the Middle East. The frozen conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh and Transnistria should also be addressed, they say.

Call for joint EU action on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's
Around 7.3 million Europeans suffer from Alzheimer's and related disorders ©Belga/AFP/S Bozon Plans to coordinate research across Europe on neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s received strong backing from the European Parliament in a resolution adopted on Thursday. The aim is to pool skills, knowledge and funding and thus maximise the benefits of work being done in the 27 EU countries.
Around 7.3 million people suffer from Alzheimer's disease and related disorders in Europe, a figure that is expected to double by 2020. No cures are available at the moment and knowledge about prevention and treatment is limited.
Today's resolution urges the EU Member States to develop a common research agenda in the field of neurodegenerative diseases while also improving epidemiological data on Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia.
Large-scale studies with better use of data and methods
Early diagnostic tests, research into risk factors (such as the environment) and criteria for early diagnosis are crucial in the fight against the disease. MEPs want to see transnational cooperation on large-scale epidemiological and clinical studies, as well as a multidisciplinary approach embracing diagnosis, treatment, prevention and social research
Research should also explore the links between the ageing process and dementia and between dementia and depression in the elderly, says the resolution. Research priorities should include prevention, early diagnosis and standard diagnostic tools and the creation of broad-based databases.
Better awareness and less red tape
MEPs urge the Commission to include the problems of dementia in all EU disease prevention measures, while the Member States are encouraged to promote ‘brain-healthy' lifestyles. A European Year of the Brain should be launched to raise awareness of brain-related diseases associated with ageing.
Parliament stresses that the pilot project should avoid creating new administrative structures. It should also collaborate where possible with industry to benefit from all available resources and experience.
New legal basis for future initiatives
Last but not least, MEPs believe that all future initiatives on joint research activities should be adopted under the EU's legal competency for research. This would give Parliament co-decision powers once the Lisbon Treaty enters into force.

MEPs demand more visibility for work of European Ombudsman
European Ombudsman Nikiforos Diamandouros Parliament has given its annual verdict on the work done by the European Ombudsman over the previous year. In a report adopted on Thursday, MEPs call for more visibility for the Ombudsman's activities and point to the high number of complaints about a lack of transparency within the EU institutions.
The role of the European Ombudsman, set up in 1995, is to investigate cases of alleged maladministration by the EU institutions. Of the 296 inquiries opened in 2008 by the Ombudsman, 36% dealt with a lack of transparency, including a refusal to provide information or documents. MEPs are concerned about this, since a transparent administration is crucial to building public trust in the EU.
The report, drafted by Chrysoula Paliadeli (S&D, EL), recognises the Ombudsman's efforts to improve performance of the EU institutions and stresses the need to better explain his activities to the general public. MEPs point out that each EU institution has its own website for complaints and petitions, which can be confusing to the public. They call for a shared site that refers users directly to the institution competent to handle their complaint.
During the debate that preceded the vote, Ms Paliadeli underlined that the Ombudsman "has supported the rule of law with great sensitivity". The rapporteur also called on all EU institutions to "do our work properly", since this is the only way to "bring us closer to the European citizens".
The European Ombudsman's office was set up in 1995. The current holder is Nikiforos Diamandouros, who was initially elected in January 2003 for the remainder of the 1999-2004 legislature following the retirement of the first Ombudsman, Jacob Söderman, and then re-elected in January 2005 for a further five years.
2008: facts and figures
The Ombudsman recorded 3406 complaints in 2008, compared to 3211 in 2007. Of these, 802 were found to fall within the Ombudsman's terms of reference, compared to 870 in 2007.
Most of the inquiries launched by the Ombudsman last year concerned the European Commission (66%). Other targets were the administration of the European Parliament (10%), the European Personnel Selection Office EPSO (7%), the Council (3%) and the European Anti-Fraud Office (2%).
The findings of the 355 completed inquiries show that in 110 cases (31% of the complaints investigated) no maladministration was found.
In 129 cases (36% of the total) completed in 2008, the institution concerned agreed to an amicable solution or settled the matter.
Election of the next Ombudsman
The Ombudsman is elected by the European Parliament by secret ballot at the start of each parliamentary term. The next Ombudsman will be elected in January 2010.
The three candidates for the election are the incumbent Mr Diamandouros (Greece), Vittorio Bottoli (Italy) and Pierre-Yves Monette (Belgium). All of them will outline their priorities at a hearing before the EP Petitions Committee on 30 November.

Results from EU-summit 29-30 October
Swedish PM, Reinfeld is pictured in the plenary during his speech on the outcome of the last European Council (29-30 of October) With the Lisbon Treaty now to come into force, MEPs zeroed in on the question of top EU jobs as they faced Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfelt and Commission President José Manuel Barroso in Parliament's chamber. What kind of Council President, what kind of commissioners, what kind of High Representative do Europe's parliamentarians want?
New EU-top jobs and new Commission
Swedish Prime minster Fredrik Reinfeldt announced that the Swedish presidency will hold a meeting of Heads of states and governments on 19 November to fill the positions created by the Lisbon Treaty. In the meeting they will "nominate the President of the European council, the High Representative and the Secretary General of the Council". Fredrik Reinfeldt expressed that he doesn’t wish to speculate over the people who will fill the posts.
President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso: "I want a new Commission composed of competent and committed Europeans. I also want a Commission with a strong democratic mandate. The Treaty gives the capacity to act, but we need to have the willingness to act together."
The leader of the EPP Joseph Daul told to Mr Barroso that "…once the member states have designated their candidates [for commissioners posts] you should move as quickly as possible to establish their portfolios, so that they can be heard by the EP in hearings that we want to be as in depth as possible.
Socialist MEP Hannes Swoboda asked Mr Reinfeldt "are you ready to talk to the heads of state to ensure that we have a gender and a geographical balance [in the Commission] and are you prepared to ensure that there are powerful ladies involved?"
Liberal Leader Guy Verhofstadt underlined that the position as President of council should be filled by "Somebody, who believes in EU integration and not eurosceptic, and believes in community method that takes Europe forward."
German Green MEP Rebecca Harms: "We need to agree that we want strong men and women in the top positions of the EU. Mr Reinfeldt, unfortunately I'm not able to congratulate you because there is as yet no sign of any strong men and women coming forward."
Timothy Kirkhope for the ECR group commented : "The discussion is degenerating into a shabby debate between government leaders who appear to be only interesting in sharing out jobs amongst themselves...Some are even trying to divide the European Union into 2 classes of citizens, by saying that only individuals coming from States in the Schengen area and the Eurozone should be eligible.
German MEP Lothar Bisky (GUE/NGL): "It would be a good idea if the head of states and governments were to use the summit for more practical and concrete politics. The biggest challenge the world has to face is climate change. We're heading towards the world climate conference in Copenhagen and I'm afraid the EU is not taking up the leading role that it said it would."
William Dartmouth, (EFD): Commenting on the new post of the High Representative, he said, "the problem facing Europe is not too few diplomatic missions but too many unemployed."

They called for human rights to be on the agenda of the EU-Russia summit on 17-18 November in Stockholm.
