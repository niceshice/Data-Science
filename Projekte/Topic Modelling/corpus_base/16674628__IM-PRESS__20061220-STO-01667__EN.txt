As 2006 draws to a close, we would like to take this opportunity to highlight some articles that we think are worth reading again. Take a look at some of this year's biggest projects and the emotions surrounding them and refresh your memory about how the Parliament works.
During 2006 MEPs worked on some important legislation with far-reaching consequences. Among the biggest projects finalised this year were the REACH chemicals regulation, aimed at improving the protection of human health and the environment, the 7th framework research programme and the Services Directive which will make the free movement of services a reality.
Some of the subjects debated by Parliament raised strong public emotions. Earlier this year there were violent confrontations in Strasbourg as MEPs debated the Port Services Directive which planned the liberalisation of the port sector. The legislation has been dropped, at least for now.
Inside the chamber, we featured several articles about how MEPs work, how they vote and how you can watch all of this live.
"Better regulation" a key theme
Do you think there are too many, over-complex and unnecessarily interfering EU rules and laws? Parliament adopted several reports and a resolution in favour of the European Commission's "better regulation" initiative that aims to simplify, codify (merge several laws into one) and modify existing laws and reduce the administrative burden on companies by 25% within six years.
Politics wasn't the only thing on the European menu this year. In July Germany hosted the football World Cup. Before the tournament we asked MEPs if they thought politics and football had anything in common. Judging by the very different answers, we concluded they are both somewhat controversial subjects!
One of the main priorities of the Parliament is the promotion of human rights and democracy in the world. This year we published several articles about the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought and the Parliament's continued support for free and fair elections around the world. It does this by sending election observers and supporting EU troops in their missions abroad.
Resolutions for the next year? The priorities of the EU are reflected in its budget. The work on the budget lasts almost a whole year. Read our focus on budget to understand how the whole process works and what priorities are in place for the next year.
We hope you enjoyed reading about the Parliament and look forward to welcoming you back to the website in 2007.
