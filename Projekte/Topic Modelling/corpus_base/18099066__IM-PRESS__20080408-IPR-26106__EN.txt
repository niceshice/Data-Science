Parliament adopted a report on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movements of pet animals as regards the extension of the transitional period. It extends the transitional period to 30 June 2010 (rather than 31 August 2009) for the entry of the pet animals listed into the territory of Ireland, Malta, Sweden and the United Kingdom, which will thereafter be subject to certain requirements.
The Regulation introduced, inter alia, the pet passport for cats, dogs and ferrets when being moved from one Member State to another, which provides proof that the animal has been vaccinated against rabies. This is the sole requirement for pets to travel to all Member States.
Until 30 June 2010, Finland, Ireland, Malta, Sweden and the United Kingdom, as regards echinococcosis, and Ireland Malta and the United Kingdom, as regards ticks, may make the entry of pet animals into their territory subject to compliance with the special rules in place on the date on which this Regulation comes into force. This amendment aims at completing the list of countries applying already special requirements concerning ticks with Malta. By mistake in the Commission proposal the name of Malta had not been mentioned amongst those Member States having already a special regime in place regarding anti-tick treatment.
The House states that the proposed extension of the transitional period may not be sufficiently long to obtain agreement on a successor regime and a longer one is more appropriate given there is still no proposal on the table and the European Parliament will be dissolved for elections in 2009.
The third amendment replaces the date 1 January 2008 by the date 1 July 2010 for the same reason.
