Profile - José Manuel Barroso José Manuel Barroso won the European Parliament's approval for his second term as European Commission President on 16 September, after a debate and a vote. MEPs approved the five-year term by 382 votes in favour and 219 against.
After Mr Barroso's re-election, EP President Jerzy Buzek said: "this is the right result for Europe". He added, "we are no longer in a political vacuum and President Barroso can start to build on his detailed programme and construct his team of Commissioners. The European Parliament has shown that it has teeth."
"A more transparent...way of financing policies"
The day before the vote, Mr Barroso explained his programme, which focuses on economic recovery combined with a social market. "I am committed to fighting social dumping," he said, announcing a revision of the working time directive.
He also promised measures to eliminate the gender pay gap. On the EU budget, Mr Barroso proposed to "move towards an approach based on solidarity". He stressed "the EU must have a more transparent and efficient way of financing its policies".
"My party: Europe"
Mr Barroso's candidacy was backed by parliament's centre-right European People's Party, but opposed by the socialists and some other groups and he stressed his desire to reach out and build consensus among the parties of the pro-European mainstream. "I am committed to having Europe’s political diversity reflected in the College and in the most important positions."
He promised changes in the Commission structure, with the appointment of commissioners for justice, fundamental rights and civil liberties, internal affairs and migration and for climate action, as well as "a scientific adviser for research and innovation". "As President of the Commission, my party is Europe," Barroso told MEPs.
What's next?
MEPs will evaluate the other members of the Commission, who will be proposed by EU countries by common accord with Mr Barroso. The candidates will be evaluated on the basis of their general abilities and readiness to assume European office, as well as their independence and knowledge of their intended portfolio.
After all the hearings, Parliament will vote on the appointment of the whole Commission.
