A half a century of political debate was celebrated on Wednesday when the European Parliament marked its 50th anniversary. It brought together EU leaders, MEPs, former Presidents of the Parliament and MPs from around Europe to mark the occasion. Visitors groups to Strasbourg and the European Youth Orchestra also took part as the latter brought classical music to the Chamber with a performance conducted by Pawel Kotla.
In a keynote speech to mark the occasion, Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering said, "today, we are 785 Members from 27 European nations, we represent seven political groups and more than 150 national political parties". Describing the powers of the institution he said, "we are both a legislative and a budgetary authority, on an equal footing with the Council of Ministers. We exercise oversight over the European Commission and elect its President".
Regarding the mandate of the Parliament Mr Pöttering said that "we are the representatives of close to 500 million Union citizens - we reflect all political tendencies in the European Union".
School children, visitors take part in celebrations
A group of school children from Karlsruhe in Germany were welcomed to the Parliament by President Pöttering. They sang "happy birthday" in several languages and brought with them a painting showing their view of the parliament as a "House of many colours".
During the day the President also met several visitors groups and asked for their impressions of the days events.

What does Parliament's 50th anniversary mean to you?
Joseph Daul is Chairman of the Centre right EPP-ED group. He told us that that "the first things it signifies, after meeting our Belarusian friends, is liberty, democracy and defence of values, but above all 60 years of peace".
Spanish Socialist Enrique Barón Crespo (EP President 1989‑1992) said, "it means it is a great birthday as we are already a major institution and the first democratic union of states and citizens in the world".
Former EP President Nicole Fontaine (1999-2002) called it "an important event for citizens as the Parliament has progressively taken up a role which listens to citizens and integrates their concerns into the Community's decisions".
How has it changed since your term as President?
Egon Klepsch (1992-1994): "The direction is perhaps towards more legislative power and to have more influence in deciding about the future of the community".
Emilio Colombo (1977-79): "I was president for 3 years before the first direct elections. That period was very important for European development as it was the time citizens entered into the European mechanism".
Enrique Barón Crespo: "I lived with the Parliament's metamorphosis, when I arrived it did not have legislative powers, and when I left after the Maastricht Summit we had legislative powers, a right to elect the President of the Commission and European citizenship."
If you could change one thing over the last 50 years, what would it be?
Former EP President (1997-1999) José Maria Gil-Robles: "The only thing that I would like to change is to have a better communication with people so that we can have a better election turnout."
What would you like the Parliament to tackle in the next 50 years?
Emilio Colombo: "we have made progress, but not sufficient to make Europe a global actor and power on the international scene."
Joseph Daul: "For the new generations here in Europe I hope that Europe helps to work for a world that is very open, and that globalisation does not destroy our values and our European Social model."
Enrique Barón Crespo : "I wish for a stronger and united Union that can help create a globalised democracy in the world."
What is your message to people on Parliament's 50th anniversary?
Former EP President Lord Henry Plumb (1987 -1989): "I am old enough to have lived through the last war and my attitude at that time was: it is time we stopped fighting each other, we lived in peace and not only that, the only way to move forward is to try to get along. And I think what has developed is nothing short of a miracle."
Nicole Fontaine told us, "I would cite three important examples where the Parliament has proved its maturity, the Services Directive, the Directive on roaming and the legislation on REACH".
Chairman of the Socialist group Martin Schulz said, "after the new Lisbon Treaty is in place...the Parliament will have new powers in the institutional, budgetary and political domain. Therefore, it is very important for citizens to participate in the 2009 elections."
