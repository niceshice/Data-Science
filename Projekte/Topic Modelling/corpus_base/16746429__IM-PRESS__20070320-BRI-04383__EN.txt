Briefing - 28-29 March 2007 - Brussels
2007-03-22 - 18:30
The March plenary session takes place just three days after the signing of the Berlin Declaration to mark the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome. German Chancellor and President of the European Council Angela MERKEL will present the declaration to MEPs, Commission President José Manuel BARROSO will also take part in the debate.
Following this set-piece debate, MEPs turn their attention to convergence in supervisory practices with oral questions to the Council and the Commission.
The House will then debate the future of Kosovo and the role of the EU. A report being put forward by the Foreign Affairs Committee gives its full support to the Ahtisaari proposal for a status settlement, while avoiding any explicit mention of Kosovo's independence. The report also reaffirms the European perspective of both Serbia and Kosovo, and called for the EU to play a central role in the current international negotiations for a settlement.
Later on Wednesday, the Parliament debates organic production and labelling of organic products . Stricter standards for the use of plant-health and veterinary products, stronger guarantees against contamination by genetically modified organisms (GMOs), reliable labelling and tougher inspections, including those on imports, are among the priorities of the report.
MEPs will also turn their attention to the EU's financial resources , including the UK rebate. The report proposes a reform of the own-resources system which would, above all, emphasise equality between Member States. There would be a second stage, starting in 2014, based on a yet-to-be-determined system of levies, although this would not be a real "European tax".
Football features highly on the plenary agenda with two reports . The first report says that professional football in the EU needs better governing rules in many areas, from managing clubs' finances to recruiting young talent, says a report by EP Committee on Culture and Education. The socio-economic challenges facing soccer are too great for the football governing bodies to tackle alone, and the European Commission should propose solutions, it adds. The second report concerns amendments to the original decision by the Council in 2002 which called for the establishment of national football information points in each Member State, "responsible for co-ordinating and facilitating police information exchange", in connection with international football matches.
The Transport Committee is tabling two reports designed to raise standards of maritime safety . The first looks at the duties of "flag states" (the state where a ship is registered), the second at the question of civil liability. These reports are part of a group of seven reports known as the "third maritime safety package". The other five will come before Parliament's plenary in April.
Thursday 29 March
On Thursday, the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier SOLANA presents prospects for the EU's Common Foreign Policy in 2007 . The issue of the possible installation of a US missile system in the Czech Republic and Poland will feature prominently in the speech and debate that follows.

Follow-up to Berlin Declaration
2007-03-22 - 18:30
On Wednesday 28 March, Parliament will hold a plenary debate to discuss the Berlin Declaration unveiled three days previously to mark the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, by which the European Community was brought into being. The purpose of the declaration of 25 March, signed by the presidents of the Council, Commission and Parliament, is to review the history and achievements of the EU, issue a reminder of the Union's underlying values and highlight the fresh challenges it faces, which include energy supply and climate change, growth and the European social model, and the treaty changes needed to enable the enlarged EU to function effectively.
German Chancellor Angela MERKEL will represent the Council in the debate, while the Commission will be represented by its president, José Manuel BARROSO .
Parliament's plenary discussed this subject on 14 March, before the text of the declaration was finalised. In that debate Parliament's President Pöttering told the House "the achievements of the last 50 years have been extraordinary. Fifty years on, however, Europe needs a fresh start. Together we need to muster the courage and the will to meet the challenges of the 21st century". Council and Commission statements - follow-up to the Berlin Declaration

The outlook for the EU's foreign policy
2007-03-22 - 18:30
In a priority debate with Javier Solana, High Representative for the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), MEPs will have the opportunity to discuss the prospects for the CFSP in 2007. Among other topics, Mr Solana will speak about the planned extension of the US missile defence shield to bases in Poland and in the Czech Republic, where there has been opposition to the plans. On 27 March, just two days before the plenary debate, the EP Foreign Affairs Committee is due to adopt a report on the CFSP drafted by Elmar BROK (EPP-ED, DE).

Foreign Affairs Committee backs Ahtisaari's Kosovo proposal, but does not call for independence
2007-03-22 - 18:30
A report being put forward by the Foreign Affairs Committee gives its full support to the Ahtisaari proposal for a status settlement, while avoiding any explicit mention of Kosovo's independence. The report also reaffirms the European perspective of both Serbia and Kosovo, and called for the EU to play a central role in the current international negotiations for a settlement. The Foreign Affairs Committee lends its full support to the UN-led drive to determine the final status of Kosovo, and to the Ahtisaari Proposal in particular. Martti Ahtisaari, former Finnish President, was the UN Special Envoy charged with devising a plan for the status settlement of Kosovo. His proposal, released early last month, would give Kosovo some of the trappings of sovereignty, such as rights to membership in international organisations, but does not advocate outright independence. The own-initiative report by Joost LAGENDIJK (Greens/EFA, NL) spells out several desirable aspects of a settlement:
-access to international financial organisations
-an international presence in Kosovo, with a clear definition of its role and mandate
-clear provisions on decentralisation which grant substantial autonomy in key areas
-full respect for human rights
-retention of Kosovo's multi-ethnic character, with protection for cultural and religious sites
-the establishment of a limited, internal, multi-ethnic Kosovar Security Force
-international guarantees for the territorial integrity of all neighbouring states
Alternative wording that would have made explicit reference to Kosovo's "sovereignty" was narrowly rejected by the Committee.
International implications
Addressing fears, especially in Russia, that granting Kosovo any form of independence would exacerbate other separatist tensions around the globe, the report "underlines that the solution in Kosovo will set no precedent in international law, as Kosovo has been under UN rule since 1999 [...and] is in no way comparable to the situation in other conflict regions which are not under UN administration."
In addition, the committee is of the view that "in the long run, the solution regarding the future status of Kosovo lies also in the fact that both Serbia and Kosovo are due to become part of the EU, together with their neighbours, since the future of the Western Balkans lies in the European Union."
The EU's role
The report emphasises that the EU Member States should speak with one voice on the Kosovo issue, by adopting a common position in Council, and maintaining it in international fora, especially the UN Security Council. (Par. 10) The committee also argued that "the European Union should have a decisive say on the final terms of the settlement." (Par. 9) Finally, the report states that "the EP is prepared to make available the additional resources required in order to finance the future EU involvement in Kosovo with a view to implementing the status settlement."

Professional football needs better governing rules / Improved information exchange for greater security at football matches
2007-03-22 - 18:30
Professional football in the EU needs better governing rules in many areas, from managing clubs' finances to recruiting young talent, says a report by EP Committee on Culture and Education. The socio-economic challenges facing soccer are too great for the football governing bodies to tackle alone, and the European Commission should propose solutions, it adds. The key challenge is getting the rules clear, said the Culture Committee, in an own-initiative report on the future of professional football, drafted by Ivo BELET (EPP-ED, BE). Uncertainties stemming from a complicated legal environment that combines European and national laws with the rules of sports governing bodies have been accentuated by football's growing professionalisation and commercialisation over the past two decades.
Supporting football's governing bodies
The report's primary aim is therefore to support sports governing bodies - especially UEFA - in their efforts to improve self-regulation, for the benefit of the entire football sector. Football rules and procedures need to be guided by good governance principles such as transparency, representativeness and accountability, and measures taken should be proportional to the aim they are meant to achieve, says the committee.
Football results, unlike rules, need to be less certain. The widening gap between top-end and smaller clubs has increasingly concentrated sporting success amongst a small number of clubs, and this threatens to erode the competitive balance and uncertainty of results which is the essence of an exciting sport, notes the committee.
The report looks at governance in sport, employment rules, the economic importance of media rights, support for local young talents and hence the social and cultural role of football and football clubs. It highlights the need for action to combat crime, corruption, violence, racism and doping.
Recommendations
The Belet report calls on the European Commission to draw up an "action plan" for European sport in general and football in particular. It notes that although the EU has no specific legislative powers in this area, the EU treaties do contain a wide array of instruments that could serve such a plan, and says the Commission should specify the conditions under which legitimate and adequate self-regulation is supported. There was a strong support for Europe's "pyramid" model of football, which links all levels of professional and amateur sport through the principles of relegation and promotion and financial solidarity.
Committee members backed the UEFA club licensing system, which aims to ensure a level playing field for clubs and contribute to their financial stability. MEPs in the committee call on UEFA to further develop this system in order to guarantee financial transparency and proper management, and also recommended creating an independent supervisory body with the main purpose of monitoring the financial and commercial activities of European clubs.
Members also backed measures to promote young local talent, such as the UEFA "home-grown players" rule.
With regard to clubs which were giving contracts to children below 16 years of age, the Committee insisted that immigration law must always be respected in relation to the recruitment of young foreign talent.
Young players must be given the opportunity for a general education and vocational training, in parallel with their club and training activity, so that they do not entirely depend on the clubs.
Action is also needed to prevent the social exclusion of young people who were ultimately not given contracts by clubs.
With regard to racism, the Commission, the Member States and all those involved in professional football were asked to step up the fight against racism and xenophobia, inside and outside stadiums. UEFA and national football associations and leagues should apply disciplinary rules in a firm and co-ordinated matter, without neglecting the financial situations of clubs, say MEPs in the committee.
EP Committee calls for improved information exchange for greater security at football matches
Security at increasingly popular international football matches needs to be improved in an effort to halt the increasing number of violent incidents, many of which often involve explicit acts of xenophobia and racism. Parliament will debate several amendments, being put forward by the Civil Liberties Committee, to a Council decision taken on 25 April 2002, including those proposed by the Republic of Austria, due to jointly host with Switzerland the UEFA European Championship in 2008. The original decision by the Council in 2002 called for the establishment of national football information points in each Member State, "responsible for co-ordinating and facilitating police information exchange", in connection with international football matches.
Increasing police efficiency - proposed amendments by Austria
The establishment of national football information points, as outlined by the Council in 2002, will help national police forces prepare in advance for football matches, and will "ensure that all the police services concerned receive the necessary information in time." The national football information points, according to the 2002 decision, "shall communicate, before, during and after the competition or match, with the national police force(s) involved."
The Austrian resolution calls for greater efficiency through the production and circulation of "regular generic and/or thematic national football disorder assessments."
Exchange of personal information - proposed amendments by the civil liberties committee
Personal information about particular supporters who pose a risk or high risk to the security of the match will be exchanged "in accordance with the domestic and international rules applicable", among the national football information points and the police, "in such a way as to preserve the confidentiality of data", as proposed by the Council's decision in 2002.
The committee's resolution adds a further condition to limit the range of personal information exchanged, stating that "such data shall be handled exclusively in connection with football matches and may not be used for any other activities."
The need to improve security
Football has evolved into a major international entertainment and sporting business, producing an increasingly competitive atmosphere amongst supporters which, while making a positive contribution to the atmosphere of a match, unfortunately can, however, involve violent clashes between rival fans or clashes with the police, often resulting in a large number of injuries. Access to relevant information will help strengthen national police forces, particularly riot police, now the most common method of increasing security at international football matches.

Agriculture
New Member States struggling to reap full benefit of CAP
2007-03-22 - 18:30
The Agriculture Committee will ask the House to approve a report calling on the European Commission to take more account of the needs of the new Member States in its decisions on the Common Agriculture Policy. The low level of direct aid received by these countries is creating unequal conditions of competition, according to MEPs. In an own-initiative report by Csaba Sándor Tabajdi (EPP-ED, HU), the Agriculture Committee describes the challenges faced by the new Member States in living with the CAP. These include major efforts to comply with Community health and hygiene rules, higher production costs and difficulties in implementing rural development programmes.
The Agriculture Committee also argues that the long phasing-in period (9 years), with a low starting level (25 %) for the direct payments in the new Member States, means that farmers in these states are not competing on a level playing field with other European farmers on the European internal market and even their domestic markets.
These countries have also been obliged to top up EU farm support from their national budgets. This virtually amounts to "renationalisation" of a Community policy and, by imposing a burden on national finances, has caused political and economic difficulties in some new Member States.
The countries which joined the EU in 2004 have thus benefited from enlargement "only partly" in the areas of farming and food production. The committee, therefore, calls on the Commission to take account of their situation in its application of the CAP, for example, by extending certain derogations regarding EU environmental standards which were laid down in the accession treaties.

Agriculture
Developing organic products without undermining consumer trust
2007-03-22 - 18:30
Preserving consumer confidence is the key aim of a report on plans to recast EU rules governing organic products, which is being put forward by the EP Agriculture Committee. Stricter standards for the use of plant-health and veterinary products, stronger guarantees against contamination by genetically modified organisms (GMOs), reliable labelling and tougher inspections, including those on imports, are among the priorities of MEPs in the committee. The consultation report by Marie-Hélène AUBERT (Greens/EFA, FR) was approved - in heavily amended form - by 34 votes to 2, with 1 abstention. However, the vote was close on many parts of the text, so further changes may be made at the plenary vote.
Preventing contamination by GMOs
According to the European Commission, foodstuffs could not legally be sold as "organic" if they contain GMOs, unless they are contaminated accidentally and even then only up to the current Community threshold of 0.9% of GMOs allowed for conventional food.
Among their amendments (which are not binding on the Council), MEPs wish to spell out more clearly that GMOs are banned in organic products, that no "products produced from or with GMOs" may be used in organic production, and that there are no exceptions to this, even for veterinary medicines.
Members of the Agriculture Committee also want to tighten up the regulation's wording so that operators throughout the food production chain (farmers, suppliers, manufacturers of animal feed, processors) "must" ensure that their products do not contain GMOs and, "in the case of an adventitious or technically unavoidable contamination with GMO", they must be able to "supply evidence that they have taken all necessary steps" to avoid such contamination. However, an amendment referring to a threshold for such contamination was not adopted.
Stricter standards and limited derogations
Members also adopted amendments laying down stricter rules for the use of plant-health products and veterinary treatments as well as national derogations thereto.
Logos and labelling particulars
The Agriculture Committee believes the European logo (to be used for food where 95% of the ingredients are organic) and the term "ORGANIC" should be compulsory on such products but that the logos of private certification bodies better known to consumers should be allowed as well. The use of the Community logo would not be permitted for processed products or those from farms in the process of conversion to organic production.
Tightening up controls, including those on imports
The Agriculture Committee stresses that national control bodies should be accredited in line with European standards. In addition, Member States must ensure that their inspection systems enable products to be traced through all stages of production, preparation and distribution, to guarantee consumers that organic products have been produced in line with the new rules. An up-to-date list of control authorities and approved control bodies must be made available to interested parties.
Moreover, operators from non-EU countries must be in a position to provide importers or national authorities with documentary evidence issued by a competent Community control body.
Regulation to apply also to catering industry
The Agriculture Committee argues that the regulation should cover the catering industry (take-aways, canteens, restaurants and similar service providers) as well as products such as wool, food supplements and essential oils.
And, more generally, apart from the production, processing, packaging and labelling of products, the new rules should also cover "conditioning", manufacture and storage, say MEPs.
Lastly, the committee says the regulation should be adopted under the co-decision procedure between Parliament and the Council, since it covers the production and distribution of processed food in the single market, which comes under this procedure, and not only agricultural produce, which comes under the consultation procedure.
The new regulation will take effect on 1 January 2009. Rapporteur Marie-Hélène AUBERT Greens/EFA FR A6-0061/2007 Organic production and labelling of organic products Procedure : Consultation

Transport
Call for tougher rules to improve safety at sea
2007-03-22 - 18:30
The Transport Committee is tabling two reports designed to raise standards of maritime safety. The first looks at the duties of "flag states" (the state where a ship is registered), the second at the question of civil liability. These reports are part of a group of seven reports known as the "third maritime safety package". The other five will come before Parliament's plenary in April. Maritime accident numbers may be falling, but the threats stemming from failure to comply with safety standards remain. Even though, in the wake of the Erika and Prestige oil-spill accidents, the EU introduced legislation to improve maritime safety, further measures are needed to prevent accidents and pollution and to deal with the aftermath of accidents. The recent accidents off the UK coast and in the Messina straits further underline the need for more robust safety rules.
Boosting the effectiveness of existing safety measures is the key aim of the European Commission's "third maritime safety package", upon which the committee approved its seven reports - all almost unanimously - on 27 February.
Flag state obligations - Rapporteur Marta Vincenzi (PES, IT)
This report is one of the key elements in the package. The Commission is proposing that the various International Maritime Organisation conventions on flag state obligations should be turned into binding legislation and the EU Member States must be required to monitor compliance with international standards by ships that fly their flags. The requisite standards are laid down in the SOLAS and the MARPOL conventions. The Commission sees the introduction of such obligations on the flag States as the "missing link" in existing Community legislation. The longer term aim is to turn the European fleet into a high-quality fleet, making the Member States flags more attractive.
However, this directive is strongly opposed by the Council, with some Member States believing the Community is not competent to take action in this field, and many arguing that these matters should be left to national law, that unnecessary extra legislation should be avoided or that the extra costs will result.
The Transport Committee urges broad support for the Commission proposal. A committee amendment would make it a requirement, for the first registration of a ship in a Member State, that this Member State should ensure that the ship complies with the relevant international rules. The committee also favours making the International Maritime Organisation's flag state obligations more acceptable to EU Member States. For example, surveyors and investigators should be well trained, and have appropriate inspection means and methods.
Civil liability - Rapporteur Gilles Savary (PES, FR)
At present, for most damage caused by ships to third parties, civil liability regimes for shipowners in Europe are not harmonised and no compulsory insurance scheme exists. This draft directive seeks to put in place "core" rules, common to all Member States, governing civil liability, insurance for ship-owners and the liability of any person responsible for operating a ship. It would do this by incorporating the International Maritime Organisation Convention on the Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims (LLMC) into EU law.
The Transport Committee supports the Commission proposal but believes the most serious damage suffered by third parties will not be adequately covered by the liability ceilings under the LLMC Convention and that the proposal fails to adequately address the most serious and negligent behaviour on the part of maritime transport operators. It therefore puts forward a number of amendments to tighten up the text.
Previous EU maritime safety legislation
Under the previous two maritime safety packages (known as ‘Erika I’ and ‘Erika II’), the European Union adopted a range of legislation on maritime security and safety, including inspections of ships in port and a ban on using single-hull vessels to transport oil, and the creation of a European Maritime Safety Agency.

Economic and monetary affairs
Financial services: improving supervision systems for crisis management
2007-03-22 - 18:30
The Chair of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, Pervenche Berès (PES, FR), will put oral questions to the Commission and Council on financial crisis management on Wednesday evening The questions read as follows :
“During the ECOFIN Council held in Helsinki in September, the Economic and Financial Committee (EFC) reported back on the results of the simulated crisis management exercise which took place in April, on the basis of a memorandum of understanding adopted in May 2005. The outcome of this exercise has clearly indicated that better coordination is needed between the relevant supervisory institutions involved in order to guarantee proper management and hence financial stability. Another exercise of the same kind is already scheduled for 2009 but in the meantime, the EFC is required to draft a report by autumn 2007 about the question of sharing responsibilities between the authorities and the countries concerned. The European Parliament welcomes these initiatives and approves the overall approach.
In the context of the current dynamic changes in the market and in particular the increase of alternative investment vehicles, the stakeholders are loudly calling for stronger measures. The European Parliament is also very concerned about this urgent question and has always been calling for an increased convergence of national supervisory practices, for example in the Muscat report adopted in July 2006 where it proposed to set up a committee of wise persons, to start a reflection on the implications of the consolidation of markets and financial institutions, prudential supervision, financial stability and crisis management.
What is the Commission intending to undertake in this area in order to respond to the needs identified in the crisis-management exercise and to shape the future of European financial supervision? Is the Commission ready to respond to the appeals of the stakeholders and invite the EP and Council to discuss together further steps?
What does the Presidency see as appropriate steps to be undertaken and how would the EP and the Commission be involved?”
MEPs will debate the issue once they have heard the responses from Commission and Council. They will then vote on a resolution on the subject on Thursday. Pervenche BERÈS PES FR Oral questions -Further convergence in supervisory practices at EU level

Budget
A new own-resources system by 2014
2007-03-22 - 18:30
The Budgets Committee is proposing a reform of the own-resources system which would above all emphasise equality between Member States. There would be a second stage, starting in 2014, based on a yet-to-be-determined system of levies, although this would not be a real "European tax". With the European Commission due to publish its initial proposals for the revision of the budget in a few months' time, MEPs express their views on the "revenue" side of the Community's finances in an own-initiative report drafted by Alain LAMASSOURE (EPP-ED, FR). The budget review, scheduled for 2008-09, will deal with both revenue and expenditure. MEPs in the committee believe the current system is complex, utterly incomprehensible to the public and not transparent - hence the need for reform.
Stage one: equality, simplicity and solidarity
In the first, transitional, stage the system would be based on the GNI resource, as proposed by Finland in 2004. This resource is less visible to the general public but is more equitable in relating contributions to the general level of prosperity. The British rebate would be abolished by 2013. Through the abolition of the VAT resource, the United Kingdom would "benefit" from the loss of its rebate. As to the Common Agricultural Policy, the committee proposes introducing compulsory co-financing (by the Member States at national level) of agricultural spending in the EU-15.
MEPs are aware that such an outcome is likely to be acceptable only as part of a global negotiation process which also covers expenditure.
A number of principles would underpin the system in this initial stage. The first of these, "equality between Member States", should ensure that no Member State enjoys any budgetary privileges. Another principle - "solidarity and equal dignity" - would ensure that bargaining and privileges are eliminated.
This initial stage could enter into force as soon as an agreement is ratified, guaranteeing the transitional nature of the system, which would remain in force until a genuine own resource is created.
Stage two: a genuine own resource for the European Union
The new system will, under no circumstances, grant the European Union the right to levy taxes. Fiscal sovereignty will remain with the Member States who might, however, authorise the Union for a limited period (to be revoked at any time), to benefit directly from a certain share of a tax, as happens with regional or local authorities in most Member States.
The new system "must not increase overall public expenditure nor the tax burden for the citizens". If it directly allocates part of a tax to the European Union, "an equivalent reduction would have to be made elsewhere".
MEPs in the committee are calling for the new system to be introduced from 2014, with a "transition period" to guarantee "a smooth phasing-out of the old financing system".
Here too a number of principles would underlie the new own resource, the declared aim being "to revive the letter and spirit of the founding treaties". These principles would be: full respect for the fiscal sovereignty of the Member States, fiscal neutrality, no changes to the order of magnitude of the EU budget etc.
British rebate
The committee stresses that the current system, with its four different resources and its several different rebate mechanisms, be they general ones in favour of one Member State such as the British rebate, or special ones such as rebates in financing other rebates, is excessively complex, lacks transparency and is completely incomprehensible to European citizens; underlines that it does nothing towards fulfilling the requirement of establishing a direct link between the Union and its citizens. The Budgets committee deplores the fact that the 2005 Brussels European Council, instead of creating a simpler and more transparent system, made it even more complicated and obscure by leaving the UK correction, the "British rebate", in principle intact and adding further derogations and corrections benefiting other Member States.
No EU tax
The report states that the time for a genuine new European tax may not yet have come, although the Member States could decide to grant the EU such a tax in future.
However, the new own resources system should be based on a tax already in existence in the Member States, the idea being that a certain percentage of an existing tax would be fed directly into the EU budget as a genuine own resource, thus establishing a direct link between the Union and the European taxpayer.
Among the taxes envisaged for this purpose are:
- VAT
- excise duties on motor fuel for road transport
- excise duties on tobacco and alcohol
- taxes on corporate profits
During the discussions within the EP, other possible fiscal resources were identified, including taxes on share trading, on financial transactions (Tobin tax) or on savings. Rapporteur Alain LAMASSOURE EPP-ED FR A6-0066/2007 The future of the EU's own resources Procedure : own-initiative

Budget
2008 budget to focus on "boosting confidence in EU institutions"
2007-03-22 - 18:30
The 2008 budget will focus upon making communication more efficient in the European Parliament in order to raise awareness among EU citizens and to "inform effectively the EU citizen on its activities and contribution to European construction", according to a report put forward by the Committee on Budgets. A focus on enhancing the exchange of information is needed to raise the profile of the 2009 elections to the Parliament, according to the report, written by Ville ITÄLÄ (EPP-ED, FI). Existing channels of communication can be improved, and a particular focus placed upon informing the local and regional media.
Greater efficiency in this area, the committee suggests, would help "address the shortcomings related to the image of the European Union" and be "highly profitable for the European project."
Obstacles to more efficient information exchange
The budget will look at factors which hinder the general flow of information, including in particular the fact that the European Parliament is located in three places. The committee expresses concern over "the additional costs that this implies in terms of running costs and in particular when travelling from one place to another." The budget can be used to improve this situation, according to the report, through investment in "new technologies in order to limit the negative impact of the European Parliament’s geographical layout such as the synchronisation of computers with mobile phones or the use of video conference rooms."
There are, however, problems which still exist in terms of successfully implementing this new technology, and the committee calls for a specific section of the budget to be dedicated to evaluating "IT projects launched in the past five years with indications regarding the provisional costs, the starting and provisional delivery dates, the delivery dates and the final costs."
European Parliament staff
The committee is particularly concerned about "the costs related to geographical dispersion", in particular "the number of missions undertaken by staff within the three places of work", and will "examine the possibilities to rationalise them better."
Services for MEPs
The report also draws attention to services available to MEPs, for example for meetings and access to library resources, including calling for the establishment of "an extensive single document and information repository of all existing texts and expertise (Knowledge Management System)." The report also calls for "a more personal level of service to members, under transparent and clearly defined conditions" to facilitate for MEPs the "accomplishment of their role and [to] enhance the quality of EU legislation."
