Tax losses incurred by Member States mean lost resources for the EU, 12% of whose budget is funded by Member States' VAT-related contributions. The Budgetary control committee is holding a hearing, under the aegis of the relevant EP rapporteur, Bart Staes (Greens/EFA), to take the pulse of national and Community authorities on concerted action to combat VAT fraud. Participants will hear Member States views first, and examine the role of European institutions thereafter.
