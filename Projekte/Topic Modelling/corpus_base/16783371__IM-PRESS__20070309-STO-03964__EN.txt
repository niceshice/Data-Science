A recent hearing in "sport and education" was told of the sorry stories that can affect young men who are lured to Europe with promises of wealth and fame, only for the dream to become a nightmare. The hearing was told that this is the latest human trafficking issue that allows unscrupulous agents to take advantage of promising young men. Often failure to get a contract with a club leads to loss of a visa and residence permit, leaving people in dire difficulties.
FIFA - the world's governing body on football - has strict rules on the transfer of players. Under 18s are not allowed to be transferred unless their parents are with them for example. Nevertheless, with many coming from the poorest parts of Africa, the lure of large salaries and transfer fees for young players and their African clubs can prove irresistible the hearing on 28 February was told.
Players can get "involved in delinquency" if they fail
Jean-Claude Mbvoumin is from the NGO "Culture Foot Solidaire" and is an ex-professional footballer from Cameroun. He told the hearing that trafficking of young players "come mainly" from Africa as "African players are the cheapest in economical terms". He went on to say that "clubs buy them to resell them afterwards" and if players "don't prove to be special their contracts are not renewed". The result can be that "they get involved in delinquency" and don't want to go back home after failing .
In Europe France is the "first destination for African players". Last season in the French league 48% of players were foreigners and their average age was 18,6.
UEFA and FIFA are aware of this problem: Lars-Christer Olsson chief executive of UEFA the European governing body said the situation was "alarming" and that "Bringing young children from Africa and South America into Europe is a major problem, and we have to address it". He said that "proper rules and regulations on agents would help."
French Socialist MEP Guy Bono has drafted a report on the issues which will be voted on by the Plenary in March. He talked of the "clandestine immigration" and that many people were bound for "training camps" in Europe.
Football about people not profits
In 2005 an Independent European Sport Review was initiated which called for greater cooperation between "the immigration and national labour inspection services, in particular, to examine the issuance of short term visas and related international transfer certificates to deter “trafficking” of young players”.
Guy Bono would like to see that clubs ensure that young players return safely home if their career does not take off in Europe. As Jean-Claude Mbvoumin said, "football is not only about money and TV rights; there are more important things, like these young people".
