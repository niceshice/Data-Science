Summer smiles - seasonal jobs can be very rewarding
Have you ever considered a summer job working abroad? The opportunities are endless - maybe as a language teacher, a waiter, or perhaps fruit picking? As well as making some money they are an opportunity to learn foreign languages, see new countries and make new friends. If this sounds appealing have a look at a website that lists a variety potential jobs for the summer.
The "eurosummerjobs" website is one initiative to mark 2006 as the European Year for " Workersâ€™ Mobility".
It is an excellent way to give young people the chance to acquire their first professional experience and get a taste of working abroad. You can search for jobs in English, German, French, Spanish and Italian .
Recent changes
Spain, Portugal, Greece and Finland, four popular summer job destinations, opened their labour markets on 1 May 2006 to citizens from the European Union as a whole. They follow the UK, Ireland and Sweden who opened their labour markets two years previously. The other members of the Union (members before 1 May 2004) kept certain restrictions for workers from the eight Central and Eastern European countries that joined the EU on 1 May 2004. In those eight countries similar restrictions to the labour market only exist in Hungary and Poland. For full details of the situation in any particular country see "Eures" - the European job mobility website.
And finally, after the summer
If you liked the taste of working abroad in a multi-lingual and multicultural environment and you are interested in politics, then perhaps a traineeship at the European Parliament is an interesting way of continuing your international working experience? The application period for a 5-month paid traineeship from 1 March 2007 opens on 15 August and closes on 15 October. Good luck!
