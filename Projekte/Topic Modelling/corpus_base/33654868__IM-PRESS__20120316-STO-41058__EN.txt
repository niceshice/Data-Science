Human hand holding pen and making notes The European Commission proposes to revise the EU directives on public procurement to make the rules simpler and more efficient, boost economic activity while ensuring transparency and efficiency. In addition to the Council, they will also need to be approved by the Parliament. Its internal market committee, which is responsible for drafting a recommendation to MEPS, will hold a public hearing on it with experts on 20 March.
Public procurement plays a vital role in the EU economy. About 18% of the EU's gross domestic product comes from authorities spending money on supplies, works and services via public procurement. This covers nearly everything, from public infrastructure to equipment to all kinds of services provided by the state.
EU rules seek to ensure a level playing field for all companies participating in tenders, especially those taking part in a tender in another member state.
The European Commission proposes to revise the current rules to make them simpler and more effective, especially for specific public services such as social, health and education services, where special provisions are needed to ensure that vulnerable groups still enjoy access to them. It should no longer be about achieving the lowest possible price, other factors such as the environment and labour should also be taken into account. Sub-contractors should be covered by the same rules imposed on the main contractor. In addition it should be made easier for small and medium-sized companies to take part in public procurement, while in the future all procurement transactions should be carried out electronically . Finally, criteria regarding the environment, sustainability and any societal considerations should be clarified and extended. It should be possible to exclude companies that breach existing norms in these fields.
Belgian Social-Democrat MEP Marc Tarabella will be steering the legislation through the Parliament. The internal market committee is leading, but other committees will also comment on it. The Parliament is expected to vote on the proposal in plenary in December.
