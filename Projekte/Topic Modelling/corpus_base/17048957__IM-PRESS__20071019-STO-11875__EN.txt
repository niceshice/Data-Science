78 million EU citizens are below the poverty line
MEPS debated ways to fight poverty and ensure that less people are socially excluded Thursday. The importance of work as a way to avoid poverty and the importance of care facilities for young and old were underlined. In a closing debate on human rights around the world MEPs voiced concern over the persecution of Christians in the Middle East and the situation in Uzbekistan and Somalia.
"78 million EU citizens continue to live in poverty"
One of the key messages was that having a job is one of the most important factors in ensuring that people do not fall into poverty - and that they do not become excluded from society. British Liberal Liz Lynne, who drafted the report on "social reality stocktaking" said that "in 2007 it is a fact that 78 million EU citizens continue to live in poverty, 8% are suffering from in-work poverty and one in six citizens is living below the poverty line." She noted that in some EU members the gap between rich and poor is increasing.
MEPs also considered the question of minimum income policies - Ms Lynne would like to see Parliament push EU members to "allow a minimum income for all". The link between poverty and crime, housing issues, school drop out rates and illiteracy were also discussed.
MEPs voice concern over beleaguered Christian communities
In their traditional debate on human rights at the end of each Plenary session, MEPs debated the plight of Christian communities around the world. MEPs voiced serious concern about the proliferation of intolerance and repression directed against Christian communities, particularly in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. A resolution lists many cases in detail, in countries and territories including Iraq, Pakistan, Gaza, Egypt, Turkey, the Philippines, Sudan, China and Vietnam.
MEP's agreed on the need for religious tolerance and respect for differences, but also underlined that this religious tolerance should be put into practice by every religion in the world. Parliament also debated the situation of human rights in Uzbekistan and Somalia.
