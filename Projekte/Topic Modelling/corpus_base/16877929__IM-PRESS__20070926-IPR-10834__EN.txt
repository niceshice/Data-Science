The European Parliament adopted a written declaration firmly condemning the illegal construction of a skyscraper with four basement levels and 20 storeys, which is endangering two buildings belonging to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bucharest: St Joseph's Cathedral and the Roman Catholic Metropolitan Palace, both of which figure on the list of historic architectural monuments in Romania.
The Declaration calls on the Commission and Council to firmly condemn the attitude of the Romanian authorities and initiate the necessary legal proceedings in order to persuade the relevant authorities to fulfil their Community obligations under Article 151 of the Treaty establishing the European Community as regards conserving and protecting the cultural and architectural heritage.
Written Declaration no 54/2007 was initiated in May 2007 by MEPs Adrian Severin (PSE), Daciana Octavia Sârbu (PSE), Radu Podgorean (PSE) and Corina Creţu (PSE), also by MEP Silvia Ciornei (ALDE). The competent authorities in Romania are systematically refusing to apply either the provisions of national law on protecting historic monuments, or the provisions of Community law on protecting the cultural and architectural heritage in this case, say MEPs.
On Tuesday 25 September, 395 MEPs had signed the declaration. For a written declaration to be adopted by the Parliament, 393 signatures are needed (half plus one from the total number of European Members of Parliament - 785)
