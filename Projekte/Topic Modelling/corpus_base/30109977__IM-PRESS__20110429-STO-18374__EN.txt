War correspondents: "We know that we may not come back"

War correspondents aren't all danger junkies More than 18 journalists have lost their lives reporting from war zones this year and another 151 are in prison. Just ahead of World Press Freedom Day on 3 May, Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Human Rights Committees organised a hearing to draw attention to the perils journalists in war zones face. There are legal means to protect journalists, but they want more consistency and a common EU position.
"A free press and media are a precondition for any democratic society. At the heart of democracy are active and well informed citizens who have access to factual information and independent analysis," EP President Jerzy Buzek said in a statement on World Press Freedom Day.
Information comes at a cost
"Truth is the first casualty of war. That is the reason journalists have to be there and report war crimes on both sides," Geman Green Barbara Lochbihler said during the hearing on 2 May.
But information can come at a cost. The deaths of two leading photo-journalists covering events in Misrata, Libya, once again show that journalists sometimes pay with their lives to deliver footage and reports from conflict zones. Attacks on journalists have become more widespread as the nature of war and journalism has changed over the decades. According to Reporters without borders more journalists have been killed during the Iraq war than in the 20 year Vietnam war.
"The work of war correspondents and local journalists is irreplaceable. Faced with war, we feel powerless," Belgian Socialist Véronique De Keyser said.
War journalists are not danger junkies
Freelance journalist Anne Nivat has reported from Afghanistan and Chechnya. The adrenaline rush is not the reason journalists put themselves into great danger, she said, "we know that we may not come back.".
"You have to go and find the story on the ground" otherwise the only source of information is the official press releases of the organisations and governments involved, she said. Information has to be ferreted out and double-checked; war reports help people understand what is going on, that this is not a "virtual war" that they see on TV in the evening. Good reporting can illustrate events, she said, for example; what is the difference between a 25-year-old Gaddhafi supporter and a 25‑ year‑old rebel? How do they see the world? What do they hope for?
Protecting journalists - "more daring" EU approach needed
Jean-Paul Marthoz from the Committee to Protect Journalists said that journalists have become targets in wars and not only international, but also local journalists. He also said that many war correspondents suffer from post-traumatic stress.
The EU has a number of projects to promote press freedom at a local level, for example help with the democratic transformation process in Egypt and Tunisia, but a "more daring" EU policy is needed, Mr Marthoz said. "The EU has developed instruments through collaboration with third countries (e.g.: human rights clauses) but they are not implemented."
Dutch Liberal Marietje Schaake highlighted the link between press freedom and internet freedom "Bloggers in some countries are imprisoned. The EU needs to defend and promote internet freedom, to allow free speech, press freedom and access to information."
A number or organisations, including Reporters without Borders, try to ensure the safety of reporters in war zones by offering insurance policies and training.
A UN resolution from December 2006 includes journalists in the protection of civilians in armed conflicts, while UNESCO's Medellín Declaration of May 2007urges all member countries to investigate acts of violence against journalists.
