Charlotte NILSSON BXL (+32) 2 28 34018 STR (+33) 3 881 72420 PORT (+32) 498 98 13 36 Paola BUONADONNA STR (+33) 3 881 74822 PORT (+44) 7 786 060 531 EMAIL Press-en@europarl.europa.eu EMAIL paola.buonadonna@europarl.europa.eu ADDINFO (+44) 207 227 43 35 The European Police College (CEPOL) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) were both granted budget management "discharges" (approvals) for financial 2009 on Wednesday, following improvements in their procurement procedures and practices. However, Parliament refused to grant the Council of Ministers a similar discharge for 2009, as it has yet to receive all the necessary information. All other EU bodies have already been granted discharges for their 2009 budgets.
In May 2011, Parliament had postponed its decision to grant a discharge to the Director of the Police College (Bramshill, UK) for 2009 budget. However, the Police College has improved its procurement procedures and practices, its current Director is more open about the accounts, and the College is progressing according to its set targets. Parliament granted the Police College its discharge with 519 votes in favour, 67 against, and 52 abstentions.
The Medicines Agency (London, UK) has likewise taken action to remedy shortcomings in its management of the Agency's 2009 budget. Although Parliament now has granted the Agency’s Executive Director a discharge, some concerns remain. Parliament wants EMA staff members' impartiality and independence to be assessed thoroughly when they are appointed as project team leaders for evaluating medicinal products.
Furthermore, it calls on the EMA to improve procurement procedures and to keep the Parliament better informed of the results of actions requested. The decision to approve the Agency's budget management was taken by a show of hands.
The closure of accounts - the last formal step in the discharge procedure - for 2009 was also approved by the plenary for the Police College and the EMA.
Further information needed on Council spending
Parliament has not yet received all the required documents and information regarding Council spending during 2009 MEPs maintain that they are entitled to take separate decisions on whether to grant budget discharges to EU institutions, including the Council - a view which is not currently accepted by the Council itself. The decision not to grant the Council of Ministers a discharge for 2009 budget was adopted by a show of hands.
Background
The European Parliament is the EU's budget discharge authority. Once annual accounts are audited and finalised, Parliament decides - on a recommendation by the Council of Ministers - whether or not to grant a discharge to the Commission and other EU bodies for their spending in each financial year.
