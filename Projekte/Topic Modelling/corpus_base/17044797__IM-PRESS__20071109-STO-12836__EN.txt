President Sarkozy: EU integration a "common will"
Tuesday saw two Presidents address MEPs in Strasbourg. First French President Nicolas Sarkozy reiterated France's commitment to the EU and said "Europe cannot be just a machine". Commission President José Manuel Barroso said that job creation would be among his priorities for 2008. MEPs debated the Schengen zone - a few weeks before border controls fall in 9 further states. They also backed the inclusion of aviation emissions in the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme.
Sarkozy: "Europe is not just a machine"
French President Nicolas Sarkozy used his midday address to "reaffirm France's commitment to Europe". He said that the EU cannot be just an "administrative and legal machine" and said that European integration was a "common will" between people who share a "common civilisation".
He welcomed the new Reform Treaty as a political victory, stressing that Europe had chosen democracy allowing anything to be discussed. He said that "Europe must ensure it is not perceived as a threat to identities but as a form of protection". He called for a strengthening of European defence and a committee of "wise men" to examine the possible future course of the European Union.
In remarks welcoming the French leader, EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering paid tribute to President Sarkozy’s commitment to the Constitution and the Reform Treaty. He also noted the French contribution to European integration, notably through the 1950 Schuman Plan.
Barroso outlines Commission's 2008 work programme
Mr Barroso welcomed the conclusion of negotiations over the Reform Treaty and said that Ratification would be vital. He told MEPs "it was now time to show citizens what the EU can offer in the run-up to the European parliamentary elections of 2009".
Commission priorities for 2008 include: Growth and jobs, Sustainable Europe, Managing migration (especially action to combat illegal trafficking), Putting citizens first, Strengthening the EU's role in the world.
Mr Barroso identified areas of "particular interest" for the Parliament that the Commission would pursue: Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs, climate change with an emphasis on mitigation, "greening" of Europe's transport, A small business act for SMEs, Legislation on consumer protection, Better access for justice for citizens, Improved regulation in Europe.
MEPs will vote on a resolution on the Commission's work programme in their December session.
Debate on Schengen: MEPs welcome opening of borders
In the afternoon the House debated the extension of the Schengen system to nine new countries, which will mean no more border controls for land and sea borders by 21 December and air borders by the end of March 2008. It will also allow people from non-EU countries to enter the EU and travel throughout the zone on a single visa. MEPs generally welcomed the agreement but expressed their concern about the possible increase of cross-border criminal activities.
Parliament's rapporteur, Portuguese MEP Carlos Coelho (EPP-ED), said the agreement by EU ministers marked "one of the greatest successes in the history of EU integration." He said however that "work is not finished yet", as there are technical steps some states still have to take to implement Schengen. Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini thanked the EP for its support. He said the Commission will try to facilitate the improvement of police cooperation and security controls in the Schengen area to prevent criminals from enjoying free movement and better opportunities to act illegally.

In Brief - Votes on Tuesday
Emissions Trading: MEPs backed a report that calls for the aviation industry to be included in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme - its flagship anti climate change policy. At current rates CO2 emissions from aviation could double by 2020 and the airline industry is currently excluded from emissions trading.
Sport in schools: MEPs backed an own initiative report calling for sport to be compulsory in all schools across the EU and for all children to have physical exercise three times a week.
Digital TV: MEPs adopted a report on the pan-European switch from analogue to digital TV. There are concerns about the cost and the 2012 deadline set by the Commission.
