Following a visit to Mali, the European Parliament delegation highlighted the need to build confidence in north-south cooperation on migration issues and the importance of the Malian diaspora. MEPs visited the Centre for Migration Information and Management (CIGEM) set up in cooperation with the EU.
With the EU seeking to increase cooperation with third countries in the management of migration, a delegation of MEPs went to Mali on 26 and 27 May to meet the authorities and representatives of CIGEM.
"CIGEM is a pilot experiment which deserves to continue but in a revised form. It needs to continue because it is very useful for the Republic of Mali and generates synergies with Europe, said the head of the delegation, Agustín Diaz de Mera (EPP, ES).
"CIGEM is not a FRONTEX on Malian soil"
CIGEM suffers, however, from a "problem of trust on the part of the Malian authorities", he said, adding "CIGEM is not a FRONTEX on Malian soil. That is definitely not the case".
In addition, "the strength of CIGEM comes from the fact that it involves civil society". The role of civil society is "fundamental for understanding the benefits of migration, protecting legal immigration and fighting illegal and clandestine immigration".
The role of the diaspora
"The skilled diaspora is of particular importance to the development of Mali", added Mr Diaz de Mera, who stressed the value of the TOKTEN project (Transfer of skills via expatriate nationals) in Mali. The project "enables highly skilled Malian immigrants to have the chance to transfer their skills to their own country", in particular in teaching, farming, health and small and medium-sized businesses.
The EP delegation consisted of Agustín Diaz de Mera (EPP, ES) and Tanja Falon (S&D, SL).
