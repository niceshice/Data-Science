Group week - Brussels
Gearing up for Strasbourg. Parliament's political groups will use the coming week chiefly to prepare for the Strasbourg plenary session of 13-16 February.
The big issue on the agenda will be the first-reading vote on the services directive. Following two years of preparatory work, the full Parliament must decide whether to back the positions adopted in November by its Internal Market Committee, particularly on the most contentious issues: the country of origin principle and the question of which categories of services should be covered by the directive.
Parliament will also adopt legislation on a Community licence for air traffic controllers and vote on a resolution on the confrontation between Iran and the international community. In addition, there will be a debate on the human rights and democracy clause in EU agreements with third countries. To mark his country's presidency of the EU, Austrian President Heinz Fischer will address a formal sitting of the House.
Pre-session press conference. Any changes to the plenary agenda decided by the Conference of Presidents will be announced at the press briefing in Brussels at 11am on Friday.
Elections in Haiti. A delegation of MEPs goes to Haïti to observe the first round of the presidential and parliamentary elections, which have been postponed four times and are now being held on 7 February.
