Colm Burke, Ireland's newest MEP for the South constituency
At his first engagement as Ireland's newest MEP for the South constituency, Colm Burke launched the Irish Examiner's photographic exhibition celebrating 50 years of the European Union in the offices of the European Parliament and European Commission in Ireland.
Reflecting on the photographs which surrounded him, Mr Burke spoke of the achievements of the European project and reminded the audience of the George Bernard Shaw quote : 'Some men see things as they are and say 'why'? I dream of things that never were and say, why not?'
Colm Burke has been practising as a solicitor in Cork City since 1983 and has been a Fine Gael (EPP-ED) City Councillor (local representative) in Cork since 1995. As a City Councillor, he has served as Chairperson of the Arts Committee, the Housing Committee, the Environment Committee and the Planning and Development Committee.
Mr Burke was chairperson of the Blackpool Community Centre and the Blackpool, Glen and Farranrea Training Centre which caters for young people who have dropped out of the education system and was involved in a campaign to get more Government funding for youth organisations in Ireland. He was also Director of the Port of Cork.
In July 2003, he was elected Lord Mayor of Cork, and during his year in that position, he travelled to Kenya to visit volunteers from development organisations and to Shanghai to begin negotiations to establish a twinning arrangement with that city. He also nominated and presented the Freedom of Cork City to former MEP John Hume in recognition of the contribution he had made to the Peace Process in Northern Ireland.
Colm Burke is replacing Simon Coveney TD who was reelected to DÃ¡il Eireann (Irish Parliament) during the Irish General Election in May. Speaking of the challenges ahead for him during his term as Member of the European Parliament, Mr Burke stated that "Simon did a lot of work in a short period of three years and he was able to build up a very strong record. I hope to follow that example."
