Europe reflects on Serbia's choice
As Sunday's election results in Serbia are being digested, some MEPs in Brussels gave us their reactions. The latest results show the pro-European party of Serbia's President Tadić as the victors days after Belgrade signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Brussels. With 38.7%, his European Serbia alliance leads Tomislav Nikolić's Serbian Radical Party with 29%. We spoke to three MEPs who follow Balkan events closely.
Austrian Socialist Hannes Swoboda, vice-chair of parliament's delegation to South East Europe, said, "it is a positive signal that the pro-European democrats are the number one but there are many hurdles still to be cleared for the European majority in Serbia itself". He called for the EU to show "courage and patience" in developing relations with Serbia.
Call for speedy formation of a Serbian government
German Christian Democrat and member of the Foreign Affairs Committee Bernd Posselt said "we have to strengthen the pro-European forces but under fair conditions. It is very important that we see also all the region, we cannot give Serbia possibilities which other states in the region do not have". He suggested a visa-free regime to encourage travel. Mr Posselt said the result of the election was not clear. "We must see how the coalition negotiations will end."
Parliament's rapporteur for Serbia is Slovenian Liberal Jelko Kacin. He asked: "Does Serbia want to take the leading role in region's accession to the EU or not?" He described the results as indicating that a "large number of citizens are pro-European and pro-reform". He said the negotiations on forming a government would decide Serbia's path and called for the quick formation of a Government "so that it can fight various problems that are waiting to be solved".
