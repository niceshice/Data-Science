EU budget 2012
2011-11-29 - 12:46
Parliament votes Thursday on next year's EU budget and also on plans to top up this year's budget, as the Commission has run out of money to pay research and social spending bills in the Member States. Both votes result from a deal struck by Parliament and Member State negotiators in the final round of budget conciliation talks on 18 November.
2012 budget
Parliament's budget proposals focused on growth, innovation, employment, border controls, managing migration and fostering democracy in the Arab world. These priorities were all taken on board by the Member States. The budget for commitments, reflecting longer-term political priorities, was increased by 3.8% to €147.2 billion.
The budget for payments in 2012 will be €129.1 billion, as requested by the Member States. Should the budget turn out to be too small to pay the bills - as happened this year - Member States have undertaken to add fresh money.
Topping up the 2011 budget
Member States also agreed to an amending budget to help to make good a shortfall of funds for 2011, which forced the Commission to stop paying its bills for research and social projects in October.
However, although the shortfall amounted to about €550 million, Member States declined to add more than €200 million. So the 2011 budget might need another cash injection to enable the EU to meet its legal obligations.

Opening the way for Croatia to join the EU
2011-11-29 - 12:46
Parliament is to vote its formal consent to Croatia's EU membership bid on Thursday. This will open the way for Croatia's EU accession treaty to be signed and ratified by all 27 Member States. It could join in 2013. The proposal was unanimously approved by the Foreign Affairs Committee on 17 November, with 65 votes in favour. Hannes Swoboda (S&D, AT), who is steering the proposal through Parliament, expects "a vast majority to support our decision".
MEPs will also debate and vote on an accompanying resolution urging Croatians to turn out for the EU referendum, vote for the EU accession treaty and tackle remaining challenges, especially in the field of the judiciary and combating corruption and organized crime.

Code of conduct for MEPs: final vote
2011-11-29 - 12:46
A new code of conduct for MEPs will be put to a final vote on Thursday. It sets out rules and principles to govern their outside activities, so as to avoid any conflict of interests. The code's guiding principle is transparency. If it is approved, MEPs will have to make clear declarations of their paid activities outside Parliament and their remuneration, as well as of any other functions that might constitute a conflict of interest.
The code would explicitly ban receiving payments or other rewards in exchange for influencing parliamentary decisions. It also lays down clear rules on accepting gifts and facilities for former MEPs working as lobbyists.

Democratic, not technocratic, economic policy co-ordination
2011-11-29 - 12:46
The "European semester" plan to co-ordinate EU Member States' economic policies must acquire real democratic legitimacy, and not be treated as a mere technical exercise, if it is to form the bedrock of better economic governance, says a resolution to be debated Wednesday and put to a vote Thursday. The resolution also notes that Parliament might have to adapt to Euro developments in a similar way to the Council, by creating a Eurozone configuration.

Better EU funding terms for crisis-hit regions
2011-11-29 - 12:46
The EU should pay up to 95% of regional development project costs in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Romania, Latvia and Hungary, says a resolution to be voted on Thursday. Parliament wants to spur recovery in countries worst hit by the crisis, by temporarily increasing the EU's share of funding for certain targeted projects, but without increasing the total volume of structural funding. The legislative resolution by Danuta Hübner (EPP, PL) advocates increasing the share of regional development project costs paid by the EU in countries that are eligible for EU financial assistance but cannot afford to pay their share of the costs.
MEPs want the improved funding terms to take effect as soon as possible, so as to counter the impact of the crisis on the real economy and labour markets.
The proposal, limited until the end of 2013, would not increase total EU regional funding in the countries concerned but would allow funding to be concentrated on completing projects focused on growth, employment and competitiveness, with appropriate reporting requirements.

Early school leaving
2011-11-29 - 12:46
To cut the early school leaving rate to below 10%, EU Member States should introduce reforms that target young people from disadvantaged, migrant and Roma families, says a resolution to be voted on Thursday. The draft calls for an EU-wide school leaving age of 18 and more "second chance" schools. The resolution stresses the importance of reducing the early school leaving rate for the EU's economic and social stability. They point out that cutting it by 1% would give the EU 500,000 more qualified young workers each year. Recent figures show that 52% of young people who left school without qualifications are unemployed.
The most vulnerable groups identified in the report by Mary Honeyball (S&D, UK), are children from poor, disadvantaged families and migrant families. Special efforts are needed to help Roma children, of whom 20% receive no schooling and 30% leave school early, it says.
The draft resolution says that the most effective ways to cut the early school leaving rate would be to raise the mandatory school leaving age from 16 to 18, or until the end of secondary education, and to create more "second chance" schools.
School reforms must take account of knowledge acquired during informal education and provide for partnerships between schools and local enterprises, like those in Spain, that help young people to decide what they would like to do, it adds.

2011-11-29 - 12:46
MEPs vote Thursday on €1.5 million in European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) aid for 726 redundant workers in Portugal. Portugal requested €1.5 million to help 726 workers made redundant by three firms making electrical equipment for cars. These firms were located in the Norte and Centro regions.
European Globalisation Adjustment Fund aid needs to be approved by Parliament and the Council of Ministers. The Council approved the French application on 24 November and the Portuguese one on 28 November.

Proposed EU-Ukraine association agreement
2011-11-29 - 12:46
MEPs are ready to agree to an EU association agreement with Ukraine, provided it respects the rule of law and allows the opposition to participate fully in politics, says a resolution to be put to a vote on Thursday. Parliament's formal consent will be needed later. The proposed agreement with Ukraine heralds a new generation of association agreements and involves an unprecedented level of integration between the EU and a third country.
The resolution to be put to a plenary vote was approved by the Foreign Affairs Committee on 17 November and the International Trade Committee on 14 November.
Once adopted by the full Parliament, the recommendations will be forwarded to the Council, the Commission and the European External Action Service.

Facilitating local border traffic in the Kaliningrad area
2011-11-29 - 12:46
To make it easier for people in the Kaliningrad area to cross the border with Poland, the entire Russian enclave and some border districts on the Polish side should be considered as a single EU border zone, says a resolution to be voted on Thursday. A Commission proposal, backed by MEPs, would amend local border traffic rules to treat the entire Kaliningrad region, as well as a specific border area in the Polish side, as a single border zone.
This would prevent an artificial division of the Kaliningrad enclave, enable more people in the area to cross the border and travel within the neighbouring districts more easily, and enhance economic and cultural exchanges.
The EU's 2006 local border traffic regulation allows Member States to negotiate bilateral agreements with neighbouring countries so as to grant special permits to citizens living in border areas. With these permits, residents face fewer checks at crossing points (no stamping, special lanes, etc).

Faster and smarter customs checks
2011-11-29 - 12:46
The information technology underlying the EU customs code system needs to be modernised, so as to make customs checks more effective by targeting high-risk consignments, says a resolution to be put to a vote on Thursday. The own-initiative report by Matteo Salvini (EFD, IT) sets out Parliament's position on a recast of the modernised customs code, to be initiated by the Commission early next year.
MEPs argue that the 2013 deadline for the recast code's entry into effect is unrealistic and that money found to develop advanced information technology to support the system, in the interests of business competitiveness and consumer safety.
