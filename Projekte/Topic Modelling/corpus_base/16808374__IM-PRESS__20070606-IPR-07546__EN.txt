European Parliament's budget for 2008 - a budget for the EU tax-payer
Budget
2007-06-07 - 13:58
Parliament adopted a report on the draft estimates of the European Parliament's revenue and expenditure (2008). The House recalls that the 2008 budget should be a 'budget for the EU tax-payer', aimed at responsible budgetary behaviour on the part of all actors involved in the process, with decisions on financial resources based on solid reasoning.
MEPs proposes to set the budget at €1,427,400,000 representing an increase of 2.1% over the 2007 budget which is €64,000,000 lower than the draft estimates set by the Bureau.
Information policy
The House takes note of the proposals to allocate an overall budget of €41,800,000 to information policy, which will include €10,300,000 for an awareness campaign in view of the 2009 European elections, €9,000,000 for implementation of the Parliamentary Television Channel (WebTV), €15,700,000 for the Audiovisual Centre and €6,800,000 to complete the construction of the Visitors' Centre. MEPs note that the WebTV project is being substantially delayed to the autumn and emphasise that the appropriations allocated and entered in Chapter 10 4 (“Reserve for information”) in the 2007 budget will not be used as initially anticipated. The House considers that this amount may be carried forward to 2008, subject to final approval of the prototype, and consequently could cover the needs of the year. MEPs therefore consider that the EUR 9 000 000 requested for 2008 should be placed in Chapter 10 1 ("Contingency reserve") pending a more precise estimation of the cost of the project if approved, and further information as to the capacity of absorption of such an amount.
The committee considers that the development of a specific programme, similar to that for Visitors' groups, which focuses on small and local media would be of interest to Members as one of the most efficient means of raising Union citizens' awareness of the European Parliament's activities. The committee invites the Quaestors to examine the feasibility of providing each Member with proper means for inviting local journalists to come to the European Parliament.
Informatics
The European Parliament notes that the increase in IT expenditure over the last four years has reached 28%; considers that the current strategy was useful in modernising the European Parliament's IT systems, enhancing the services provided to users and developing a new internet website.
The report also notes that the estimate for telecommunications charges is approximately the same as the estimate for 2005, whereas the actual costs have been falling annually since 2004 owing to the use of new technologies and general price reductions in the sector, and in 2006 were €2,100,000 below the estimates. The House calls on the Secretary-General to report to the Committee on Budgets on the use of current VOIP technologies to reduce telephone costs.
Staff
MEPs consider that efforts can be made to limit the number of staff missions to Strasbourg and, where possible, to make better use of new technologies such as video conferencing.
Finally, the House is convinced of the need to reinforce the relationship between Members of the European Parliament and Members of EU national parliaments and democratically elected national parliaments of third countries; is willing to support the programme for information exchanges with national parliaments.
