The Parliament has received many questions about the elections ©Belga In just a few days the 7th election in 30 years to the European Parliament will take place. An estimated 375 million people across the continent have a chance to elect the people they want to represent them for the next 5 years. The state of the economy and efforts to tackle climate change are just two issues that new MEPs will have to deal with. Ahead of the elections being held from 4-7 June we publish some frequently asked questions about this election.
They deal with everything from where can I vote, who are the candidates and who are the Parliament's political groups?
Here we try to answer just some of those questions.

FAQs on the European elections
The voting age across the European Union is 18 - with the exception of Austria where it is 16 ©Belga Europe goes to the polls in 10 days when people have the chance to elect a new set of Members for the European Parliament. Ahead of the ballot - in which an estimated 375 million people are entitled to vote, we look at some of the questions we have been getting about the practicalities of the election and how it will work exactly. Here is a sample of what we have been asked.
How can I vote in the European elections?
In most countries you can vote at the age of 18 although in Austria it's 16. As long as you are registered and on the electoral roll you can vote. Some countries have specific rules - you can see the electoral law of your own country via the first link below.
What about living abroad?
You are entitled to vote either back in your home country or in the country you live in now provide you are registered.
Why should I vote?
In the last few years the European Parliament has passed legislation forcing mobile phone operators to lower their prices. It has also passed rules that will reduce CO2 emissions by 20% within just over a decade. Added to this have been a series of European wide directives on how to manage immigration and a blue card scheme for skilled migrants.
All these decisions affect everyone in Europe one way or another. If you want your voice to be heard then voting for the candidate or group that represents your views is one way of doing that.
People often complain that the EU and "Brussels" is remote. Now is your chance to make a difference and elect people who will represent you there and shape the kind of European Union you want to see.
How many rounds of voting are there?
There is only one round of voting even if the exact date of the elections (4-7 June) varies from country to country.
Is it possible to vote by post?
Voting by post is usually possible although not in all countries. See your national electoral laws via the first link below for more information.

Parliament's election campaign
This European Parliamentary election is the 7th in 30 years ©Belga/L. Hamels From Barcelona to Bucharest, Stockholm to Sofia, people across Europe will be electing 736 Members of the European Parliament at the polls from 4-7 June. Ahead of the election, an information campaign organised by Parliament has endeavoured to raise people's awareness of its role and urged them to vote using the slogan "It's your choice!" We have received many questions about the elections, including queries about just who the candidates are, and you can find the responses here.
Where can I find a list of candidates?
See the first link below for a full list of candidates.
Is the Parliament doing anything to urge people to vote and why?
Yes, because over the past decades parliament's power and influence have increased and the 2009 election - the 7th in 30 years - gives people across Europe the opportunity to shape politics for the next five years.
What? Parliament's campaign aims to raise awareness about the work MEPs do. It is non-political and based around the slogan of "It's your choice!", in an attempt to get people to out and vote when their country goes to the polls sometime between 4-7 June. A variety of ways and means are being used to get people thinking about key issues.
Give me examples!
Posters across Europe based on 10 themes; security, energy, fuel and climate change, food and agriculture, borders and migration, standardisation, consumer protection, budget, equal opportunities and financial markets.
Choice boxes in various cities where people can go to record a message highlighting the issues they want the EU to deal with.
TV and radio ads.
The Parliament's election website site in 22 languages tackles the issues.
Something a bit different - the parliament on sites like YouTube, Facebook, MySpace and Flickr.
Press kits for Europe's media explaining the work of the Parliament.
EuroparlTV will have extensive coverage of the election including an election night special.
How much does the campaign cost and how is it financed?
The campaign is spread over the 27 countries of the European Union covering all 23 official languages used by those countries. The cost is around €18 million or €0,05 per eligible voter in the EU - there are about 375 million potential voters. The money comes from the 2008 and 2009 budget of the European Parliament which is a part of the Union's overall budget. The precise amount spent per country varies although a country where voter turnout was low previously or is predicted to be low for 2009 have been specifically targeted.

Political parties and party politics
The political groups are increasingly using social media as a way of reaching people. ©Belga/V.Hazat Around Europe political parties are campaigning for votes so they can send Members to the European Parliament. If elected they form a group, not with people from the same country, but with other parties from other countries who hold similar views. So for example Socialists sit with one another in a political group in the Parliament. The European Parliament receives many questions about the political parties. Here are some of the most frequently asked.
What are the party programmes?
You can take a look at the programmes and priorities of the EP's political groups on their websites - see the links below. Most MEPs are elected on party lists in their country of election and most parties adhere to a political group in the European Parliament, thereby endorsing common political principles. The political groups form the basis of political life in the European Parliament.
Formally, however, members "shall not be bound by any instructions and not receive a binding mandate for example from their Member State or from any private person", according to Parliament's Rules of Procedure. Ultimately therefore, MEPs are responsible only to their electorate.
What is the political composition of Parliament now?
MEPs sit in political groups – they are not organised by nationality, but by political affiliation. There are currently 7 political groups in the European Parliament, the biggest being the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats group with 288 (of a total of 785 MEPs) and the smallest the Independence/Democracy Group with 22 members. Some 30 MEPs - the non-attached - do not belong to any political group.
How can a new party be constituted?
After the 2009 elections the minimum number of MEPs allowed to form a political group will be 25 representing at least seven countries.
How are political parties financed for the elections?
That depends on each member states' laws. Every party gets funds according to the national rules for the elections.
The EP has, however, a special fund for "European level political parties", defined as organisations following a political programme, composed of national parties and individuals which is represented in several countries. For example, it must be represented in at least a quarter of all countries by MEPs or MPs from national or regional Parliaments or regional assemblies.
How many MEPs will there in the new Parliament?
The elections on 4–7 June will be the biggest transnational elections ever. Some 375 million Europeans in 27 EU countries will elect 736 MEPs to represent them. The total number of MEPs has steadily grown as the EU has enlarged, rising provisionally to the current total of 785 with the accession of Bulgaria and Romania in 2007.
Since 1979 MEPs have been elected by direct universal suffrage for a five-year period. The seats are, as a general rule, shared out proportionately to the population of each Member State. Each country has a set number of seats, the maximum being 99 (in Germany) and the minimum 5 (Malta).

Eligibility
A variety of posters have been used to highlight the issues decided at a European level. Many people contact the European Parliament with questions. As the 4-7 June European elections approach there have been lots of election questions. Here is a taster of the most frequently asked questions.
What steps must be taken to stand as a candidate?
The precise steps vary from country to country, although they usually involve registering with either your local, regional or national electoral authority. A number of counties also require individual candidates or political groups to pay a deposit.
Who is eligible to stand?
In theory, anyone who enjoys their full rights as an EU citizen and is over the voting age is eligible to stand for election, although some countries require that candidates are older than the minimum voting age. In some countries candidates must pay a deposit, which they lose it if they don't get a certain amount of votes.
The unusual thing about the European elections is that you can also stand as a candidate in a foreign country providing you have been resident there. In the current parliament, several MEPs have one nationality but represent people from another country - 1981 world rally champion Ari Vatanen is Finnish by birth but was elected by French voters.
Where can I find out who the candidates are?
As the election approaches local authorities will publish a list of names of people who have put their names forward to be candidates. As official lists become available, Parliaments Information Offices around Europe will have those lists.

The 4-7 June European elections
As the elections draw nearer many people are writing in to find out more ©Belga/M.Dalle In the run up to the June European elections, the Parliament's Citizens' Correspondence Unit has been deluged with mail asking questions about the elections. A bewildering array of enquiries have come from all 27 EU states, many of them about the date of the election. Take a look at the four most frequently asked questions this year:
Q. Who decides the election date in each country?
This is a European election, but each country gets to choose the date it will hold the election. There are two provisos - the election must be held between 4 and 7 June and the results are released only after the final polling station has been closed i.e. on Sunday 7 June.
Q. Will the polling date coincide with a national holiday?
Voting is always an enjoyable activity but the election does not fall on any bank holiday or national holiday.
Q. Will the date of the European election coincide with "D-Day" - the liberation of Western Europe on 6 June?
The famous events in Normandy in 1944 are of course a vital part of Europe's history but the European election date is not connected to these events. In France, where the allies landed - the election date is 7 June.
Q. Will the ballot take place everywhere on the same date?
No. Most countries vote on Sunday 7 June, but some vote on other days, for example, the UK and the Netherlands vote on Thursday 4 June, the Irish vote on Friday 5 June, Malta goes to the polls on Saturday 6 June and Italy votes on 6-7 June. The results however will all be available on the same day - 7 June.
This year the majority of enquiries about the election have come from the French.
