The EP approved a fisheries partnership agreement between the European Community and Morocco today, despite some MEPs' reservations about its international legal ramifications regarding Western Sahara.
The fishing agreement with Morocco covers 119 vessels, mostly from France, Spain and Portugal, although it also includes a 60 000 tonne quota for industrial pelagic fishing for several northern European fleets. The financial contribution is set at â‚¬36.1 million per year, making this agreement the most valuable of all EC fisheries agreements. The Parliament's consultative report was drafted by Daniel Varela Suanzes-Carpegna (EPP-ED, ES), and passed by 409 votes in favour with 167 against with 79 abstentions.
The report approves the fishing agreement and protocol, although it demands "an annual report on the implementation of the agreement" before it gives its go-ahead for the negotiation of the next protocol. It also asks that "in the event of evidence that the use to which the Agreement is being put is in contravention of international obligations, the Commission shall take immediate steps to suspend the Agreement." This addition refers to the relationship between Morocco and Western Sahara.
Several MEPs had been troubled by the inclusion of the waters of Western Sahara in the fishing agreement. They were concerned that by signing an agreement with Morocco giving the EU fishing fleet access to waters off the coast of Western Sahara (i.e. south of the 27.4 degree line), the EU would be breaking its commitments to the UN. Several amendments were therefore submitted to prohibit fishing in these areas, but they were voted down.
The fishing agreement is expected to be approved by the Council on 22 May, allowing the agreement to enter into force before the first payments are due on 30 June. The Parliament had previously rejected using the urgency procedure to ratify the agreement during its April session - more details are available via the link below.
