MEPs adopted a legislative report on the annual review of Regulation 1408/71 on cross social security. Parliament adopted amendments intended to simplify the proposal, to correct mistakes and to update the annexes of Regulation. These technical amendments are acceptable to both the Commission and the Council.
The aim of Regulation 1408/71 is to ensure that anyone moving from country to country within the EU enjoys the same rights as someone who has always lived and worked in the same country. Thanks to this Regulation, people who move around do not lose their acquired social security rights and are not required to contribute simultaneously to more than one national social security scheme. The Regulation determines whether the citizen is entitled to specific benefits laid down by their Member State of origin, or whether an equivalent benefit is available in the person's new Member State of residence. Almost every year, the Regulation is modified in order to take account of the developments of national social security schemes, incorporate changes in national law, and take account of the case law of the Court of Justice.
The proposal updates the Regulation to reflect changes in national legislation on social security, in particular from the new Member States since the end of accession negotiations. It also completes the simplification of procedures on receiving medical care abroad, introduced by Regulation (EC) No 631/2004, by extending some of those modifications to the identical procedures regarding benefits for accidents at work and occupational diseases. Finally, it aims at updating and simplifying the list of bilateral agreements which include provisions on social security that are still in force and have not been replaced by Regulation 1408/71, as well as at introducing technical corrections.
