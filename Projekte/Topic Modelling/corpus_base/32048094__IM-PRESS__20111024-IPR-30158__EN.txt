Mary BRAZIER BXL (+32) 2 28 32733 STR (+33) 3 881 74005 PORT (+32) 498 98 35 87 EMAIL press-EN@europarl.europa.eu MEPs praised the successful conduct of last Sunday's elections to Tunisia's Constituent Assembly in their initial findings released on Tuesday and congratulated the people on turning out to vote in huge numbers. While noting some imperfections they declared that the elections met international standards and called on Tunisia to start building a new democratic state.
" These elections were the first step. Now it is up to you to build new democratic institutions ", said Gabriele Albertini (EPP, IT), who led the 14-member delegation of MEPs that formed part of the overall EU Election Observation Mission (EOM). " The task of the Constituent Assembly that has just been elected is huge and we know how much the Tunisian people want the direction taken on 14 January to be pursued democratically, he declared .
" We were moved to see joy and hope on the faces of young people, women, old people, everyone," he continued. "We were impressed to see polling stations close early because everyone had voted! Can there be a stronger indication than that of the determination of the Tunisian people to engage in truly democratic debate and open a new chapter in their history?"
The EP Delegation worked closely with the EOM headed by Michael Gahler (EPP, DE), and fully endorsed its findings after observing polling and vote-counting in Tunis and the surrounding area, Sidi Bou Zid, Sfax and Gafsa. Though it will make some recommendations for the next elections, for example concerning voter registration and ballot papers, it found no major irregularities.
Mr Albertini called on the whole of the new political class in Tunisia to continue to work in a spirit of consensus and said the European Parliament was ready to establish ties with the newly elected members of the Constituent Assembly, provided the principles governing the EU's neighbourhood policy are met.
