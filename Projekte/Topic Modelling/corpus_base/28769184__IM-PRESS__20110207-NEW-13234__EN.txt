Passenger rights for bus and coach travellers
2011-02-10 - 16:13
Bus operators and terminals throughout the European Union will soon have to offer their passengers better information, assistance and compensation for delays, thanks to MEPs. Parliament's vote on Tuesday 15 February will be the final building block in EU rules that already cover air, rail and sea travellers. MEPs were keen to ensure that bus passengers enjoyed similar rights to these other groups.
The new legislation on bus and coach travel will cover cancellation, overbooking and departures delayed for more than two hours on journeys over 250 km.
Unless bad weather conditions or natural disasters prevent a bus service from running safely, companies will have to offer a choice between full reimbursement of the ticket and rerouting by similar means, free of extra charge. If reimbursement is the only option offered, the companies have to add 50% of the ticket price in compensation.
Damaged or lost luggage will be reimbursed up to the value of €1200 but there will be no limit for replacing mobility equipment for disabled passengers.
The EP's consistent non-discrimination policy on behalf of people with reduced mobility has resulted in strong basic rights for assistance at terminals and stops, including free-of-charge transport of equipment such as wheelchairs.

Protecting patients from counterfeit drugs
2011-02-10 - 16:13
Internet sales of medicines are set to be covered by a new EU law designed to prevent counterfeit drugs from entering the legal supply chain. Parliament will vote in Strasbourg on the final shape of the law, following an agreement reached with the Council just before Christmas.
New safety features will be introduced along with sanctions on counterfeiters and a control system to prevent dangerous medicinal products from reaching the patient.
It is estimated that 1% of medicinal products currently sold to the European public through the legal supply chain are fake and the number is increasing. In other parts of the world more than 30% of the medicines on sale can be fake. In particular, more and more innovative and life-saving drugs are counterfeit.
The draft legislation updates current rules and introduces safety features to guarantee the identification, authenticity and traceability of the medicinal product from the factory to the consumer.
MEPs also deemed it necessary to regulate the sale of pharmaceuticals online, as the internet is one of the main routes by which fake medicines enter the EU market.

On the road to greener vans
2011-02-10 - 16:13
Parliament will take a step towards introducing cleaner, more fuel-efficient vans on Tuesday, when it votes on CO2 limits for new vans in the EU. The new rules, agreed with Member States, include incentives to make highly efficient vehicles as well as penalties for manufacturers that miss the targets.
Following legislation on car emissions approved two years ago, Parliament is set to give the green light to introduce CO2 limits for new "light commercial vehicles". As well as contributing towards better air quality and the EU's climate targets, these vehicles will also offer greater fuel efficiency for the small businesses that depend on them.
The targets aim to drive innovation in industry. Parliament reached agreement with Council for a limit of 175g CO2/km to apply in 2014, which will decrease in phases to 147g CO2/km by 2020. The targets are an average across a manufacturer's fleet.
Vans that emit less than 50g CO2/km will earn carmakers 'supercredits' for a limited time, by counting as more than one vehicle towards the average. The scheme will be phased out by 2017. On the other hand, new vans over the agreed limits will be subject to penalties rising to €95 per gram from 2019.

Sustainable pension systems
2011-02-10 - 16:13
Pension reforms are under way across Europe, in response to the EU's ageing population and the economic downturn. Sustainability of systems and adequate retirement income must be maintained, according to a resolution to be put to the vote by MEPs on Tuesday. While pensions are the responsibility of Member States, the EU has a role to play. The EU's supervisory powers cover public deficits, which can be a major issue when steps are taken to ensure reform for the long term. Portability of pensions between jobs and across the EU's internal borders is also a concern, as are the lower employment rates of women and older people, which are hitting their retirement benefits later in life.

Croatia: the next EU Member State?
2011-02-10 - 16:13
Croatia's EU membership negotiations could be completed in the first half of 2011 provided Zagreb pushes ahead with reform, according to a draft resolution by the Foreign Affairs Committee that comes before Parliament on Wednesday. The fight against corruption, support for returning refugees and the restructuring of shipyards are among the remaining challenges facing the country. However, MEPs acknowledge that major efforts have been made to change the constitution, reform the judiciary and co-operate more closely with the International Crime Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
MEPs will also debate the current political stalemate in Albania Tuesday night. No resolution will be put to the vote.

Hungarian media law under the spotlight
2011-02-10 - 16:13
Hungary's new media law will be debated at the European Parliament on Wednesday. The Commission has asked the Hungarian government to clarify certain aspects of the law, which entered into force on 1 January this year. A resolution will be put to the vote on Thursday. The Commission's main concerns were whether the law complied fully with the EU Audiovisual Services Directive. The EP Civil Liberties and Culture committees debated the issue on 17 January.

EU's free trade accord with South Korea nears the finishing line
2011-02-10 - 16:13
The European Parliament is expected to give the green light in Strasbourg for ratification of the EU-South Korea free trade agreement, the most ambitious trade accord the EU has ever negotiated. At the insistence of MEPs, strong safeguard measures have been included, together with guarantees from Seoul that new Korean legislation on automobile CO2 emissions will not have an adverse effect on Europe's car makers.
The long-awaited agreement will eliminate about 98% of tariffs on bilateral trade over the next five years and double the EU trade with Korea in the medium term, thus boosting jobs and growth.
The House will be asked by the EP's International Trade Committee to endorse two reports: one by Robert Sturdy (ECR, UK) which focuses on the substance of the FTA itself, and the second, more controversial one, by Pablo Zalba Bidegain (EPP, ES), on the safeguard measures to protect European industry if ever it is threatened by a surge in South Korean imports.
Background
Following two and half years of negotiations, the deal was signed at the EU-South Korea summit in Brussels on 6 October. However, it can only enter into force after both the safeguard regulation (co-decision) and the free trade agreement (consent) are adopted by Parliament.
Both the free trade agreement and the safeguard regulation are due to come into force in July 2011. The EU is the largest foreign investor in South Korea and its second largest trading partner after China.
Procedure: Consent (FTA) and co-decision (safeguard clause, 1st reading agreement)

MEPs to vote on patent procedure limited to EU states that wish to opt in
2011-02-10 - 16:13
Parliament will vote in Strasbourg on plans to create a common patent system within the EU - although not one involving all Member States - by using the enhanced co-operation procedure. If Parliament and Council authorise this procedure, the Commission will then have to table two draft laws: one on establishing a common patent system and the other on the language rules to be used.
The request by 12 Member States (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Lithuania, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Poland, Slovenia, Sweden and the UK) to launch an enhanced cooperation procedure came in December 2010, after it was concluded that no EU-wide agreement on the issue could be reached within the Council. Subsequently all other Member States except for Italy and Spain have indicated they will join in. These two States can still join at any time.
If the enhanced cooperation is authorised by both Parliament and Council, the Commission will present two legislative proposals: one on establishing the single patent (co-decision procedure) and the other on the language regime (consultation procedure). In the resolution by Klaus-Heiner Lehne (EPP, DE), MEPs call on the Council to use the co-decision procedure for both proposals.
Member States have been trying to agree on an EU-wide patent system for years but their efforts to achieve unanimity have failed. Language issues have been particularly problematic. Currently, national patents coexist with a European patent but the system is complex and expensive: a European patent can be 10 times more expensive than a comparable US patent.

Immigration: a single permit to live and work in the EU
2011-02-10 - 16:13
A draft "single permit" law, enabling immigrants to obtain work and residence permits via a single procedure and conferring on them a standard set of rights comparable to those of EU citizens, will be put to the vote on Wednesday. The draft law as amended in plenary in December was rejected by a majority of MEPs at the final vote and sent back to the Civil Liberties Committee for further consideration. It now returns for a fresh plenary vote.

EU firms have yet to reap full benefits of Services Directive
2011-02-10 - 16:13
Red tape and lack of information are hindering cross-border trade in services more than a year after the deadline for implementing the 2006 Services Directive, argues a draft resolution by the Internal Market Committee. Easier access to information for businesses and speedier implementation by Member States of all the directive's provisions are crucial, say MEPs. The author of the draft resolution, Evelyne Gebhardt (S&D, DE), was also Parliament's rapporteur on the Services Directive back in 2006.
On 27 January 2011 the Commission unveiled a communication on the transposition of the Services Directive and stated its willingness to launch infringement proceedings against recalcitrant Member States.

Brazil: visa-free stays for EU citizens
2011-02-10 - 16:13
EU citizens will be allowed to enter Brazil visa-free for stays of up to three months, under new visa rules set to be approved by MEPs in Strasbourg. Citizens of Estonia, Latvia, Malta and Cyprus, who until now needed to apply for a visa for tourism and business stays, will henceforth be exempted.
The UK and Ireland are not bound by the new agreements as they are not in the Schengen area and so the existing bilateral agreements between these two countries and Brazil will continue to apply. However, under these bilateral accords, British and Irish tourists can already enter Brazil without a visa for a stay of up to 90 days.

Backing for EIB to help it achieve environment and development goals
2011-02-10 - 16:13
On Thursday Parliament will be asked to vote for an increased ceiling - from €26 billion to €27 billion - for the EU's guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses made outside the EU. This would enable the bank to keep up its rate of lending for the rest of the 2007-2013 period. The report drafted for the Budgets Committee by Ivailo Kalfin (S&D, BG) also calls for increased transparency and monitoring of projects, especially of the environmental and development aspects, and investment in small and medium-sized firms (SMEs).
Procedure: Co-decision (1st reading)
