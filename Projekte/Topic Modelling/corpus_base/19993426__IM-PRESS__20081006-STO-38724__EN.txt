Free at last - Ingrid Betancourt embraced by EP President Pöttering; 8 October The power of the spoken word and the comfort it can bring to hostages. Those were the messages brought to MEPs by former Colombian hostage Ingrid Betancourt when she addressed them on Wednesday. The days also saw MEPs debate the issues they believe a forthcoming EU summit should look at with the financial crisis being central stage. Later, steps to cut water waste by 20% were discussed.
Betancourt: "There is nothing stronger than words"
The session opened with president Pottering warmly welcoming Ingrid Betancourt, former Colombian presidential candidate and French national who was invited to address the Parliament.
Ms Betancourt spent 6 years as a hostage n the Colombian jungle after having been taken prisoner by the FARC rebel movement. Her case had repeatedly been raised by MEPs over the last years and she told the House that "just three months ago I was watching you act from the depths of the jungle and my biggest hope was that people could speak for us as prisoners at the madness of others. It is a miracle that I can share this" she said.
In an emotional speech she rammed home the importance of words and the impact they can have saying "the only weapon we can believe in, is the force of words, there is nothing stronger than words."
Ms Betancourt also called for continued recognition for those both in Colombia and elsewhere who are held in captivity. Her full speech is available below.
Financial crisis debated ahead of EU summit
Next Wednesday Europe's leaders will meet in Brussels for a European Council. Ahead of the meeting - in which the present crisis is expected to dominate - MEPs debated the options open to Europe.
The debate saw profound ideological differences emerging around the Chamber, as members sought to interpret recent events in the financial world and draw conclusions for the EU as a whole. Despite their differences on the wider meaning of the crisis however, most speakers agreed that the EU must take initiative and act collectively to introduce new measures and rules in order to ensure the stability of the economy.
Water scarcity and droughts in Europe
In the evening, MEPs debated on a report on water scarcity and droughts in the EU. In particular the problems have been identified as inefficient water consumption, a lack of knowledge about the need to conserve water and a lack of coordination between people and water companies.
The report - drafted by Austrian MEP Richard Seeber's (EPP-ED) - calls for the creation of a water saving culture in Europe. The Austrian MEP said that "in the future up to three billion people will be facing water scarcity and that already in 2007 one third of the Europeans lived in regions facing this problem". He underlined that "water scarcity and droughts should be considered as a global phenomenon" and that "when it comes to fighting against water scarcity and droughts the member states should work together united".
MEPs on Parliament's Environment committee also want a greater realisation that deforestation and urban development are contributing to growing water scarcity.
Another topic discussed on Wednesday was the situation in Belarus after the parliamentary elections, which failed to respect the international standards for democratic government.
