Next Tuesday we will find out whether the UK nomination for this year's European Charlemagne Youth Prize has won. "Europe &amp; Me" is an online lifestyle magazine for young Europeans produced by an editorial team of eight young people from six different countries, based at St Antony's College Oxford. There's a new edition every three months and there have been seven editions in all since the magazine launched in July 2008.
"Europe & Me" is up against projects from the other 26 EU Member States. A European judging panel composed of three MEPs, the President of the European Parliament and four representatives of the International Charlemagne prize Foundation will select the overall winners. The first prize of €5,000 will be handed over at an award ceremony in Aachen, Germany, on 11 May 2010, along with the 2nd and 3rd prizes of €3,000 and €2,000 respectively.
"Europe & Me" has built up a readership of more than 20,000 from 20 different countries, and has had more than 90 contributors in its seven editions so far. The overall goal of the magazine is to make Europe 'personal' and to move away from perceptions that 'Europe' is all about politics and bureaucracy. The latest edition includes articles on politics, but also about languages, travel, culture, even dating across Europe. The next edition is due out on 1 July 2010, so take a look at their website (see link below).
Notes to editors
The Charlemagne Youth Prize is open to people aged between 16 and 30 who have been involved in projects which help to promote understanding between people from different European countries.
The UK judging panel was made up of two UK MEPs and a representative from the British Youth Council.
Last year's overall winner was a Polish youth project "YOUrope needs YOU!", a series of high school workshops run by university students.
