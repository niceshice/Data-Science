France
The largest share, €24.5 million, is to aid 3,582 French workers made redundant by the car manufacturer Renault and seven of its suppliers. The redundancies mainly affected three regions in France: Ile-de-France (53% of redundancies), Haute-Normandie (29.5%) and Nord-Pas-de-Calais (12.5%).
The French application was rejected by the Budgets Committee in October because MEPs wanted further clarifications about Renault's voluntary redundancy plan in relation to new retirement legislation that entered into force in France after it applied for the EGF aid. MEPs feared that this new law might negatively affect the status of the staff that volunteered for early retirement. After having received the requested information and reassurances, the committee has now decided to approve the aid.
Portugal
Portugal had applied for €1.5 million to benefit 726 workers who lost their jobs in three companies producing electrical equipment for cars. The companies were located in the Norte and Centro regions.
Next steps
Following the committee's green light, the aid will need to be approved by Parliament and the Council of Ministers. The Council is set to vote on the French application on 24 November, and the Portuguese application on 28 November. Parliament's plenary votes on both applications are scheduled for 1 December.
Background
The EGF was established to provide additional support for workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation or the financial crisis and to assist them with their reintegration into the labour market by offering them training and job-search assistance. The fund's annual ceiling is €500 million.
