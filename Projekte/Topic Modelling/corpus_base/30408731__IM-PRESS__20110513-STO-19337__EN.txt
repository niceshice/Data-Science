Ban should be lifted by 2013 Â©BELGA/DPA/Tim Brakemeier The decision to postpone the lifting of the ban on liquids in planes will be discussed by MEPs in the Transport Committee over coming weeks but divisions are already clear. Transport Committee Chair Brian Simpson thinks it's a bad move, while MEPs from the ECR and EPP groups believe security issues must be fully dealt with before the ban is lifted.
The ban on liquids was introduced in 2006 after the discovery of a terrorist plot to build explosives using liquids during flights from London to the US and Canada. Now passengers are limited to carrying liquids, gels, aerosols, jam and cheese in bottles of less than 100 ml in hand luggage.
EP called for review and repeal in 2007
In 2007, the EP called on the European Commission to review restrictions and repeal them as soon as possible, without compromising passenger safety. The aim was to lift the ban in 2010, but that was postponed until 2013.
A partial lifting of restrictions, to allow duty free liquids purchased in third counties, was supposed to come into effect by the end of April, but "a growing number of member states", according to the Commission, resisted the change as it could "cause confusion for passengers"
Mr Simpson , a British Socialist, is disappointed by the decision but believes the Commission had no choice after some large countries said they would keep the ban in place. "This left the good guys penalised and the bad guys getting away with it"
Next deadline 2013
The Commission expects the 2013 deadline to be met, as liquid-screening machines should be available at all airports by then. But Mr Simpson is less optimistic. "This whole issue has nothing to do with security and all to do with cost. If it was a security issue why were other countries happy to end the ban? This whole issue has been dominated by major airports not being willing to buy the equipment and they used the security angle as their excuse," he said.
However, Transport Committee Vice-President Peter van Dalen , a Dutch member of the ECR group, said the EU should wait until the equipment necessary to scan liquids is available. "Europe is still under threat of terrorist attack, especially now after the killing of Bin Laden."
Fellow vice-president, German Christian Demcrat Dieter-Lebrecht Koch , agreed. A partial lifting of the ban could be puzzling for passengers who would have to deal with different sets of rules, he said. "The Commission decision means less insecurity, confusion and bureaucracy for travellers."
