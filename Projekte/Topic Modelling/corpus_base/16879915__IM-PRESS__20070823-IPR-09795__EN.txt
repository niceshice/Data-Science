The European Parliament gave its approval to a planned European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) mission to Chad and the Central African Republic (CAR), but listed several conditions which needed to be met for this operation to enjoy parliamentary support. The mission, which is meant to address the insecurity in the two countries resulting from the crisis in the neighbouring Darfur region of Sudan, could possibly be deployed by early November.
In a resolution adopted by (453 votes in favour 104 against and 15 abstentions), the House "gives its approval for the launch of an ESDP operation in the eastern part of Chad and the northern part of CAR, which will last for one year, but makes its final approval conditional on the fulfilment of the following points:"
EUFOR must:
-have a diverse composition
-not get involved in fights between government authorities and rebel groups
-not get involved in the tasks performed by NGOs in the region
-have a robust mandate, according to Chapter 7 of the UN Charter
-have the necessary number of troops and must be equipped appropriately
-have a clear exit strategy, which foresees its replacement by a UN, AU, or hybrid force
-establish effective coordination with UNAMID (the joint UN and African Union (AU) hybrid operation in Darfur)
-have as its mission to create a secure environment for: the work of the UN police force, the return of internally displaced persons, the delivery of humanitarian aid, the free movement of humanitarian staff and the continuation of political dialogue
Background
The Council decided on 23 July of this year to set up an ESDP operation to eastern Chad and northern CAR. The operation would aim to stabilise the region, which has experienced a large influx of displaced persons from the neighbouring Darfur region of Sudan. The operation could involve up to 4000 troops, supporting the UN mission MINURCAT (French for: UN mission in the Central African Republic and Chad). Both the EU mission and MINURCAT have already received a one-year mandate from the UN Security Council this Tuesday, based on Chapter 7 of the UN Charter (which allows the use of force). The Council is set to approve a joint action on Friday of this week, allowing for a deployment by mid- to late-October. France, with a substantial presence in Chad already, is expected to provide the bulk of the troops for the operation.
