The Foreign Affairs Committee has taken note of Foreign Affairs EU High Representative Catherine Ashton's wish to reschedule the exchange of views with her nominee for EU ambassador to Japan, Mr Hans-Dietmar Schweisgut, which was to take place on Tuesday morning. The committee understands that Baroness Ashton wants to meet nominees EU ambassadors herself before they appear before Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee.
The Committee has also reaffirmed its willingness, as expressed in its letter to Baroness Ashton of 30 September, to discuss the format of these exchanges of views as provided in the declaration on political accountability, if that is considered to be more suitable in the case of a specific country.
Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee has begun organizing exchanges of views with nominee ambassadors, in order to impart to them Parliament's political priorities for the countries concerned.
In the chair: Gabriele ALBERTINI (EPP, IT)
