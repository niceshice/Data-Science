A recent blackout across Europe has put the focus on EU energy policy
The 4 November power outage, which plunged millions of Europeans into darkness was one of the key issues discussed in the opening session of the November Strasbourg plenary on Monday. Separately, the House agreed to postpone the debate and vote on the establishment of the "European Globalisation Adjustment Fund" - the aim of which was to help those made redundant by the effects of globalisation get back into work - to allow more discussions with ministers.
Commenting on the electricity black-out, Europe's Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs called for greater investment in electricity transmission systems and more importantly that such lines should not be overcharged. He also put forward proposals to set up a European grouping of transmission system operators that will look at solutions for the EU's energy needs, in particular network security standards.
1st ever report on Euro area
Also on the agenda Monday was the first report on the Euro area. MEPs want more openness on European Central Bank decision-making and stressed the urgency of implementing the Lisbon Strategy on economic reform. Equally MEPs called for the Commission's annual report to contain more practical proposals for improving the management of the 12 member Euro area.
TV: MEPs adopt new approach to product placement
Outside the plenary chamber, members of the Culture Committee backed a directive on audiovisual media with several amendments aimed at limiting product placement, new rules on advertising and measures against intolerance in TV adverts.
The amendments would forbid product placement in news, documentaries, children programmes and advisory programmes. However, it will be allowed to continue in films on TV, sports programmes and certain instances where the goods were supplied for free.
On advertising, the Committee wants only one ad break every 30 minutes for children's and news programmes and every 45 minutes for TV films, concerts, plays and operas.
The aim of updating the 1997 TV without frontiers directive is to take account of changes in technology like the switch from analogue to digital broadcasting. The reach of the legislation has been extended to include new media like WebTV and video on demand. The report will be voted on by the December Plenary.
