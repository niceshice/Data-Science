The European Parliament Bureau has decided to put forward a strategic plan to reduce the institution's carbon "footprint" by 30%, thus going beyond the EU undertaking to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20%. The Bureau welcomed an in-house study showing how the 30% reduction can be achieved, noting that Parliament's recent shift to the use of only "green electricity" in its three places of work has already reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 17%.
Members of the Bureau also welcomed information that the EP has recently been awarded the EMAS (Environmental Management Scheme) certification for its buildings in Luxemburg, so that it now has an EMAS certificate for all three places of work.
The European Parliament decided last year to cut its CO2 emissions by 30 % by 2020 and commissioned a carbon footprint study to this end. The study shows that it is possible to meet the 30% reduction target. A strategic plan with concrete measures based on the study will be put forward by the beginning of next year.
Various emission reduction strategies are envisaged in the study, e.g. changing behaviour (reducing needs), increasing energy efficiency, using renewable energy or offsetting emissions. The main potential reduction opportunities suggested would require action in the areas of energy use, IT and building infrastructure and mobility.
