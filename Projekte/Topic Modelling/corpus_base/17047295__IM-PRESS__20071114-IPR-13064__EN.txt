The European Parliament "expresses its solidarity with the legitimate protests" by thousands of Pakistanis, "condemns the violence of the police" against them, and "demands unequivocally that an end be put to the state of emergency" in the country. In a resolution adopted today in Strasbourg, MEPs demand the restoration of judicial independence and fundamental freedoms, and call on President Musharraf to "renounce his position as head of the army."
The Parliament's resolution "demands unequivocally that an end be put to the state of emergency and that the 1973 Constitution of Pakistan be re-implemented with immediate effect." It "expresses its solidarity with the legitimate protests by thousands of lawyers, civil society and human rights activists and eminent political leaders," and "condemns the violence of the police against the protesters and the large-scale arrests without charge or under terrorism charges without any factual basis."
Members demands that "judicial independence be restored," "that ordinances restricting the free coverage of political events be withdrawn," and calls for "the immediate release of all representatives of the bar associations who have been arrested after peaceful street protests." They reiterate their call on President Musharraf to "respect the verdict of the Supreme Court - once it is reinstated - on the constitutionality of his election as President," calling on him to "renounce his position as head of the army before taking his oath for a new presidential term and before the parliamentary dispensation for him to wear both civilian and military hats expires on 15 November 2007.
Free and fair elections
The resolution calls on the Government of Pakistan "to implement the necessary conditions to guarantee the holding of free, fair and transparent elections as scheduled," which the President had announced would be completed by 9 January, 2008. The House also demands that a completely neutral caretaker government be formed to oversee the polls, and that the election commission be reconstituted. In particular, MEPs call for "leaders of all political parties to be allowed to contest these elections, including former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who should be allowed to return to Pakistan and to participate actively in the election process."
The Parliament stresses that the credibility of any elections process will "depend on the release of all political prisoners," and "on an end being put to the disappearances of political opponents." MEPs consider that "freedom of speech, movement, association and assembly must be fully implemented and all restrictions on law-abiding political parties be removed, " in order for any meaningful election to take place in Pakistan.
The possibility of an EP observer delegation to monitor the elections "depends on the fulfilment of basic preconditions for holding free and fair elections by the Pakistani authorities," say MEPs, and call on the Commission to "carefully consider the sending of a further exploratory mission, in the event that martial law is lifted, in order to evaluate the viability of the deployment of a long-term EU-EOM [Electoral Observation Mission]"
