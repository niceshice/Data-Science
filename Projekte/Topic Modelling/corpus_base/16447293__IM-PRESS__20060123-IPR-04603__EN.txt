A delegation of MEPs is in Jerusalem starting work on their observation of the Palestinian legislative elections. The 27 MEPs, led by EP Vice-President Edward McMillan-Scott (EPP-ED, UK), are the largest group of elected representatives observing this election. They will be deployed in various voting districts across the West Bank and Gaza Strip to observe the electoral process.
Mr McMillan-Scott said:
"These are the first Palestinian legislative elections since 1996. There is a very strong desire here for a functioning democracy - despite the tensions between factions and despite the occupation and the deplorable Israeli attacks during an election, the Palestinian people have been determined to hold this vote. It is in everyone's interest for the results, whatever they may be, to come from a fair process – and we will respect the results. We very much hope this election live up to the standard set in the Presidential election a year ago."
Before election day, the MEPs are meeting election officials and candidates from all the main lists. The delegation will also be meeting leaders of other international observer missions, including former US President Jimmy Carter.
