Parliament and the Commission will launch their joint "transparency register" for lobbyists and other interest groups on Thursday 23 June. This new register, which merges the two institutions' existing ones, will mean that lobbyists need register only once. It will also provide a "one-stop shop" for citizens seeking information on lobbyists.
The transparency register will provide more information than its predecessors, such as how many people are involved in any activities relating to the register, and any EU funding or support received by the registrant. It will also set out procedures for handling complaints and sanctions. Registration in the joint register will not be mandatory, but MEPs have decided that all lobbyists wishing to enter Parliament's premises will have to register.
Vice-President Diana Wallis, who led Parliament's negotiating team on the issue, said: "By launching this joint register for interest representatives between the Commission and the Parliament, I hope that we will help to instill a more solid culture of transparency in Brussels. Up until now, there may have been some confusion. Now there can be none: one register, one place to sign up."
Ms Wallis added: "For all those who want to take part in the EU policy-making process, this register will also demonstrate that our institutions are working together. This is why I am thrilled that the Council has now announced its willingness to take steps in joining us."
A joint press conference of Vice-President Wallis and Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič will take place on Thursday 23 June at 13.00h in the Commission.
