Six years after the abduction of Ingrid Betancourt, more than 700 hostages are still being held by guerrilla organisations in Columbia, President of the European Parliament Hans-Gert PÖTTERING called for the immediate release of Ingrid Betancourt and her fellow hostages for humanitarian reasons.
Speaking on behalf of the European Parliament, President Pöttering expressed concern about the worrying state of health of many of the hostages and called for an international medical mission to be sent to Columbia immediately to address their medical needs.
The hostages, including French-Colombian Ingrid Betancourt, have been held captive by the left-wing Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrillas since February 2002.
In his speech President Pöttering also welcomed the endeavours being made by the Columbian President Alvaro URIBE to seek dialogue to try to find an agreement to release the hostages.
Marking the anniversary of the capture of the hostages, President Pöttering reiterated the European Parliament's solidarity with their families and highlighted that the eyes and thoughts of the international community and European Parliament are turned to the "human tragedy" of their situation.
The House responded with sustained applause.
