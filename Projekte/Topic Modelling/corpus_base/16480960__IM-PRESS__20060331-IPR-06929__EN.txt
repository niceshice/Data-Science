MEPs adopted an own-initiative report by Thierry CORNILLET (ALDE, FR) on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) in 2005.
Parliament welcomes the conclusion of the negotiations on amending the Cotonou Agreement, but regrets that the agreement reached at the Brussels Summit of 15 and 16 December 2005, bringing the amount allocated to the 10th European Development Fund (EDF) (2008-2013) to €22 682 million remains short of the initial proposals aimed at maintaining the same level of aid as under the 9th EDF.
MEPs support the request of the ACP-EU JPA, expressed at its 9th session in April 2005 in Bamako (Mali), that a suitable proportion of EDF appropriations should be used for the political education and training of parliamentarians and of political, economic and social leaders, in the interests of a lasting strengthening of good governance, the rule of law, democratic structures, and the interaction between government and opposition in pluralistic democracies based on free elections.
Parliament calls for greater transparency with regard to the progress and the substance of the negotiations on the economic partnership agreements as well as delivery of substantial assistance in line with President Barroso’s commitment, in Gleneagles, to provide EUR 1 billion in ‘aid for trade’
On sugar, the House notes that the EU package of compensation and restructuring measures for the EU sugar industry exceeds EUR 7 billion and urges that the 18 ACP signatories to the Sugar Protocol, many of whose economies depend almost entirely on sugar, receive timely and substantial financial support, which must be additional to existing commitments.
MEPs call the JPA members and the European co-secretariat to do everything they can to strengthen the role and the position of the JPA within the European Parliament.
The House congratulates the UK Presidency and the Scottish authorities on their excellent contribution to the 10th JPA in Edinburgh, particularly to the workshops on the following subjects:
- meeting the MDGs on health through research and development,
- protecting the environment: ecotourism and sustainable energy,
- fishing and fish processing: EU policies and standards
Finally, MEPs call on the Austrian Presidency and the Bureau of the European Parliament to make the necessary arrangements for the organisation of the 11th session in Vienna (Austria), from 17 to 22 June 2006, and of the 12th session in Bridgetown (Barbados), from 18 to 24 November 2006.
