Participants: Enrique BARÓN CRESPO (PES, ES) and Riccardo VENTRE (EPP-ED, IT) 09:00 19:00 Rome, Italy International Conference on "Beyond GDP" Measuring progress, wealth and the well-being of nations
Measuring progress, wealth and the well-being of nations are the topics that will be discussed at a high-level conference on 19-20 November organised by the Euorpean Commission, the European Parliament, the OECD, the Club of Rome and WWF. The aim of the conference is to move towards a better appreciation of what progress, wealth and well-being are, decide how they should be measured, and highlight the benefits of integrating them in decision-making. The Beyond GDP conference will be opened on the first day by the President of the Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso and on the second day by Hans-Gert Pöttering, President of the European Parliament.
Over the last two decades a number of alternative indicators have been designed to complement GDP (Gross Domestic Product) in measuring progress and the health of the economy. They introduce aspects not covered by GDP such as the long-term accumulation of wealth (natural, economic and social), the levels of life expectancy, literacy, and education and the negative impact of pollution and resource degradation.
The Beyond GDP conference is the launching pad for the political debate on the need to move beyond the principles of Gross Domestic Product. It will be held at the European Parliament building in Brussels. Some 600 participants from the economic, social and environmental sectors will be attending. Speakers include HE Chief Emeka Anyaoku (President, WWF), Ashok Khosla (Co-President, Club of Rome), and Pier Carlo Padoan (Deputy Secretary General, OECD).
