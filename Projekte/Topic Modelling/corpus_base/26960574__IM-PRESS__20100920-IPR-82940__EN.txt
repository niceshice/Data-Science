Redundant testing and certification rules that obstruct trade between the EU and Turkey should be removed, and Ankara should meet all its trade-related obligations, says a non-binding resolution approved by Parliament on Tuesday. MEPs also welcomed the outcome of Turkey's recent referendum on constitutional reform.
All unnecessary barriers to EU-Turkey trade, such as non-recognition of certification, duplicative testing, multiple inspections, technical regulations and standards, should be removed, say MEPs in a non-legislative report drafted by Metin Kazak (ALDE, BG) and approved on Tuesday by a show of hands.
Burdensome procedures
Parliament calls on Turkey to withdraw its "burdensome" import authorisation procedures, but also stresses that recurrent visa problems for Turkish businessmen and lorry drivers are "significantly restricting" their movement into the EU.
MEPs also noted that due to the EU-Turkey customs union, third countries that have free trade agreements with the EU get preferential access to the Turkish market, but Turkey's exports do not enjoy reciprocal access to their markets.
MEPs urge Turkey to cease discriminating foreign firms by granting a 15% price advantage to Turkish bidders for public procurement contracts.
Counterfeit products, including pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, are a major problem in EU-Turkey trade relations and reduce Turkey's attractiveness to foreign direct investors, they add.
MEPs also note that Turkey and the EU face similar energy supply challenges, and that the Nabucco gas pipeline project is important to EU energy security.
Parliament welcomes the outcome of the Turkish referendum in support of constitutional reform.
Implement the additional protocol in full
MEPs deplore Turkey's failure to implement the additional protocol to the EC-Turkey Association Agreement (which guarantees access to Turkish airports and harbours for all EU member states, including Cyprus). They call on Ankara to apply the protocol in full, without delay or discrimination, and stress that "failure to do so may further seriously affect the negotiating process" for EU accession.
EU-Turkey customs union
MEPs note that the EU-Turkey customs union, established in 1996, has helped bring about considerable market integration, especially in the field of the free movement of goods, and consider that the customs union agreement, which covers all industrial products and processed agricultural goods, could now be extended to cover other areas, such as services and public procurement.
Turkey is the EU’s seventh-largest trade partner and the EU is Turkey’s largest trade partner. In 2009, Turkey exported goods worth €33.6 billion to the EU, and imported goods worth €40.4 billion from it. Furthermore, 88% of foreign direct investment in Turkey comes from the EU.
