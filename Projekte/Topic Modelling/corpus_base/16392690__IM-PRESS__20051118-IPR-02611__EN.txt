Statement by President of European Parliament on decision to ban Secretary General of Reporters without Borders from entering Tunisia
"Just as the European Parliament prepares to award the Sakharov Prize 2005 (1) to Reporters without Borders in recognition of its campaigning efforts for freedom of the press around the world, Robert Ménard, secretary general of the organisation, is refused entry to Tunisia where he planned to attend the World Information Summit organised by the UN.
Violations such as this of the freedom of expression of NGOs and the media are unacceptable. I wish to reiterate, on behalf of the European Parliament, my grave concern (2) and call for respect for the fundamental values of human rights (3).
On the eve of the 10th anniversary of the Barcelona process, which seeks to promote respect for democracy, human rights, the rule of law and fundamental freedoms on both sides of the Mediterranean, it is essential that everyone undertakes firmly to keep to their commitments."
