Costa Rica President Óscar Arias is welcomed by EP President Pöttering Wednesday MEPs strongly backed a resolution calling on Russia to withdraw its troops from Georgia. They also debated new labels and warnings for hazardous substances to bring them into line with UN norms and the EU's sanctions policy. MEPs also called for a ban on cloning animals for food. The day also saw Costa Rica's president Óscar Rafael Arias Sánchez address the plenary.
Russia-Georgia crisis
A resolution calling on Russia to honour the cease-fire agreement and withdraw its troops from Georgia was adopted on Wednesday. It follows Monday's debate on the crisis by MEPs and the European summit, which also took place in Brussels.
Proper labelling of dangerous substances and mixtures
Better information about hazardous products we may use in our daily lives (such as paint) is just one recommendation contained in 3 reports on proposed legislation adopted Wednesday. MEPs want the use of labels, pictograms and words like "warning", and "danger" used more frequently to alert the public and industrial users.
The reports from parliament's Environment Committee aim to modify rules on chemicals labelling and to provide consistency between EU and UN legislation. The Italian MEP who put introduced the reports to plenary - Amalia Sartori (EPP-ED) - said the compromise reached "provides for a better consumer protection and will help EU companies to become more competitive".
EU sanctions policy debated
In the afternoon MEPs debated proposals for a more targeted sanctions policy, so that sanctions are directed against those responsible rather than punishing the people of a country who have little control over their rulers. French Green Hélène Flautre authored the non-legislative, own-initiative report and said, "it is essential to try all the conditions which make the sanctions effective...the aim must be to provoke a change of behaviour."
Some members also called for attacks on the environment to be subject to sanctions, while others pointed to the need to avoid double-standards and to achieve better evaluation. MEPs will vote on a resolution Thursday.
Costa Rican President calls for closer Central American-European links
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and President of Costa Rica Óscar Arias urged Europe to support Central America's efforts to build a peaceful and prosperous society. He noted that when Central America faced war and turmoil in the 1980's, Europe was close but now that peace has come a certain distance has developed. "We never imagined that in crossing the threshold of peace, we would enter the kingdom of oblivion," he told MEPs.
He went on to call for Europe and the wider world not to offer any solace to countries with warlike intentions: "The developed nations of the world must not support, with aid and resources, the actions of those who prefer to equip their soldiers rather than educate their children".
Other votes Wednesday
Resolution calling for a ban in the EU on the cloning of animals for food supply was adopted; also approved were reports on equality between men and women in Europe and gender stereotyped marketing as well as support for hydrogen cars.
