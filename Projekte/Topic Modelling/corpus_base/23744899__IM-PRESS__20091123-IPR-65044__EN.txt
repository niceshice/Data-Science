MEPs: immunity and statute
2009-11-24 - 13:10
Parliament has rejected a request to defend the immunity of Tobias Pflüger, a German former MEP who was sentenced to a fine on 2 March 2009 for insulting behaviour towards two police officers. On 15 April the state prosecutor applied to have the original sentence quashed and the punishment increased but on 21 July a Munich court (the Landgericht), as the court of last instance, halted the proceedings after a payment was made.
