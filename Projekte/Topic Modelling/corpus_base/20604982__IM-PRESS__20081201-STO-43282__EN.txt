MEPs want more money to fight HIV/AIDS You may see lots of people wearing red ribbons today. The reason: December 1, 2008, marks the 20th World AIDS day. In 2007, 33 million people were affected by HIV, with Africa hardest hit. Some 269,000 new EU cases were diagnosed between 1999-2006 and parliament wants a strategy on early diagnosis, testing and care, ensuring that access to testing remains free and anonymous.
The red ribbon is a symbol for drug prevention and for the fight against HIV/AIDS. Even though the global HIV epidemic is stabilising, those infected are still stigmatised, there is a lack of information and limited access to antiretroviral drugs especially in Africa.
One problem with aids is that official statistics disguise the real number of people infected, which is estimated to be three times the official rate in some countries.
In a resolution, MEPs call for money to be made available to back early diagnosis and care and to ensure accurate monitoring.
EU problems
In the EU, HIV is on the increase, bucking the global trend, but at the same time the number of diagnosed AIDS cases is dropping. Worryingly 11% of all new cases over the past 10 years have been in the under 25 age group and HIV has spread rapidly in Eastern Europe because of intravenous drug use.
MEPs call for an end to discrimination
MEPs are calling on EU countries to fight the stigma of HIV and AIDS by outlawing discrimination including travel restrictions and want more information and education campaigns on prevention, testing and treatment.
Some AIDS facts
