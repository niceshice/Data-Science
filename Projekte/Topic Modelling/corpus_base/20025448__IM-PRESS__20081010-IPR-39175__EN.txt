The President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering, has made a statement on the occasion of the European Day against Death Penalty on 10 October.
The EP President said:
"The European Day against the death penalty is the day on which we remember that the defence of human rights and the necessity of a justice system which is based on the respect of human rights and the dignity of the human being, is an essential part of our common values.
The European Parliament has for many years been campaigning for a worldwide abolition of the death penalty. The death penalty is in contradiction to the values on which the European Union is based. Therefore only countries in which the death penalty does not exist or which have abolished it, may become members of the European Union. This condemnation of the death penalty is also laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
The death penalty is a breach of fundamental human rights and failure to respect the dignity of the human being and the right to life. The European Parliament will fight against the death penalty under any circumstances everywhere in the world."
