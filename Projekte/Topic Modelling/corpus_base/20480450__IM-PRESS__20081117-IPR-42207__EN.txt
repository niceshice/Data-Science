In adopting a resolution on the EU response to the deteriorating situation in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the House calls on the UN Security Council, as a matter of urgency, to take all measures capable of genuinely preventing any further attacks on the civilian population of the eastern provinces of the DRC.
MEPs are extremely concerned at the increase in clashes in North Kivu and the consequences for the population of the east of the DRC and the region as a whole, particularly humanitarian consequences as a result of the recent offensive by the CNDP, displacing and killing large numbers of people in North Kivu.
The European Parliament expresses its deep outrage at the massacres, crimes against humanity and acts of sexual violence against women and girls in the eastern provinces of the DRC and calls on all relevant national and international authorities systematically to bring the perpetrators to justice.
The House urges Laurent Nkunda to respect his own declaration supporting the peace process for the east of the DRC after talks with the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the former President of the Republic of Olusegun Obasanjo. The House calls in this regard on the CNDP to rejoin the Amani peace process without delay. Parliament reaffirms its support for the Congolese authorities in the search for a political solution to the crisis and welcomes the plan put forward by the Congolese parliamentarians, which calls for a general mobilisation in favour of military, political and diplomatic dialogue.
MONUC - The Mission of the United Nations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
The Parliament reaffirms its support for MONUC, in the present dramatic circumstances in which, despite its shortcomings, its presence remains indispensable, and calls for every effort to be made to allow it to carry out its mandate in full and use the force of arms to protect those under threat; in this respect, calls on the Council, and in particular, Belgium, France, Italy and the United Kingdom, to play a leading role in ensuring that the United Nations Security Council supports MONUC by strengthening its operational capacities in terms of appropriate equipment and manpower .
Role of International Community
MEPs call on the African Union, the UN Security Council and key international players, including the EU, US and China, to increase pressure on all parties to push forward with the peace process, finding a solution to the problem of control of the mineral resources and aiming for a broad peace agreement rather than only a ceasefire, and further calls on these actors to put pressure on Rwanda and Uganda to give a commitment to end the free movement and operations of Nkunda's troops on their territory.
Minerals
MEPs call on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that European companies do not trade in, handle or import products derived from minerals that have been sourced in a manner that benefits armed groups in the DRC, and hold accountable any that persist in such practices.
The House calls for zero tolerance of the sexual violence against girls and women which is used as a weapon of war and for severe criminal penalties to be imposed on the perpetrators of these crimes. MEPs draw attention to the importance of access to health services in conflict situations and refugee camps, especially in the light of the recent outbreaks of cholera, whooping cough and measles.
MEPs call on the Council to work with international and regional mediators to address the economic agendas of the warring parties explicitly in the context of current mediation efforts and call on the Council and Commission to closely follow the humanitarian and security situation in the east of the DRC, with a view to determining in more detail the different lines of action that may be envisaged in the light of circumstances.
