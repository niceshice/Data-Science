The chair of Parliament's Environment Committee, Karl-Heinz Florenz (EPP-ED, DE), announced on Wednesday that a planned visit by MEPs to Turkey had been cancelled as a result of a decision by the Turkish authorities. The delegation of MEPs was due to go to the country from 4 to 6 October to evaluate progress made in the field of the environment, health and food safety. Several MEPs said they deplored Ankara's attitude.
Mr Florenz explained that the Turkish authorities had asked for the mission to be postponed because they objected to the list of MEPs due to take part. In particular, Ankara objects to the presence of Marios Matsakis (ALDE, CY), whom they accuse of anti-Turkish propaganda. "This reaction by Turkey is unacceptable", said the chair of the Environment Committee. He added that MEPs were "the only ones entitled to choose their missions".
Mr Florenz's position was fully backed by members of the committee and several voiced a wish for the matter to be raised in plenary. Some members stressed the need to respond firmly, including John Bowis (EPP-ED, UK), Chris Davies (ALDE, UK) and Satu Hassi (Greens/EFA, FI), while others simply expressed disappointment, such as Avril Doyle (EPP-ED, IE), Philip Bushill-Matthews (EPP-ED, UK) and Guido Sacconi (PES, IT).
The delegation's visit has therefore been postponed indefinitely. The President of Parliament, Josep Borrell, has been officially informed and the matter could be brought up at a meeting of the Conference of Committee Chairs.
