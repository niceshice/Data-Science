Monday: MEPs will discuss new recycling targets Legislation on waste recycling and water quality is up for debate when MEPs meet Monday evening in Strasbourg. If Members back a compromise agreement with EU environment ministers tougher recycling and water quality standards will be in place by 2020 and 2018 respectively. Re-using 50% of all glass, paper and metal is one target contained in the draft legislation. By chance this week is also "Green week" in the EP in Strasbourg.
MEPs want 50% recycling targets
Increased emphasis on waste prevention is the hallmark of UK Conservative Caroline Jackson's report on the waste framework directive. With Europe producing 1.8 billion tonnes of waste annually the need to increase recycling targets has won cross-party approval.
In particular there are new targets for the reuse and recycling of waste. If it becomes law, 50% of all paper, metal, glass and similar items from houses must be recycled, as opposed to 27% now. There is also a 70% target for recycling non-hazardous construction and demolition waste.
Another key aspect of proposed law and a crucial aim of MEPs on the Environment committee is the reduction in the amount of landfill and incineration. Members also back proposals to create a hierarchy of waste, namely prevention, re-use, recycling, other recovery operations and, as a last resort, safe and environmentally sound disposal to prevent and reduce waste production.
Finally, the obligation to prioritise waste and for EU members to develop waste management plans is also included in the draft directive. Speaking about the compromise measures ahead of Monday's debate, Ms Jackson said, "We have given real meaning to the Commission's desire to create a recycling society".
33 water pollutants face new quality standards
MEPs look set to back new rules setting tough Europe-wide quality standards for 33 pollutants - mainly pesticides and heavy metals - likely to be found in rivers, lakes and coastal areas. French Liberal Anne Laperrouze's report on the "environmental quality standards for water" directive calls on all EU countries to "make progress towards compliance" with these standards by 2018. This is the final piece of legislation needed to support the Water Framework Directive.
