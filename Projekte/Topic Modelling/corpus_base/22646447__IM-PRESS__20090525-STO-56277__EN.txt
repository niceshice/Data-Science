"The change of generations " by Daniel Andrei Â©Daniel Andrei/www.andreidanielart.blogspot.com Concern about young people not voting and the need for parents to tell children the importance of voting lay behind this month's guest photograph. "The change of generations" by Romanian photographer Daniel Andrei from Constanta on the Black Sea was chosen from scores of entries on the theme "on the way to vote". It was taken in the Sibiu which was the European capital of Culture in 2007. Thanks to all of you who entered - a full gallery can be found on the flickr account below.
Speaking about the photo, Daniel, who is a student of law and public administration at Ovidius University, said: "As parents we have the duty of teaching our children about the importance of voting. Do young people go to vote? Unfortunately, nowadays, youngsters do not have the spirit of voting."
He also said he was concerned about "low levels of participation in elections among younger members of the electorate".
