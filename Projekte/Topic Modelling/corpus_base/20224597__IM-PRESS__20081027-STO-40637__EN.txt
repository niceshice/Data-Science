It was part of the annual "Youth Media Days" from 15-17 October that aims to help young journalists discover their trade and meet other reporters from different countries.
" Brussels at work"
The journalists were split up into 16 different workshops, where they produced radio interviews, online and print magazines, photo reports and TV shows.
The price of food, immigration, European elections and the freedom of the press were among the topics considered.
One such contribution was from Anna Morawiec of Poland. The 22-year old and her group shot a photo series entitled "Brussels at work" intended to show the many faceted faces of the European Institutions
She explained that "we want to show that EP work is more than just politicians' work, but involves lots of other people – including the cleaning-lady!"
The emphasis was very much on creating a media product to take away. Cypriot journalist Marios Psaras and his group produced a webTV show on the upcoming US elections. He commented that "the teamwork functions impressively and everything is really well-organised".
Views from MEPs - "we need your criticism"
Opening the event Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering stressed that the young journalists represented the future of the media: "We need your criticism, your commitment and your enthusiasm" he told them.
Spanish MEP Alejo Vidal-Quadras is a Vice-president of the parliament and in charge of its communication policy. At the opening of the event he called on MEPs and journalists to meet each other halfway with "mutual respect", but to keep a certain distance: "One must not forget that we do not play in the same team" he said.
The head of parliament's Communication Directorate Francesca Ratti said the EU needs "simple, direct and transparent communication” with its citizens.
The opening session also saw an opportunity for the young journalists to put their questions to a small group of MEPs in a panel discussion.
Europe "is still parted"
Austrian MEP Othmar Karas of the EPP-ED group put it down to a question of mentality: "in many people’s heads - Europe is still parted" he said. The leader of the Greens Monica Frassoni said that Europe faced the challenge of ensuring "the greatest well-being for the greatest number of people".
The Director of the European Journalism Centre Wilfried Rütten felt that the role of a journalist is changing with more interaction needed from the readers. He also said reporters "should do more than just deliver messages from politicians and lobbyists."
There was a strong feeling of a common bond during the event. Young journalist Dominika Peterova from Slovakia said after the event: "We’re all equal. There is no issue of where people are from." Frieda Brepoels of the EPP-ED group said: "This event goes beyond grey European theory – this is Europe alive!"
Competition for the event was tough with over 1,700 people applying to attend. At the end of the event all of the workshops presented their work at a social evening in "Claridges" bar in Brussels.
The contributions were assessed by each other and a jury of journalists and MEPs.
