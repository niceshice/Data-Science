Austria will have to steer a difficult course through negotiations with the European Parliament over the future funding of the EU, now it has taken over the presidency of the Union. The country has said it will focus on boosting employment and economic growth during its 6-month EU presidency, but it will also have to win agreement on the budget deal approved by heads of state in December, which has been criticised by most of the political groups.
The Parliament will seek to have the EU budget increased in the areas it sees as pivotal for the future of Europe. It wants increased spending on research and development and is firmly against any cuts in spending on education and culture. Austria aims to reach an accord by March.
Austria has said that it wants strong cooperation with the Parliament and other EU countries to "enhance overall effectiveness and continuity" and has said that relations with the Parliament will play a "key role" during the presidency, which began January 1. A group of MEPs met with Austrian ministers in Vienna on December 19 to discuss ways of increasing cooperation between the Parliament and presidency.
Some of the items on the agenda over the next 6 months
The country aims to use its chairmanship of the EU to boost the "Lisbon Strategy" which is supposed to rejuvenate Europe's economy by 2010. Other key objectives on the Austrian agenda will be developing the "specifically European social model" and efforts to "rebuild confidence in the European project among EU citizens."
Other issues include workers in transition: the transitional period for introducing freedom of movement for workers from the newest EU countries in some of the "old" EU members will be reviewed. The countries concerned must declare by May 1 if they wish to continue to control access to their labour markets for a further three years.
The Working Time Directive: the Austrians have said that they will "endeavour to conclude negotiations" in 2006, which will be the "European year of workers' mobility." Austria will also continue the focus on climate change, which was a key point under the UK presidency.
EU Presidency
Each EU country holds the Presidency of the Council of ministers for six months on a rotational basis, following a predetermined order. Large and small countries take part on equal terms. Austria follows the UK, which held the Presidency between June and December 2005, and it will be followed by Finland in the second part of 2006. Austria held the Presidency during the second half of 1998 and will hold it again in the first half of 2019.
