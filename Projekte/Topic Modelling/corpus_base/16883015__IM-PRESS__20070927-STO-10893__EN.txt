No clear result
Ukraine's elections on Sunday attracted around 63% of the population and were mostly in line with international standards, according to the European Parliament and other parliamentary delegations observing the elections. Exit polls show that the race is very tight and with no party dominating, the EP delegation stressed the need for cooperation among the different political forces.
According to independent exit polls in the Ukrainian media the results are as follows: Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych's Party of Regions has 35%, Yulia Tymoshenko's "Tymoshenko Block" 31%, President Viktor Yushchenko's Our Ukraine/Self Defence Block has 14% and the Communist Party 5%.
Results to trust?
The elections are seen as mainly in line with international standards, which could help create a stable environment for building a new government. However, the head of the EP delegation Adrian Severin said: "The results show that the society is dramatically split therefore cooperation between majority and opposition is extremely important to avoid a new crisis."
He encouraged a constructive post­-electoral approach and urged the main political parties to recognize the outcome of the elections and to agree to a national political agenda.
"E-day"
The 14 MEPs were deployed to different regions and visited a number polling stations to check voting conditions. Mr Severin visited the House of Trade Unions where he saw President Yushchenko vote, Kiev's Music Academy and even a remand prison - prisoners have the right to vote in Ukraine. He met Ukrainian ombudsman Nina Karpachova there who explained the voting system in detention centres.
Commenting on polling, Mr Severin said the "atmosphere was relaxed and de-dramatized...good cooperation between different observers and voting committees"
However, there were a few problems. Laima Andrikienė, a Lithuanian member of the EPP-ED group, noted that a chair of a voting commission was not aware that the polling station was open, while German Green Milan Horáček reported some language problems in Crimea, where many elderly residents speak Russian, rather than Ukrainian, and had problems understanding the voting instructions. Polish liberal Grażyna Staniszewska expressed concern over the political neutrality of cars driving around encouraging citizens to vote in Donetsk.
In addition, some non-governmental monitoring organisations reported that voting lists might not be completely reliable. They said Ukrainian citizens could be missing from official voting lists, while reports from some towns had deceased voters on the lists.
President had predicted tight result
Mr Severin and the heads of 3 other parliamentary delegations met President Yushchenko ahead of the election. The President predicted a tight result and said that cooperation between the major political forces would be essential. He said it was a good sign that the tone of the campaigns had been constructive.
Final results are expected on 15 October.
