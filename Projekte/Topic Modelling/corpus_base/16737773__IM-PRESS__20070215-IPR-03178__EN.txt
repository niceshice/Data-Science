In a joint resolution adopted by MEPs, the EP calls on the United Nations, even in the absence of consent or agreement from the Sudanese Government, to clearly set a date for deployment of a United-Nations-supported peacekeeping force to secure humanitarian aid corridors. A no-fly zone over the region and sanctions are proposed while China's role in Darfur is criticised.
The resolution also calls on the governments of the Member States of the EU, the Council and the Commission to assume their responsibilities and make every possible effort to protect the people of Darfur from a humanitarian disaster. MEPs call on the international community, including the EU Member States, to make equipment available in the region for the enforcement of the no-fly zone over Darfur - a region the Sudanese Government has been bombing.
Another concern for the House is China who should cease to export arms to Sudan and to stop blocking decisions on targeted sanctions in the UN Security Council. The European Parliament is also in favour of targeted economic sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes and threatens to have an embargo on oil.
Some of the authors of the resolution - Philippe Morillon (ALDE, FR), Simon Coveney (EPP-ED, IE), Ana Gomes (PES, PT) and Jean Lambert (Greens/EFA, UK) underlined during a press conference on Wednesday 14 February that the dramatic deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Darfur sparked the further mobilisation of the European Parliament.
The absence of the Council of Ministers was heavily criticised by some MEPs during the debate. They also criticised the watered-down conclusions of the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) meeting of 12 February. (See link below)
