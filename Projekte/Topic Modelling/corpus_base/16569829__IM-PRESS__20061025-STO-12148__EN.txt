Woman immigrants often suffer discrimination on race and gender
Tuesday's plenary opened with leading MEPs marking the 50th anniversary of the Hungarian uprising. Today MEPs hear from Hungary's President ahead of a resolution on the uprising. The plight of immigrant women was also the subject of a report, as was one on the environmental "LIFE+" programme - with members pushing for greater European coordination. Support for Europe's TV and film industry and help for cultural cooperation were also on the agenda.
Women's immigration: action against double discrimination
With 54% of all immigrants into the EU being women, a report approved Tuesday by MEPs was timely. The report highlighted the reasons women migrate - either for better jobs, as refugees, seeking asylum or wanting to be reunited with family members. It says that they often suffer "double discrimination" due to sexism and racism. Some of the proposed measures include: priority access to language and education, protection from enslavement, access to medical care, legal aid and education for children. The report was drafted by Greek People's Party member Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou.
Hungary '56 - half a century on
The evocative images of Budapest 1956 came to Parliament's hemicycle chamber Tuesday with tributes to those who took part in the uprising. President Borrell recounted hearing of it as a boy and said it was a formative experience for him. Hans-Gert Poettering of the European People's Party said those who took part were "defending the values and dignity" of Europe and that having Hungarian MEPs showed how far Europe had come. Martin Schulz of the Socialist group drew parallels between the 1956 Budapest uprising and the 1957 Rome Treaty founding the European Community. Both embodied the "spirit of freedom and cooperation between peoples", he said. Former anti-Soviet dissident Bronisław Geremek - now a Liberal MEP, described the "silence and impotence" of other European countries in 1956 as a "lesson for us now". Daniel Cohn-Bendit for the Greens warned that "democracy can never be guaranteed; only if we fight can we retain it".
Hungarian President László Sólyom will address the hemicycle today at noon - while a resolution on Thursday is likely to salute the "self sacrifice" of the heroes of '56.
Breathe cleaner air with LIFE+
The purpose of the environmental LIFE+ programme is to combat climate change, improve the environment and promote the use of sustainable resources. The programme will ensure €1.9 billion over the next seven years for these, and other, types of projects. EU environment ministers originally wanted 80% of the Life budget decentralised to them. However, MEPs rejected this - fearing that the benefits of a coordinated European response could be lost as countries distributed the funding as they desired. During the Monday evening debate which proceeded yesterday's vote, Marie Anne Isler-Beguin, the French Green MEP who drafted the report, said it LIFE+ will influence EU policies "in the cleaning of the air and ground, and stopping the degradation of biodiversity". A conciliation meeting between the Parliament and the Council of Ministers is now the next step.
Help for Europe's TV, Film industry, cultural cooperation
Two European cultural initiatives were also supported by MEPs. The "MEDIA" programme aims to support the Europe's TV and cinema industries. "Trainspotting" and "Bend it like Beckham" are among the films that have benefited from the scheme. Currently 90% of non-national European films have been supported by the MEDIA programme.
"Culture 2007-2013" seeks to promote the mobility of workers active in the field of culture, to encourage the cross-border circulation of works of art and of "culturally significant objectives".
Both were approved at the second reading.
