A minute's silence for the victims of the bus accident in Switzerland Last night 28 people, including 22 children, died in a tragic road accident in Switzerland. The European Parliament observed a minute's silence for the victims on Wednesday afternoon. "I extend our deepest sympathy to the families of the victims and to all those affected by this disaster," said EP President Martin Schulz.
A Belgian coach carrying children on their way back from holiday was involved in a terrible crash last night in Switzerland. "Everyone of us in this House - if we have children or if we remember our own relationship with our parents - can certainly comprehend what it means to send your children on a holiday trip and see coffins come home," said Mr Schulz before asking members to observe a minute's silence.
