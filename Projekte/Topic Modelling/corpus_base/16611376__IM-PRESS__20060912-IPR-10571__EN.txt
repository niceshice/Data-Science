On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in New York and Washington, Josep Borrell, President of the European Parliament, made the following statement: "On September 11th, the whole world was deeply shocked by these cruel acts which had struck innocent civilians in such a cowardly manner".
"I would like to recall that on 12 September 2001, the European Parliament, at an urgent meeting, had conveyed to the American people its full and wholehearted support.
Today, I once again wish to assure the families of the victims and those close to them that we will continue to share their profound grief.
I also wish to pay tribute again to the selfless and heroic attitude of the rescuers, police officers and firemen who bravely worked at Ground Zero on 11 September and the following days.
Five years on, terrorism remains a scourge which transcends all borders. We must therefore continue to fight it alongside our neighbours and partners while ensuring a balance between measures to improve the safety of the general public and rigorous respect for the basic rights of each citizen.
We will never allow these atrocities to triumph over our values of peace, freedom and democracy."
