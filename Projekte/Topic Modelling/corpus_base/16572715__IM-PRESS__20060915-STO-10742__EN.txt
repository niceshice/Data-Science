New Fundamental Rights Agency for 2007
Parliament's Civil Liberties committee has strongly backed the establishment of a new "fundamental rights" agency for the EU to be established in Vienna. However, it wants the scope of the Agency's mandate to be extended to include not just the current 25 members, but also those seeking to join the Union and countries with which the EU has "stabilisation or association agreements".
The chief role of the Agency will be to ensure that the values enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights are respected. The Charter is divided into six chapters: Dignity, Freedom, Solidarity, Equality, Citizenship and Justice. It covers everything from the right to equal pay for men and women to the right to access health care and medical treatment.
The practical task of staff in Vienna will be to monitor the human rights situation in the EU, offer advice on improvements, raise awareness of the issues among the public and work closely with civil society. It will supersede the "European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia" already based in the Austrian capital.
Agency to be a "reference point" on human rights
Following the adoption of the report supporting the Agency on 13 September, Kinga GÃ¡l, a Hungarian member of the European Peoples' Party who drafted the report, said that "the Agency is especially important since the ratification of the EU Constitution [which incorporates the Charter], is presently on hold. The EU should take immediate steps in institutionalising the protection of citizens' fundamental rights and freedoms". She said she hoped the Agency would in future "be the reference point when discussing human rights..."
A key issue for members of the Civil Liberties committee is the Agency's scope regarding cooperation between governments on policing, justice and counter-terrorism issues. This would take it into the whole issue of data protection for airline passengers - and whether such data should be made available to the US government to fight terrorism.
MEPs also want Parliament to have greater consultation on the five-year work plan for the Agency and who will fill the post of Director.
Discussions between EU governments, the European Commission and the Parliament should determine the final scope of the Agency in coming weeks. If agreement is reached, Parliament may vote on the report in its plenary session on 11-12 October, thus allowing it to start work from January 2007.
