Round-up: Ashton, Lewandowski, Piebalgs & Rehn hearings Monday In a day of Q&amp;A in Brussels, candidates for the EU's top foreign policy, economics, budget and development Commissioner posts were quizzed by MEPs on their priorities. Catherine Ashton promised to give credibility to the EU's dealings with the world whilst Mr Rehn said growth and jobs would be a priority. Budget nominee Janusz Lewandowski said EU budget policy could focus on the environment or climate change. Development nominee Andris Piebalgs pledged that fighting poverty would remain key.
Ashton pledges credibility to EU foreign policy
"Afghanistan and Pakistan, Iran, the Middle East, Somalia and Yemen are clearly among some of the top priorities" according to the EU's foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton in her confirmation hearing Monday. She said the EU was now able to assume a "stronger, more credible role in the world".
Questioned on the scope of the new European External Action Service (EEAS) which she is tasked with setting up, she said "it would be subject to full scrutiny by Parliament". On Russia she said that the EU needed a strong relationship with Moscow and on energy, she advocated "diversification of sources of supply".
In reply to questions on Afghanistan and the EU's strategy and military presence in Afghanistan, she replied that the Union needs to "provide concrete results about what we do for the citizens of Afghanistan". On the crisis in the Middle East she said that she would be meeting with US and Quartet peace envoys Senator George Mitchell and Tony Blair on Tuesday (12 January) to discuss the way forward.
Lewandowski: "Europe is not ready for a European tax"
The idea of an EU tax, a review and possible prolongation of EU's multi-annual budget and irregularities in spending of EU funds were some of the key questions put to Polish Budgets Commissioner-designate, Janusz Lewandowski, by the Budget and Budgetary Control committees.
"Europe is not ready for a European tax,” said Mr Lewandowski. He admitted however, that he was not against it and was open to new budget financing ideas like a "Tobin tax" on financial transactions. He also said Europe needed a "key orientation" for the coming budget period and that this could be the environment or climate change. He noted that Key budget control problems were cohesion and external policy.
Piebalgs: EU must be "champion" of development aid
Andris Piebalgs, the Latvian Commissioner-designate for Development fielded questions on the key aim of development policy, fighting poverty, as well as aid effectiveness, the impact of climate change on developing countries and co-ordination among EU policy makers.
Mr Piebalgs stressed the need "to maintain the EU's role as a champion of the developing world" and agreed that "it would be wrong to give money with one hand and take it away with another policy." He also noted that climate change and poverty eradication should be funded separately.
He said he was looking forward to a fruitful cooperation with High Representative Ashton and promised to be available for the EP “seven days out of seven and 24 hours out of 24”.
Rehn - Stability and Growth pact must be adhered to
An exit strategy to the current crisis and healthier public finances are what Finnish Economic Affairs Commissioner-designate, Olli Rehn, called for in his hearing with MEPs on Monday. He said that he intended to "provide future perspectives for jobs and prosperity, growth and stability".
Many MEPs raised the issue of improved co-ordination and supervision. Mr Rehn said he would use Lisbon Treaty tools to step up co-ordination in the euro area and deepen preventive surveillance between countries.
Asked about the suitability of the euro zones "Stability and Growth Pact" and how it could be strengthened, Mr Rehn reiterated that the Pact is the right mechanism to return to stability. It should ensure that Member States conform to the rules. He added that Greece will be the first test for these mechanisms.
On the Commission's ambitious "2020" strategy Mr Rehn said in response to MEPs' questions that the state must be there to facilitate innovation, investment in education and the take-up of green technologies, all key elements in the EU 2020 strategy.
