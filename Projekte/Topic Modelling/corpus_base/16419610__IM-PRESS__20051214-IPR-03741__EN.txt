Given the growth in world energy demand and the decline in resources, there is an increasing need to save energy and use it more efficiently. A step in the right direction has been taken when Parliament confirmed an agreement with Council on a directive aiming to encourage Member States to save energy and use it more efficiently when it is sold to private households or the public sector.
" The directive must and can kick off a real energy efficiency offensive in the Member States ," said Parliament's rapporteur Mechtild ROTHE (PES, DE) in the debate before Parliament's second reading vote. The report was adopted with 582 votes in favour, 13 against with 18 abstentions.
Parliament adopted 49 compromise amendments which are the result of negotiations between the rapporteur, shadow rapporteurs and the Council. The Directive will therefore enter in force soon.
This directive, which aims to encourage energy saving, covers the great majority of forms of energy sold to end users: electricity, gas, heating oil and transport fuels. It was tabled as part of the Commission's December 2003 energy package.
The compromise adopted asks Member States to save 9% of the energy supplied to end users in the nine years following the directive's entry into force. Members may set themselves a higher target. The Council had been arguing for a 6% reduction over six years. Some of the MEPs regretted that the goals were not binding, but merely indicative, in accordance with Member States' wishes. Nevertheless, the Member States will have to adopt three multi-annual Energy Efficiency Action Plans. In the first, to be submitted to the Commission no later than 30.6.2007, an intermediate goal for the third year must be set. In all three plans (the second to be submitted until 30.6.2011, the third until 30.6.2014), Member States must describe the energy efficiency measures planned to reach the targets.
Member States will have a period of two years to transpose the directive into national law with the exception of the first EEAP which has to be submitted until 30.6.2007 and which will be reviewed by the Commission before 1.1.2008.
Another positive point for Parliament is that the public sector will have to set an example. Member States are invited to develop guidance aiming to include energy efficiency as a criterion for public procurement processes. More information will be provided to consumers on energy end use efficiency and they will receive detailed and regular statements on their energy consumption.
For Commissioner PIEBALGS , " energy efficiency is one of the main priorities of this Commission. That will remain so throughout our mandate period. This new directive is expected to be a valuable tool for achieving that goal. "
Background:
Energy efficiency and energy savings have become one of the most important energy sources. According to studies, the total energy end-use consumption in the European Union could be reduced by 20% to 30 % without reducing comfort or standards of living. Energy savings of 1% per year could halve CO2 emissions and enable the EU to meet the Kyoto objective of reducing emissions in the EU by 8% over the period 2008-2012.
