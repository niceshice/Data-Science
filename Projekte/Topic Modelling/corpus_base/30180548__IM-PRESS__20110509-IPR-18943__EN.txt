The commemoration of May 9th as Europe Day, the EU's new status at the United Nations, the upcoming International Day against Homophobia on May 17th and the EP's condemnation of an execution in Gaza were the issues highlighted by Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek at the opening of this week's plenary session in Strasbourg.
Every year, May 9th is Europe Day and today is the 61st anniversary of the Schuman Declaration, which launched what has become the European Union, noted President Buzek, who had just returned from events held in Florence to mark the occasion.
Moreover, "the EU is now a fully-fledged member of the international community", added the President, since on 3rd May the United Nations agreed that the European Union would enjoy speaking rights at the UN General Assembly. "We must continue to speak to the world with one voice", particularly in view of events such as those in north Africa, Syria and Bahrain, stressed Mr Buzek.
Another day highlighted by the President was 17th May, which is International Day against Homophobia. Under the treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the EU is committed to rooting out homophobia, he emphasised.
Next, Mr Buzek condemned, in the name of the European Parliament, the execution by a military court in Gaza of an individual for collaborating with Israel.
The President then welcomed three new MEPs: Mojca Kleva (S&D, SL), replacing Zoran Thaler, Phil Prendergast (S&D, IE), replacing Alan Kelly, and Sampo Terho (EFD, FI), replacing Timo Soini. These Members will all take their seats subject to verification of their credentials.
The House also confirmed the mandate of new French MEP Brice Hortefeux (EPP, FR) replacing Catherine Souillie.
Agenda changes
Two agenda changes were approved by the House.
The order of the first two items on Monday's agenda was reversed, with the oral questions on the European fisheries sector crisis due to the rise in oil prices switched ahead of the debate on radio spectrum policy.
The second debate on Wednesday morning with Catherine Ashton, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security, was expanded in scope and will now be on the situation in Syria and in Camp Ashraf and the Coptic Christian Community in Egypt.
