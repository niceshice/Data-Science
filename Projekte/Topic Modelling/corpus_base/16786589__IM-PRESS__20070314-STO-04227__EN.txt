The bad side of business people want to move away from
In the past the role of business was to primarily create jobs and profits. However, they are increasingly being asked to be socially responsible and serve the society in which it is based. This mantra is called "Corporate Social Responsibility" (CSR) and last week MEPs voted to back a report calling for its practices to be included into EU policies. It also wants a type of mandatory "environmental audit" that would mean businesses had to report on the environmental impact of their operation.
CSR - ethical business or window dressing?
Corporate social responsibilty can best be described as businesses taking more account of the wider environment in which they operate. This means ensuring its workers and their families are well cared for, consulting members of the local community and NGOs before taking decisions and not investing in unethical products.
Nowadays international companies who sell their goods around the world go out of their way to show their CSR credentials. Many cynics dismiss it as a cynical window dressing to hide their real intentions - although allegations of using child labour against a certain sports company had a dramatic impact on their sales. Image is all and companies want to show their good intentions.
Making CSR concrete
The report - drafted by British Socialist MEP Richard Howitt - makes a number of recommendations for expanding CSR. These include:
identifying good practice and publicising success stories
include CSR principles in all EU policies and programmes
introduce mandatory environmental and social reporting
ensuring that EU countries with operations abroad uphold the highest standards on the International Labour Organisation
creating a European wide ombudsman to undertake enquiries on CSR issues.
History of CSR
In 1999 Parliament adopted a resolution on the issue calling for a binding code of conduct to govern EU companies' environmental, labour and human rights compliance worldwide.
Last year it organised a a public hearing on "Corporate Social Responsibility - is there a European approach?". Also that year the European Commission called on companies to make Europe a "pole of excellence" for CSR.
