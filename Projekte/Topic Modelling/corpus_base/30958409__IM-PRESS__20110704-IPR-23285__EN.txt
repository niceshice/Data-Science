Parliament decides against new climate policy resolution
Environment
Plenary sittings
2011-07-05 - 17:04
A majority of MEPs, led by rapporteur Bas Eickhout (Greens/EFA, NL), voted on Tuesday against the adoption of a draft resolution on EU climate policy. An amendment had been narrowly adopted to support a conditional 30% greenhouse gas reductions target, rather than the unilateral step to 30% cuts previously recommended by Parliament.
In the final vote, there were 258 votes in favour of adopting the amended resolution, 347 against and 63 abstentions.
Parliament's latest adopted position on climate policy therefore remains the resolution voted in November 2010, which recommended an unconditional 30% greenhouse gas reduction target (by 2020 based on 1990 levels).
Procedure: Non-legislative resolution
