Women and elections Some people believe that politics is dominated by men. Do you agree with this statement? 78% of British women agree totally + somewhat according to a Eurobarometer Flash survey presented in the EP on opinions and expectations of European elections. Most women want the next European Parliament to guarantee equal pay for equal work, promote day care facilities for children, include child-minding years as pensionable years and combat violence towards women.
If we should increase the proportion of women MEPs what would be the most effective way, according to Brits, 65 % think by encouraging women to participate in politics, whereas the EU average is 53 %.
In the domain of gender equality in family life, which of the following areas should be prioritized by the next European Parliament? 33 % of British respondents said that provision of sufficient day care facilities for children was the most important and the least relevant option was securing a minimal length of parental leave with 11 %.
1284 women were surveyed in the UK and 35 109 in the EU 27. European elections take place in the UK on 4 June 2009.
