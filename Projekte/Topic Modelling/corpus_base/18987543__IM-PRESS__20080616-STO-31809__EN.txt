As oil prices climb fishermen are under pressure The closing day of the June plenary session saw MEPs back a report calling for a European charter of rights for gas and electricity consumers. The right to change supplier free is one demand. A resolution calling for more state aid to help the fishing industry in the face of high fuel costs was also supported by MEPs. Plans to develop "intelligent" cars and better roads were two measures also supported by Members. Debates on human rights in Burma, Somalia and Iran rounded off the session.
Energy Consumers must have charter of rights say MEPs
In a week that has seen Europe's energy market under the spotlight with MEPs backing liberalisation and greater competition, Thursday saw Members vote to support the creation of a "European Charter on the Rights of Energy Consumers". In backing a report by Belgian Socialist MEP Mia de Vits, the House wants people to be able to change gas or electricity supplier free of charge, be billed for only the energy they use and have clearer energy bills to make price comparison more straightforward. Free price information and disconnection being the last resort are among the measures backed by MEPs Thursday.
A lifeline to Europe's fishermen
As oil prices hover around 140 dollar a barrel then one industry that is really feeling the financial pain is Europe's fishermen. In a resolution adopted by a large majority MEPs called for extra financial aid to be given to them. In particular it wants the European Commission to reconsider it rules of state aid (outlawed by EU law) and allow a maximum of 100,000 euros of aid per boat rather than by fishing company. At present this ceiling of possible aid for fishing companies only. MEPs also want financial encouragement given to fishermen to reduce CO2 emissions over the next 7 years- based on the current price of â‚¬ 25 per ton of CO2.
Are we close to the first intelligent car?
Parliament debated the "First Intelligent Car" report which says that such cars " reduce congestion, pollution and the number and seriousness of road accidents". It also welcomes negotiations on the inclusion of "eCall" in all new cars from 2010 (eCall automatically calls emergency services in the event of an accident). Several MEPs stated that these technologies should be affordable for everyone. The rapporteur told the house that yearly over 41,000 European are killed in road accidents and that this technology can help save lives. There was also concern among the MEPs that intelligent technologies may lead to drivers getting a false sense of safety.
Also on road safety MEPs adopted a directive that aims to improve road safety across the European Union. Assessing the impact on safety of new road building, better road signs and parking areas on main roads for people to rest are all suggested. German MEP Helmuth Markov (GUE/NGL) was parliament's rapporteur.
Human rights in Burma, Somalia and Iran
In its traditional end of session debate on human rights around the world the situation in Burma, Somalia and Iran were debated. MEPs condemned Burma's military Junta for its refusal to allow large scale international aid in the wake of the cyclone. In Somalia civil war and social breakdown has contributed to a humanitarian crisis. MEPs called on the EU's institutions and member countries to do all in their power to bring Somalia's warring factions together. On Iran, Members condemned Tehran's continuing use of public execution for young people under 18.
Russia, public health and support for sheep, goat farmers
Also Thursday: With the European Union due to hold a Summit with Russia at the end of the month MEPs passed a resolution identifying human rights conditions in Russia and Moscow's actions in Abkhazia and South Ossetia as particularly worrying. MEPs also passed a resolution emphasising their opposition to the import (mainly from the US) of chlorinated chicken into Europe on public health grounds. Finally, the House backed a report that calls for Europe's sheep and goat farmers to be given more financial support.
