EU's strategy to deliver market access for European companies

Parliament adopted an own-initiative report on the EU's strategy to deliver market access for European companies. The House urges the Commission to ensure that the European Union's legitimate trade interests are defended against the abusive or unfair trade practices of third countries. It takes the view that, when third countries unjustifiably restrict access to their markets by European Union companies, the European Union should react rapidly and firmly.
MEPs believe that Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with the European Unionâ€™s target countries will be meaningless unless they secure significant market access and real progress in reducing and eventually eliminating non-tariff barriers which, it is worth recalling, are often more trade-distorting than tariff barriers.
Chambers of commerce and trade associations
The report calls on the Commission and the Member States to enhance cooperation with European chambers of commerce, trade associations and Member State trade promotion agencies located in third countries, and to ensure the appropriate exchange of information between delegations, Member State embassies, other governmental foreign trade bodies and interested European business associations.
The European Parliament urges the Commission to include in the new generation Free Trade Agreements and in other agreements having trade implications clear enforcement and dispute settlement provisions, especially designed to tackle 'behind-the-border' barriers.
MEPs urge European companies, which are legitimately competing against each other inside and outside the European Union, to adopt a cooperative approach to a new market access strategy, bearing in mind that opening foreign markets and ensuring free and fair trade serves their common interest and thus requires common and coordinated efforts.
Looking ahead
MEPs take the view that, unless justified by development concerns, the European Union should deploy its best efforts to obtain concessions from its trading partners that are proportionate to their level of development.
