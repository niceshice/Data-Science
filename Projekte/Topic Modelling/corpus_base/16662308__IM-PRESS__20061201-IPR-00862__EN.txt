Members of the national parliaments and of the European Parliament will meet, for the second time this year, in Brussels on the EP's premises to discuss the 'Future of Europe' on 4 and 5 December 2006. This conference will give citizens' national and European representatives an opportunity to discuss the key issues which are of concern to them.
The first meeting, held on 8 and 9 May, helped to the re-launch, at national level, of the debate on the future of Europe. On this occasion, with a new title: "from reflection to action", the meeting is about to raise the level of the debate and address concrete questions.
The issues to be addressed during the meeting, in working parties and in plenary, will include: "the future financing of the Union", "towards a European energy policy" and "the European Union's role in conflict prevention".
This event, jointly organised by the European Parliament and the Finnish Parliament, will contribute to the discussions of the European Council meeting, due to be held on 14 and 15 December.
