Janusz Lewandowski MEPs come from all walks of life including other EU institutions. So just how much cross-over is there and how does the experience impact on their work? We are talking to some of the people who have worked in different institutions. First was MEP Danuta Hubner, ex-Commissioner for Regional Policy, today its the turn of ex-MEP Janusz Lewandowski who is the Budget Commissioner.
What did the move from Parliament to Commission mean for you?
In practical terms it was a revolutionary change. I was representing Poland and Polish constituents before, now Brussels is my home and Poland is among my destinations when I go for missions. But there are also other differences.
Both institutions have a consensual spirit and compromise is the name of the game; the main difference is in the process of decision-making and what comes after a compromise is reached. In the EP the process is more transparent, open, it's sort of political theatre. In the Commission it's more internal. After a decision is reached in the college we don't speak about differences between Commissioners. It's all about unity and speaking with one voice.
The Parliament is also more human, friendly, while the Commission is colder, more about codes and procedures.
Do you see the Parliament differently now?
My perception of the EP has changed, but not because of my "displacement", rather because of the new powers the EP has under the Lisbon Treaty. Now it is a fully-fledged legislative body and a real budgetary authority. It's more focused on legislation and decision-making than on resolutions that are often very time-consuming and have little practical meaning.
I also appreciate the European spirit that is preserved in the Parliament - despite the bigger and "louder" representation of eurosceptics during this parliamentary term.
Does your parliamentary background help you during negotiations with MEPs?
My insider knowledge and understanding of both institutions is a big advantage. What's more, I believe I enjoy more credibility (in the EP) and I have managed to preserve informal and friendly contacts, mostly in the Budget Committee. It helps a lot, especially during the current crisis situation. My experience in the EP is something I can contribute to the work of the Commission as well.
