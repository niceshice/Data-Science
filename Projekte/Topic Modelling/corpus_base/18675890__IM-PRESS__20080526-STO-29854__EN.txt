Singer and activist Alanis Morissette, Monday 26 May 08
Alanis Morissette, known best for her songs "Ironic" or "All I really want" was at the European Parliament on Monday night for the Energy Globe Award. She has been active in environmental issues for several years - notably against US energy policy and drilling for oil in Alaska. At the Gala she sang her latest song to the assembled crowds. Prior to her performance we caught up with her and asked her a few questions on activism and the environment.
How would you define North American attitudes to the environment? Is there an awareness of climate change?
I think it's very trendy right now to be aware of the eco situation, especially with the Live Earth concerts. So I think that people are aware and doing the best they can - doing the little things they can.
What can artists like you do to make a difference?
Activism! I did some activism with Adam Yauch from the Beastie Boys. Bush was trying to have an energy plan go through where he was going to affect native people's way of life in Alaska - so we did some concerts. It's a great way do it through music and art. I think I have some social activism by default in some of lyrics. The song I'm going to sing tonight is about taking personal responsibility, rather than trying to control people outside and tell them what to do. I'd rather take responsibility for my own life.
How do you contribute personally to saving the environment in your everyday life?
We run our tour busses on bio diesel, recycle, use solar panels, I drive a hybrid car, I paid for my CD covers to be made of eco-friendly materials when they weren't doing it. They wouldn't pay, so I paid for it myself at the beginning. Now it has become a sort of a commonplace thing, but a few years ago the Red Hot Chilli Peppers and myself were paying for it ourselves - so that was cool.
