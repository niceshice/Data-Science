2011-12-08 - 17:44
The 2011 Sakharov prize for freedom of thought will be awarded by President Jerzy Buzek to five "Arab Spring" activists, for their contribution to historic changes in the Arab world, at a ceremony at noon on Wednesday, 14 December, in the plenary chamber. Three of the five winners will attend the ceremony - Ms Asmaa Mahfouz (Egypt), Mr Ahmed El Senussi (Libya) and Mr Ali Ferzat (Syria). Mr Mohamed Bouazizi (Tunisia) will be awarded the prize posthumously. Ms Razan Zaitouneh is in hiding in Syria, where she is accused of being a foreign agent.
The Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought, named in honour of the Soviet physicist and political dissident Andrei Sakharov, has been awarded by the European Parliament every year since 1988 to individuals or organizations that have made an important contribution to the fight for human rights or democracy.

EU-wide protection for crime victims
2011-12-08 - 17:44
Crime victims who are granted protection from their aggressors in one EU Member State could get similar protection if they move to another, under new rules to be voted by Parliament on Tuesday. These rules, already agreed with national governments, would protect victims of, for instance, gender violence, harassment, abduction, stalking or attempted murder. The European Protection Order (EPO) would enable anyone protected under criminal law in one EU state to apply for similar protection if they move to another. Once the new directive is adopted, Member States will have three years to transpose it into their national laws.
MEPs sought from the outset to ensure that EPO rules cover victims of all crime, not just gender violence. Today, most protection measures are granted to female victims of gender violence but an EPO can cover victims of either sex and other crimes too.
The rules seek to protect victims or possible victims "against a criminal act of another person which may, in any way, endanger his life, physical, psychological and sexual integrity […] as well as his dignity or personal liberty". Such acts would include harassment, abduction, stalking and "other forms of indirect coercion".
Keeping aggressors away
The rules say an EPO may be issued if the aggressor is banned by the initial country from places where the protected person resides or which s/he visits, or if restrictions are imposed on contact or approaches by the aggressor to the protected person.
The UK has opted in, but Ireland and Denmark are not taking part.

Common rights and single work and residence permit for non-EU workers
2011-12-08 - 17:44
Third country migrants working legally within the EU should enjoy comparable rights to those of EU nationals as regards working conditions, social security and access to public services, under a new "single permit" law to be voted on Tuesday. The draft law, already informally agreed by Parliament and the Council, would also cut red tape, by enabling foreign workers to obtain work and residence permits via a single procedure. The "single permit" directive complements other measures on legal migration, such as the blue card, and is designed to facilitate such migration where it meets the needs of the EU labour market.
These rules do not affect EU countries' power to decide whether or not to admit non-EU workers or how many to admit, but they would have to decide within four months on whether to grant single permit applications.
Single permit holders would enjoy a standard set of rights comparable to those of EU workers, such as decent basic working conditions, recognition of qualifications, the right to join trade unions and access to pensions, social security, employment office services and public housing. However, EU countries could apply some specific restrictions to those rights.
The proposed directive would also reduce red tape for third-country nationals, by enabling them to obtain both work and residence permits in a Member State via a single procedure.
Who is covered?
The agreed rules would apply to non-EU nationals who wish to live and work in a Member State, or who already legally reside or work there.
The new law would not cover long-term residents, refugees and posted workers (who are already subject to other EU rules), seasonal workers or intra-company transferees (who will be covered by other EU directives). Au pairs and seafarers sailing under the flag of a Member State are also excluded.
Member States would have two years to transpose the directive into their national laws.

A "letter of rights" to help ensure fair trials across the EU
2011-12-08 - 17:44
Anyone suspected or accused of having committed a crime in the EU would have to be promptly informed of his or her procedural rights in easy-to-understand language, under a draft law to be voted on Tuesday. Any suspect who is then arrested or detained would also have to be given a written "letter of rights", adds the text, to which MEPs added the right to remain silent, the right to urgent medical care and the right to contact relatives. This draft directive, already agreed with Member State governments, lays down EU-wide minimum standards to enforce the right to information in criminal proceedings.
Today, citizens arrested and charged with a criminal offence cannot be certain that they will be properly informed of their rights everywhere in the EU. In some Member States, they receive only oral information about their procedural rights, whilst in others, the information is given in writing, but is technical, complex and provided only on request.
Once this directive is adopted, EU countries will have two years to transpose it into their national laws.

Proposed changes to EU labelling rules for fruit juices, "nectars" , juices made from concentrates, and those made from several fruits will be debated Tuesday and voted Wednesday.

Cutting phosphates out of detergents
2011-12-08 - 17:44
Washing powders throughout the EU will need to be almost phosphate-free in future, if legislation proposing tough limits wins the support of the European Parliament and Council. Voting on Wednesday, MEPs may follow an Environment Committee recommendation to demand that only minimal amounts of phosphates be allowed in dishwasher detergents, too. Phosphates help wash clothes and dishes, especially in hard water. Some Member States already impose restrictions (especially on laundry detergents) because the release of phosphates into waterways can lead to excessive plant growth that stifles fish and other aquatic life. Treatment to remove phosphates from water is expensive and not always available.

Neighbourhood policy: balance between East and South
2011-12-08 - 17:44
The EU’s engagement with its neighbours should be conditional upon their progress towards democracy and respect for human rights, says a draft resolution to be voted on Wednesday. MEPs also stress the need to maintain a reasonable balance in neighbourhood policy between East and South. The Commission's new approach to neighbourhood policy is endorsed in a draft tabled by Mário David (EPP, PT) and Marek Siwiec (S&D, PL). MEPs nonetheless underline the need to create tangible incentives for neighbouring countries to build democracy, and stress that result-oriented, tailor-made policies should be applied according to the countries' political, economic and social realities and performance.
MEPs underline that the democratic transition in the "Arab Spring" countries, the participation of women, young people and civil society and the functioning of free and independent media will be crucial, and urge the EU to increase support to train and organise political players. Respect for freedom of religion should be a priority, they add.
Among other initiatives, MEPs call on the Commission to establish a Euro-Mediterranean Erasmus programme to promote student exchanges between Mediterranean and EU countries.
The draft resolution calls for a sizeable increase in the EU budget for the European Neighbourhood Partnership Instrument, but also for a critical review of the workings of financial instruments used in the past in both eastern and southern countries, and especially in the Palestinian Territories.

Measures taken since 9/11 to combat terrorism in Europe should be properly assessed, to determine their achievements and future challenges, says a draft resolution to be voted on Wednesday.

Prison conditions and prisoners' rights
2011-12-08 - 17:44
Deteriorating conditions in EU Member States' prisons, abuses of pre-trial detention, overcrowding and the detention of non-EU nationals will be debated with the Council and Commission on Wednesday. MEPs will ask what can be done at EU level to improve detention conditions and safeguard detainees' fundamental rights. Parliament is to vote on a resolution on this on Thursday. Parliament has for several years been calling for EU-wide minimum standards for prison and detention conditions and a common set of prisoners' rights.
The very varied and often worrying situation in Member States' prisons is illustrated in a Green Paper on the application of EU criminal justice legislation in the field of detention, issued by the European Commission in June after many requests by Parliament.
The European Court of Human Rights has also repeatedly condemned EU Member States with regard to detention conditions, the length of pre-trial detention and the administration of justice.

Rural development: better EU funding terms for crisis-stricken states
2011-12-08 - 17:44
The EU would pay up to 95% of rural development projects costs in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Latvia and Romania, under a draft regulation to be voted on Tuesday. Increasing the share paid by the EU (Member States pay the rest) should help to accelerate investment and boost competiveness in crisis-stricken states, without increasing the total volume of EU funding. The new measures would apply until the end of 2013. Similar arrangements for regional development projects funded from EU structural funds were approved by the Parliament on 1 December.

Final vote on EU-Morocco fisheries agreement
2011-12-08 - 17:44
After heated debate and a failed bid by 77 MEPs to refer the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement to the European Court of Justice on the grounds of lack of evidence that it benefits the Sahrawi population, Parliament holds a final debate Monday on whether to extend the protocol, which specifies the number of EU vessels, quotas allocated to them and EU fees for access. It then votes on Tuesday to decide its fate. If approved, the protocol will remain in force until 27 February 2012. The fisheries agreement with Morocco, which is the second most important EU fisheries agreement and is currently worth €36.1 million, will appear on Parliament's agenda again soon as the Commission is expected to propose a completely new protocol to enter into force after February 2012.
MEPs will therefore quiz Commissioner Damanaki on the state of play in the negotiations with the Moroccan authorities and ask what steps the Commission is taking to ensure that the new protocol is economically and environmentally more beneficial for both the EU and Morocco and that it takes the interests of local populations into account. Parliament will also vote on a resolution to this end on Thursday.

MEPs to vote on EU aid worth €66.4 million to Spain, Italy, and France
2011-12-08 - 17:44
Parliament votes Tuesday on €38 million in EU Solidarity Fund (EUSF) aid to repair earthquake and flood damage in Italy and Spain. On Tuesday and Thursday it will also vote on €28.4 million in European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) aid to find new jobs for redundant Italian and French workers. EU Solidarity Fund aid to Spain and Italy
To repair damage caused by the earthquakes in Lorca (Murcia region) in May this year, Spain requested €21.1 million from the EU Solidarity Fund. The total direct cost of the damage caused by the earthquakes is an estimated €842.8 million.
Italy, where heavy rain in October and November 2010 caused severe flooding in the Veneto region, requested €16.9 million from the EU Solidarity Fund. The direct cost of the damage done by the flooding is estimated at €3.7 billion.
The two aid requests, totalling €38 million, are to be met out of unspent funds for rural development programmes. This will require an amending budget, the seventh this year
European Globalisation Adjustment Fund aid to France and Italy
France applied for €24.5 million to help find new jobs for 3,582 French workers made redundant by car manufacturer Renault and seven of its suppliers. The redundancies mainly affected three regions: Ile-de-France (53% of redundancies), Haute-Normandie (29.5%) and Nord-Pas-de-Calais (12.5%). MEPs will debate this request before the vote on Thursday.
Italy requested €3.9 million in EGF aid to help find new jobs for 528 workers made redundant by 323 construction industry firms in the Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol region.
Amending budget
All aid requests and the amending budget needed to cover the payments for the EU Solidarity Fund aid will need approval by Parliament as a whole and the Council of Ministers.
Future of the EGF
The EGF was established to provide additional support for workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation or the financial crisis and help reintegrate them into the labour market. Its annual ceiling is €500 million.
A Commission proposal to extend the EGF crisis measures until the end of 2013 was approved by a large majority in Parliament on 29 September, but employment ministers rejected it on 2 December. The Commission will present its view of the situation on Thursday.
MEPs will also debate a new proposal, which would maintain the fund until 2020 and extend it to cover farmers affected by new trade agreements, temporary employees and independent workers.

Court of Auditors: Parliament to vote on eight candidates
2011-12-08 - 17:44
On Tuesday MEPs will vote on eight candidate members of the European Court of Auditors Of the eight candidates, three are re-nominations: current President of the Court, Mr Vítor Manuel da Silva Caldeira (PT), and current members Mr Karel Pinxten (BE) and Mr Hans Gustaf Wessberg (SE).
The newly-proposed members are Mr Henrik Otbo, nominated by Denmark, Mr Juan-Francisco Corona Ramón, nominated by Spain, Mr Ville Itälä, nominated by Finland, Mr Pietro Russo, nominated by Italy, and Mr Kevin Cardiff, nominated by Ireland.
In the Budgetary Control Committee vote on 23 November, all the nominees were approved except for Mr Cardiff, whose candidature was narrowly rejected.
Although it is the Council of Ministers that formally decides upon the appointments, co-operation with the European Parliament, and particularly its Budgetary Control Committee, is crucial for members of the Court of Auditors. It has become standard practice for the Council to consult Parliament on appointments to the Court.
Procedure: Consultation
Vote: Tuesday 13 December Draft report on the nomination of Karel Pinxten Draft report on the nomination of Vítor Manuel da Silva Caldeira Draft report on the nomination of Hans Gustaf Wessberg Draft report on the nomination of Henrik Otbo Draft report on the nomination of Juan-Francisco Corona Ramón Draft report on the nomination of Ville Itälä Draft report on the nomination of Kevin Cardiff Draft report on the nomination of Pietro Russo Profile of rapporteur Inés Ayala Sender

More powers for European Maritime Safety Agency to prevent oil pollution at sea
2011-12-08 - 17:44
The EU should beef up the powers and the resources of the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) to reduce the risks of oil pollution from tankers and offshore oil rigs, says a draft resolution to be voted on Tuesday. Transferring monitoring and inspection tasks from national agencies to EMSA would enable Member States to make major economies of scale, says the draft text, which was prepared by the Transport Committee.
It also recommends using EMSA's electronic monitoring systems for maritime traffic to pool information on commercial shipping entering or leaving ports in the EU. This would, it believes, reduce formalities and speed up the creation of a real "European maritime space without barriers".
Procedure: Co-decision, first reading

Sustainable transport: MEPs to fix ambitious targets for 2020
2011-12-08 - 17:44
Halving road deaths and injuries, cutting transport CO2 emissions by 20% from 1990 levels and promoting walking, cycling and public transport, are the key aims of a draft resolution on the "single European transport area", to be put to a plenary vote on Wednesday. The debate on Tuesday afternoon will also focus on measures to better connect various modes of transport, build environmental costs into the price paid by users and the use of longer, heavier lorries (25,25m, 60t) on certain roads.
Procedure: Non-legislative resolution

Improving health and safety at work
2011-12-08 - 17:44
The effects of new technologies, harmful substances and nanomaterials on health should be included in the next EU strategy on health and safety at work (from 2013), says a draft resolution to be put to vote on Thursday. The potential risks of new technologies and harmful substances must be assessed, and legislation drafted to ensure that nanomaterials are covered by the current European Occupational Health and Safety regulation, says the text, which was drafted by the Employment and Social Affairs Committee.
Furthermore, individuals who legitimately warn of risks at work should be protected from any pressure to remain silent, say MEPs, calling on the Commission to propose a directive to protect these workers.
