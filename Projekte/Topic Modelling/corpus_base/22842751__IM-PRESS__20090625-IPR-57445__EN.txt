After a meeting on Wednesday with Iranian Nobel Peace laureate Shirin Ebadi, the President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering, announced his willingness to lead a European Parliament delegation to Iran.
President Pöttering said:
"I am ready to lead a European Parliament delegation to Iran composed of representatives of the different EP political groups. The aim of this delegation would be to meet with Iranian authorities, as well as with members of peaceful opposition groups. We are willing to offer our support and mediation to bring about a peaceful solution.
He added:
"The situation in Iran is getting worse day by day: Foreign journalists and diplomats are being expelled of the country. Activists and representatives of the media have been arrested over the past days. Communications are controlled and demonstrators violently attacked. This must come to an end. The international community has a moral obligation not to shut its eyes to what is happening and to have an open ear to the call for freedom.
Through its resolutions and continuous action, the European Parliament has always been a strong advocate of universal human rights and fundamental freedoms and the respect for human dignity. The ongoing breach of the freedom of expression and the freedom to demonstrate by the Iranian authorities is utterly unacceptable".
