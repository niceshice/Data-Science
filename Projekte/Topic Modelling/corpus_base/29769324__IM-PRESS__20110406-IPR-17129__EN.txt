Parliament Vice-president Gianni PITTELLA (S&D, IT) announced in plenary on Wednesday that the EP has received the request of the Romanian Ministry of Justice to waive the immunity of the non-attached MEP Adrian Severin. The request will be referred to the Legal Affairs Committee, which deals with parliamentary immunity cases.
What next?
The Legal Affairs Committee will appoint a rapporteur for this particular case. The committee will discuss the issue as soon as possible in camera. The MEP in question must be given the opportunity to state his case. If needed, the committee can also ask for additional documents or explanations from the requesting authority.
The committee then votes on the issue, recommending either the adoption or the rejection of the request for the waiver of immunity. After that, the report goes for a vote at the next plenary session. It is a "yes" or "no" vote, in other words no amendments can be tabled.
