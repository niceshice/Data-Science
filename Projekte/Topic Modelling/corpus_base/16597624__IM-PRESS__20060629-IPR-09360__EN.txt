Parliament adopted, with one minor amendment, the Council's common position on this draft directive on technical requirements for inland waterway shipping. The legislation covers areas from engine design and vessel manoeuvrability to crew safety and accommodation.
The aim is to align Community technical rules with the advanced standards governing navigation of the Rhine, so as to establish a single scheme for the entire European inland waterway network. The directive will create a level playing field in the single market for inland waterway transport, thereby increasing competition and promoting higher safety, environmental and social standards.
This is the final stage in a long process of revising the rules on inland waterway shipping which reached a standstill in Council because of a conflict of competences between the EC and the Central Commission for the Navigation on the Rhine. Under the new legislation, this conflict will be resolved by mutual recognition of certificates.
