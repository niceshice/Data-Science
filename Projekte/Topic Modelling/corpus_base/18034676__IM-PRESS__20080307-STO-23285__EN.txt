CAP reform affects them too
Tuesday's plenary began with a minute's silence for the victims of terrorism, four years after the Madrid trains bombs. Later MEPs give a green light to a proposed European Institute of Technology and adopted new rules to make airlines safer. Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves addressed the House and warned MEPs that Europe must not fall behind in terms of innovation and research. The afternoon saw MEPs discuss milk quotas and CAP reform.
President Ilves delivered a sobering view of the drawbacks of the European Union. He warned the House of a lack of innovation and competitiveness in Europe and of the Union's increasing slide into protectionist trade practices.
To push the EU forward he called for the Reform Treaty to be ratified and for the Union to adopt a common policy towards energy - a step that the appointment of an Energy Commissioner would promote. Mr Ilves also spoke of the battle between authoritarian capitalism and democratic market economies telling the House that this "is probably the latest ideological-intellectual-moral battle we face".
He also used the address to speak about what he envisages being a European is all about. "National interests are best served when we all give up a little so that the Union as a whole is successful." He spoke of the need to create a strong sense of "Europeaness" and of "a Europe of Polish-speaking Portuguese, Spanish-speaking Estonians and Slovenian-speaking Swedes".
CAP Health check, rising milk prices
The Common Agriculture Policy has just undergone a "health check" by the European Commission and MEPs were anxious to have their say. Although the Agriculture Committee had endorsed the broad thrust of the Commission's reform proposal, MEPs criticized the proposed transfer of funds from direct market support to rural development measures. The limitation of direct aid to farmers got a lukewarm response from MEPs. "The Commission should take our opinion much more seriously", said rapporteur Lutz Goepel (EPP-ED), "especially in light of the budgetary debate for the period after 2013."
Parliament discussed another report from the Agriculture Committee on national milk quotas. As consumers complain about higher milk prices, Parliament is being consulted on legislation which would allow Member States to increase dairy quotas by 2% on a voluntary basis from 1 April 2008, thereby expanding supplies.
Rapporteur Elisabeth Jeggle (EPP-ED) and other members of the agriculture committee criticised the Commission proposal. "It is our political responsibility to do more than just to help liberalize the markets." She warned that a gradual growth of milk quotas might lead to new milk lakes in Europe in 2015, when the current milk quota system will be phased out.
For the time being the EP has only a consultative voice on agricultural matters. However, under the upcoming Lisbon Treaty, Parliament will assume full legislative powers in this domain.
Tuesday's votes
Parliament gave the go-ahead to the EIT (European Institute for Innovation and Technology) and adopted new rules on airport and in-flight security - including the deployment of sky marshals and allocated â‚¬162 million to the UK to help deal with flood damage. It also laid down new rules about access to information for the EU's ombudsman.
