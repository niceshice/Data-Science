Focus on saving biodiversity
"The preservation of biodiversity is vital for our survival." That's the rallying cry from French Green MEP Marie Anne Isler Béguin at the start of Green Week, organised by the European Commission, which focuses this year on biological diversity. Biodiversity is all forms of life on Earth - species, genes and ecosystems - and is vital to man. It affects the climate, air, water, soil fertility, food production, medicines, in fact every aspect of our lives.
To preserve and restore biodiversity, EU Heads of State and Government agreed at the Göteborg Summit in 2001, "to halt the loss of biodiversity in the EU by 2010" and to restore habitats and natural systems .The Chairman of the European Parliament's Environment Committee, German Christian Democrat Karl-Heinz Florenz, said in an interview, "This certainly proves that the EU has recognized the problem and chose the right way to solve it." But he is also inclined to take a step further: "It is important to see the protection of biodiversity not just as a goal to be met by 2010. It has to be a constant aspect in legislation and in every action taken."
Mr Florenz fully supports Green Week, which carries the slogan Changing Our Behaviour. "In order to guarantee results in protecting biodiversity and avoiding further decline, every person should contribute to a stop of biodiversity loss. Help can start with small actions, like minimizing waste and using more environmentally friendly transportation," he said. Ms Isler Béguin added: "We all should in our daily lives make different choices, for example by avoiding buying articles that are damaging to the environment."
The Parliament has already begun to improve its ecological behaviour. In 2006 it is implementing an Environmental Management System based on the European Union Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) standard. An example that others are encouraged to follow. And what will you do for biodiversity?
