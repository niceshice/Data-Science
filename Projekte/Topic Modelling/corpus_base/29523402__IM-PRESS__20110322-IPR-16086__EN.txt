Following allegations published in the Sunday Times of 20 March against three MEPs, the European Parliament has begun an investigation to establish all the facts. Parliamentâ€™s services are reviewing a dossier delivered by the newspaper.
Independently of these official steps, two of the MEPs named in the article, Ernst Strasser (EPP, Austria) and Zoran Thaler (S&D, Slovenia), have resigned from the European Parliament, while the S&D group has announced that the third MEP, Adrian Severin (Romania), is no longer a member of the group.
