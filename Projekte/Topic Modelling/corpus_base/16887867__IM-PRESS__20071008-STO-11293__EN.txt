Staircase to the lobby: EP in Brussels
Lobbying: a normal part of the democratic process or something that exerts more power than it should? This afternoon MEPs in the Constitutional Affairs Committee will meet to discuss lobbying ahead of a report Parliament is preparing on the issue. The European Parliament has at present 4570 accredited lobbyists. Many of the lobbyists are NGOs and pressure groups such as amnesty international. Trade associations, regions, cities and companies (for example British Airways) constitute the rest.
The debate this afternoon from 3pm CET comes ahead of a report that Finnish MEP Alex Stubb (centre right EPP-ED) is preparing on how the EU institutions should deal with lobbyists.
No gifts allowed!
At present the Parliament's own Code of Conduct says that lobbyists must clearly state who they represent when dealing with MEPs and staff and refrain from offering any gifts.
Early in 2007 the European Commission decided to set up a voluntary register where lobbyists declare who they are and how they are funded. In a Green paper that proceeded the list the Commission said it saw lobbyists as an important part of the democratic process. However, it warned that "it must be clear to the general public what input they provide". They are hopeful the list will be available from early next year.
Part of the problem is that there are no reliable figures on the number of lobbyists who work in Brussels. Estimates vary from between 15,000 to 20,000 people who are employed in that way. As a comparison, in 2005 a survey for the "Washington Post" concluded that over 34,000 lobbyists were registered in the US capital.
The European Commissioner for Administrative Affairs Siim Kallas estimates there are 2,600 interest groups established in Brussels. He will be present on Monday afternoon to put his position to MEPs.
Am I being lobbied?
Face to face meetings with MEPs and Commission officials are just two ways that lobbyists operate. They also send letters, emails and make phone calls to people in an effort to make them aware of their concerns. Advocacy campaigns and coalition building around issues are two other ways that lobbyist work.
In December MEPs on the Constitutional Affairs Committee will adopt a report based on their findings - the full Plenary of Members will vote on it in January next year. We plan to have an interview with Alex Stubb in the coming weeks.
