The principle of solidarity should impel EU Member States to provide immediate assistance and share the burden with Italy and the other countries affected by an extraordinary inflow of immigrants from Northern Africa, said MEPs in a debate with Commissioner Malmstr√∂m.
The Commissioner promised exceptional financial assistance to the Italian government and proposed a joint operation by the FRONTEX agency , which was criticised by several M EPs as ineffective . MEPs also stressed the need for the EU to help Tunisia to foster social, economic and political development.
