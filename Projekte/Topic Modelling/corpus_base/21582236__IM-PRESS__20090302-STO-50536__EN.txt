Pricing, late delivery, returns and refunds are some areas that will be covered by proposed new EU-wide rules. The increase in online shopping through eBay and the importance of people shopping around for bargains in times of economic hardship are two key aspects behind the new directive.
Monday afternoon see a public hearing in the Parliament's building in Brussels which will see the launch of a public consultation on the new measures which are designed to replace four existing directives and a host of national rules. Please find a questionnaire below which you are invited to fill out with your views.
The head of Parliament's Internal Market Committee, British MEP Arlene McCarthy has called the measure "potentially the most significant change in European consumer law for many years."
E-shopping to be covered by new rules
As well as more protection for shoppers it is hoped that with standardised and clearer contracts companies that sell abroad will save money in red tape and lost custom.
In recognition of the fact that almost 150 million people have at some time bought something on the internet, the new measures will specifically include new rules to protect people who take part on online buying or auctions.
The measure also envisages a "black list" of unfair contract terms which are prohibited under EU law.
The Parliament's Internal Market Committee holds it hearing Monday from 4:00 pm to 6:30. They would also like to hear your views (which you can send in the EU's 23 official languages) by 13 March. You can send them to consumer.rights@europarl.europa.eu .
What next?
The proposed Contract Rights Directive must be approved by the European Parliament and EU Governments in the Council of Ministers before becoming law.
