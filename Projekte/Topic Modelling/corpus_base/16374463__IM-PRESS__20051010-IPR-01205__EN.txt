Urban policy in the EU of 25 - opportunity and challenge
Regional policy
2005-10-13 - 13:32
In adopting an own-initiative report with 540 votes in favour, 29 against with 36 abstentions on the urban dimension in the context of enlargement, Parliament is convinced that towns and cities and urban agglomerations or areas, including small and medium-sized ones, have a central role to play in achieving the revised Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives.
As to urban policy in the ten new Member States, MEPs recall that urban policy development priorities must continue to be reinforced at Member State and regional level after enlargement, to include housing and revitalisation of urban areas, infrastructure, transport, tourism, the environment, waste disposal, water supply, culture, training, education, social care and health.
Parliament also points out that there are great disparities in terms of urban policy between the 25 Member States, particularly as a result of the enlargement to include 10 new Member States. The new Member States, says the House, often have no clear and comprehensive urban policy at national or regional level.
MEPs point out that cities and urban agglomerations or areas represent 78% of the European Union population and considers that urban areas are:
– the place where both the most complex and the most common problems are concentrated (social exclusion, spatial and ethnic segregation, housing shortage, insecurity, drugs, pollution, contaminated former industrial sites, traffic, unemployment, lack of competitiveness, poverty, demographic changes, etc.)
– the place where the future is built: universities, research centres etc.
"Owing to the renegotiation of the rules linked to the Structural Funds, the urban dimension must be better taken into account" , stated Mr Beaupuy following the vote. "The Commission must orientate itself towards a horizontal application of the urban dimension and towards a coordination of its services which work directly or indirectly on urban questions," he concluded.
