The November plenary session opens with a debate on the role of sport in education with a report which says physical education should be compulsory in school and children should have at least three physical education lessons a week.
The House then turn its attention to the protection of soil with MEPs debating and voting on legislation on a legal framework and a thematic strategy. Among the key points proposed by MEPs in the committee is the proposal to set up public inventories of contaminated sites within the EU. Amendments are proposed aiming to give more flexibility to Member States in how they put the directive into practice. As for the thematic strategy, floods, landslides, desertification and climate change are among the reasons why a strategy for soil protection is needed in Europe, according to an own-initiative report.
The European Parliament will address a legislative report on the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading . The Environment Committee wants significantly tougher CO2 emission limits, and a stipulation that the emissions trading scheme should include flights between the EU and third countries, as well as intra-EU ones, by 2010, rather than 2012 as the Commission had proposed.

The House will debate the regulations governing political parties at the European level and the rules regarding their funding . A European Commission proposal to allow European political parties to finance campaign activities for the 2009 elections is backed by the EP Constitutional Affairs Committee.

It would also permit the creation of European political foundations. The vote takes place on Wednesday.
Tuesday evening sees MEPs debate the "proclamation of consensus on humanitarian aid".

The European interest: succeeding in the age of globalisation
2007-11-08 - 09:28
The key debate of the plenary week is entitled " The European interest: succeeding in the age of globalisation." which is the name of the discussion paper presented to Heads of State and Government at the Lisbon summit of 18 and 19 October (See link below) José Manuel Barroso will set out the views of the European Commission. MEPs will also vote on a resolution on this topic. Commission President José Manuel Barroso said: "We need a confident, open, reforming Europe, actively promoting the European interest. European leaders now need to maintain the vision and redouble their ambition," said the commission president. The discussion paper by the college for the Lisbon informal summit (18-19/10) makes clear that the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs is at the heart of Europe's response to globalisation."
The paper lays particular stress on the external dimension of economic policy. It makes clear that the EU, a single market of 500 million people, the world’s largest exporter of goods and services and its largest importer of goods, is a major beneficiary of an open world economic system. This economic power gives Europe a lever as a force for good in tackling global issues and in making sure international trade governance and global regulatory standards reflect Europe’s interests.
Third country companies will be welcomed to do business and to create jobs in the EU, but will not be allowed to by-pass the rules applied to European companies in the single market. It is important for the EU to maintain its openness, to use its influence in international negotiations to seek openness from others and to defend itself against unfair trade.
Also referred to in the paper is the Commission's comprehensive review of the functioning of European Monetary Union nearly 10 years after the launch of the euro. The review will present ideas on how policies, coordination and governance can help the euro area to work to best effect. The paper points out that the euro has already proved an anchor of stability that has protected the EU economy as a whole, not only the euro area. Reforms carried out during the last years have made Europe's economies more resilient, have already helped them remain healthy in the face of high energy prices and will also help them weather the recent financial market storm.
Concrete initiatives referred to in the paper to help achieve that potential include a “Small Business Act” for Europe, with wide–ranging proposals to be put forward by the end of 2008. Council and Commission statements

Commission legislative and work programme for 2008
2007-11-08 - 09:28
MEPs will debate the Commission's legislative and work programme for 2008. The Commission's priorities for 2008 are: "growth and jobs, sustainable Europe, an integrated approach to migration, putting the citizens first and Europe as a world partner. " The House will vote on a resolution on this during the December plenary session (10-13 December 2007) At its launch on 23 October 2007, President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, said: “This document is our political programme for 2008. It sets out our strategic initiatives and builds on our commitment to provide value added to Europe’s citizens. In parallel to the ratification of the Reform Treaty, the Commission will be delivering results for citizens to confirm that Europe matters more than ever in the age of globalisation: we will be active on growth and jobs; sustainable Europe; managing migration; putting the citizen first and Europe as a world partner. ”
To better reflect the current multi-annual nature of most of the activities of the Commission, the Programme devotes a new section to areas where work in 2008 will involve impact assessments and consultations which may lead to specific initiatives in the future.
The proposals to be presented illustrate many of the key features promoted by the Commission: they cover many cross-cutting themes, call for partnership with the Member States and other key actors, and look to tackle some of the longer-term issues facing Europe in the decades to come. They include a particular stress on better regulation, including a detailed list of simplification measures for the year ahead. The Programme also sets out the consequences in terms of communication, and includes areas foreseen as inter-institutional priorities for communication in 2008.

Situation in Pakistan - MEPs to vote debate and vote on a resolution
2007-11-08 - 09:28
At 3pm on Wednesday, the House will debate the dramatic situation in Pakistan with statements from both the Council and the Commission. MEPs will also vote on a resolution on this topic on Thursday.
MEPs and NGOs have criticised the imposition of a state of emergency in Pakistan last Saturday by President Pervez Musharraf. (see link below) They voiced their views at an already scheduled hearing on Bangladesh and Pakistan by the EP Human Rights Subcommittee, which gave MEPs and the invited NGOs their first opportunity to respond to the weekend's events.
Opening the hearing, the chair of the subcommittee, Hélène Flautre (Greens/EFA, FR), described the situation in both countries as "worrying". She recalled that on 25 October, the European Parliament had adopted a resolution on Pakistan warning amongst other things against "the imposition of emergency rule" (see link below).
The first NGO speaker, Brad Adams of Human Rights Watch, argued that Musharraf had "traded on the notion that he was the single person" able to hold the Taleban at bay. In fact he was now "destabilising Pakistan". A statement read out on behalf of Mohammed Tahseen of the Pakistan Coalition for Free and Fair Elections, who was unable to attend the hearing, criticised Musharraf's actions, notably "pre-election rigging" and attacks on the judiciary and media.
By contrast, Pakistan's ambassador to the EU, Saeed Khalid, argued that human rights in his country had not deteriorated but in many ways improved over the last 7-8 years, since Musharraf took office. Moreover, he assured the hearing, the emergency was intended as "a short term measure". In addition, the president has now "decided to take off his uniform".
On 6 November, the Council (see link below) said: "The EU is deeply concerned with the declaration of the state of emergency and suspension of Pakistan's constitution and fundamental liberties announced by President Musharraf on 3 November.
It strongly reiterates the importance of holding free and fair elections on schedule, of restoring civilian rule and the full respect for human rights, including the independence of the judiciary and freedom of the media. The EU is particularly concerned by reports of numerous arrests of leaders of political parties, lawyers, journalists, human rights defenders and representatives of civil society.
The EU takes note with interest of the statement by PM Aziz that the elections will take place, as scheduled, in January, and will look forward to the implementation of the necessary conditions to guarantee free and fair elections.
While recognising that Pakistan faces threats to its peace and security, the EU believes that stability and development can only be achieved through democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law.
The EU therefore now calls on the Government of Pakistan to take urgent action to: i) restore the Constitution; ii) implement the necessary conditions to guarantee free and fair elections on schedule in January; iii) release all political prisoners, including members of the judiciary, as well as Ms. Asma Jahangir, UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion and belief; iv) honour the President's commitment to step down as Chief of Army Staff by 15 November; v) pursue energetically reconciliation with the political opposition; and, vi) relax restrictions on the media.
At the same time, the EU urges all parties concerned to show restraint and to work together for a peaceful and democratic solution." Debate: 14.11.2007

European Neighbourhood Policy: visa facilitation, conditionality and supporting civil society are key, says Foreign Affairs Committee
2007-11-08 - 09:28
The Foreign Affairs Committee is putting forward a report assessing the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). The committee notes that although some common threads such as visa facilitation and the encouragement of civil society and people-to-people contacts existed, the Eastern, potentially candidate countries and the Southern Mediterranean Neighbourhood countries, needed to be dealt with in quite different ways. The ENP applies to the EU's immediate neighbours by land or sea – Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Moldova, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, Syria, Tunisia and Ukraine.
The report "expresses doubt about the meaningfulness of the ENP's geographic scope, as it involves countries which geographically are European together with Mediterranean non-European countries." For this reason, it advocates that "the unified implementation of the policy take as much account as possible of the differing identities of all the countries covered by the ENP." The committee assigned two rapporteurs to the issue, with Charles Tannock (EPP-ED, UK) dealing with Eastern European Neighbourhood, and Raimon Obiols i Germa (PES, ES) responsible for the Southern Mediterranean Neighbourhood.
Eastern European Neighbourhood
On the former, the report notes that "democratic neighbours who are clearly identifiable as European countries and who respect the rule of law may in principle [...] apply for membership of the Union." It believes that the gradual integration of the EU's Eastern neighbours into the European Energy Community should be pursued, and also suggest the setting-up of an "EU-Neighbourhood-East Parliamentary Assembly (EURO-NEST)" to strengthen parliamentary cooperation. The report also underlines the need for stronger EU involvement in the resolution of so-called frozen conflicts, condemns the continued human rights violations and the use of the death penalty in Belarus, and says serious consideration should be given to ways of involving Kazakhstan in the ENP.
Southern Mediterranean Neighbourhood
On the latter, the committee says human rights clauses' implementation mechanisms need to be included in the next-generation accords that will be signed between the EU and countries in the region, and regrets that so far, no substantial progress has been made in terms of democracy or human rights since the beginning of the European-Mediterranean Partnership. The report also notes that any new initiatives for the region need to involve a relaunch of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly (EMPA), with a serious look at its difficulties of the past few years.
General framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy
For both regions, the committee stresses that "conditionality can constitute an appropriate incentive for acceleration of reform processes in the ENP countries towards their convergence with the EU if conceived positively, and differentiated according to the country's specific needs and capacities." MEPs also underline that "respect for universal human rights and fundamental freedoms are the core principle of EU policy," and stressed that civil society and a free media must be supported everywhere, "regardless of the degree of willingness of partner countries' governments to cooperate and to share in these values."
MEPs in the committee welcome the longer-term aim of establishing a neighbourhood-wide free trade area and advocate that visa facilitation and readmission agreements be negotiated with all ENP countries. The report emphasises the importance of people-to-people contacts, for instance, by involving ENP countries in the Erasmus Mundus student exchange programme and by encouraging the Commission to set up city and region-twinning programmes.

Soil: special legislation needed

Floods, landslides, desertification and climate change are among the reasons why a thematic strategy for soil protection is needed in Europe, according to an own-initiative report drafted by Vittorio Prodi (ALDE, IT) on behalf of the Environment Committee. Soil degradation is a serious problem in Europe, entailing erosion, contamination, salinisation, compaction, decline in biodiversity and organic matter, floods and landslides. As soil formation and regeneration is a slow process, soil must be regarded as a non-renewable resource.
The problem is caused or exacerbated by certain agricultural, forestry and industrial practices, tourism, urban sprawl and construction work. It has a direct impact on water and air quality, biodiversity and climate change, and can affect human health as well as the safety of food and animal feed. An impact analysis carried out for the Commission suggests soil degradation may cost up to €38 billion per year.
Action needed at all levels: national, regional, local and Community
Unlike water and air, soil has not until now been subject to a specific EU policy. Soil protection measures are spread across many other EU policy areas. However these are now proving insufficient and MEPs in the committee agree with the Commission that a coordinated approach is now needed. They say that "in addition to national bottom-up approaches, a European strategy" is required, though they emphasise that Member States must shoulder their responsibilities and that "regional and local authorities should play a major part in formulating objectives and plans".
The first new piece of legislation deriving from thematic strategy is a directive on soil protection ( see below ). However, MEPs in the committee also stress the need to ensure synergy with existing Community directives on groundwater, nitrates, sewage sludge, waste and other areas.
The soil strategy is one of seven thematic strategies stemming from the Sixth Environmental Action Programme adopted in 2002. Rapporteur Vittorio PRODI ALDE IT A6-0411/2007 Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection Procedure : own-initiative

Framework for the protection of soil
2007-11-08 - 09:28
The Environment Committee is giving first reading approval to the first EU directive on soil protection. Among the key points proposed by MEPs in the committee is the proposal to set up public inventories of contaminated sites within the EU. Amendments are proposed aiming to give more flexibility to Member States in how they put the directive into practice. A series of compromise amendments have been tabled to plenary in particular to annex II. In their first reading report, drawn up by Cristina Gutierrez-Cortines (EPP-ED, ES), MEPs in the committee aim to promote the sustainable use of soil, to prevent soil degradation due to climate change - or to mitigate and remedy its consequences. The proposed directive should end the fragmentation of EU soil policy with existing provisions currently divided between various pieces of legislation on waste, pesticides and nature protection.
National or regional inventories of contaminated sites
The directive includes a requirement to establish national inventories of contaminated sites, which will be made public. MEPs in the committee add that these could also be on a regional basis. They should be updated at least every five years to include new contaminated sites and exclude those which have undergone remediation.
The committee inserted a definition of a "contaminated site" as a site where there is a confirmed presence on or in the soil, caused by human activities, of dangerous substances posing a significant risk to human health or the environment.
Remediation
The committee proposes the Commission's proposal that seven years after transposing the directive into national legislation, remediation strategies have to be drawn up by Member States, "at the administrative level they consider appropriate", including at least remediation targets - and the funds allocated.
Agriculture and climate change
"This Directive is the first piece of Community law that recognises the positive role of agriculture on soil protection and tackles the issue of climate change", said the rapporteur. Amendments proposed by the committee reaffirm that Member States may decide upon their own agricultural policy in relation to the soil, while on climate change, MEPs in the committee want the Member States to improve their soil's capacity to capture carbon.
Within five years of the transposition date, Member States will have to identify the "priority areas" which need special protection against erosion, organic matter decline, soil biodiversity loss, compaction, salinisation, landslides, desertification or acidification. MEPs in the committee propose that the choice of measures to combat these phenomena will be left to the Member States.

Strategy for the Bali Conference on Climate Change (COP 13 and COP/MOP 3)
2007-11-08 - 09:28
Guido SACCONI (PES, IT), on behalf of the Temporary Committee on Climate Change, will be asking the Council and the Commission the following questions on the strategy for the Bali Conference on Climate Change (COP 13 and COP/MOP 3): What is the Council's / Commission's strategy to ensure that the Parties to the Climate Change Convention reach a negotiation mandate? What will the Council / Commission do to ensure that this negotiation mandate imposes binding emission targets which would lead to the necessary global emission reductions in the coming decades?
Binding emissions targets for all industrialised countries; a global "cap and trade" system; and a 50% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by the middle of this century should be some of the EU's core targets for the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference, says a resolution adopted by the Temporary Committee on Climate Change.
Commitments made under the Kyoto Protocol for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions run to 2012. It is the EU's aim to ensure that the 3-14 December 2007 UN Conference in Bali marks the first step in building a post-2012 framework on tackling climate change.
EU's leading role on climate change
The European Union, MEPs in the committee stress, must confirm its "leading role" at Bali, ensuring that Conference members begin to establish "a realistic framework for an international post-2012 climate agreement". A future climate change regime, they add, should be based on the principles and mechanisms of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol.
The target for the EU at the Bali conference, according to the resolution, drafted by Satu Hassi (Greens/EFA, FI), should centre on the long term goal of limiting average global temperature increase to below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. This, notes the text, effectively means reducing global greenhouse gas emissions "by at least 50% by 2050 compared to the 1990 level". Even then, the text says the latest evidence suggests that the 2°C goal "might not be sufficient to avoid significant negative effects of climate change".

Include aircraft in Emission Trading Scheme by 2010, says Environment Committee
2007-11-08 - 09:28
A European Commission plan to include aviation in the EU's Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) is being put forward by the Environment Committee, but with significantly tougher CO2 emission limits, and a stipulation that the ETS should include flights between the EU and third countries, as well as intra-EU ones, by 2010, rather than 2012 as the Commission had proposed. Whereas the Commission had proposed limiting ETS allowances for CO2 emissions to 100% of aircraft operators' average annual emissions during 2004-2006, Committee members went further, reducing ETS-authorised emissions for aviation to 75%.
In 2004, greenhouse gas emissions from the EU's share of international aviation were 7.5% up on 2003. The cumulative growth of aviation CO2 emissions amounts to 87% since 1990, in stark contrast to the EU's overall greenhouse gas reduction target under the Kyoto Protocol, which is 8%.
All flights to be covered by 2010
The ETS should cover flights between the EU and third countries, as well as intra-EU ones, by 2010, says the committee. (The Commission had proposed that the scheme should cover all intra-EU flights as of 2011, but that flights between the EU and third-country airports should come under its scope only as of 2012). As rapporteur Peter LIESE (EPP-ED, DE) commented earlier, "It is difficult to explain that a flight from the UK to Morocco is not covered by the scheme while a flight from the UK to the Canary Islands [would] be covered."
The ETS allocates a number of permits to operators, each giving them the right to emit one tonne of carbon dioxide per year. So the total number of permits sets a limit on the overall emissions from participants in the scheme. While some permits are allocated to operators free of charge, others are traded freely (auctioned) so as to allow emission reductions to be made where they are most cost-effective. While the Commission proposed no specific values for the number of permits to be auctioned, MEPs in the committee did so, deciding on an initial figure of 50%.
Lastly, whereas the Commission sought to exempt government flights from the scheme, Committee members -- taking the line that governments ought to be setting an example - deleted the exemption.
Earlier report - EP advocated inclusion of aviation in the ETS
In July 2006, the House adopted a report (see link) by Caroline Lucas (Greens/EFA, UK) on reducing the climate change impact of aviation which advocated an aviation scheme as well as its inclusion in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). Rapporteur Peter LIESE EPP-ED DE A6-0402/2007 Air pollution: including aviation activities in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community (amend.

Constitutional affairs
Sounder funding arrangements for European political parties
2007-11-08 - 09:28
A European Commission proposal to allow European political parties to finance campaign activities for the 2009 elections is backed by the EP Constitutional Affairs Committee. If approved, the new legislation would improve the financial stability of European parties, and thus facilitate long-term planning. It would also permit the creation of European political foundations. The existing legislation on the financing of European political parties needs to be amended to enhance the European nature of Parliament's elections, and European political parties should enjoy more flexibility in managing their funds and financing their electoral activities, says the committee in a report by Jo Leinen (PES, DE).
No funding of national parties permitted
To enhance political debate at EU level with a view to the European Parliament's 2009 elections, the committee welcomed a Commission proposal to allow European political parties to use their money to finance campaign activities for European elections.
Such use of public funds is currently forbidden under EU law. The report as approved in committee also endorses the general principle that in no circumstances should these funds constitute direct or indirect financing of other parties and particularly of national parties and candidates.
The 2007 budget set out the money allocated to the EU parties. It is the EP who controls and manages the funds. In fact, the budget line for them is in the Parliament's section of the EU budget (line 402, chapter 40, title IV section I (Parliament) Ten parties were eligible for funds for 2007.
4 0 2 Contributions to European political parties
€10 436 000 was the figure for the 2007 budget (see link below).
More financial stability
In an effort to strengthen the European dimension of political parties, committee members also supported the aim of improving financial stability of European parties, so as to facilitate long-term planning. This financial stability is currently lacking, said MEPs, because the grants given to European political parties are subject to change every year, discouraging any proper financial self-management.
The Commission proposes to allow political parties to carry over, by way of derogation from the no-profit rule, 25% of annual total income from one year to the first quarter of the following year. Moreover, the new legislation would introduce the possibility of accumulating reserves, over several years as own resources, of up to 100% of parties' average annual income. These resources would consist of donations, contributions from member parties and individual members.
It is also proposed that the EU general budget may finance up to 85% of the expenditure of a European political party or foundation, compared with 75% now.
Foundations
If approved, the Commission proposal for amending the 2003 Regulation on the statute and financing of European political parties would also introduce a new legal basis for establishing European political foundations.
According to the proposal, endorsed by the committee, foundations would have to be formally associated with an already established European party in order to access funding - a foundation may receive funds only by applying through the political party with which is affiliated.
Finally, the proposed regulation leaves to European political parties the task of defining their relations with associated foundations, including an "appropriate degree of separation".
EU political parties: Parliament against Council decision to split regulation
On Thursday 25 October 2007, the European Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering strongly criticised the decision of the COREPER, the Council body, to split in two the Regulation on the financing of European political parties, currently under examination of the House. The decision was also disapproved by Parliament rapporteur on this subject, Jo Leinen (PES, DE), and Commission.
President Pöttering said: "We urgently call on the Council to reconsider its decision". He explained that: "The decision calls into question the Commission right of initiative and the rights of Parliament and creates risk of significant delays".
Moreover, he added: "The changes proposed by the Commission would allow the establishment of political foundations on European level that can provide an important contribution to enhance political debate at EU level". "A rapid decision is needed", he concluded.
Rapporteur Jo Leinen opposed the decision for having "excluded the representatives of the citizens of the EU from the decision-making procedure". He also said: "It cannot be up to bureaucracy and some ministries of finance and then to governments alone to decide on this matter".
Also the vice-President of the Commission, Margot Wallstrom intervened in the debate in the plenary. She said the EU Executive opposes the decision. She criticised the exclusion of the EP from the decision-making procedure, since the subject is closely linked to Parliament's business.
Council to exclude Parliament from decision on financial provisions
The COREPER, the Council permanent representatives' body, decided on Wednesday 24 October 2007 to split the proposal on amending the 2003 Regulation on the statute and financing of European political parties in two separate pieces of legislation. The governments' representatives also asked the Commission to put forward a new proposal accordingly.
COREPER decided that a first part, containing rules on the statute and the rights of EU political parties, will continue to be dealt under the codecision procedure, which guarantees Parliament's legislative powers. A second part on the financial measures will be instead adopted under a different legal basis and therefore MEPs will be only consulted, together with the Court of Auditors.

Sport
Physical education should be compulsory in schools
2007-11-08 - 09:28
Physical education should be compulsory in school and children should have at least three physical education lessons a week, says an own-initiative report by Pál Schmitt (EPP-ED, HU) for the Culture and Education Committee. The number of EU children who are overweight or obese is growing by an estimated 400,000 per year, yet, according to a study done for the Culture Committee, the average time that primary schools allocate to physical education has fallen from 121 to 109 minutes per week since 2002.
The report calls on Member States to make physical education compulsory in primary and secondary schools, ensure that the timetable includes at least three physical education lessons a week, and ensure "a higher degree of integration" between sports and academic subjects.
MEPs in the committee underline that physical education is the only school subject that seeks to prepare children for a healthy lifestyle and focuses on their physical and mental development.
"I hope that the report will draw attention to the problem and the need to improve the general health for children," said Mr Schmitt after the vote.
MEPs in the committee also stress the need for better sports facilities and recommends that EU structural funds be used to create school and other sports facilities in disadvantaged areas.
Child obesity and sport
The report u rges the Member States to carry out information campaigns on the need to adopt a healthy lifestyle, and engage in regular physical activity and on the health risks linked to an unhealthy diet aimed at children from a very early age and their parents.
The committee stresses t he importance of physical exercise in curbing obesity and overcoming unhealthy life-style habits, thereby greatly benefiting individual health, expresses concern, however, that longer working hours and present-day conditions of employment in general, are preventing workers from taking regular physical exercise and becoming more involved in sport.
A study commissioned by the Parliament's Culture and Education Committee and written by a British academic (see link below) says that "in some Member States the lack of sporting facilities...and PE teachers put physical education in a difficult situation". It concluded that "PE is often sacrificed to other academic subjects". The number of EU children affected by overweight and obesity is estimated to be rising by more than 400,000 a year, adding to the 14 million-plus of the EU population who are already overweight (including at least 3 million obese children) [COM(2005)0637, Green paper "Promoting healthy diets and physical activity: a European dimension for the prevention of overweight, obesity and chronic diseases"] across the entire EU27, overweight affects almost 1 in 4 children. Spain, Portugal and Italy report overweight and obesity levels exceeding 30% among children aged 7-11. The rates of the increase in childhood overweight and obesity vary, with England and Poland showing the steepest increases. In overall terms, children are less fit compared to the generation of the 1970s and 1980s. It is not such much a higher calorie intake that causes overweight, but physical inactivity: children do not eat more - they move less.

Community statistics on public health and health and safety at work
2007-11-08 - 09:28
The Environment Committee, in a report drafted by Karin Scheele (PES, AT), is recommending that Parliament approve with amendments - at first reading under the codecision procedure - a proposal for a regulation on Community statistics on public health and health and safety at work. The aim of the regulation is to establish a legal framework for the production of statistics in these two areas (replacing the gentlemen's agreements which have hitherto been the norm), thereby making statistics more reliable and consistent.
Among its amendments the committee calls for the increase in the proportion of women on the labour market to be taken into account, and for gender and age be included in the breakdown variables. It also wants complementary financing for the collection of the data in the field of health and safety to be provided under the Community programme for employment and social solidarity (PROGRESS).

Complaint by Boeing against Airbus before the WTO
2007-11-08 - 09:28
The Commission will make a statement on the Complaint by Boeing (US) against Airbus (EU) before the WTO. Since 1992 direct and indirect government support to aircraft industry in the US and the EU has been regulated by the bilateral EU-US Agreement on Trade in Large Civil Aircraft. The EU in good faith has continuously met all commitments under this agreement whereas US compliance had been less than adequate, in particular by covering up large hidden subsidies to Boeing including unprecedented prohibited production subsidies in Washington State for the 787 and other Boeing commercial aircraft.
Nevertheless, during the course of the Summer 2004 the United States purported to unilaterally withdraw from the bilateral 1992 Agreement (a move that the EU considers invalid as it did not respect the required conditions) and unexpectedly filed a WTO challenge of all EU support even though it had been granted in accordance with the Agreement.
On 6 October 2004 the US requested formal WTO consultations with the EU regarding alleged subsidisation of Airbus by the EU and certain of its Member States, and a WTO panel was set up thereafter.
The major bone of contention is that of EU Member State co-financing of R&D for new Airbus aircraft ("Member States Financing" or "reimbursable launch investment"). This form of support is expressly agreed under the bilateral EU-US Agreement and has been used on three of the nine Airbus aircraft launched since 1990. It provides for government funding to Airbus repaid with interest under terms specified in the Bilateral Agreement (loan rates of return are cost to government plus 1%, and interest and principal is repaid on deliveries, even before the programs break-even). In some cases the terms are more onerous than those commercially available in that the lending governments are receiving royalty payments that will last through the life of a particular aircraft program even though the original loan and interest are completely repaid. In fact, EU governments so far have made handsome returns on their initial “investments”, even though there are instances where Airbus has been able to obtain financing on more favourable terms from private lenders, compared with government offers. As of today, Airbus has repaid in excess of 7 billion euros ($9 billion). Since 1992, Airbus has repaid 40 percent more than it has received from EU governments. Airbus currently repays loans at the rate of 300 to 400 million euros a year.
The US also claims that a number of infrastructure projects were allegedly built or upgraded exclusively for Airbus, or that Airbus enjoyed preferential treatment. However, unlike infrastructure projects in the State of Washington (which were designed for Boeing and for which Boeing benefited from preferential treatment), Airbus pays a market-based rent and clearly did not benefit from any preferential treatment for these projects, or they were for the use of the general public.

Building ties with Ukraine
2007-11-08 - 09:28
The International Trade Committee will submit to the House a draft own-initiative report by Zbigniew Zaleski (EPP-ED, PL) on trade and economic relations with Ukraine. The report reviews the areas on which MEPs believe work needs to be done, including Ukraine's accession to the WTO, the creation of a free trade area with the EU (and Ukraine's long-term prospects for integration with the EU), energy supplies and relations with Russia. MEPs want Ukraine to speed up its accession to the WTO by removing all residual legislative and technical obstacles. They look forward to the creation of an EU/Ukraine Free Trade Area . However, Ukraine must introduce EU-compatible customs legislation and improve the functioning of its customs service.
The draft report makes various proposals on Ukraine's industrial policy : export diversification, improved public services, market liberalisation, creation of an effective tax system, updating of money-laundering and tax evasion regulations, elimination of distortions of competition and illegal export subsidies.
Ukraine is urged to align its intellectual property legislation and law enforcement with the acquis communautaire, WTO rules and other international standards, and also to combat counterfeiting and piracy effectively.
Ukraine should place more emphasis on the knowledge economy and increase the proportion of its GDP allocated to scientific research. At the same time, the EU should support education and research in Ukraine.
Farming and the rural population need financial and infrastructure support, easier access to loans for small producers and a weighting system for aid that favours small and young entrepreneurs. Regulatory cooperation between the EU and Ukraine on plant health is needed. And Ukraine should develop environmental programmes (key issues include the drinking water distribution network and action to prevent the deterioration of the Black Sea).
The report calls on Ukraine to develop its economic relations with the Russian Federation in a way which would not hamper closer integration into the Community's Single Market. A three-way dialogue between Ukraine, Russia and the EU should be promoted by the Commission, to foster a climate of security and peace in the region.
On the crucial issue of energy supplies, the report calls for full implementation of the EU-Ukraine Memorandum of Understanding on energy cooperation and stresses the need for a safe, transparent and reliable system of energy transit between Ukraine and the EU.
Lastly, the committee welcomes the opening of negotiations between Ukraine and EU with a view to concluding a new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement . But MEPs in the committee are concerned about the lack of a strategic vision for development and stabilisation in Eastern Europe and they stress the need for Ukraine's integration to become a real political priority on the EU agenda. They also call on the Council to explain how will apply the Human Rights and Democracy Clause to the negotiations for a new agreement with Ukraine.

Economic and monetary affairs
International Financial Reporting Standard 8: yes, but…
2007-11-08 - 09:28
MEPs are to set out their views on the proposed adoption of International Financial Reporting Standard 8, which now has the qualified backing of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee. Once endorsed by the EU, these standards apply to listed companies.
The European Commission is proposing that IFRS 8, drawn up by the International Accounting Standards Board, be approved as a replacement for the existing international accounting standard (IAS14) relating to the way in which companies present information on the performance of different segments of their business.
Committee votes to approve IFRS 8...
On 5 November, the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee adopted a resolution accepting IFRS 8, but expressing reservations about some of its implications – and the process used to adopt this and other accounting standards.
The full Parliament will vote on Tuesday (13 November). If it follows the Economics Committee’s line, that will give the green light for the standard, which will require listed EU companies to disclose segmental information following the US-style “through the eyes of the management approach.”
... but expresses reservations and concerns
In its resolution, drawn up by committee chair Pervenche Berès (PES, FR), the committee recalls that convergence of accounting standards is “not a one-sided process where one party simply copies the financial reporting standards of the other party.” It expresses reservations about the Commission’s view that geographical information would not in practice be reduced compared to the current standard, and asks the Commission to report back to Parliament within six months on its discussions with the International Accounting Standards Board on this issue.
The committee says the IASB should review IFRS 8 two years after it come into force, and that the Commission should follow closely the application of IFRS 8 and report back to the European Parliament no later than 2011, inter alia regarding reporting of geographical segments, segment profit or loss and use of non-IFRS measures.
MEPs in the committee stress that the IASB and the European Commission must engage more closely with Parliament and European stakeholders on accounting standards. They insist that Parliament will actively use its right of scrutiny in such cases. They also stress that the Commission must ensure that impact assessments incorporating quantitative information, reflecting an equilibrium between stakeholders are carried out “at the earliest stages in the development on international accounting standards or interpretation”.
Background
In April 2007, the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee proposed a draft resolution to Parliament expressing concern at the proposed approval of IFRS 8, but since the Commission agreed to undertake an impact assessment, Parliament postponed the plenary vote on this resolution. This is now replaced with a new text, following the Commission’s presentation, on 11 September, of the impact assessment.
The endorsement of accounting standards is delegated to the Commission under legislation adopted by the Council and Parliament in 2002, but the EP still has the right to scrutinise proposals before the Commission acts. While Parliament’s position in such cases is not formally binding, when it comes to financial services legislation, the Commission has undertaken to take the fullest possible account of Parliament’s views.

Social policy
Poverty still too widespread, says Employment Committee
2007-11-08 - 09:28
In an own-initiative report on Social Reality Stocktaking, the Employment and Social Affairs Committee calls on the Commission and Member States to pursue "an ambitious objective of reducing poverty, especially among working people, in Europe". The draft report by Elizabeth Lynne (ALDE, UK) welcomes the Commission's forthcoming proposal to make 2010 the European Year of Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. However, it also highlights the scale of the effort needed.
Over 50 million people or around 16% of the EU's workforce are disabled and their rate of unemployment is twice as high as that of the able bodied. Overall, 78 million European citizens still live in poverty, 8% of people in the EU suffer from in-work poverty and the gap between rich and poor in many Member States is increasing.
A decent minimum wage at Member State level
The draft report urges Commission and Council to examine "how Europe can provide a social level playing field to eradicate unfair competition in the European internal market". It stresses that "to make work financially viable", a "decent living minimum wage" should be set at Member State level - be it by national law or in cooperation with the social partners.
MEPs in the committee complain that "in many Member States the minimum wage is set very low or at below subsistence level". Member States should also end asylum seekers' dependence on benefits by allowing them to work, say MEPs.
Prevent exploitation of vulnerable workers
The committee welcomes the Commission's draft directive on "Sanctions against employers of illegally staying third-country nationals". At the same time MEPs in the committee call on Member States to better implement existing legislation to prevent the exploitation of vulnerable workers by gangmasters. They should also sign and ratify, if they have not yet done so, the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and their Families.
Combat child poverty
Given the number of children abandoned, on the streets or in institutions, Member States should provide adequate resources for combating child poverty, says the report. Children and their families should be supported, for example with affordable childcare and housing.
Member States are urged to ensure that their citizens are literate and have "the skills and knowledge to gain useful employment". Pupils should be prevented from dropping out of school early. MEPs in the committee also note that people from less wealthy backgrounds are "seriously underrepresented" in higher education.
Rehabilitation for prisoners
Extreme poverty can lead to crime, points out the report. Adequate rehabilitation for prisoners is crucial to prevent them slipping further into social exclusion and unemployment. Lastly, the fact that for many people the only access to treatment for alcohol and drug abuse is through the prison system is regarded by MEPs as "unacceptable".

Judicial cooperation
Follow-up of cross-border collective copyright management - question to the Commission
2007-11-08 - 09:28
Giuseppe GARGANI (EPP-ED, IT), on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs will be asking the Commission a question on the follow-up of the EP resolution on cross-border collective copyright management (Lévai report A6-0053/2007). The European Parliament adopted on 13 March 2007 a resolution on cross-border collective management (P6_TA(2007)0064 (see link hereunder). In its resolution, Parliament invited the Commission to present as soon as possible a proposal for a framework directive with a view to regulating the collective management of copyright and related rights as regards cross-border online music services; it also invited the Commission to make it clear that the 2005 Recommendation in this field applies exclusively to online sales of music recordings.
Can the European Commission inform Parliament of the steps taken so far with a view to complying with Parliament's requests? Oral question to the Commission

Culture
Interoperability of digital TV - concern over the 2012 deadline
2007-11-08 - 09:28
Henri Weber (PSE, FR) for the Committee on Culture and Education will be putting forward an initiative report on the interoperability of digital TV. The report underlines the importance of the switchover from analogue to digital technology and is concerned about delays in the 2012-deadline set by the Commission. MEPs underline in the report, that the new possibilities of interaction, that digital TV provides should be for the benefit of the users, and that the new technologies should allow the broadcasting of pluralist information and quality programmes.
The committee points out that the switchover from analogue to digital is a great step forward and can contribute towards disseminating cultures and improving social cohesion.
UK tops the EU table for digital TV
According to the report digital television data - EU market for digital TV, (see link below), at the end of 2005 66.6 per cent of households had digital TV, compared to an EU-27 average of 23.8 per cent.
With digital TV, viewers can interact directly with the broadcasters. Interactive TV is based on different applications and software in the receivers with different standards. However, the Committee on Culture and Education finds that imposing a single standard is not the right solution. MEPs share the view of the Commission that it would be better to continue promoting open standards, which are recognised by the European Standards body, and maintain that these open standards are the most appropriate ones for ensuring the technological neutrality of networks and the free movement of information.
The committee regrets that interactive television in the EU has ultimately proved to be less commercially successful than expected and calls on the Commission to study the reasons for this phenomenon and to submit regular reports on the efforts made by the Commission and the Member States to develop the digital TV market and its numerous ramifications.
MEPs consider that the technical and legislative choices related to interoperability should not only be economic, but also social and cultural, and they stress attention should be paid above all to the interest of the users.

Petitions
Petitions: MEPs wish to see EU law enforced
2007-11-08 - 09:28
In 2006, the European Parliament received no fewer than 1,016 petitions from citizens alleging failures to comply with EU law in their countries or regions. MEPs are now calling on the Commission to take more systematic legal action against Member States in the event of infringements, and wish the Council to be more extensively involved in the work of the EP Petitions Committee. Members of the Petitions Committee, in a report by Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo (EPP-ED, ES) on the committee's deliberations in 2006, underline that petitioning is a "fundamental right" that enables European citizens to participate in monitoring the application of Community law by national, regional and local authorities. This right also contributes "significantly" to the EU's efforts to "reconnect with its citizens" and provides an insight into the expectations of the European public.
Between 1 January and 31 December 2006, the EP received 1,016 petitions, or roughly three per day, a figure comparable with 2005's (1,032). But about one-third of these were found to be inadmissible because they did not relate to the EU's spheres of competence. - which points to a need, say MEPs in the committee, to ensure that citizens are provided with adequate information on these spheres of competence. They also asked that visibility of the "Citizens Portal" on the European Parliament's web site be improved.
The most active petitioners were German, British, Spanish, Greek, French, Italian and Polish citizens. The majority of petitions illustrate difficulties involved in applying Community law in areas such as the environment, social security, the recognition of qualifications and the functioning of the internal market. MEPs regret the "widespread failure" by Member States to correctly implement environmental norms and called for "improved consistency in the monitoring" notably of respect for Community law on the protection of biodiversity and on the assessment of the impact of certain public and private projects and plans on the environment.
Equitable Life
The significant number of petitions received from United Kingdom, Germany and Ireland on major financial losses incurred following alleged mismanagement at Equitable Life resulted in the European Parliament setting up a temporary committee of inquiry to investigate "alleged contraventions or maladministration in the implementation of Community law" (Article 193 of the EC Treaty).
Take Member States to court more systematically
The report reiterates the committee's growing concern about the unjustified and excessive time taken by the Commission - often several years - to conclude infringement proceedings. MEPs in the committee also criticise frequent failures by Member States to comply with Court of Justice decisions. They consider that this situation "undermines the credibility of the formulation and coherent application of EC law and that it serves to discredit the objectives of the EU".
MEPs in the committee therefore call on the Commission to avail itself of the possibility of taking Member States to court to have them ordered to pay fines and damages if they delay implementing the Court's rulings in infringement proceedings.
Involve the Council and the Member States more extensively
MEPs in the committee underline the need to involve the Council more extensively in the activities of the Petitions Committee, inter alia by sending representatives to its meetings. They also reiterate their proposal that the Council appoint a senior official responsible for petitions, given that many complaints are to do with the Member States' transposition of Community legislation into national law.
In this connection, the report refers to the "key role" of the Member States in correctly implementing Community legislation and underlines that the practical application thereof "is decisive for the purposes of increasing the relevance of the European Union for its citizens". Greater participation by representatives of the Member States and their parliaments in the debates of the Committee on Petitions is needed, say MEPs in the committee.
Close co-operation with Commission and Ombudsman
MEPs in the committee believe that cooperation between the Petitions Committee and the European Commission "remains critical" for dealing effectively with petitions, especially in relation to Community decisions or activities with a direct impact on the citizen.
Welcoming the constant dialogue between the Committee on Petitions and the European Ombudsman, MEPs in the committee point out that they had supported the special report on the transparency of Council meetings, welcomed the successful resolution regarding the way the Commission handles complaints alleging an infringement, and supported the Ombudsman's request for an increase in his budget.

Humanitarian aid
Consensus on humanitarian aid
2007-11-08 - 09:28
As part of a joint debate on humanitarian aid, the Commission will make a statement on the proclamation of consensus on humanitarian aid. From Afghanistan to Zimbabwe, the European Union helps hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people on a daily basis. But while the need is great, the job of delivering the aid is getting harder and more dangerous, in an ever-more complex international environment. More than half of official international humanitarian aid comes from the EU - either through the Commission or through bilateral Member State programmes. The Commission is seeking a consensus affirming that EU aid:
• is founded unequivocally on the humanitarian principles of neutrality, independence and impartiality, and
• must be delivered rapidly and efficiently to crisis victims on the basis of assessed needs.
This would be the first time that:
• The European Union issues a joint document on its humanitarian aid policy (since the adoption of the Humanitarian Aid regulation in 1996)
• The EU as a whole, both the Commission and all Member States, has a comprehensive policy statement on humanitarian aid that underlines our commitment to the fundamental humanitarian principles
• The principles and guidance of the Good Humanitarian Donorship Initiative of 2003 would be discussed in detail and formally adopted at EU level
• The EU would commit itself to diversity of implementing partners
• Member States and the Commission would discuss concrete steps to improve coordination of humanitarian aid activities
• The Community's added value in humanitarian aid would be formally recognized and steps for further improvement endorsed by Member States and the European Parliament Commission statement - Proclamation of consensus on humanitarian aid

Humanitarian aid
Humanitarian aid consensus needs to be clearer and more specific
2007-11-08 - 09:28
The EP Development Committee is proposing an own-initiative report outlining the EP's position on the "European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid", aimed at rationalising the efforts and the distribution of aid between the European Commission and the Member States. The European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid is likely to be signed by the three institutions in plenary on 18 December. Rapporteur Thierry Cornillet (ALDE, FR), said after the adoption of his report: "this text is a good basis for negotiation with the Council of Ministers and the European Commission".
The report insists that the Consensus needs "to be clearer and more specific in order to enhance European humanitarian policy" and also to ensure that the EU's potential as a humanitarian donor is fully exploited". The EU, i.e. the European Commission and the Member States, collectively, is the world's leading humanitarian aid donor. In 2006 the EU contributed over €2 billion, which is over 40% of official international humanitarian assistance.
The committee reaffirms that EU civil protection and military assets and capabilities must be deployed in a way which complements and supports the work of humanitarian organisations. it should be limited to those cases or areas where they can provide real added value.
The report stresses the need to clarify the relations between activities supported by the Commission via the Stability instrument for crisis prevention, management and resolution (such as disarmament, demobilisation, mine clearing, reintegration of displaced populations/refugees, etc.), and the concomitant activities carried out by DG ECHO, the Commission's humanitarian aid office.
Thierry Cornillet, who is the European Parliament's standing rapporteur on Humanitarian Aid, presented his initial proposals to the Informal gathering of Development and Cooperation Ministers in Funchal (Madeira) from 20 to 22 September, in the run-up to the December EU-Africa Summit.

New Statutes for the Euratom Supply Agency
2007-11-08 - 09:28
Parliament is being consulted on a proposal for a Council decision establishing Statutes for the Euratom Supply Agency. On behalf the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, rapporteur Romana Jordan Cizelj (EPP-ED, SL) is recommending that Parliament approve the draft decision with amendments. The European Atomic Energy Community has a Supply Agency to guarantee supplies of nuclear materials to European Union users. The Agency's current Statutes date from 1958. New Statutes have to be adopted to take account of EU enlargement, the need to apply modern financial provisions to the Agency and the need to fix the Agency's seat.
Among its amendments, the Industry Committee recommends that the Agency's role should be redefined, making it a proper "energy observatory" in nuclear supply policy and markets, providing the industry and governments with data on market equilibriums, long-term price levels and risk analysis.

Regional policy
Dealing with the regional impact of earthquakes
2007-11-08 - 09:28
MEPs are to debate and vote on a series of ways to improve the EU's ability to cope with earthquakes. The Council should agree on the new EU Solidarity Fund regulation, to help repair earthquake damage faster, the Commission should draw up a joint EU earthquake action plan and Member States should step up research into earthquake damage prevention and crisis management, says an own-initiative report by Nikolaos Vakalis (EPP-ED - EL). Earthquakes caused the deaths of 1.5 million people worldwide In the twentieth century, and cost an estimated at €75 billion in the last quarter century alone, says the report. The EU's most seismically active areas are Italy, Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Cyprus and Slovenia, but Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Spain, Portugal and Malta are also at significant risk . Large areas of the EU are also subject to mining-related rock-mass tremors, which cause similar damage, it adds.
Take stock, plan joint action
The report calls on the European Commission to draw up a communication on earthquake hazards, damage prevention, management and repair and a technical protocol for joint action by the EU in the event of earthquake disasters, focusing on critical transport, energy, telecommunications and health infrastructures and on the roles of national, regional and local authorities.
Solidarity
The Council should decide without delay on the new Solidarity Fund regulation, as part of the co-decision procedure, so as to help repair damage fast and flexibly, including simplifying the requisite financial procedure (Parliament made its observations on time limits and eligible actions in May 2006), says the report.
Step up research, share special skills
The Commission should help formulate an earthquake research agenda, and Member States should step up research on ways to prevent damage, manage crises and reduce the impact of disasters, in tandem with the Seventh Research Framework Programme, says the report, adding that the Commission and Member States should also encourage the setting up of centres of excellence in scientific, technological and architectural innovation.
The report calls for public information campaigns on prevention and preparedness and university courses, master's and Ph.D programmes in disciplines such as earthquake-related engineering.
The Commission and Member States are also urged to promote special European training and best practice exchange programmes in the special skills required to prevent and deal with earthquake damage.
Build in earthquake resistance
The report calls on the Commission and Member States consider upgrading ancient buildings and monuments, as well as public buildings of strategic importance for civil protection and other critical infrastructure, so as enhance their earthquake resistance.
It also urges the Commission to recommend that Euro code 8 earthquake resistance provisions be included in the planning regulations of all vulnerable Member States, and calls on EU and Member State authorities to consider applying these provisions to old buildings as well as new ones.
Co-ordination and civil protection
The report calls on the Council and the Commission to take due account of earthquakes when finalising the revised legislative framework for civil protection.
It advocates co-ordinating Community, national, regional and local action, in the spirit of the Barnier report, and recommends introducing a "binding co-ordination system" for prevention, management and protection measures, including observation and early warning mechanisms, data bases and the exchange of best practices, and urges each Member State to create a single, co-ordinated, civil defence management system to this end.
Finally, the report reiterates the committee's support for the establishment of a European Civil Protection Force and calls on the Commission to submit a proposal for one. Rapporteur Nikolaos VAKALIS EPP-ED EL A6-0388/2007 The regional impact of earthquakes Procedure : own-initiative

Bluefin tuna recovery plan: Fisheries Committee opposes derogations and favours compensation
2007-11-08 - 09:28
Bluefin tuna fishermen must get financial compensation during closed seasons and derogations relating to specific fishing areas and minimum size are not justified, since the Mediterranean and the Atlantic are populated by a single tuna stock, says the Fisheries Committee in a consultative report on a multi-annual recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean. To address concern about the critical state of bluefin tuna stocks due to over-fishing, the recovery plan provides for a steady reduction in the catch quota (by 20% between 2006 and 2010), and an increase in minimum size from 10 to 30 kilogrammes, with derogations for fishing in the Gulf of Biscay and for catches in the Adriatic intended for fish farms. A derogation is already in operation for the Gulf of Biscay (6.4 kilogrammes instead of 10). Furthermore, the fishing period for long-line vessels is to be restricted from 1 June to the end of each year and for purse seine vessels from 1 July to 31 December. Control measures are to be stepped up to combat illegal fishing.
"The bluefin tuna recovery plan has been criticised in a variety of ways, which illustrates the fact that scientific experts and fishermen hold differing views regarding the need for stocks to be protected", said rapporteur Iles Braghetto (EPP-DE, IT).
Derogations are "unacceptable"
According to the report, the derogations relating to fishing areas conflict with the views held by all scientific experts and with the opinion expressed by the majority of the Member States. They are not justified from the biological point of view, would severely distort competition and would lead to more intensive fishing in the areas concerned, including by vessels which do not traditionally operate there, MEPs said.
The Fisheries Committee is also opposes minimum size derogations for bluefin tuna. "If the situation regarding the survival of fish stocks is really so critical, the derogations regarding both minimum size and - to a lesser extent - closed seasons are unacceptable. Derogations would not be justified from a biological point of view (…) and would also make controls less effective", said Mr Braghetto.
Closed season compensation for fishermen?
The rapporteur questioned whether the socio-economic impact of reducing fishing activity in order to preserve the economic balance of fishing operations had been properly assessed. In the proposal for a regulation there is no reference to the recovery plans provided for in Community law, even though such a reference is essential if fishermen are to receive financial compensation from the European Fisheries Fund (EFF).
In one of the amendments proposed by the committee, MEPs add that a financial compensation from the EFF shall be paid to fishermen - both crews and shipowners - during the closed season.
Member States to submit a fisheries plan
As the biggest problem in bluefin tuna fishing is that the EU fleet capacity exceeds the available quotas, MEPs want Member States to submit to the Commission a fisheries plan, indicating the number of vessels and traps for which fishing licences are to be requested, accompanied by information concerning the expected fishing effort.
Given failures by Member States to respect the reporting requirements in 2007 and the subsequent over-runs of certain national allocations, the committee proposes that if a Member State fails to provide catch data, then the national fishery should be closed.

Fisheries
An improved framework for the collection and management of data in the fisheries sector
2007-11-08 - 09:28
In a consultative report by Paulo CASACA (PES, PT), the Fisheries Committee recommends the House to approve, with some amendments, the Commission proposal establishing a Community framework for the collection, management and use of data in the fisheries sector and supporting scientific opinion on the Common Fisheries Policy. The rapporteur highlights the problems of competition and competence among fishermen and puts forward amendments aiming at ensuring the confidentiality of data. The proposal for a new regulation on data collection is intended as a response to the demands arising from the need to move towards fisheries management which is geared in particular towards fleets and fishing areas rather than fish stocks, and towards an ecosystemic approach to fisheries management.
One objective of the proposal is to re-examine in depth the current legal framework governing the collection of basic data on fisheries and their use in drawing up scientific opinions. The new data collection system will cover the whole of the process, from the collection of data in ports and at sea to their use by the final users.
Another objective is to improve access to data and its use, including access to additional sets of data such as Vessel Monitoring Satellite (VMS) data. New rules have been defined to this end, as well as rules on the use of data to protect the interests of the data providers.
The Fisheries Committee amendments aim mainly at ensuring the confidentiality of such data and improving the clarity and consistency of the text. MEPs say that the connectedness of the end-user to fisheries management and research should determine his level of access to the primary, detailed or aggregated data.
Simplification of the procedures is another important goal, as national programmes will from now on be established for a 3-year period. According to the rapporteur, these multiannual planning periods will reduce the administrative burden for all parties concerned.
