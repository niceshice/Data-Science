The 18 additional MEPs envisaged by the Lisbon Treaty are a step closer to starting work. The treaty change needed to enable them to do so was approved by Member State representatives at a brief Intergovernmental Conference on 23 June, after a green light from Parliament. The 18 MEPs can start work only after EU Member States have ratified the change.
"On 6 May the European Parliament, with an overwhelming majority, gave green light to the entry of 18 new members of the European Parliament, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon. This is a decision that renews the political commitment arising from the Treaty and constitutes the response to the principle of proportionality laid down therein", said Parliament's rapporteur, Iñigo Méndez de Vigo (EPP, ES).
"Now that the Intergovernmental Conference has definitively adopted on Wednesday 23 June the allocation of those 18 seats, the process of ratification by national parliaments will begin. The EP expects this process to conclude within the shortest delay", stressed Mr Méndez de Vigo, adding that "Meanwhile, Parliament's regulation provides the possibility to welcome those 18 MEPs with the status of observers so that they can participate and get involved politically in the legislative activities of Parliament."
Parliament has not yet taken any decisions on the timetable for possibly inviting the 18 additional MEPs to act as observers in the meantime. They will acquire their full rights as MEPs only after all 27 Member States have ratified the treaty change. It is not known how long the ratification process will take.
Twelve countries will be receiving extra MEPs: Spain will get four, Austria, France and Sweden two each, and Bulgaria, Italy, Latvia, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovenia and the United Kingdom one each.
