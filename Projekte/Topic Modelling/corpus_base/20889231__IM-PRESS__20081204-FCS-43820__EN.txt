Youth Media Days draws young journalists
Young journalists listening to the opening speeches. Wednesday, 15 October The Parliament: an ideal setting for the 200 journalists to get together Look who’s talking in the interpreter’s booth 200 people from 27 EU countries – many perspectives Smiling faces and good humour abounded – also among the MEPs! 23 European languages plus 1 - sign language Many young photo journalists came with their equipment Busy atmosphere during the workshops TV food show with Belgian cook Piet Huysentruyt and MEP Frieda Brepoels The other week 200 young journalists from all over Europe descended on the European Parliament for workshops and debates. It was part of the annual "Youth Media Days" from 15-17 October that aims to help young journalists discover their trade and meet other reporters from different countries.
" Brussels at work"
The journalists were split up into 16 different workshops, where they produced radio interviews, online and print magazines, photo reports and TV shows.
The price of food, immigration, European elections and the freedom of the press were among the topics considered.
One such contribution was from Anna Morawiec of Poland. The 22-year old and her group shot a photo series entitled "Brussels at work" intended to show the many faceted faces of the European Institutions
She explained that "we want to show that EP work is more than just politicians' work, but involves lots of other people – including the cleaning-lady!"
The emphasis was very much on creating a media product to take away. Cypriot journalist Marios Psaras and his group produced a webTV show on the upcoming US elections. He commented that "the teamwork functions impressively and everything is really well-organised".
Views from MEPs - "we need your criticism"
Opening the event Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering stressed that the young journalists represented the future of the media: "We need your criticism, your commitment and your enthusiasm" he told them.
Spanish MEP Alejo Vidal-Quadras is a Vice-president of the parliament and in charge of its communication policy. At the opening of the event he called on MEPs and journalists to meet each other halfway with "mutual respect", but to keep a certain distance: "One must not forget that we do not play in the same team" he said.
The head of parliament's Communication Directorate Francesca Ratti said the EU needs "simple, direct and transparent communication” with its citizens.
The opening session also saw an opportunity for the young journalists to put their questions to a small group of MEPs in a panel discussion.
Europe "is still parted"
Austrian MEP Othmar Karas of the EPP-ED group put it down to a question of mentality: "in many people’s heads - Europe is still parted" he said. The leader of the Greens Monica Frassoni said that Europe faced the challenge of ensuring "the greatest well-being for the greatest number of people".
The Director of the European Journalism Centre Wilfried Rütten felt that the role of a journalist is changing with more interaction needed from the readers. He also said reporters "should do more than just deliver messages from politicians and lobbyists."
There was a strong feeling of a common bond during the event. Young journalist Dominika Peterova from Slovakia said after the event: "We’re all equal. There is no issue of where people are from." Frieda Brepoels of the EPP-ED group said: "This event goes beyond grey European theory – this is Europe alive!"
Competition for the event was tough with over 1,700 people applying to attend. At the end of the event all of the workshops presented their work at a social evening in "Claridges" bar in Brussels.
The contributions were assessed by each other and a jury of journalists and MEPs.

FIFA boss Blatter appeals to MEPs over "local" football
FIFA boss Blatter: wants more local players The head of world football - Sepp Blatter - has told MEPs he wants to limit the number of foreign players on the pitch to 5. He believes this will encourage clubs to develop home grown talent and to protect the local identity of teams.
Such a move from Blatter has sparked controversy as it would appear to contradict EU law - notably the right to free movement of persons. Instead MEPs on the Culture Committee prefer a "home-grown players rule" which foresees a minimum number of locally trained players.
The Swiss born FIFA boss proposes a "6+5" rule to govern local and foreign players. He set out his arguments to MEPs on the culture committee on Monday 6 October.
MEPs want "homegrown" football
In May MEPs rejected the proposed "6+5" rule by adopting a report by Greek MEP Manolis Mavrommatis (EPP-ED). This report called on countries and sporting associations in the European Union not to introduce new rules that create direct discrimination based on nationality.
Instead MEPs want the Commission to recognise the legality of measures that favour a minimum number of locally trained players. MEPs support the position of the European football body UEFA and its President Michel Platini. A position which states that a minimum number of players in a team should be trained in the club or in the same league
“National identities are lost”
On Monday Blatter stated that due to a lack of national restrictions, “the best players now play in the biggest and richest competitions in the biggest teams who have 30 good players, while only 11 can play and the other players are not available to other teams. This is morally reprehensible, it causes increasing inequalities" he said
Moreover Blatter indicated that “national identities are lost. Some teams play with 11 different nationalities, none from the country the club is from. Bayern München apparently needs 5 interpreters in their dressing room. We therefore ask to let sports be organized autonomously.”
"1 billion affected by professional football"
Mr Blatter told the MEPs that "sports is not an economic activity alone, it’s far more about culture since 1 billion people are directly or indirectly affected by professional football. We do not want to contradict EU law, the free movement of persons, but things can be changed if we really want it. Laws are not definite. We ask for your understanding, for your solidarity."
He went on to say that "it’s not only about football. The whole sports world is with us, including the football players.”
The European football body UEFA has opted for an approach which seems to comply with the principle of free movement of workers while promoting the training of young European players. Blatter views the proposed "home grown-players" however as “a contradiction regarding the protection of young players since teams will then attract young foreign players at an even younger age.”
Concerns about young players, foreign investors and racism
Belgian MEP Ivo Belet (EPP-ED) drafted a report on football last year. He said that: “We agree 100% with the objectives of the FIFA. We however have to be realistic; the 6+5 rule is in contradiction to EU law. The home-grown player rule we think is a step towards a final solution."
Several MEPs showed concerns about increased racism in football as well, which led several MEPs to ask for actions such as taking points away from teams whose fans engage in racist behaviour.
Ivo Belet stressed that parliament and FIFA “share the same concerns, such as foreign investors taking over national clubs." Belet focussed on teams such as Manchester City which has recently been taken over by a wealthy sheikh who aims to invest millions into the team, buying the best players available.
Locally funded teams
The FIFA President said he was appalled by these developments, stating in a press conference later on Monday that "clubs should be financed from the same region or at least the same country. When such an investor after a few years has had enough of a team he leaves and takes his money with him."
The 72 year old Swiss has held the post of the world governing body of football - FIFA - since 1998. His tenure has often been marked by controversy - notably over his often robust views on players and referees. He one suggested a referee should receive a yellow card after doling out several during an ill-tempered match. After speaking to MEPs on Monday 6 October Mr Blatter spoke to us and was interviewed by EuroparlTV on his proposals.

From politics to love and war - MEPs and the books they write
Former EP Secretary General Julian Priestley at the launch of his book European politics, feminism, the Yugoslav secret service and love: These are just some of the subjects current MEPs have written books about. Some have written for pleasure, some for principle and some for profit. There are also books that have sought to persuade - or to set the record straight after an event. There are also books about the European Parliament, how it works and the battles that have shaped it. Here we take a look at a few of the authors and the works they have written.
One of the most recent books launched in the European Parliament was by its former Secretary General Julian Priestley. "Six Battles that shaped Europe's Parliament" looks at the political struggles which saw its emergence as a political force in Europe.
Former Prime Ministerial musings
There are a few former Prime Ministers who are now MEPs and they have been quite prolific in their writings.
Key moments in the 1990's and the history of the European Union are just two subjects that Slovenia's Lojze Peterle (PM 1990-92) and Belgian's Jean-Luc Dehaene (1992-1999) tackle in their books. Dehaene's has the ironic title of "There is still life after 16" in reference to the address of the Prime Minister's residence in Brussels.
"If the left would have known" was written by Socialist PM turned MEP Michel Rocard with Georges-Marc Benamou. It takes a look at a half century of French politics. Mr Rocard was France's Prime Minister from 1988-1991.
Lithuania's first post-Communist President Vytautas Landsbergis (1990-1992) takes a personal look at his country's struggles against Moscow, as well as his interest in piano playing in his autobiography. Former Latvian Prime Minister Guntars Krasts (1997-98) is now an MEP for the UEN group. He struck an optimistic note about Europe in his book "The future belongs to us".
Books written from personal experience
Czech MEP Jana Hybášková (EPP-ED) used her experience as her country's Ambassador to Kuwait at the time to speak of the diplomatic build-up to the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq.
Estonia MEP Tunne Kelam has with his wife published a photographic account of Estonia's path towards independence from Soviet rule. Another former dissident - Polish MEP Bronislaw Geremek (ALDE) - last year penned a book with Robert Picht entitled "Visions of Europe". It would be the last book he wrote as in mid July this year Mr Geremek was tragically killed in a car accident.
Cem Özdemir is a Green MEP representing Germany but from a Turkish background. His book "Currywurst und Döner - Integration in Deutschland" has sparked a lively debate in Germany about the integration of the Turkish community. The role of the Yugoslav secret service during the battle for Slovene independence was a ground-breaking work by Slovene MEP Miha Brejc (EPP-ED).
Social issues and religion in Europe
Swedish MEP Maria Carlshamre of the Liberal ALDE group in Parliament penned a book called "The Unbeatable" about violence against women at home. Feminism is tackled by German Liberal MEP Silvana Koch-Mehrin who last year wrote a book "Sisters - A Pamphlet for a New Feminism".
Former Irish MEP Mary Banotti this year launched her book "There is something about Mary" which deals with the problem of abducted children. Italian MEP Mario Mauro (EPP-ED) has written a book entitled "God of Europe" about Europe, its identity and the road ahead for Christianity.
The European Parliament itself
As well as the "Six Battles that shaped Europe's Parliament" a number of books have looked at the workings of the Institution itself. British Liberal MEP Andrew Duff penned "The Struggle for Europe's Constitution" which looked in part at the Convention that met inside the parliament to draft the original document.
One of the most informative books about the ins and outs of the parliament itself is "The European Parliament" by writing trio Richard Corbett MEP (PSE), Michael Shackleton and Francis Jacobs. The success of the book among students of the parliament can be seen in the fact it has now reached its 7th edition.
Finally, books that leave out the politics
The "Pillow Book" by Hungarian Socialist MEP Katalin Levai is about a love story about a couple in Transylvania in Romania in the late1980s set against the backdrop of rapid political change.
Physics is the subject tackled by Slovenian nuclear engineer turned MEP Romana Jordan Cizelj (EPP-ED). In the science field she is joined by Bulgarian Liberal (ALDE) Vladko Panayotov who has a degree in chemical cybernetics and whose textbooks are used widely on the subject.
Finally Portuguse MEP Vasco Graça-Moura (EPP-ED) has published poetry since 1963. One of his latest books is "Night-time, my love". Find your MEP
Traffic offences - no more immunity on foreign roads
Immunity for bad and dangerous drivers may be coming to an end Drivers caught speeding abroad must no longer be able to avoid prosecution, say MEPs on Parliament's Transport Committee, who overwhelmingly voted to back a report that will make cross border law enforcement easier. Last year over 40,000 people lost their lives on Europe's roads and MEPs want coordinated European action on the causes of 75% of those fatalities: speeding, drink driving, not wearing a seatbelt and failing to stop at red lights.
The legislation is part of a European Commission initiative to halve road deaths in Europe between 2001 and 2010. At the start of this decade they stood at 54,000 a year, the target is to bring them down to 27,000 by the end of this decade.
Current rules discriminate
Research for the European Commission shows that non-resident drivers account for a disproportionately high number of road traffic accidents - particularly speeding offences. The Transport Committee believes current rules discriminate against residents who face penalties foreign drivers generally avoid.
Speaking after the vote, the Committee's rapporteur, Spanish Socialist Inés Ayala Sender, said that "with this directive we provide Member States' authorities with an instrument that could end EU foreigners' impunity... we say no to first and second league's citizens."
Enforcement of fines
MEPs back proposals to make it easier to make cross-border payments - in this case fines - whilst protecting personal privacy. The Transport Committee also wants more information exchange between EU members, through an electronic data exchange network. Finally, if a motorist refuses to pay a fine, the matter would be passed on to the authorities in their home country, who could force them to pay.
Roads in Baltic States 3 times as dangerous as Sweden, The Netherlands
There are huge disparities in road safety across the 27-member EU bloc. Generally speaking, road travel is most dangerous in Greece and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. For example you are three times more likely to die on the roads in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia than in Sweden and the Netherlands, which have among the safest roads in Europe. Some improvements have been made - France and Portugal have cut road deaths by 40% since 2001. In France it is estimated this has saved 3,500 lives.
MEPs will take an initial vote on this legislation during the October plenary.

"1000 bucks for a hazardous sea voyage" scoops web journalism prize
Finland's Pete Pakarinen won for his article on immigration Immigration is one of the most politically emotive issues that Europe faces. As the population ages the debate over the extent we allow people into the continent will increase, not diminish with time. Pete Pakarinen's emotive article "a thousand bucks for a hazardous sea voyage" has explored the issue. On Friday he won parliament's journalism prize for his work on the internet. We spoke to him.
You were awarded the EP Journalism Prize, in the domain "online media". Could you explain to us why you chose your subject and summarize your article?
I wrote about illegal immigration from Africa to Europe, and more particularly about the situation in Malta from the point of view of an immigrant who was staying for about two years in an immigration centre there. He had come to Malta by boat from Africa, so I described the normal immigration route from Africa by boat and the life-threatening boat trip, which cost something like one thousand dollars. Then I described the broader immigration problems and the measures about to be taken in order to solve them. After one year, I can say the situation hasn't changed a lot.
I chose immigration because I was in Malta at the time, as I was attending a study day organised by the EPP-ED group, and because immigration is a very crucial question in Malta. Then I had the possibility to visit the immigration centre, read a lot of newspapers, talk with different people and thus I have structured a typical reportage-kind of article from all this material.
Do you think that the online media has any added value in comparison with the other media? And, if so, could online media one day threaten the existence of other media - print, radio, TV?
On the web, the stories are shorter and more rapidly produced. Besides, there are lots of people who search background information from the internet, so the stories live longer than articles in printed media.
However, I don't believe that online media can threaten the other media. The death of a book has been announced for decades or perhaps hundreds of years, but books are still alive and kicking. The same stands for radio
Are citizens of Europe well aware of European issues in your opinion and, if not, how can the media or institutions like the European Parliament increase awareness?
Online media can indeed help raise awareness on European issues, as well as any other media. There is plenty of information available but there could be more journalistic information about the structures, the decision-making processes and all the things that are difficult to understand about the EU. The difficulty in reaching people though is that quite a lot of people just search for scandals or funny news and that every single story competes with all the other ones.
The public could be well informed if it is interested. I think it is the politicians' job to make their work interesting and important, and simplify the difficult things, not only the European politicians, but the national politicians too. In Finland but I suppose the situation is pretty much the same everywhere national politics doesn't see the value of the European news, they blame everything on the EU or they look at the EU as if it was one monolithic block.
What is your message today to Europeans citizens?
I would just say look closer to the EU, to what is happening there, how it functions, what it really decides. There are quite magnificent, great things happening in the EU. I am myself quite enthusiastic about the EU, even though there are also downsides. Be interested; ask the politicians about the EU and how European politics correlates to our everyday life. Right now many politicians think they are alone in the world.

Airline security rules: are we safer or have they gone too far?
Agree to disagree: Philip Bradbourn and Ignasi Guardans In August the European Commission finally issued a list of what you can and can't take on planes. The list was initially compiled in 2003 and covers everything from banning liquids in amounts over 100 millilitres to golf clubs and scissors. It also sets out the powers of airports to search passengers - including removal of clothing. Are the measures justified or are they too much? We talk to two MEPs - one who supports them and another worried about civil liberties.
Do you find these basic standards on aviation security sufficient?
British Conservative MEP Philip Bradbourn is Vice-Chair of Parliament's Civil Liberties Committee. "The problem is how those rules are actually applied by aviation authorities. The new proposal that came through on aviation security was to have almost a one-stop shop throughout Europe, so that people were not unduly inconvenienced, but that, of course, relies on the whole of the EU airport industry, actually applying the existing rules consistently and safely".
Spanish Liberal MEP Ignasi Guardans: "The standards are both too safe and not safe enough; there is never 100% security in anything, and some of them are based on unproven statements. In my opinion, the whole issue of liquid prevention is a sort of show to give an impression of security, which has no substantial evidence. Of course, if you forbid cars near airports, you will prevent a car bomb, but that does not mean that it is proportional, that it is intelligent to do that".
Have you ever experienced an incident at an airport or found security overbearing?
Bradbourn: "Some airports manage the security process very efficiently and effectively because they have the right number of staff, they have the right amount of equipment, so the passengers are not inconvenienced unduly. In other airports there never seem to be the right number of staff to deal with passengers.
It is not the security itself that is overbearing, because it's needed, it's how that security is implemented. It's not only staff, but having the right equipment and equipment that actually functions at peak periods...It's about planning the equipment so that people are not inconvenienced, not more than they have to be for the necessary reasons, obviously to make sure that the aircraft flies safely. I never felt it to be overbearing. I always say that I would rather be safe at 35,000 feet than not".
Guardans: "I had one in Spain which I brought to a judge. It was an abuse of authority mostly based on the fact that the regulation was secret until some days ago. This fact would allow every single police officer throughout Europe to decide when to search you; some are implementing rules that have no legal basis at all. Like the shoe issue; there is no legal basis in European law to force a passenger to remove shoes before going though the metal detector.
In European airports people are forced to accept things they would never accept in any other place. It is as if the police ask you to dance in Trafalgar Square to check if you are drunk. Nobody would accept that because that is not the way to do it. In airports, under the pretext of security and with a secret regulation, police officers could do whatever they wanted. The European Commission has a huge responsibility for having kept the rules secret and for introducing some irrational, unpractical rules. And EU members have a huge responsibility for not implementing the rules, now that they are published, in a proper and rational way".
What do you think should be the attitude of passengers at security checks?
Bradbourn: "I think they have to understand that given the threats that we face in Europe and elsewhere these days, a level of security is going to be required, basically to keep them safe. It's frustrating when you're kept in a queue, but that's not because of the requirement for security itself, it's the way it is implemented. I think basically most people understand now that they have to go through these checks. Sometimes there is an inconsistency between different Member States of the EU as to how that threat level is assessed and whether you need to heighten security ".
Guardans : "Passengers should know that airports are not an exception to democracy. They have the same fundamental rights in front of an airport police officer that they have when they are in the middle of the street, which means they have to protest any attitude that is not covered by the law; only what has a specific legal coverage can be required from you. Unfortunately, when people travel they are under stress and the only thing they want to do is to take the flight, and they are prepared to waive rights that normally they would not. Citizens should be able to contest; maybe take a photograph, or be able to identify any security officer by the number of the badge".
"In European airports people are forced to accept things they would never accept in any other place. It is as if the police ask you to dance in Trafalgar Square to check if you are drunk"
