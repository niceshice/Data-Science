Europe - could the Obama effect work?

Newspapers across Europe greeted the inauguration with enthusiasm The life story of President Obama and all that he embodies has boosted America's image in Europe. However, the old continent has not yet produced a similar figure and many are asking if it is indeed possible. We spoke to some young MEPs about opportunities for a similar "European dream".
Spanish MEP Antonio López-Istúriz of the centre-right EPP-ED group was clear about the symbolic importance of the inauguration: "The myth of Obama has broken some negative stereotypes of the States. In the US dreams can become true. Someone without any possibilities has an opportunity within American society."
"We should learn lessons"
Mr López-Istúriz, a 38 year old law graduate, went on to say that: "In all European countries we should learn lessons, because we are very quick to criticise the US. With all the immigration we have let's see when something like this will happen in Europe."
Dutch Liberal Member Sophia In't Veld told us "in Europe, it's not so much about working your way up but about community, equality, freedom and a safe environment."
Dan Jørgensen, a young Danish MEP in the centre-left PSE group commented: "We have already fulfilled a very important European dream of creating a continent in which we don’t kill each other. There are also many other values that we share about human rights, sustainable development, the spreading of democracy and helping the poor countries."
Will Europe ever have an elected President?
If the Lisbon Treaty is passed, the role of a President of the European Union will be created. However, the President of the EU will be chosen by governments rather than by people voting.
For Mr López-Istúriz "it would be fantastic" if one day Europeans could vote in an election for a "European list" of candidates for the presidency. "We hope that this becomes a reality in the future" he told us.
For Jørgensen a President "will solve some of the practical problems. There might be a chance that we get a very charismatic and popular leader who understands how to use his new role and who can help to build a European identity".
However, Ms In't Veld was pessimistic: "It is not going to work because there won't be elections for the European President."
Is there a place for a European Obama?
We put it to MEPs whether there is a place for a European Obama. Dan Jørgensen was less enthusiastic: "Not to the same extent, the US is one nation and the EU is not. We might experience something similar if someone had a very clear voice on a topic that would interest a lot of people as for instance about environment."
For Ms In't Veld: "We don’t have that tradition. Leadership in Europe is not embodied in one single person, it is about working together. It is easy to gather around one person but in Europe we work in a less glamorous way."
"If you want to influence people, the EU is the place"
We finished by asking about young politicians like themselves and what role they can play in modern Europe.
Dan Jørgensen said he believed that "a lot of young European politicians have acknowledged that if they want to make a difference, then the place to be is in European politics. Many of the big issues like global warming and financial crisis are impossible to deal with on a national level. So if you want to influence people, the EU is the place to do it."
