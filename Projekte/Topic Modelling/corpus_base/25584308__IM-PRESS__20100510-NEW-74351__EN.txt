Economic crisis to top Parliament's plenary agenda
2010-05-14 - 12:20
MEPs will debate the massive new eurozone lending facility, and associated proposals to improve economic governance, with the Commission and Council. Political groups will ask how the Commission and the Council plan to make economic co-ordination mechanisms more effective and what role they foresee for the Commission and the European Parliament in the task force to strengthen economic governance. Another debate focuses on the Europe 2020 plans to improve long-term economic competitiveness (both debates on Wednesday, votes on Thursday) . The current ECOFIN Council chair, Spain's Finance Minister Elena Salgado, will also have a discussion with the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee (Wednesday).

Common EU rules to facilitate safe organ donations
2010-05-14 - 12:20
People needing liver transplants or other organ donations should face shorter waiting times if on Wednesday the plenary backs a compromise, agreed by EP and Council negotiating teams, on a draft EU law setting out quality and safety standards for transplantation of human organs. MEPs will also vote on an own-initiative report on the Commission Action Plan on organ donation. Over the past 50 years organ transplantation has become an established practice worldwide and is often the only possible treatment. Yet the queues are long - about 60,000 patients are now on waiting lists in the EU - and every day 12 people die while on a list. EU common quality and safety standards would facilitate organ donation, transplantation and exchanges among EU countries. Parliament's observations on the draft directive are set out in a report by Miroslav Mikolášik's (EPP, SK).
Guaranteeing quality and safety
A key step is to designate the competent authority in each country responsible for quality and safety standards for human organs intended for transplantation. These authorities will have to establish rules for all stages from donation to transplantation or disposal, based on the quality and safety standards laid down in the directive. Member States may keep or introduce more stringent rules if they wish. The compromise text stipulates minimum data which as a rule needs to be collected for each organ donation. It also asks Member States to ensure that healthcare staff involved are suitably qualified or trained.
Living donors and fighting organ trafficking
Member States must ensure the highest possible protection of living donors, say the compromise amendments. Human organ donations must be "voluntary and unpaid" but MEPs add that "the principle of non-payment shall not prevent living donors from receiving compensation, provided it is strictly limited to making good the expenses and loss of incomes related to the donation". Member States must also ban advertising the need for, or availability of, human organs where the purpose is financial gain. If the directive is approved, then Member States must transpose it into their national laws within two years of its entry into force.
Action Plan on Organ Donation and Transplantation (2009-2015)
In a separate own-initiative report by Andres Perello Rodriguez (S&D, ES), MEPs welcome a Commission Action Plan on organ donation and stress that appointing transplant donor co-ordinators in each hospital and swapping information and best practice will help countries with low organ availability to improve their donation rates. Environment Committee MEPs urge Member States to consider enabling citizens to join a donor register when applying for a passport or driving licence and to include references their on national ID cards or driving licences identifying them as organ donors.

Energy efficiency: final vote on measures to cut consumption
2010-05-14 - 12:20
New energy efficiency measures for buildings and the new layout of the EU energy efficiency label will be put to a plenary vote on Tuesday. These measures - which come in addition to the EU's 2008 climate change package - were agreed with the Council last year but have to be endorsed by the full Parliament. The new energy efficiency legislation will help consumers to cut their energy bills and the EU as a whole to hit its climate change target of using 20% less energy by 2020. Member States' building codes will say all new buildings must have near-zero energy consumption and also require regular inspections of boilers and air conditioning systems. Mandatory labels for household appliances and energy-saving products will help consumers to assess running costs.
Energy-saving buildings
All buildings built from the end of 2020 onwards must have high energy-saving standards and be powered to a large extent by renewable energy. Public authorities' building projects are to lead the way two years earlier. Part of the funding for these changes will come from the EU budget.
Where feasible, the energy performance of existing buildings will have to be improved during major renovations. When renovating, owners will be encouraged to install "smart meters" and replace heating, hot-water plumbing and air-conditioning systems with high-efficiency alternatives such as heat pumps.
Efficiency label for household appliances and other products
A new layout of the energy efficiency label for household appliances and other energy-saving products allows for additional classes (with "A+++" for the most energy-efficient products) but limits the total number of energy classes to seven. Furthermore, in future any advertisement promoting price or energy efficiency of fridges, washing machines or ovens will have to indicate the product's energy class.
Buildings account for around 40% of the EU's total energy use and are Europe's largest source of emissions, so improving their energy performance would help achieve CO2 emission reduction goals. If, for example, conventional double glazing was replaced by low-emission windows, around €4 billion and 25 million tonnes of CO2 could be saved each year.

Resettling refugees: volunteer host countries could receive €6,000 per person resettled
2010-05-14 - 12:20
EU Member States volunteering to welcome third-country refugees could receive up to €6,000 per resettled person under a draft law, as amended by the Civil Liberties Committee, to be put to a plenary vote on Wednesday. EU Member States currently contribute far less to refugee resettlement than do other developed countries such as the USA, Australia and Canada. On Tuesday, MEPs should also approve the setting up of a European Asylum Support Office, further to an agreement with the Council. The EU contributed to only 6.7% of the global resettlement of refugees in 2008, with 4,378 individuals. The UNHCR estimates that 747,000 are in need of resettlement. To date, only ten EU Member States have taken part in any resettlement schemes.
To encourage more Member States to help in resettlement, the funding should be increased to €6,000 per person for the first year for Member States applying for the first time, €5,000 in the second year and €4,000 thereafter. The additional amount that newly participating Member States receive must be invested in developing a sustainable resettlement programme.
The resettlement programme will follow a number of EU priorities, upon which Parliament and the Council have yet to agree. MEPs wish priority to go to children and women at risk of violence or exploitation, unaccompanied minors, persons with serious medical needs, and survivors of violence and torture. The Council wishes to establish priorities according to the geographic origin and nationality of refugees.
Asylum: an agency to assist Member States
Parliament is likely to approve the creation of a European Asylum Support Office when it votes on a report by Jean Lambert (Greens/EFA, UK), also on Wednesday. Based in Valletta (Malta) the office will lend its expertise to Member States receiving asylum seekers. It will strive to strengthen co-operation among national authorities, and afford administrative support to Member States subject to particular pressure. Parliament and the Council agreed at the second reading to assign the office the task of co-ordinating information exchange on resettlement actions carried out by Member States.
Finally, the decision establishing the European Refugee Fund will be amended to ensure that it is adequately funded - MEPs will vote on a report by Claude Moraes (S&D, UK), to this end. MEPs call for EU money for Member States willing to host refugees - Committee press release 27.04.10 Establishing a European Asylum Support Office Establishment of a joint EU resettlement programme European Refugee Fund ERF 2008-2013 (amend.

"Made in" labels could become compulsory for clothes
2010-05-14 - 12:20
"Made in" labels would become compulsory for clothes sold in Europe if Parliament backs Internal Market Committee amendments to a proposed EU labelling system on Tuesday. Country of origin labelling must be made mandatory to ensure that consumers are not misled by labels suggesting clothes were made in an EU Member State rather than a third country (such as China or Pakistan), say Internal Market Committee amendments to proposals for an EU labelling system. "Made in" labels are currently voluntary, and in practice their use depends on national laws.
New textiles to hit the market faster
Current EU legislation on textile labelling applies only to the harmonisation of textile fibre names - there are currently 48 fibres (18 natural and 30 synthetic) sold on the single market - and the labelling of the fibre composition of textile products.
Although Parliament was initially asked to vote only on a technical proposal by the Commission (aiming at cutting the time taken to place new fibres on the market), MEPs turned this into a more political proposal, to make country of origin labelling mandatory in the new regulation.
To help consumers to make informed choices, MEPs will ask the Commission to table a report within two years, and if necessary a proposal for legislation to impose the new labelling requirements EU-wide. This report should examine the harmonised requirements on care labelling (currently voluntary), clothes and footwear sizes and health and safety warnings (flammability, possible allergenic substances).

Self-employed women should have same maternity leave rights as employees
2010-05-14 - 12:20
EU Member States should grant standard social protection, including at least 14 weeks' maternity leave allowance, for self-employed women and for spouses or life partners of self-employed workers, says a proposed update of an EU directive, to be put to a plenary vote on Tuesday.
Compromise amendments added by the Women's Rights Committee say it should be up to Member States to decide whether paying for membership of social insurance schemes (covering maternity leave, sickness, invalidity and old age), must be mandatory for self-employed women or whether they may contribute to these schemes voluntarily.
The EU is to update an existing law to give standard social protection rights to self-employed women and the spouses or life partners of self-employed workers. These spouses or life partners are not employees, but they nonetheless habitually assist in the work of the self-employed worker (frequently in farming, small firms and liberal professions).
Self-employed women, and self-employed workers' spouses or life partners, could either be given the opportunity to pay to join a social coverage scheme or could be obliged to do so, as each Member State chooses, stress MEPs in a controversial compromise amendment negotiated with the Council at the second reading.
In any event, any pregnant self-employed woman or self-employed worker's spouse or life partner would be entitled to 14 weeks' maternity leave, i.e. the minimum paid maternity leave laid down for employees by the EU maternity leave directive. Again, it will be up to Member States to decide whether the leave is mandatory or voluntary, and whether this social protection must also be "proportional to the participation in the activities of the self-employed worker".

EP to adjust its budget to new Lisbon Treaty responsibilities
2010-05-14 - 12:20
MEPs will vote their own budget on Wednesday, firstly, to adjust the 2010 budget to enable the Parliament to cope with its new Lisbon Treaty responsibilities and secondly to set out the details of a budget for next year. The 2010 budget adjustment will pay for hiring 150 more staff and raising the secretarial allowance by €1,500 per MEP per month. After a compensatory cut in the buildings budget, it will increase the whole budget by €9.4 million or 0.6%.
Parliament will be the second institution to receive "Lisbon money" for 2010, since the European Council and its President received an additional €25 million at the end of last year. The Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee have also asked for Lisbon-related increases in their budgets, of €6.4 million and €4.14 million respectively.
The resolution on next year's budget will give Parliament's negotiating team a mandate for the upcoming 2011 budget negotiations with the Council.

Europe 2020 growth and employment strategy
2010-05-14 - 12:20
Parliament's observations on the EU 2020 growth and employment strategy will be set out in a resolution to be voted Wednesday, further to a plenary debate in Brussels on 5 May. MEPs will also debate oral questions on the strategy, and vote Thursday on reports by Louis Grech (S&amp;D, MT), on delivering a single market for consumers and citizens, Liem Hoang (S&amp;D, FR), on the long-term sustainability of public finances, and Lambert van Nistelrooij (EPP, NL), on funding for research and innovation. Single market to drive the Europe 2020 strategy
Strengthening the single market will be vital if the Europe 2020 strategy is to deliver protection to citizens and consumers. To this end, the EU should pass a "Single Market Act" by May 2011, setting out priority areas for action to create a sustainable and competitive social market economy and covering both legislative and non-legislative initiatives, says the draft resolution prepared by the Internal Market Committee.

Lorry drivers' working hours: include the self-employed?
2010-05-14 - 12:20
Self-employed bus and lorry drivers must be subject to the same rules as those employed by companies, say Employment and Social Affairs Committee MEPs. Parliament could back this view in a vote on Thursday, by rejecting a draft law that would treat self-employed and employee drivers differently. Arguments for rejection include health, safety and the need for fair competition in the industry. MEPs will vote in plenary on whether or not to reject a Commission proposal to exempt self-employed drivers from the 2002 working time directive for the road transport industry. Amendments initially tabled by the S&D, Green and GUE groups, seeking to reject the proposal on the grounds of driver health and safety, road safety and fair competition, were approved by a comfortable majority of Employment Committee MEPs on 28 April.
If self-employed truck drivers were to be included in the directive covering employee drivers, they would also be subject to other common rules, e.g. on loading and unloading, assistance to passengers, cleaning and maintenance, and police and customs formalities. Current legislation for employed drivers sets a weekly limit of 48 hours a week on average, which can rise to 60 hours a week provided the average of 48 hours a week over a four-month period is not exceeded. Rules on working hours must apply to self-employed commercial drivers too, say MEPs

Breathing new life into the Union for the Mediterranean
2010-05-14 - 12:20
The second summit of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) in Barcelona on 7 June will take place in difficult circumstances, but MEPs will ask on Thursday that the process be given a new boost. The fresh impetus that the UfM needs will require a historic commitment by heads of state and government to provide adequate funding for major projects and consolidate the institutions underpinning the process, says a draft resolution by Vincent Peillon (S&D, FR). The UfM has stagnated since the Gaza conflict of December 2008, even though meetings of ministers and senior officials resumed in September 2009.
Educational exchanges
Most new UfM projects must be devoted to teaching, school and university exchanges and research, including upgrading the Erasmus Mundus programmes for the Mediterranean and creating a Mediterranean Erasmus junior programme to step up educational exchanges between UfM Member States, said Foreign Affairs Committee MEPs. Members also stressed that the UfM's institutional architecture will not be complete without parliamentary scrutiny of the process, which should be devolved to the Euromediterranean Parliamentary Assembly (EMPA).
Revitalise the Barcelona process
Launched in July 2008 in Paris, the UfM sought to revitalise the Barcelona process by structuring co-operation with the Mediterranean countries around six major projects (civil protection, maritime and land highways, de-pollution of the Mediterranean Sea, a Mediterranean solar energy plan, the Mediterranean Business Development Initiative and a Euro-Mediterranean university).

Making life easier for farmers
2010-05-14 - 12:20
Any reform of the Common Agricultural Policy must clarify its rules, says a draft resolution to be voted on Tuesday. MEPs propose to make farmers' lives easier by creating a single payment system, simplifying rules on electronic identification of animals, and even creating a helpdesk phone line for farmers in each EU Member State. This resolution is part of a wider debate on how best to reshape EU farm policy in time for the EU's next multi-annual budgeting period, which starts in 2013. .

Financial support for decommissioning Bulgarian nuclear plant
2010-05-14 - 12:20
MEPs will vote Thursday on a proposed Council regulation to provide an extra €300 million in EU financial support for decommissioning the Bulgaria's Kozloduy nuclear power plant. All four reactors there have now been shut down, but the extra funding is needed until the end of 2013 to decommission them safely, says the proposal. Parliament's resolution says that of the €300 million total, €180 million should go to ensure safe decommissioning and €120 million should be used to fund energy-saving measures. This funding would be additional to €210 million in EU support for 2007-2009, agreed under Bulgaria's EU accession treaty.
Under that treaty, Kozloduy was to be decommissioned by 2009, but the work was not completed on time. Bulgaria therefore asked that the EU funding be extended until 2013, to allow it to be completed safely. Parliament is now being consulted on the proposed extension. Slovakia and Lithuania have received similar extensions in the past.

Volcanic ash cloud: MEPs to question Commission on EU response to crisis
2010-05-14 - 12:20
On Tuesday evening, MEPs will ask the Commission to assess the EU's response to the air travel paralysis caused by ash from Iceland's Eyjafjallajökull volcano in April.
Transport Committee MEPs will ask the Commission about progress in developing a "mobility action plan" to help the EU cope better with such crises. They will also want to know how the Commission plans to tackle the industry's reluctance to comply with EU passenger rights legislation. Lastly, MEPs will insist that financial assistance to the aviation sector should be fairly distributed EU-wide.
The oral question, on the EU's response to the volcanic ash crisis, is tabled by Brian Simpson (S&D, UK) on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. Oral questions

Special measures to help EU outermost regions
2010-05-14 - 12:20
Special exemptions from EU agricultural policy rules for the Azores and the Canary Islands will be put to a plenary vote on Tuesday. This vote would confirm a deal, agreed by Parliament and Council negotiating teams last week, that would enable the Azores to continue supplying sugar to the rest of the EU, but gradually reduce its export ceiling from 3,000 tonnes a year in 2011 to zero after 2015, and allow the Canary islands to import 800 tonnes of milk-based preparations a year for industrial processing.
The exemptions from EU farm trade and production rules would help protect the economic and social stability of these EU regions, whose remoteness and difficult topography make them economically dependent on just a few products, says Luís Paulo Alves (S&D, PT), who tabled the proposals.
Azores: sugar export exemption to be prolonged, but gradually phased out
As EU milk quotas are to be abolished in the near future, sugar beet production could become a very important alternative for the Azores, and particularly for São Miguel Island.
The deal would prolong an exemption that allowed the islands to export up to 3,000 tonnes of sugar a year to the rest of the EU until 1 January 2010 (when it expired). However, it would gradually reduce the ceiling on these exports by 500 tonnes each year, from 3,000 tonnes in 2011 to 1,000 in 2015 and zero thereafter.
Canary Islands: milk powder to be recognised as "traditional" product
Due to the Canary Islands' structural milk deficit, skimmed milk powder containing vegetable fat has become a "traditional" product and substitute for milk. An exemption from EU rules allows the islands to receive up to 800 tonnes per year of milk-based preparations for industrial processing. Parliament and Council representatives agreed to amend the Commission proposal, which would have prolonged the exemption for 10 years, so as to make it permanent.

South Caucasus: EU must help stabilize the region
2010-05-14 - 12:20
EU strategy must seek stability, prosperity and conflict resolution in the South Caucasus, says a resolution to be voted on Thursday. The region is central to EU energy interests, because the South Caucasus Pipeline carries gas from the Caspian to the Black Sea.
Comprehensive strategy needed
Armenia , Azerbaijan and Georgia have been EU Neighbourhood Policy partners since 2004, but a comprehensive strategy for the region is still lacking, says the resolution, drafted by Evgeni Kirilov (S&D, BG). MEPs want the EU's South Caucasus strategy to focus on resolving conflicts, promoting democracy, human rights and the rule of law, and fostering economic cooperation and social development.
The region's geopolitics are complicated by conflict in Nagorno Karabakh and Georgia, as well as tensions between Armenia and Turkey. These open and "frozen" conflicts obstruct economic and social development note MEPs, who voice concern over recent increases in military spending.
Energy security
MEPs back efforts to strengthen EU-South Caucasus co-operation in energy projects, and in particular the Nabucco pipeline.
Background - upcoming elections in Georgia
MEPs call for measures to ensure that international electoral standards are respected in Georgia's local elections on 30 May. The EP Foreign Affairs Committee will send an ad-hoc delegation of seven MEPs to observe these elections. South Caucasus: EU must play greater role in stabilising the region, say MEPs

Ukraine: MEPs to vote on €500 million loan
2010-05-14 - 12:20
Ukraine could get an EU loan of up to €500 million to help it out of the financial crisis, if approved by the full Parliament on Tuesday.
The loan would help Ukraine to finance its balance-of-payments deficit and meet external financing needs. It would supplement IMF support and EU €110 million in EU macro-financial assistance granted in 2002. The loan would be available to Kiev for 30 months.
The lending conditions must improve the efficiency, transparency and accountability of the assistance, stresses the International Trade Committee, which approved the proposal on 17 April. Progress must be regularly assessed by the Commission, and Parliament must be briefed on how the assistance is managed, add MEPs.

Sustainable debt levels and economic governance in the EU
2010-05-14 - 12:20
A resolution on the long-term sustainability of public finances, to be voted on Thursday, calls for more thorough debt surveillance and says the Commission should assess the quality of Member States' debts and oversee their debt statistics. Tougher supervision of financial markets is essential to ensure the long-term health of national budgets, it adds.
The Commission will also be asked about next steps towards stronger EU economic governance and whether it plans to propose legislation establishing a binding framework for strong EU surveillance of economic policies.
Transparency on debt
The resolution stresses the need constantly to monitor Member State budgets and regularly to publish information on debt contracted through public-sector spending and social security payouts, e.g. via pension schemes. Public spending and payouts need to be less wasteful, but remain efficient, if public finances are to become sustainable without jeopardising social policy, says the resolution.
The resolution calls on the Commission to assess the quality of Member States' debt. It blames poor statistics for the markets' loss of faith in public finances, and says the Commission should be empowered to control Member States' reporting obligations.
Stability and Growth Pact rules
The resolution notes the deficiencies of current Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) rules and says they are not up to the task of harmonising Member States' fiscal and economic policies. It also asks Member States to treat the SGP's 3% deficit limit not as a target, but as a ceiling never to be breached.

EU faces legal hurdles to joining Human Rights Convention
2010-05-14 - 12:20
The EU is required by the Lisbon Treaty to join the European Convention on Human Rights. But before doing so, it needs to clarify relations between the Court of Human Rights (Strasbourg) and the European Court of Justice (Luxembourg) and decide how to appoint an EU judge under the Convention.
The case for joining is set out in a resolution to be voted Wednesday.

MEPs urge third countries to ratify International Criminal Court Statute
2010-05-14 - 12:20
Ten years after the International Criminal Court (ICC) was established, MEPs will vote a resolution Wednesday calling on all countries to ratify its founding Rome Statute. Of the 139 countries that signed the statute, 111 countries have ratified it so far, including all 27 EU Member States. China, India, Russia and the US are among those that have yet to do so.
Ratification is necessary to allow full co-operation with the Court and ensure that crimes against humanity or genocide do not go unpunished. Some MEPs suggest that the statute should be incorporated in EU law.
EU Member State representatives at the ICC's first review conference (Kampala, Uganda, 31 May to 11 June) will focus on proposed amendments to the Rome Statute, inter alia to define "the crime of aggression" and will review the Court's work and impact so far.

Road transport: rule breakers should pay similar penalties EU-wide
2010-05-14 - 12:20
Lorry drivers who break rules on working time, rest periods or working conditions, should pay clear and comparable penalties across the EU, says a resolution to be voted Tuesday. The text criticizes wide disparities in EU Member States' fines for similar offences, and calls for closer harmonization and co-ordination of penalties, in the interests of road safety and fair competition.
Fines for exceeding the daily driving time by more than two hours are currently ten times higher in Spain (€4,600) than in Greece (€400). The methods used to determine the gravity of an offence also vary among Member States. For example, Belgium takes both daily driving time and total uninterrupted driving time into account, but others do not, and some Member States treat holding more than one valid driver's card as a minor offence, even though it is defined as a "very serious" one by EU legislation.
In the resolution drafted by Hella Ranner (EPP, Austria) and approved by the Transport Committee in April, MEPs call on Member States to find "legislative and practical ways" of reducing the differences in the types and levels of penalties applied. Minimum and maximum penalties should be laid down for each offence against these rules, they say. The text also urges Member States to increase the frequency of checks carried out by their national authorities, and to invest in more rest facilities and parking spaces along their motorway networks.

Europe needs to boost university-business cooperation
2010-05-14 - 12:20
Calls to strengthen education-business links, increase computer literacy, foster mobility and volunteering, encourage life-long learning and combat youth unemployment are set out in three non-legislative resolutions to be voted by Parliament on Tuesday. MEPs also call for more private and public investment in universities, with safeguards for their autonomy.
Safeguard academic autonomy
The draft texts encourage firms to expand apprenticeships and provide more university scholarships. Nevertheless, "universities should in all circumstances maintain the autonomy to decide over their curricula and governance structures", and not become financially or intellectually dependent on business. "Higher education remains a public responsibility and therefore public financing to universities is needed in order to preserve equal financing to all fields of study, including humanities", say Culture Committee MEPs.
Universities are also urged to broaden access to their study programmes and adapt them to the needs of adults. MEPs call for "legal recognition of a universal right to life-long education" and further development of experimental, distance, electronic and blended forms of learning. They also ask for a better EU legal framework to facilitate mobility of students and lecturers and between universities and business.
Young and unemployed
Worried at "the increasing numbers of young people who are unemployed, under-employed or who have no job security", MEPs urge EU Member States to support the education of ethnic minority children in their mother tongues. They call on Member States to eliminate all kinds of discrimination, and improve sex education so as to help counter "the continuing high level of under-age pregnancies".
