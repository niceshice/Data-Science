Against a backdrop of more economic growth and jobs across the Eurozone, MEPs have called on EU members use this opportunity to reduce deficits and create surpluses. A resolution adopted during the July Plenary session also called for a "policy debate on the application of the convergence criteria" due to economic disparities. With all 12 states that joined EU in 2004 and 2007 obliged to join the currency when their economies are ready, it also wants more information on the euro for the public.
This year Slovenia became the 13th country to adopt the euro and the first of the 2004 intake to do so. In January Cyprus and Malta will follow suit.
Sound public finances key
The resolution also calls for EU members to improve the quality of public finances with investment in education, training, research and innovation. The need for better information in the countries due to join the euro is also highlighted.
Despite this influx there are concerns that other states will find the convergence criteria set at Maastricht in 1992 hard to meet. That summit set five criteria: budget deficits below 3% of GDP, public debt less than 60% of GDP, an inflation rate within 1.5% of the three countries with the lowest rates, long-term interest rates within 2 points of the three best performing countries in terms of price stability and exchange rates within "normal" fluctuation levels.
In 1992 there were 12 EU countries - now there are 27. That is one reason the resolution calls for a debate on entry criteria - in particular the inflation test. Many states have high growth - and high inflation. However, the resolution says the convergence criteria must be applied in line with the Treaty.
2 million new jobs created in 2006
Last year Eurozone GDP grew 2.7% - the highest growth since 2000. With the creation of 2 million new jobs there is renewed confidence across Europe.
The man who drafted Parliament's report - Polish PES member Dariusz Rosati - called on EU members to take advantage of this opportunity while it lasts: "2006 was a very good year but there are some worrying signs as well. If members do not take the opportunity to benefit from this excellent recovery to put their public finances in order - what will happen when bad times come?" He went on to say that countries "should use this opportunity to reduce their deficits to zero".
Commenting on the overall performance of the euro, Italian MEP Mario Mauro called for the completion of the EU's internal market as a way of boosting Europe's economy. If this does not happen he warned, "not all countries can compete at an equal level - especially with some of them running with boots full of sand".
When Cyprus and Malta join the euro it will be the currency of almost 320 million people. Slovakia is expected to be the next country to join - possibly in 2009.
