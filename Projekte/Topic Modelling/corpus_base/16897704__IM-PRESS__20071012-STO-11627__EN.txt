EU budget 2008: every cent counts
MEPs meeting next week in Strasbourg will have the task of adopting the EU's draft 2008 budget as it receives its first reading on Tuesday. For the first time ever there is more money allocated for growth and job creation than for agriculture. The EP's Budget Committee has already looked at the € 129 billion proposals and called for more funding for the Galileo satellite system, the planned European Technology Institute and the EU's commitments in Kosovo and the Palestinian territories.
The Commission's proposed budget allocates € 57.2 billion to boost growth and employment. Investment in research, transport and energy networks and lifelong learning programmes form the core of this funding. The amount allocated shades the € 56.3 billion for agriculture and natural resources. This new shift prompted European Budget Commissioner Dalia Grybauskaitė to call the proposals "a historical shift for the EU".
Innovation and Galileo earmarked for more funding
One of the most important tasks of an MEP is to scrutinise and then vote to adopt the EU budget for the following year. The Parliament goes through the budget item by item and literally thousands of amendments can often be made in late night sessions. From the amendments emerge what Members would like to see as key priorities for the following year. For this year's budget, the Council of Ministers have already shaved € 717 million off the proposals so far.
The Budget Committee has already pointed to a number of areas where it would like to see changes and increases of expenditure. At a glance some of them are;
Increased spending to fund the board of the proposed European Institute of Innovation and Technology. Last month MEPs voted to support the creation of the Institute.
€ 739 million of increased funding for the Galileo satellite project to allow it to be completed on schedule and be totally funded by the EU budget.
Usage of a "flexibility clause" to allow an extra € 87 million to be used for the EU's commitments in Kosovo and the Palestinian territories.
Reduce funds allocated to foreign and security policy and use the money instead to finance other foreign policy objectives such as "the EU as a global partner".
Why are these important to the Budget Committee?
The planned European Technology Institute is the brainchild of Commission President José Manuel Barroso and is aimed at improving innovation in Europe. As well as more funding for the board, MEPs on the Budget Committee also want a new budget line established to fund for the "Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) which are expected to be key aspects of the Institute.
Galileo is an attempt to create a navigation system that is independent of the much used American GPS system. The latter is a creation of the US military and Europe is keen to develop its own system for navigation, environmental observation, transport management and mapping purposes.
There is agreement in the Council of Ministers, the European Commission and among MEPs on the Budget Committee that more money is needed for EU commitments in Kosovo and the Palestinian territories. The Budgets Committee believe a flexibility instrument" should be invoked to draw an extra € 87 million in funding.
What happens next?
Parliament’s first reading of the budget will take place in Plenary session on Tuesday 23 October. Negotiations with the Council will take place on 23 November. The final budget for 2008 is scheduled for adoption at Parliament’s second reading in December.
