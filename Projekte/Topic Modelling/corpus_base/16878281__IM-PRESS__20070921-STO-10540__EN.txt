From among the many interesting topics on Tuesday's plenary agenda, take a look at MEP reactions to dangerous toys from China, the main benefits of a common EU foreign energy policy and the reform of the sugar market.
Discussing toy safety , in the context of recent worries about Chinese manufactured toys, MEPs urged clear standards and information. British Conservative Malcolm Harbour said, "Consumers are entitled to more and better information," while Dutch ALDE member Toine Manders said "If we do not reach 100% safety, then at least we must reach 100% accountability." Toy safety is currently covered by the Toy Directive, which leaves it to makers and importers to ensure that products are safe and the authorities informed if there is a problem. Enforcement is at a national level.
German Socialist Evelyne Gebhardt said, "Our goal is to reach the highest standards...we need to do a lot in the EU to have safe products just 3 months before Christmas and we are angry it has taken the Commission so long to reform the Toy Directive.” Non-attached British MEP, Jim Allister approached the issue from another angle. “If we had not decimated our own manufacturing industry by punitive regulation, then maybe now we would not be so dependent on China."

Should the EU have a common foreign energy policy?
The own-initiative report by Polish conservative Jacek Saryusz-Wolski looks at ways to face challenges to energy security. It advocates a common foreign policy for energy based on the principles of diversification, unity in defending EU's interests ,solidarity and strengthening cooperation between partners; transit and consumer countries based on reciprocity. "The EU has to be determined, active and united" he said.
EP wants sweetners to help stop sugar production
The European Commission wants the EU sugar industry to cut production by 6 million tonnees by 2010. If the industry can't make the cuts, then the Commission plans to impose "linear quotas". While the Parliament backs the reform, it suggested increasing compensation to producers and regions to encourage them to cutback rather than having to impose quotas. The latest reform follows failed 2006 plans to cut prices and production.
EU ministers have the final say over sugar reform and are expected to reach a common position later this week.
