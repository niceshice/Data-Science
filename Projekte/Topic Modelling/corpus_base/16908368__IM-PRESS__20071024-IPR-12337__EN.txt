MEPs adopted a non-binding report on laying down the rules according to which one Member State is to supervise suspended sentences, or alternative sanctions, contained in a judgment given in another Member States.
The purpose of the Framework Decision is to facilitate a sentenced person's reintegration into society, to provide better protection for victims and society as a whole and to facilitate the enforcement of appropriate suspended sentences, alternative sanctions and conditional sentences in the case of offenders who are not resident in the State in which they were sentenced.
The European Parliament underlines that the Framework Decision should apply only to the recognition of judgments and the transfer of responsibility for the supervision and execution of suspended sentences, alternative sanctions and conditional sentences, and for all other subsequent decisions provided for in this Framework Decision.
Objectives
As to the objectives, the report says the Framework Decision should seek to facilitate the social re-integration of sentenced persons, to improve the protection of victims and society and to facilitate the application of appropriate suspended sentences, alternative sanctions and conditional sentences in the case of offenders who are not resident in the sentencing State. With a view to achieving these objectives, this Framework Decision should lay down rules pursuant to which the Member State, in which the sentenced person has his lawful and ordinary residence, should recognise the judgments passed in another Member State and should supervise and execute suspended sentences, alternative sanctions and conditional sentences.
