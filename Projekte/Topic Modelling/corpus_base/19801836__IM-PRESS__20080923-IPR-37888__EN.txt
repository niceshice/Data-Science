International Tropical Timber Agreement not enough to protect forests
External/international trade

The House welcomes the conclusion of the 2006 ITTA (International Tropical Timber Agreement) but considers that the outcome falls well short of what is required to address the loss of tropical forest. MEPs therefore call on the Commission and Member States to increase the financial resources available for the conservation and ecologically responsible use of tropical forests and to promote economically viable alternatives to destructive logging, mining and agricultural practices.
Public procurement policies should require timber and timber products to be derived from legal and sustainable sources so as to encourage public authoritiesâ€™ practical commitment to good governance in forestry and to combat corruption, says the resolution.
Labelling initiatives enabling consumers to be confident that the timber they are buying is not merely legal but originates from sustainably-managed forests as potentially usefully supplements to international agreements could be useful.
MEPs regard the proposed trade agreement with the countries of south-east Asia to be of particular importance. They consider that any agreement must contain a meaningful sustainable development chapter which addresses the issues of forest preservation and the fight against illegal and unsustainable logging.
Assent of Parliament
MEPs consider that the agreement requires the assent of Parliament under Article 300(3), second subparagraph, of the EC Treaty.
