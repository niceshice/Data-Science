The European Parliament welcomed the start of negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Bosnia-Herzegovina, but stressed that the pace of negotiations will depend on the ability of the Bosnian, Serb and Croat communities to reach agreement on necessary constitutional and institutional reforms. In a resolution adopted by a large majority, MEPs said that the EU should support the countryâ€™s political forces and citizens more actively in their search for a consensus.
MEPs referred in particular to the development of a proper legal framework and efficient public administration and reforms of public broadcasting, police, defence and intelligence. They also stressed that full cooperation with The Hague Tribunal is a precondition for closer relations with the EU and asked the authorities to renew efforts for the sustainable return of refugees.
Among other things, MEPs supported the initiative to set up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and stressed that the parliamentary elections in October 2006 will be crucial. They pointed out that the policing financed by the EU has proved to be quite efficient and reiterated its calls for strengthened cooperation with the Balkans countries on border control.
