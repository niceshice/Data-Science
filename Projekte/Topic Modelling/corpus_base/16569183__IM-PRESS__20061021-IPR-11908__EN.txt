2006-10-26 - 15:20
MEPs adopted an own-initiative report on EU-Syria Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement. The House is convinced that the association agreement could give a decisive impetus to the political, economic and social reforms needed to improve the country’s situation. Parliament reiterates, however, that respect for democratic values, human rights and civil liberties are prerequisites, and that, to this end, an effective control mechanism should be included in the agreement’s human rights clause.
The report adopted with 453 votes in favour, 11 against and 15 abstentions calls, in particular, for greater respect for ethnic minorities and reiterates the need to maintain freedom of religion.
MEPs believe that anchoring Syria firmly within the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership will reinforce Syria’s relations with the Member States of the European Union and its partners in the Southern Mediterranean, and facilitate the Middle East peace process.
The House asks the Council to strengthen its initiatives with a view to deepening the cooperation between the EU and Syria and ultimately signing that agreement, while taking account of the following recommendations:
· encourage and support actions by the Syrian Government towards the establishment of a democratic system;
· call on Syria to respect Lebanon’s sovereignty and abstain from interfering in its internal affairs, in particular by stopping arms supplies and preventing Hezbollah militias from rearming in full cooperation with UNIFIL, and make renewed efforts so as to restart a credible peace process in the region leading to a comprehensive settlement and the restitution to Damascus of the Golan Heights;
· take account of the political signals emanating from the tenth regional congress of the Baath Party, of which the most conspicuous is the change in the leadership team to include younger figures close to President Al-Assad, as is shown by the appointment of Abdallah Dardari as deputy prime minister;
· give particular attention to the application of the clauses in the agreement seeking to make public contracts more transparent; call on the Commission to ensure that other bilateral or multilateral agreements follow that approach;
· call on the Syrian Government to adopt measures in the fields of democracy and human rights so as to comply with international human rights law as regards respect for freedom of expression, the protection of human rights defenders, the prevention of and the fight against torture and the abolition of the death penalty; in particular, draw attention to the necessary reform of the Syrian associations law so as to end all major restrictions as regards the activities of human rights organisations;
· nevertheless, put to the Syrian Government its serious concerns about the absence of progress in such areas as opening up to multi-party politics and respect for human rights and civil liberties;
· point out that respect for human rights constitutes a vital component in this association agreement and call on Syria to respect its commitments within the framework of the Barcelona Process and along the lines of the European Neighbourhood Policy; call on Syria in this perspective to do what is needed to immediately lift the state of emergency;
· call on the Syrian Government to reconsider the case of political prisoners and release all prisoners of conscience and peace activists, and to allow the existence of groups such as the signatories of the Damascus Declaration, signed on 16 October 2005 by five proscribed parties and by independent personalities, and the signatories of the Beirut-Damascus/Damascus-Beirut Declaration of 14 May 2006; call on Syria to ensure that detained or imprisoned persons are well treated, not subjected to torture and are given prompt, regular and unrestricted access to their lawyers, doctors and families; MEPs encourage the Syrian Government to cooperate fully with the Lebanese Government, in accordance with the agreement of 5 May 2005 between the Prime Ministers of Syria and Lebanon, to obtain concrete results in the cases of disappearances of Syrian and Lebanese nationals, within the purview of the joint investigative commission created to that end;
· denounce before the Syrian Government – as Parliament has done in its above resolution of 15 June 2006 – the wave of arrests in response to the Beirut-Damascus/Damascus-Beirut Declaration, the first joint initiative by Syrian and Lebanese intellectuals and human rights defenders, and call for their immediate release;
· address the concerns of the European Union with regard to respecting the rights of religious and other minorities, and of the Kurds in particular; call on the Syrian Government to report on the state of progress with these issues;
· re-open a genuine dialogue with Syria with a view to involving it in peace efforts towards an overall settlement of the Middle East conflict;
· urge Syria to play a constructive role in the implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions 1559 and 1701, and call on it specifically to step up controls on its side of the Syria-Lebanon border so as to prevent the supply of arms to non-state entities;
· point out that cooperation by the Syrian authorities with the UN International Independent Investigation Commission headed by judge Brammertz has improved, but insist that it is further stepped up and that practical action is taken to follow up the investigation and comply with its findings;
· insist that Syria fully complies with UN Security Council Resolutions 1559, 1562, 1680 and 1701 and with the European Council’s declaration on Lebanon of 16 and 17 June 2006, which call on Syria and Lebanon to delineate their common frontier to reinforce regional stability; call on Syria to make a positive contribution to the clarification of the final status of the Shebaa Farms area in accordance with the UN Secretary-General’s recommendations of 12 September 2006 and in compliance with international law;
· note positively in this connection the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanese territory; yet call firmly on the Syrian Government to establish formal diplomatic relations with Lebanon, which has so far been refused, and to stop supporting Hezbollah;
· call on the Syrian Government to give an account of its practical actions to combat the proliferation of weapons and against terrorism and al-Qa’ida and on the control of its frontiers to prohibit the smuggling of weapons and the crossing of terrorists into neighbouring countries;
· deplore in this connection the signing of a military agreement concluded with Iran on 15 June 2006 on strengthening mutual cooperation in the face of American and Israeli ‘threats’;
· draw the attention of Syria to the importance of its potential role in the Near and Middle East for the peaceful resolution of conflicts in the region; address the concerns over Syrian support to Damascus-based Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad at the expense of moderate Palestinian forces that seek coexistence and peace with Israel;
call on the Syrian Government to improve the living and environmental conditions of Palestinian refugee camps in Syria in accordance with international human rights standards;
· call on the Syrian Government to release Yacoub Hanna Shamoun, an Assyrian Christian who has been incarcerated for over twenty years without due process or a release date in the near future;
· exercise caution in the repatriation to Syria of immigrants and refugees belonging to religious minorities as long as repression continues; and, in any event, improve coordination of the different Member States’ national approaches to this issue;
· call for support for a dialogue between Syria and Parliament on these various points, so as to go forward with the cooperation between the EU and Syria with the expectation of signing the association agreement.
Finally, Parliament requests the Council to consider additional incentives and benefits for Syria, going beyond those granted through the association agreement, in order to encourage Syria to review its current foreign policy and regional alignment in ways that will help promote regional peace, stability and prosperity and, in particular, recognition of the State of Israel’s right to exist and support by Syria for progress in the Middle East peace process.
