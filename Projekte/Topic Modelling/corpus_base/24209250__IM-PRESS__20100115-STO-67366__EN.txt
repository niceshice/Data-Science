The News: Malmström stands firm - Damanaki fishes for approval - Jeleva withdraws candidacy On Tuesday morning MEPs questioned Swedish nominee Cecilia Malmström and Greek Maria Damanaki. On the latter's fisheries brief she said that environmentally sustainable fishing and fishing incomes were priorities. Ms Malmström said that it was time to evaluate piecemeal decisions of the past and to develop justice and home affairs policies more consistently. She underlined that no country could deal with challenges such as terrorism or immigration alone.
Malmström: Fight against terror a priority
On immigration Ms Malmström said that "we need immigration, and we need migrant workers to know that while in Europe they have a set of rights". She also stressed their responsibilities to the European societies they came to.
Turning to terrorism she told the Civil Liberties Committee that: "The fight against terrorism will be one of my priorities...we should review all the tools and mechanisms. Perhaps there is duplication, or conversely something missing. We must strive to respect the integrity, the principle of proportionality and human rights ".
The Swedish European Affairs Minister stressed her determination to get a favourable agreement in the EU on the transfer of SWIFT data.
Concerning organised crime and in particular criminality by the Mafia she said she would work with Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding as such problems "were not only Italian but European. Organised crime knows no frontiers" she told MEPs.
Maria Damanaki: "striking the right balance"
Ms Damanaki told MEPs that "there is drastic overfishing". To reduce it without striking a blow to fishing communities, she proposed modernisation of the resources, for example equipping vessels with selective gear that helps to eliminate discards.
She welcomed the fact that under Lisbon Treaty fisheries will be subject to the ordinary legislative procedure, giving an even greater role for the European Parliament.
She said that the ongoing reform of the Common Fisheries Policy will look for more efficiency by "striking the right balance", among the interests of consumers, fishermen, industry, tourism and related activities. "I will be proud to contribute to blue growth", she added, adding that she would examine whether the European Social Fund could give assistance to those who may have to stop to work because of the reform.
Ms Damanaki agreed on the need to develop the aquaculture sector "as much as we can", given that the EU imports more fish than it produces. She also stressed the importance of fighting piracy, saying that "the EU has to make sure that its vessels can fish securely, especially off the Somali coast".
