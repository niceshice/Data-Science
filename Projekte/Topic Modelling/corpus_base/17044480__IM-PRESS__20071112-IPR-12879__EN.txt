2006 budget discharge: MEPs expect "significant progress" in co-managing EU spending
Budgetary control
2007-11-13 - 17:52
Further to the publication of the Court of Auditors' annual report, the European Parliament is starting the 2006 discharge procedure determined to get results on the management of the EU budget. In its report, the Court flags up a still-considerable number of errors, notably for the structural funds. MEPs are calling for substantial progress in co-managing Community spending.
For the thirteenth consecutive year, the Court of Auditors has not delivered a positive "declaration of assurance" (DAS) for the EU budget. Financial 2006 was marred by errors in the legality and the regularity of underlying transactions. The progress made remains insufficient to enable the Court to present a satisfactory report.
However, "errors" should not be confused with "fraud", as the Court states in its report: errors affect the final beneficiary and concern either amounts or procedures. Every case of fraud discovered is in any case notified to the EU Anti-Fraud Office.
Catastrophic deficiencies
The monitoring system in place in the Member States for the structural funds still has "catastropic deficiencies" said Budgetary Control Committee Chairman Herbert Bösch (PES, AT). "It is imperative that the situation should improve, and we are counting on firm support from the European Commission to achieve significant results", he said.
Dan Jørgensen (PES, DK), for his part, called for the implementation of "national declarations", requested by the European Parliament in the three previous discharge exercises, which would ensure that Member States assume their responsibilities for co-managing the EU budget. "The European Parliament will play its role as EU spending watchdog. The Court of Auditors conclusions show that worrying weaknesses remain, especially for the structural funds. We expect clear responses from the Commission to enable us to take the right decision on the 2006 discharge".
Next steps
The 2006 discharge procedure begins formally with the presentation of the Court of Auditors report. The hearings of the Commissioners responsible for the large spending headings begin next week, with Ms Benita Ferrero-Waldner, Mr Louis Michel (Tuesday 19 November) and Ms Mariann Fischer Boël the next day. The full calendar of hearings is available below.
In April 2008, Parliament must give its opinion on the discharge to be given to all European institutions and agencies, for the 2006 accounts. MEPs have three options: grant a discharge, postpone it, or refuse it (follow "press kit" link below).
An audio file of the press conference given by Messrs Bösch and Jørgensen is available via the link at the bottom of this release.
