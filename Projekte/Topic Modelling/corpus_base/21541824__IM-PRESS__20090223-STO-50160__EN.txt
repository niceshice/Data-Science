Budapest, Hungary. Described by the photographer as the "Paris of the east" "Love can be ambiguous, politics must be crystal-clear” is the title of the latest photo to be chosen from all those sent in over the last month. We asked people to send us their ideas on "the art of politics" and you can see some of the photos we received in a special flickr account. The photo chosen was taken by Wouter Van Waeyenberg.
Mr Van Waeyenberg is from Geraardsbergen in Belgium. In addition to being an amateur photographer he is studying graphic design in Ghent.
Regarding his photo he said: "The photo is taken on the static historical part of the 'Paris of eastern Europe' (Budapest). It shows a view of the vibrant Pest where culture, religion and economy merge into one". He talks about the bright future of love (using his personal life as a concrete example,) in contrast with the dark future of humanity. "We all must act now against pollution, but politicians first because they have the biggest impact on problem solving".
Thanks to all our participants for sending their photos Our next topic is pollution and how to solve it . So send us your photos and you could be our next guest photographer.
