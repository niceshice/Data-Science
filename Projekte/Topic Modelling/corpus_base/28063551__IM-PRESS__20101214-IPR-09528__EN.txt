Crime victims to get EU-wide protection
Justice and home affairs
Plenary sittings
2010-12-14 - 12:57
Victims of crime who have been granted protection by law in one EU Member State will be able to request similar protection if they move to another EU country, under the rules of the European Protection Order approved on Tuesday by the European Parliament.
Measures to protect victims of crime already exist in all EU Member States but at present they cease to apply if the victim moves to another country. The European Protection Order (EPO) will enable anyone protected in one EU state to apply for protection if they move to another EU state.
"We wish to send a clear message to the Council: EU citizens want to live in a genuine area of freedom, security and justice and to be protected wherever they are in Europe", said Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio (EPP, ES), Women's Rights Committee rapporteur. "We must think of the victims, of the people who are frightened and who want to live in peace. With this proposal we have the opportunity to save lives and we should be proud of that". "The European Protection Order is a first small step, but it's the beginning" of a broader framework for the protection of victims' rights in the EU, she concluded.
"We want an instrument that provides effective protection. The law should resolve conflicts, not create them", said Carmen Romero López (S&D, ES), Civil Liberties Committee rapporteur. "With today's vote we want to send a strong message to the Council. It is now up to the Council to shoulder its responsibilities", she said.
All crime victims to be covered
MEPs voted to make it clearer that the rules will cover all victims of crime, not just victims of gender violence. Most protection measures are granted to women victims of gender violence but an EPO could cover any other type of victim too. "This directive applies to protection measures which aim at protecting all victims and not only the victims of gender violence, taking into account the specificities of each type of crime concerned", says the text of the legislation as amended by MEPs.
The rules will apply to a victim or potential victim who needs protection "against a criminal act of another person which may, in any way, endanger his life, physical, psychological and sexual integrity […] as well as his dignity or personal liberty". Such acts would include harassment, abduction, stalking and "other forms of indirect coercion".
Keeping aggressors away
An EPO may only be issued if the aggressor is banned by the Member State of origin from places where the protected person resides or which they visit, or if restrictions are imposed on contact or approaches by the aggressor to the protected person.
Leeway for the authorities to decide appropriate measures
The Member State to which the victim moves will have “a degree of discretion to adopt any measure which it finds adequate and appropriate under its national law" to provide protection to the victim.
Protection of victims' relatives
Thanks to MEPs, an EPO may also be requested to safeguard relatives of a beneficiary of a European Protection Order.
The text of the EPO, as approved today by Parliament by 610 votes to 13 with 56 abstentions, is based on a compromise worked out between Parliament negotiators and the Belgian presidency. It must still be confirmed by a qualified majority of Member States in the Council. Once the directive is adopted, Member States will have three years to transpose it into national law.
