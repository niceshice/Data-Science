Opposition leader and prisoner of conscience
Aung san Suu Kyi is Myanmar’s best-known prisoner of conscience. She spent most of the time between 1989 and 2011 under house arrest because of her efforts to bring democracy to military-ruled Burma/Myanmar. She was freed from house arrest in November 2010.
Aung San suu Kyi received the Sakharov prize for freedom of thought in 1990, the same year that her party National League for Democracy won an overwhelming victory in an election later annulled by the military regime. Because of the house arrest, she was not able to attend the award ceremony in the European Parliament.
In 1991 Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
