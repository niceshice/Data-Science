Shadow of a woman with a raised hand holding a pen It looks set to be a busy 12 months for MEPs with the economic crisis continuing, a raft of energy and transport issues on the agenda and negotiations on reforming the Common Agriculture Policy.
The parliament will be involved in talks to set up a reinforced economic union to tackle the financial crisis, it will also consider rules on credit rating agencies, eurobonds and a financial transaction tax.
Improved combined transport solutions, safer roads and more efficient air transport are on the agenda, as are new rules on air passenger data and cheaper roaming.
Energy efficiency and the security of energy supplies will be at the top of the Energy Committee agenda, while rules to make cross-border successions and cross-border property issues less complicated will be in plenary in the first part of the year.
Read on to find out more about some of the key issues before the EP this year.

Weighty topics on economics agenda
Bureau de Change, Rome ©EPA/CLAUDIO ONORATI It is going to be a busy year for members of the Economics Committee with the international agreement on a reinforced economic Union, eurobonds, a financial transaction tax and credit rating agencies among the weighty topics on the agenda in the coming months.
The EP's representatives in the working group drafting the international agreement on a reinforced economic Union - German Christian Democrat Elmar Brok, Italian Socialist Roberto Gualtieri and Belgian Liberal Guy Verhofstadt - say all future decisions should be based on the normal EU procedure in order to ensure democratic accountability and respect of parliament's legislative role. A final version of the agreement is expected to ready by the end of January so that it can be signed by heads of states at the beginning of March.
The committee wants measures to reduce reliance on credit ratings by the "big three" agencies and to limit their direct impact on countries´ borrowing costs. MEPs want the conflict of interests between agencies and the companies they asses to be addressed. A report by Italian Socialist Leonardo is expected to be voted in July.
In December MEPs backed a Commission green paper on eurobonds , which they see as a source of stability for euro zone countries if the Commission can make the system attractive for AAA countries as well as heavily indebted ones. They will also consider an own-initiative report, drafted by French Liberal Sylvie Goulard, giving a more detailed reaction to the green paper.
A majority of members support the idea of introducing an EU financial transaction tax , which according to the Commission could raise up to €57 billion a year. Greek Socialist Anni Podimata will steer the proposals through the EP; a vote in committee is scheduled for April and in plenary for June. Economics Committee
MEPs want safer roads, better cross-border systems, more combined transport
Eurostar Train on high speed rail link ©BELGA_Pressassociation_G.Fuller Better cross-border EU transport systems, more efficient air transport and safer roads are among the key issues on the agenda Transport Committee in the year ahead.
The EU has 5 million km of roads, 212,800 km of rail lines and 42,700 km of navigable inland waterways. As transport and traffic volumes increase, MEPs want to make transport more efficient, removing bottlenecks and bringing a greener touch to transport policies.
Transport networks
Road, air, rail and sea routes are included in the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) , which aims to create better cross-border transport infrastructure in Europe. The network was first created in 1996 but now the focus has shifted towards resolving bottlenecks and promoting combined transport solutions and intelligent transport systems.
Also on the agenda is the proposed Connecting Europe Facility , which aims to boost Europe's transport, energy and digital networks through targeted investment in roads, rail, energy grids, pipelines and broadband networks. The idea is to fill missing links and promote greener and environmentally friendly solutions.
Safer roads
Another key initiative for 2012 is safer roads and MEPs will be trying to make tachograph fraud more difficult, while reducing the administrative burden on companies. The tachograph is a device designed to monitor that drivers of heavy goods vehicles and coaches take enough breaks.
Air and rail
MEPs will consider proposals on the future of regional airports, aviation noise, ground handling and airport slot allocation.
And almost 10 years after coming into force, legislation on railways will be streamlined to bring existing rules together in a more coherent form. Transport and Tourism committee
Energy efficiency, security of supply top agenda
Model of a house with energy efficiency chart to the left ©BELGA_Monkey Energy efficiency and security of supply will be at the top of the agenda for the Energy Committee in 2012. MEPs will also look at the safety of offshore oil and gas operations, try to better co–ordinate external energy policy and boost Europe's energy networks.
Energy efficiency
The EU spends more than €400 billion a year importing energy but efficient energy use could save consumers and businesses money and reduce pollution from global warming. In coming months, MEPs will vote on the energy efficiency directive , which aims to cut energy consumption 20% by 2020.
Reduction of energy use by 1.5% a year, an annual 3% target for the renovation of public buildings, new guidelines for public contracts, the promotion of energy–efficient housing through double glazing and cavity wall insulation are among the proposed measures, along with cogeneration, energy auditing and better information for consumers.
Offshore safety
The EP will consider tougher safety and environmental rules for offshore oil and gas drilling . The Commission proposal was made in the wake of the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. MEPs last year said that the development of new gas and oil fields in European seas should only be allowed if the operators have adequate emergency plans and sufficient funds to repair possible damage to the environment.
Security of supplies
The EU imports more than 60% of its gas and 80% of its oil and this figure is rising. In general energy supply contracts are concluded between commercial entities. However sometimes major energy deals, mostly concerning the building of gas pipelines, are negotiated between European governments and non–EU countries like Russia and Libya.
In order to ensure that those deals are in line with EU energy market rules and security–of–supply aims, MEPs will vote on a proposal allowing the European Commission to examine the agreements between member states and foreign suppliers in the field of energy.
Connecting Europe
To allow individual EU countries to have security of supply, alternative supplies or transmission routes are vital and the EU plans to use €9.1 billion from its 2014–2020 budget to modernise and extend Europe's energy infrastructure, to ensure that no member state is isolated from the European network.

CAP reform, dairy, food quality
A vineyard covered in poly tunnels ©BELGA/AFP/F.VON ERICHSEN The reform of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy will remain centre stage as MEPs work on the much criticised proposals from the European Commission in October. Also on the Agriculture Committee's agenda in 2012: support for dairy farmers, food quality labels, food aid and bluetongue vaccination.
MEPs will draft six reports on reforming the CAP, aimed at making it fairer, simpler and more effective. Agriculture will account for around 37% of the EU's 2014-2020 budget - a budget that still has to be finalised and that is vital to the discussions because it will set annual spending ceilings.
The main issues concern a fairer distribution of funds between old and new member states, environmental criteria for 30% of direct payments, setting aside 7% of arable land and capping subsidies for the largest farms at €300,000.
Food quality labels, aid
February looks set to be packed with agriculture issues. MEPs are expected to approve an overhaul of the 20-year-old food quality labelling scheme to help EU food producers compete with imports from third countries by promoting quality and diversity. New rules will make it easier to register agricultural products and foodstuffs according to geographical and authenticity designations.
In December, the EP and the Council agreed to continue the EU's €1 billion food aid for deprived people until 2013, a decision MEPs are expected to endorse in February.
Support for dairy farmers
They are also expected to back an agreement reached in December to give farmers more bargaining power in negotiations over prices for raw milk in preparation for the end of milk quotas in 2015.
Bluetongue vaccination
Also scheduled for February, a vote allowing the more effective use of vaccines against bluetongue , a mosquito–borne disease that affects cattle, goat and especially sheep. It will also cut red tape for farmers. CAP reform proposals Food quality legislaton Dairy farm proposals Food aid More on bluetongue vaccination
Roaming, passenger name records, EU patent, collective redress
Man sitting in a deckchair on a beach talking into a mobile phone ©BELGA/ILOVEIMAGES New roaming rules set to be approved later this year will determine how much operators can charge mobile users when abroad. Over the coming months, MEPs will also debate how air passengers' data could be used to combat criminal offences and they will decide on rules about EU-wide patents that could improve the competitiveness of European businesses.
Lower roaming prices
Making a phone call, sending a text message or browsing the net on your mobile phone while abroad in the EU could get cheaper thanks to the new roaming rules in the pipeline. The Commission is proposing the following maximum charges from July 2014:
24 euro cents a minute for outgoing call
10 euro cents a minute for incoming calls
10 euro cents to send a text message
50 euro cent per megabyte for data download
However, German Christian Democrat Angelika Niebler, who is steering the legislation through the EP, thinks that maximum prices could be even lower. MEPs will vote on the new rules, including the right for mobile users to choose their roaming provider when abroad, in April.
Use of passenger name record (PNR) data
New legislation to be voted in May will clarify which authorities would have access to PNR data - information provided by passengers and collected by air carriers - and under what terms. The aim is to help combat organised crime.
Unitary patent to help businesses
Getting EU-wide patent protection is a costly and complicated affair requiring a patent to be validated in each EU country. Proposals for a unitary EU patent, due to be voted in February, would give patent protection in all 25 EU countries who have signed up to the proposal (Italy and Spain are not participating) and should foster innovation and boost competitiveness.
Seeking justice collectively
Also in February MEPs are set to decide on an own-initiative report proposing collective redress at a European level. It would allow victims of unlawful behaviour to bundle claims they would not otherwise pursue individually (for example because the cost of seeking individual redress might be disproportionate to the damage sustained), but should not allow abusive litigation.

Cross-border relationships - which court, what legislation?
Hand writing a will in French ©Belga/BELPRESS As it becomes easier to live and work across the EU, the number of relationships involving people from different countries is rising and that raises concerns about issues such as what legislation applies to property and inheritance, which court deals with any problems and the recognition of legal decisions across borders.
In 2012 MEPs will consider a series of proposals covering judicial cooperation in civil affairs and setting criteria clarifying which legal system applies when more than one member state is concerned.
Cross-border successions
Eight million European live outside their country of origin, 2 ½ million properties are owned by people residing in other countries and 450,000 EU successions a year (around 10% or €123 billion) have a cross-border dimension. The European Certificate of Succession aims to make it easier to settle inheritances issues and avoid disputes by determining which court is competent and which law applicable.
It proposes that jurisdiction and law applicable to a cross-border succession is based on the deceased's habitual place of residence. But, those living abroad would be able to opt instead for the succession to be governed by the law of their country of origin. The aim is to reduce the risk that different member states issue contradictory decisions. The proposals should be voted in February.
Property of transnational couples
In March the EP will turn its attention to matrimonial property regimes and property consequences of registered partnerships for transnational couples, who can face difficulties particularly over dividing property in the case of separation or death. The aim is to ensure that all procedures related to the property are dealt with by a court in a single EU country.
