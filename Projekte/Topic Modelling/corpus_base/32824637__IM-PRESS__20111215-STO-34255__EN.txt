The final plenary session of 2011 marked a number of endings - Jerzy Buzek's term as EP president, Poland's six months at the head of the council of ministers, this year's Sakharov Prize with the award of the prize to representatives of the Arab uprising and phosphates in detergents. But it also marked a number of beginnings - a single permit for non-EU citizens, the EU protection order and fairer treatment for those arrested abroad.
The big debate concerned the outcome of last week's EU summit , including the UK's veto of changes to the EU treaties; click below to read our summary. So what else happened?
Ten years after 9/11, the EU should reassess its counter-terrorism policy in terms of cost, effectiveness, impact on civil liberties and democratic scrutiny, MEPs said Wednesday.

MEPs gave eight candidates for the EU's Court of Auditors the green light on Tuesday and approved France's candidate Benoît Coeuré, for the European Central Bank's Executive Board on Wednesday.
The EP agreed to €1.3 billion in funding for nuclear fusion research over the next two years on Tuesday.
The EU should breathe new life into relations with its neighbours to the South and East but any engagement must be conditional on their progress towards democracy and respect for human rights, MEPs said Wednesday.
MEPs approved €24.5 million to help 3,582 workers made redundant by Renault and seven of its suppliers find new jobs under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund Thursday.
Last but not least, MEPs welcomed 17 new colleagues, of the 18 extra MEPs agreed under the Lisbon Treaty. The final member from the Netherlands will arrive once their name has been notified to the EP, bringing the total number of MEPs to 754.
