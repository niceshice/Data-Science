The Piraeus Court of First Instance asked Parliament to waive Mr Toussas' immunity to enable it to conduct criminal proceedings against him. He is accused of having knowingly defrauded, for the benefit of another party, the property of the Greek Merchant Seamen's Fund (NAT), with whose management was entrusted.
Mr Toussas told the Legal Affairs Committee that the criminal proceedings against him were politically motivated. However, the committee found no grounds to accept this claim and therefore recommended that his immunity be lifted.
