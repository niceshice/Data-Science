January's gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine exposed the EU´s dependence deep on Russian energy. Two new energy projects - Nabucco pipeline and Desertec - should help Europe diversify energy supply.
The EU today imports over half its energy from abroad: 42% of the imported gas comes from Russia, of which 80% pass through Ukraine. Many Eastern European member states are more or less a 100% dependent on Russian gas supplies.
The Nabucco pipeline
In July, four EU countries (Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Austria) and Turkey signed an inter-governmental agreement on the legal framework for the Nabucco gas pipeline. Unlike the South stream and Nordstream pipelines, Nabucco will be totally independent of Russian gas. Azerbaijan is seen as the most likely supplier, but also countries such as Iraq, Turkmenistan and even Iran are mentioned as possible suppliers in the future.
According to plans, the 3,300 km pipeline will run through Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary to Austria, carrying 30 billion cubic meters of Caspian natural gas to Europe annually, once it becomes fully operational. The European Union has approved 200 million Euros in investment for the project .
However, Nabucco isn't the final answer to Europe's energy needs. The pipeline will only cover 5-10% of Europe's total gas demand. Nevertheless, it has an important symbolic importance for Europe's energy policy of diversification of gas supplies and transport routes.
DESERTEC: Sun is a shining source of clean energy
The sunny desert belts north and south of the tropics extent around the globe cover about 40 million km² and receive within half a day - 6 hours - more energy from the sun than humankind uses in a year. Furthermore, solar energy does not compete with plants in desert zones, it does not harm environment and it allows countries to widen their energy portfolio fit for generations to come.
On 13 July, a group of European companies and the DESERTEC Foundation signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the aim to put the DESERTEC Concept into effect in the EU-MENA Region. The world's most ambitious solar power project is meant to develop carbon-free energy that could supply up to 15 percent of Europe's needs by 2050, in the deserts of North Africa.
