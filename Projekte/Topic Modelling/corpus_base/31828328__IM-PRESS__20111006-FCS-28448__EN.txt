LUX Prize - spreading cinema around Europe
Marc Bordure, producer of winning film "Les neiges du Kilimandjaro" This year's LUX cinema prize went to French film "Les neiges du Kilimandjaro" and after the awards ceremony producer Marc Bordure, who picked up the award on behalf of director Robert Guédiguian, told us how this story set in dockyards of Marseilles is about the whole of Europe, the web and the new challenges we face today.
What interest does this "local" movie from Marseilles have for all EU citizens?
"Les neiges du Kilimandjaro" is about universal values that are fundamental elements of the European identity. It's about "Liberté, Egalité et Fraternité". It may seem obvious but in this period of crisis we have to be aware and careful about a slide into xenophobia.
What does it mean to win the LUX Prize?
If I want to see a Polish movie in a French cinema, it's still very difficult. The LUX Prize will allow a bigger circulation of the movie. Subtitling the movie into the 23 official languages of the EU will awaken the interest of local distributors! Promotion and distribution are very important today and the web is beginning to take a role in the cinema industry.
How can EU institutions support cinema in Europe?
A lot has been done. The system of co-productions works quite well and as a French producer I've co-produced movies in Irish, Swedish and Georgian partnerships. We should invest more on cinema and its distribution. We should also be careful about the fiscal dumping (the use of lower taxes to unfairly attract investment). Interview on EuroparlTV
"Les neiges du Kilimandjaro" wins 2011 LUX film prize
Jerzy Buzek awards 2011 LUX Prize to producer Marc Bordure for "The snows of Kilimanjaro" The winner of the 2011 LUX film Prize is "Les neiges du Kilimandjaro" by French director Robert Guédiguian. Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek today presented the prize to the film's producer, Marc Bordure, at a formal ceremony in its Strasbourg plenary chamber. The film questions the injustices of today's societies and their political and trade union conflicts, and makes a plea for tolerance.
The other two finalists were "Attenberg" (Greece) by Athina Rachel Tsangari and "Play", (Sweden-France-Denmark).
Presenting the prize, Parliament's President Buzek said "The European Parliament's LUX film prize serves as a reminder that what unites us is stronger than what divides us. It reminds us that the values, freedoms and indeed self-criticisms we share, are worth fighting for. It also reminds us that European movies have nothing to envy non-European productions."
At the ceremony, the film's producer, Mr Bordure, said on behalf of Robert Guédiguian: "The values of Europe are, for me, linked to the idea of the Republic - this Republic which Jean Jaurès, under whose auspices my film is placed, called a 'social Republic': liberty, equality and fraternity are qualities that Europe also owes it to itself to defend [....] Please do not abandon the poor people of Victor Hugo, a symbolic figurehead of both film and Europe, in the 'icy waters of egotistical calculation'."
The European Parliament's LUX prize is awarded each year to films illustrating values that constitute European identity, the diversity of cultures in Europe or debate on the European Union integration process.
The €90,000 prize money will pay to sub-title the winning film in the EU's 23 official languages, adapting the original for people with visual or hearing handicaps, and the cinema launch or production, in each Member State, of a 35mm or digital copy.
Since its creation in 2007, the LUX Prize has gone to "Auf der anderen Seite" by Fatih Akin (2007), "Le Silence de Lorna" by Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne (2008), "Welcome" by Philippe Lioret (2009) and "Die Fremde" (Allemagne) by Feo Aladag.
Parliament's support for European cinema includes specific legislation to promote the diversity of, and access to, cinematographic works. Today MEPs voted an own-initiative report by MEP Piotr Borys (EPP, PL), on cinema in the digital era, which calls for instruments and adequate funding to help film producers and distributors, and particularly small independent cinemas, to survive the switch to digital projection.

Questions & answers to Ruben Östlund
Poster of "Play" by Ruben Östlund Ruben Östlund (born 13 April 1974 in Gothenburg) is a Swedish film director. He began by making skiing films in the 1990s, and since 2004 has directed three feature-length fiction films: "The Guitar Mongoloid" (2004), "Involuntary" (2008) and "Play". Östlund's short film Incident by a Bank won the Golden Bear for Best Short Film at the 2009 Berlin International Film Festival.
Can you describe your movie in a few words?
The movie is inspired by real events in Gothenburg between 2006 and 2008. I recall a news article in the local newspaper about a robbery. It was interesting because the robbers were black and very young. The image, built up by the media, of five black boys robbing three white boys, was the starting point for the movie. My own feeling was that the article was provocative and controversial. So I did some research about the case: read trial documents, interviewed perpetrators and victims. Remarkably, the perpetrators consciously used the image of the "black man" to inspire fear in their victims.
Do you recall any particular moment while shooting the movie?
We were in Venice, screening the film for the LUX prize. As I was getting into a taxi boat I spotted a black man I recognised, an actor in "Intruder", a movie that I had recently seen. So I walked over to him and started talking in English. He asked me where I was from and I answered: "Sweden". And in perfect Norwegian he answered "I'm from Norway!".
This is a striking example that these days you can't rely on appearance alone. It says something about Europe as well, something I want to highlight in "Play": maybe before long all such "borders" will eventually disappear for good.
What did you think the first time you saw the movie edited and finished?
Overall I'm always quite happy with the result. I look at films as if they were my children. Sure, there are certain details that I don't like about them, but I love them anyway (laughs).
The last movie you saw?
"The Intruder", by Roger Corman (1962).
The last book you read?
A book by the French writer Michel Houellebecq. I like his work.
What European city would you like to use as a setting for your next film?
My next film is going to be about tourism, so it will take place in tourist resorts, ferries, buses, and at one point even the French Alps. So I doubt that there will be many city scenes, actually.
Your motto as movie maker?
I have an old friend who always tries to find something to push against. I guess that's what I do as well. I find breaking convention releases a positive energy that results in the creation of inspired works. Interview on CINEUROPA
Questions & answers to Robert Guédiguian
"Les neiges du Kilimandjaro" by Robert Guédiguian Robert Jules Guédiguian (born 3 December 1953 in Marseilles) is a French movie maker. Born to a German mother and Armenian father, he evokes his paternal working class roots in his 2006 film "Le voyage en Arménie". He became concerned with political questions when young and was active in the French Communist Party for a while .
Can you describe your movie in a three words?
Faithfulness, solidarity and morality.
Does any particular moment while shooting the movie stick in your mind?
We were shooting a scene about job losses in the Marseilles docks. In this place, this is something that happens very often. It didn't feel like cinema. It was real life.
What did you think the first time you saw your finished movie?
I was very satisfied about working on my origins: my land, Marseilles, the workers' world.
The last movie you saw?
"Habemus Papam", by Nanni Moretti (2011). It's a great reflection on power.
The last book you read?
"Woman Flees Tidings", by David Grossman (2009).
What European city would you like to use as a setting for your next film?
Rome. This city means a lot to me. It's the city of Pier Paolo Pasolini, Antonio Gramsci, the Italian communist party (PCI) and the seventies.
Your motto as movie maker?
Never accept any concessions. Interview on CINEUROPA
Questions & answers to Athina Rachel Tsangari
"Attenberg", by Athina Rachel Tsangari Athina Rachel Tsangari is a Greek movie maker and actress. She was co-founder and artistic director of the Austin-based Cinematexas International Short Film Festival, which ran for 10 successful years.

Can you describe your movie in three words?
Sir David Attenborough.
Does any particular moment in the shooting of the movie come to mind?
The first time the camera rolls onto the set and I realise, this is it: we're about to make a movie.
What did you think the first time you saw the movie edited and finished?
What have I done? The last movie you saw?
"Network" by Sydney Lumet (1976).
The last book you read?
"The Stars My Destination" (1956) by the American writer Alfred Bester.
What you don't like to see in a movie?
Pseudo humanism. Which is the European city you'd like to use as the setting for your next film?
Athens - because it's a war zone in a vanishing country.
What's your next project?
Sci-fi screwball tragedy.
Your motto as movie maker?
Better late than never. Interview on CINEUROPA
