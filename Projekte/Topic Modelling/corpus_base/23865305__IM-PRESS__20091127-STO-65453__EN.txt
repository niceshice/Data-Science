Barroso's Dream Team After the unveiling of the new European Commission line up on 27 November, each "commissioner designate" faces a Q and A session with MEPs. The committee covering the area of competence of each commissioner will hold a hearing from 11 to 19 January, following the receipt of written answers from each of them. A final parliamentary vote is expected on 26 January. The Commission cannot take office before the EP has approved it.
The new Commission will be headed for a second time by José Manuel Barroso. It includes nine women and some new portfolios such as Climate Action, Home Affairs, Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship.
Speaking after the names had been made public EP President Jerzy Buzek said "I am happy that President Barroso has acted swiftly in allocating the portfolios to the Commissioners-designate".
Parliament has created a special interactive website for the hearings of the commissioners designate in all EU languages telling all you need to know. It's also the place to follow the hearings live.
