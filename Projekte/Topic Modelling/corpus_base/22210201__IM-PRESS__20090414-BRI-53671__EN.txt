Briefing - 21-24 April 2009 - Strasbourg plenary session
2009-04-17 - 09:34
MEPs face a packed agenda in the penultimate plenary session before the European elections 4-7 June 20009. Please note that the session starts on Tuesday 21 April and ends on Friday 24 April.
Highlights of the Strasbourg plenary session 21-24 April 2009 include:
Reform of Credit Rating Agencies
Supervision of the insurance sector
Gas and electricity markets to be further liberalised
Mobile roaming: new charges for calling, texting and mobile internet surfing
Clearing away the obstacles to cross-border healthcare
Stricter rules to keep illegal timber off the EU market
Fisheries control: MEPs want to rewrite rules on recreational fishing
Budgetary control: MEPs set to postpone approving Council spending
Music copyright to be extended from 50 to 95 years
Parliament's calendar of plenary sessions for 2010
Credit Rating Agencies: partially responsible for the current financial crisis
Jean-Paul GAUZÈS (EPP-ED, FR) for the Economics Committee will be putting forward a legislative report on Credit Rating Agencies. MEPs and the Council have reached a first-reading deal on this. A credit rating agency (CRA) is a company that provides opinions on the future value of companies, securities or obligations. These ratings, despite being just opinions, are used by investors, lenders, issuers and securities regulators and therefore influence global financial transactions. Given this influence on the financial market, CRAs' decisions have to be taken in transparent and independent way.
Solvency II: better financial supervision of the insurance industry
Peter SKINNER (PES; UK) will be putting forward a legislative report on Solvency II, taking up and pursuit of the business of insurance and reinsurance. A first-reading deal has been reached with Council. The new legislation seeks to achieve a major overhaul of the supervisory framework to enhance the financial stability of the insurance industry.
Safer and easier e-money transactions
The offer of e-money services should be enhanced by boosting innovation and improving consumers' confidence with a legislative report put forward by John PURVIS (EPP-ED, UK) for the Economics Committee. Updating the existing legislation on e-money business to achieve a true single market allowing this industry to expand is the objective of the report.
Economics Committee calls for the end of tax havens
All EU Member States should agree to exchange full information on interest earned on saving accounts by July 2014, says the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee. Members also call for an end to tax havens. The report by Benoit HAMON (PES, FR) for the Economics Committee calls for the end of the withholding tax option for certain Member States and asked the Council to take action to put an end to so-called tax havens. The aim of the draft legislation under consideration is to improve action against tax fraud.
Electricity and gas market: MEPs to debate and vote on deal with Council Presidency
Europe's electricity and gas markets will be further liberalised while the rights of energy consumers are strengthened. Parliament will debate and vote on a compromise agreed with the Czech Presidency on a wide-ranging package of energy market legislation. The informal compromise negotiated by Industry Committee MEPs with the Czech Presidency still needs to be backed by the whole Parliament and the Council of Ministers.
Charges for calling, texting and mobile internet surfing
Charges for calling, texting and mobile internet surfing will be cut from 1 July 2009. MEPs negotiated a compromise with the Czech Presidency on the extension of the 2007 which will be debated and voted on in Strasbourg. The informal compromise negotiated by Industry Committee MEPs with the Czech Presidency still needs to be backed by the whole Parliament and the Council of Ministers.
Tyre labels to show fuel efficiency, safety and noise
Tyre buyers will be better informed about their fuel-efficiency, safety and noise performance thanks to a mandatory tyre label proposal put forward by the Industry Committee. Like the European energy label, the tyre label will use fuel-efficiency classes ranging from best-performance (green “A” class) to worst (red “G” class). It will also show the tyre's wet grip and noise performance.
Nuclear safety measures in the EU must be improved, say MEPs
The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy is backing a report from the Commission/Council which is calling for an EU-wide nuclear safety framework, based on the principles of the International Atomic Energy Agency. According to the report, drafted by Gunnar HÖKMARK (EPP-ED, FI), nuclear installations should be operated so as "to achieve the highest safety standards that can reasonably be achieved taking into account economical and social factors."
Report calls for Member States to maintain minimum stocks of crude oil
MEPs are concerned that a sudden shortage of crude oil - one of the main energy sources of the EU - could be extremely damaging to the economies of Member States, and that could also "compromise" national military capabilities. The risk of an unexpected shortage of oil has increased in recent years due to increasing global demands, the concentration of oil supplies in often unstable areas and decreasing resources within the European Union. In light of this, the report drafted by Miloslav RANSDORF (GUE/NGL, CZ) calls for increased energy security and more effective monitoring of oil stocks in the EU.
All new buildings to be zero energy from 2019
All buildings built after 31 December 2018 will have to produce as much energy as they consume on-site, says a report put forward by the Industry Committee, amending the 2002 Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. MEPs in the committee also call for more public investments in energy-efficient buildings.
Clearing away the obstacles to cross-border healthcare
The general aim of the draft directive on cross-border healthcare is to ensure that there are no obstacles to patients who seek treatment in a Member State other than their own. It also clarifies the right to be reimbursed after a treatment in another Member State. These rights have been confirmed in European Court of Justice Judgments but are not yet included in EU legislation. The directive also aims to ensure high-quality, safe and efficient healthcare and to establish healthcare co-operation mechanisms among Member States. Parliament will vote at first reading on plans to give patients the right to seek healthcare abroad more easily and be reimbursed for the costs. The Environment and Public Health Committee's report also calls for patients to be properly informed about their rights when treated outside their home Member State.
Rare diseases: an invisible threat
Although the incidence of each rare disease is very low, millions of people are affected across the European Union because the number of such diseases is high. There are between 5,000 and 10,000 rare diseases, with a total number of sufferers ranging between 27 and 36 million people. Rare diseases contribute heavily to the death rate in Europe but often go unrecorded owing to weaknesses in healthcare data systems. Concerted action at EU and national level is needed to tackle this problem, according to a report tabled to plenary by the Environment and Public Health Committee.
War on hospital bugs
The Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee is urging Parliament to back measures designed to reduce the millions of infections picked up by patients in hospitals each year. The recruitment of specialised nurses, better education, support for research and better information for patients are among the measures proposed. Patient safety is of increasing concern in healthcare systems everywhere. The most common problems are healthcare associated infections, medication-related events and complications during or after operations. Many such problems could be avoided fairly easily.
Pollution at sea to be punished under criminal law
Tough legal penalties to help combat pollution at sea are expected to be endorsed by Parliament when it votes at first reading on a report by the Transport Committee on a directive on ship source pollution. The aim of the proposed directive is to tackle a widespread problem in sea transport, namely the worrying increase in illegal operational discharges of ship-source polluting substances.
Action plan for urban mobility
Sixty per cent of Europeans lived in urban areas in 2005, and that number will rise to eighty per cent in 2020, making urban transport a major component of goods and passenger transport in Europe. A significant proportion of greenhouse gases are generated by road traffic in urban areas. Parliament will vote on a report by the Transport Committee that seeks to prompt EU action on problems relating to urban mobility such as congestion and pollution.
Intelligent Transport Systems to make roads safer and more efficient
Fresh ideas are needed to cope with increasing congestion on transport systems (freight road transport is expected to increase by 55% and passenger road transport by 36 % by 2020) and the related energy consumption and negative environmental impacts (CO2 emissions from transport will grow a further 15% by 2020). Modern information technology can do much to improve road safety and traffic efficiency but the maximum benefit will be reaped only if measures are coordinated at European level. With this in mind, MEPs will be asked to approve with amendments a draft directive on the deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems in the field of road transport.
Shifting freight traffic from road to rail
Increased funding for projects that seek to shift freight from road to rail, and better compatibility between European rail networks, are the subject of two reports being tabled to plenary by the Transport Committee. Ulrich STOCKMANN (PES, DE) drafted the report on a regulation on "Marco Polo", an EU funding programme which encourages the shift of freight transport from road to other, more sustainable and environmentally-friendly transport modes: rail, sea, and inland waterways. Freight transport companies who present projects which apply this "intermodal shift" are eligible for funding.
New rights for bus, coach and ship passengers
Parliament will vote at first reading on two regulations designed to replicate for bus, coach and ship passengers certain rights already granted to air travellers under EU rules. There will be stricter rules on compensation for delays and cancellations and on payments in the event of accidents and assistance for disabled passengers. The Transport Committee is tabling the two reports, one by Gabriele ALBERTINI (EPP-ED, IT) on rights of bus and coach passengers, the other by Michel TEYCHENNÉ (PES, FR) on the rights of passengers travelling by sea and inland waterway.
Road transport package set to speed through Parliament
Fewer empty lorries on Europe's roads, longer maximum working hours for coach and bus drivers, and tougher inspections of transport companies are among the key aims of the "road transport package" set to be approved by Parliament in Strasbourg. Members of the EP Transport Committee have hammered out a second-reading agreement with the Council on the three regulations making up the package: on cabotage rules, on maximum working hours for coach and bus drivers and on rules governing road haulage firms.
Deforestation and forest degradation
Recent studies show that there is potential for reducing global greenhouse emissions by 40 % by 2030 and that, at a cost of less than half of one percent of global GDP, wind, solar and other sustainable renewable energies could provide almost a third of total global power needs; whereas energy efficiency could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than a quarter and whereas deforestation could be almost halted. Parliament will debate the challenges of deforestation and forest degradation to tackle climate change and biodiversity loss following a statement from the Commission. MEPs will also vote on a resolution on this topic.
Stricter rules to keep illegal timber off the EU market
Stricter rules on timber sold in the EU are needed to combat illegal logging - the main cause of deforestation - says a report by Caroline LUCAS (Greens/EFA, UK) for the Environment Committee. All the operators in the timber supply chain must prove the legality of their timber and illegal timber suppliers must pay penalties that reflect the degree of environmental and economic damage, it added. EU rules need to be more effective, as 20 to 40% of global industrial wood production is from illegal sources, stress the Environment committee, which calls on the Commission to table tough legislation to ensure that illegally harvested timber and timber products are removed from the EU market, through a concrete system of traceability and monitoring.
Music copyright to be extended to 95 years
Copyright term for music recordings must be extended from 50 years to 95 years, says legislation put forward by Brian CROWLEY (UEN, IE) for the Legal Affairs Committee. Increasing the term of copyright protection would ensure that performers and producers continue to receive royalties for 95 years from the first publication or performance of their song, according to a Commission proposal backed by the committee.
Strengthening the fight against nuclear proliferation
The next Review Conference of the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is scheduled for 2010, and according to MEPs, it should be a chance to put the production, use and disarmament of nuclear weapons under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna. The conference also presents an opportunity to reach a consensus on a treaty to end the production of fissile material for military purposes.
MEPs report on the activities of the Committee on Petitions in 2008
The report, drafted by Mairead McGUINNESS (EPP-ED, IE), summarises the work of the Committee on Petitions for 2008. The UK submitted the sixth highest number of petitions, whilst Ireland submitted the largest number of petitions per capita . The issues covered ranged from landfill sites to the planned route of the M3 in Ireland to the Equitable Life affair in the UK. The Committee on Petitions also expresses its hope that its powers will be extended in the next Parliament, to better allow it to represent the views of the European people.
Budgetary control: MEPs set to postpone approving Council spending
MEPs suggest postponing the approval of the EU Council of Ministers' spending for 2007. The Budgetary Control Committee said Council's administrative spending had in fact become increasingly operational, and that Parliament should therefore have scrutiny over the Council budget. Yet the Council has consistently refused to give the committee the facts. Rapporteur Søren Bo SØNDERGAARD (GUE/NGL, DK) explained that the vote to postpone "granting discharge" was to show that MEPs took this issue very seriously but also to give Council the opportunity to deliver the information requested before the April plenary session, when the full House will vote on budget discharges for the EU institutions and agencies.
Western Balkans: reaffirmed European perspective to stabilise the region
The prospect of future EU membership for countries of the Western Balkans is the primary guarantor of stability and a driver of reforms, say MEPs in a report drafted by Anna IBRISAGIC (EPP-ED, SE). Full membership to the EU of countries that satisfy the Copenhagen criteria must not be delayed or denied, says MEPs to the Commission and to the Member States. The EU's leverage in the Western Balkans depends on the credibility of its commitment to a European future for the region. MEPs ask the Commission and the Member States not to unduly delay or deny full membership of the EU for countries that satisfy the Copenhagen criteria.
Situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina
MEPs will debate the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina after hearing statements from the Council and Commission. Parliament will also vote on a resolution on this topic. The draft resolution says that only a single sovereign state of Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH) can aspire to join the EU. Concerned at the deteriorating political climate in the country, MEPs deplored the "paucity of attention" paid to it by the Council and the "lack of determination" shown by Member States.
Governance of Common Fisheries Policy must be improved according to MEPs
The Committee on Fisheries call for improved governance of the Common Fisheries Policy through better financing and more efficient representation for parliamentarians at all levels of policy making. The report, drafted by Elspeth ATTWOOLL (ALDE, UK) expresses its concern at the lack of formalised participation by MEPs at meetings of the Regional Fisheries Organisations, and is calling for clarification of their position in both regional and international meetings concerning fisheries policies. It is also calling for members of the Fisheries Committee "to be given observer status at meetings of the Council of Fisheries Ministers."
Fisheries control: MEPs want to rules on recreational fishing
MEPs want to rewrite the rules on recreational fishing in its consultative report on a proposed "control regulation" to ensure compliance with common fisheries policy (CFP) rules. It also replaces proposed rules to enable the Commission to close fisheries or reduce quotas with new ones on unused quota transfers, and said that EU budget aid should be available for installing vessel monitoring systems and electronic logbooks.
Conservation of fisheries resources through technical measures
The proposal is intended to achieve the protection of juvenile fish, and an important part of these measures is designed to limit their capture, for example, by measures to improve the selectivity of fishing gear or fixing certain closed seasons/areas. It will bring together most of the existing technical measures in various Community regulations for the Atlantic and the North Sea.
Europe must deliver a common immigration policy, say MEPs
An own-initiative report by Simon BUSUTTIL (EPP-ED, MT) is proposing a blue-print for a common policy on European immigration. The report recognises the importance of legal immigration, in the face of Europe's ageing population and declining workforce, but also urges Member States to jointly tackle the problems caused by illegal immigration.
MEPs call for stricter legislation to protect citizens from the effects of profiling
At a time when our personal data is accumulating on the internet and in data-bases, a Parliamentary report, drafted by Sarah LUDFORD (ALDE, UK), warns against the dangers of 'profiling' of European citizens on the basis of criteria such as ethnicity, religion, gender or age, especially by the police. MEPs are warning against the excesses of the system and call on Member States to shed light onto these practices.
Calendar of part-sessions 2010
Parliament will vote on the calendar of part-sessions for 2010 on Wednesday (22 April) at midday based on a proposal from the Conference of Presidents.
Human rights in the world
As usual the session ends with three debates and votes on human rights issues in the world. On this occasion, the topics are:
Women's rights in Afghanistan
Support for the Special Court of Sierra Leone
Humanitarian situation of Camp Ashraf residents (Iraq)

Energy
Electricity and gas market: MEPs to debate and vote on deal with Council Presidency
2009-04-17 - 09:34
Europe's electricity and gas markets will be further liberalised while the rights of energy consumers are strengthened. Parliament will debate and vote on a compromise agreed with the Czech Presidency on a wide-ranging package of energy market legislation. The informal compromise negotiated by Industry Committee MEPs with the Czech Presidency still needs to be backed by the whole Parliament and the Council of Ministers.
Separating supply and production from network operations
The compromise gives Member States the possibility to choose between three options for separating supply and production activities from network operations - both for gas and electricity markets:
full ownership unbundling;
the independent system operator (ISO);
the independent transmission operator (ITO).
Full ownership unbundling would force integrated energy companies to sell off their gas and electricity grids thus establishing separate transmission system operators, which handle all network operations. A supply and production company could not, in this case, hold a majority share in a transmission system operator, stipulates the compromise text.
As alternatives to ownership unbundling the ISO and ITO options allow energy companies to retain the ownership of their transmission networks. To liberalise the energy market, Member States could, for example, oblige companies to hand over the operation of their transmission network to a designated, separate body - the independent system operator (ISO).
The third option – the ITO model – preserves integrated supply and transmission companies but compels them to abide by certain rules to ensure these two sections of the company operate independently in practice:
a “supervisory body” - composed of gas company representatives, third party shareholders, and transmission system operator representatives - responsible for decisions “which may have a significant impact on the value of the assets of the shareholders”;
a “compliance programme” setting out measures that prevent “discriminatory conduct”;
a “compliance officer” responsible for monitoring the implementation of the compliance programme.
Improved consumer rights
MEPs achieved a clear strengthening of consumer rights. The new legislation would give customers the right:
to change their gas and electricity suppliers within three weeks and free of charge;
to receive the final closure account at the latest six weeks after switching suppliers;
to receive all relevant gas and electricity consumption data;
to independent mechanisms for efficient treatment of complaints and out-of-court dispute settlements, such as an energy ombudsman or a consumer body;
to compensation if service quality levels are not met (as with, for example, inaccurate and delayed billing);
to information on their rights through bills and company websites.
The Commission should put forward a clear and concise "Energy Consumer Checklist" listing practical information on consumer rights, says the compromise text.
Subject to an economic assessment, 80% of consumers should have access to intelligent metering systems by 2020, says another provision added to the text.
Guaranteeing universal service of electricity
The new legislation would also oblige Member States to guarantee universal service to all household customers and, if necessary, small enterprises (with fewer than 50 employees and an annual turnover or balance sheet of less than €10m). Those customers would then have the right to be supplied with electricity of a specified quality at reasonable, easily and clearly comparable, transparent and non-discriminatory prices.
Protecting vulnerable consumers
On the EP's initiative, the new legislation includes special protection measures for vulnerable energy consumers. EU countries should take "appropriate measures” to address energy poverty such as National Energy Action Plans or benefits in social security systems to guarantee necessary energy supply to vulnerable customers or energy efficiency improvements, says the new text.
Further measures
The two directives and three regulations of the third energy package also include, among other points:
the creation of an EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators which will set out non-binding guidelines;
tasking the Commission with the adoption of binding network codes - e.g. on procedures in emergency situations - based on the agency's guidelines;
the establishment of European Networks of Transmission System Operators for electricity (ENTSOE) and gas (ENTSOG) which are to implement the network codes;
the obligation on transmission system operators to submit every two years a 10-year network development plan to the national regulatory authorities;
measures to improve the regional cooperation between different national regulators;
measures to strengthen the independence of national regulators.
Parliament's negotiating team was composed of Industry Committee Chair Angelika Niebler (EPP-ED, DE) as well as rapporteurs Eluned Morgan (PES, UK), Antonio Mussa (UEN, IT), Alejo Vidal-Quadras (EPP-ED, ES), Atanas Paparizov (PES, BG) and Giles Chichester (EPP-ED, UK).

Energy
Tyre labels to show fuel efficiency, safety and noise
2009-04-17 - 09:34
Tyre buyers will be better informed about their fuel-efficiency, safety and noise performance thanks to a mandatory tyre label proposal put forward by the Industry Committee. Like the European energy label, the tyre label will use fuel-efficiency classes ranging from best-performance (green “A” class) to worst (red “G” class). It will also show the tyre's wet grip and noise performance.
Fuel efficiency, wet grip and noise label
Suppliers must show fuel efficiency, wet grip and external rolling noise classes in any technical promotional literature for C1, C2 and C3 tyres (fitted to passenger cars, light and heavy duty vehicles), says the report drafted by Ivo Belet (EPP-ED, BE). Distributors must also include these values in their bills, says the amended draft legislation.
The label will also have to be attached, e.g. as a sticker, to C1 and C2 tyres, says the committee. Tyre manufacturers must mould into each sidewall the rolling resistance, wet grip and noise emission values as measured in the type approval test, says another amendment proposed by the committee.
Low noise mark for very quiet tyres
To promote low-noise tyres, the committee inserted a provision in the text for a new "low noise mark", showing a tyre with earmuffs if the noise level is below 68 decibels (C1), 69 decibels (C2 tyres) or 70 decibels (C3 tyres).
Snow tyres
The Commission will set specific requirements for snow or Nordic winter tyres under the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, say MEPs.
Incentives for fuel-saving and safe tyres
The new law also states that Member States may provide incentives only for tyres ranked at least "class C" on fuel efficiency and wet grip.
EU tyre labelling website
Industry Committee MEPs also want the Commission to create by September 2010 an "EU tyre labelling website" as a "central online source of explanatory information for each component of the label".
Provide fuel savings calculator on websites
Suppliers will have to provide a "fuel savings calculator" on their websites, says the Industry Committee, adding that this tool should allow consumers to assess the "potential average savings of fuel, CO2 and costs, for C1, C2 and C3 tyres".
MEPs in the committee think that a regulation (directly applicable in all Member States) would be a better format for the new legislation. The Commission had proposed a directive, which would need to be transposed into national law.

Nuclear safety measures in the EU must be improved, say MEPs
2009-04-17 - 09:34
The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy is backing a report from the Commission/Council which is calling for an EU-wide nuclear safety framework, based on the principles of the International Atomic Energy Agency. According to the report, drafted by Gunnar Hökmark (EPP-ED, FI), nuclear installations should be operated so as "to achieve the highest standards of safety that can reasonably be achieved taking into account economical and social factors." The proposed directive would create a common European framework for nuclear safety, which would recognise and build on the international principles of the IAEA, but would also allow for Member States to apply "more stringent safety measures than those laid down in this Directive." The report also requires Member States to continue to develop "additional safety requirements" based on the continuous improvement of current best practices.
Ensuring the independence of regulatory bodies
The committee is calling for all Member States to ensure the independence of their national regulatory body for supervising nuclear safety. These bodies need to be "legally distinct and functionally independent from any other public or private entity", and their staff should be free to carry out the designated tasks of the agency without instruction from "any government or other public entity." A further amendment to develop the strength and independence of the regulatory bodies calls for them to have the power to shut down any nuclear installations where "safety is not guaranteed".
At least every ten years, each regulatory body and the national regulatory system should be submitted to "an international peer review, aimed at continuously improving the regulatory infrastructure" according to the committee's proposals. This should allow for regulatory bodies to exchange best practices and to develop a clearer understanding of the EU's requirements.
Increasing protection of workers and the public from harmful radiation
The committee is proposing the addition of an extensive amendment concerning detailed safety principles. As well as calling for workers and the general public to be protected from "harmful effects of ionising radiation", committee MEPs want to ensure that future generations are not at risk from radioactive material. This means that Member States must ensure that the production, storage and transportation of all radioactive materials are safely controlled, and that there are provisions for future responsibilities as radioactive waste remains dangerous for many years.
Consultation of the Euratom expert group
The Industry Committee is calling on the Commission to alter its proposal "to ensure that the legal requirements foreseen by the Euratom Treaty…have been respected, notably the consultation of the group of experts in accordance with Article 31 EA."

Energy
Report calls for Member States to maintain minimum stocks of crude oil
2009-04-17 - 09:34
Crude oil is one of the main energy sources of the EU, and is likely continue to be for several decades. The Commission estimates that in 2030, European demand will be one third higher than it was in 2006, which is of concern as demand was already outstripping supply in 2006. Therefore, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy is calling on Member States to maintain minimum stocks of crude oil as a barrier to protect against any unexpected cuts in supply. Committee MEPs are concerned that a sudden shortage of crude oil could be extremely damaging to the economies of Member States, and that could also "compromise" national military capabilities. The risk of an unexpected shortage of oil has increased in recent years due to increasing global demands, the concentration of oil supplies in often unstable areas and decreasing resources within the European Union. In light of this, the report drafted by Miloslav Ransdorf (GUE/NGL, CZ) calls for increased energy security and more effective monitoring of oil stocks in the EU.
Increasing energy security in the EU
The Commission is calling for minimum national stocks of 90-days worth of crude oil supplies. In the view of the rapporteur, the actual levels of need during a crisis, will only become apparent after the shortage, and that 90 days should be "sufficient to cover any conceivable non-politically-motivated disruption of supply." If a crisis lasts longer than this, then the world-wide problems caused by this would require other responses.
Currently many Member States hold some of their oil reserves in the infrastructure of other states; for example, in 2007, Denmark, Ireland and Sweden all held part of their stocks in the UK . Whilst the report sees this as generally positive, it is calling for further legislative clarification of bilateral agreements between states, to ensure that in the event of a crisis, oil stocks can be delivered quickly and efficiently.
Monthly or weekly reporting?
Across most parts of the world, oil stock summaries are reported on a weekly basis, but this is not the case in the EU where monthly summaries are still used. Committee MEPs believe that whilst weekly reporting would provide better information, this would only be effective if the reports are entirely accurate and do not require further corrections. Therefore they support the feasibility study launched by the Commission, which will investigate the possibility of weekly reporting on commercial oil stocks. The committee urges caution on making any further decisions about reporting until after the results of this study have been published.
Cooperation with international organisations
All but eight of the EU Member States are also members of the International Energy Agency, which means that the Commission should ensure that these members are "involved on an equal footing as regards the decisions adopted" by the EU in conjunction with the IEA. The Commission should also ensure that the interests of all Member States should be equally upheld. Finally, the committee urges the Commission to work closely with other international bodies which have the power to release oil stocks so that "multilateral and bilateral coordination on these matters" is strengthened.

All new buildings to be zero energy from 2019
2009-04-17 - 09:34
All buildings built after 31 December 2018 will have to produce as much energy as they consume on-site, says a report put forward by the Industry Committee, amending the 2002 Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. MEPs in the committee also call for more public investments in energy-efficient buildings. By 31 December 2018 at the latest EU Member States must ensure that all newly-constructed buildings produce as much energy as they consume on-site - e.g. via solar panels or heat pumps, says a report drawn up by Silvia-Adriana Ţicău (PES, RO). The Commission proposal did not include any specific target dates for zero-energy buildings.
The Industry Committee also wants Member States to set intermediate national targets for existing buildings, i.e. to fix minimum percentages of buildings that should be zero energy by 2015 and by 2020 respectively.
MEPs in the committee define zero-energy buildings as buildings "where, as a result of the very high level of energy efficiency of the building, the overall annual primary energy consumption is equal to or less than the energy production from renewable energy sources on site". By the end of 2010, the Commission should establish a detailed common European definition of "net zero energy buildings", states the amended directive.
Step up financial support for improving energy efficiency of buildings
The committee adds new provisions to the text which require Member States to draw up national action plans by 30 June 2011 setting out financial instruments for improving the energy efficiency of buildings, such as low-interest loans, fiscal rebates on income or property taxes or requiring energy suppliers to offer financial assistance to consumers.
Moreover, the Commission should by 30 June 2010 propose additional EU financial instruments such as:
- increasing the share of European Regional Development Fund money available for energy-efficiency measures to at least 15%,
- establishing, by 2014, an Energy Efficiency Fund financed by the Community budget, the European Investment Bank and Member States, to promote private and public investment in projects increasing the energy efficiency of buildings, and
- VAT reductions for goods and services related to energy efficiency and renewable energy.
Upgrade energy performance of existing buildings
A building's energy performance will have to be upgraded to meet at least minimum energy performance requirements whenever it undergoes major renovation or building components and technical building systems (such as windows, boilers or air conditioning systems) are replaced, says the amended text.
MEPs in the committee define a "major renovation" as a refurbishment of more than 25% of the building's surface or where the total costs of the renovation are higher than 20% of the building's value.
The minimum energy performance requirements are to be set by the Member States, says the directive. However, the Commission will have to establish a common methodology for calculating the energy performance of buildings by 31 March 2010, add MEPs in the committee.
Holiday homes must meet minimum energy performance standards, too
Member States should set minimum energy performance standards for holiday homes used less than four months a year, too, say MEPs in the committee, deleting a proposed exemption for such houses.
However, the following are excluded from the directive's energy efficiency requirements: small houses (with a floor area of less than 50m2), buildings for religious activities, temporary buildings used for less than 18 months, workshops and agricultural buildings with low energy demand and protected historic buildings where an energy-efficiency measure would "unacceptably alter their character".
Smart meters
The committee wants "smart" meters to be installed in all new buildings and all buildings undergoing a major renovation. Smart meters measure both how much and at what time of day energy is consumed - a system which could, for example, allow customers to benefit from lower night-time tariffs.

Clearing away the obstacles to cross-border healthcare
2009-04-17 - 09:34
Parliament will vote at first reading on plans to give patients the right to seek healthcare abroad more easily and be reimbursed for the costs. The Environment and Public Health Committee's report also calls for patients to be properly informed about their rights when treated outside their home Member State. The general aim of the draft directive on cross-border healthcare is to ensure that there are no obstacles to patients who seek treatment in a Member State other than their own. It also clarifies the right to be reimbursed after a treatment in another Member State. These rights have been confirmed in European Court of Justice judgments but are not yet included in EU legislation. The directive also aims to ensure high-quality, safe and efficient healthcare and to establish healthcare co-operation mechanisms among Member States.
Emphasis on patient mobility: no encroachment on national prerogatives
MEPs stress that the legislation is about patients and their mobility within the EU, not about the free movement of service providers. Moreover, the directive fully respects "national competencies in the organisation and delivery of healthcare" and does not oblige healthcare providers in a Member State to provide healthcare to a person from another Member State.
Moreover, the directive does not change the right of Member States to define the benefits that they choose to provide. If a Member State does not include a particular treatment as part of the entitlement of their citizens at home, this directive does not create any new entitlement for patients to have such treatment abroad and be reimbursed.
The new directive will not affect current patient rights, which are already codified under another EU regulation, or the regulations on the co-ordination of social security systems.
Prior authorisation for hospital treatments
Under the draft directive, patients will have the right to seek healthcare abroad but Member States may nonetheless insist on prior authorisation for the reimbursement of hospital costs if the financial balance of the Member State's social security system could otherwise be seriously undermined.
The committee agrees with this principle but wants Member States to define what hospital care is and not the Commission, as originally proposed. It also says the prior authorisation requirement must not create an obstacle to the freedom of movement of patients.
Easier reimbursement of costs
On the reimbursement of medical costs incurred, MEPs agree with the general rule that patients are to be reimbursed up to the level they would have received in their home country. They add that Member States may decide to cover other related costs, such as therapeutic treatment and accommodation and travel costs.
Since the proposed rules would in practice mean that patients need to pay beforehand and get reimbursed only later, MEPs added a provision that Member States may offer their patients a system of voluntary prior notification. In return, reimbursement would be made directly by the Member State to the hospital of treatment. MEPs say Member States must ensure that patients who have received prior authorisation will only be required to make direct payments to the extent that this would be required at home. The Commission is to examine whether a clearing house should be established to facilitate the reimbursement of costs.
Exceptions for rare diseases or disabilities but long-term care and organ transplants excluded
The committee adds special rules for patients with rare diseases and disabilities that might need special treatment. Patients affected by rare diseases should have the right to reimbursement even if the treatment in question is not provided for by the legislation of their Member State. Special costs for people with disabilities must also be reimbursed under certain conditions. Furthermore, all information must be published in formats accessible to disabled people. However, MEPs believe the directive must not apply to long-term care or organ transplants.
Better information, redress and complaint system
To improve patients' confidence in cross-border healthcare, they must receive appropriate information on all major aspects of such care, such as the level of reimbursement or the right of redress in the event of any harm arising from healthcare. MEPs back the idea that national contact points should be established but they also propose establishing a European Patients Ombudsman to deal with patients' complaints regarding prior authorisation, refunds or any harm suffered, after all complaint options within the relevant Member State have been explored.
Final committee vote
The committee's report, drafted by John Bowis (EPP-ED, UK), was adopted with 31 votes for, 3 against and 20 abstentions. Members of the Socialist group abstained during the final vote, since the committee did not follow their request to add Article 152 concerning action in the field of public health as a second legal basis for the proposal (which is based on Article 95 - internal market) and because they want clearer rules on prior authorisation.
Background
Healthcare was excluded from the Services Directive. Parliament and Council had asked the Commission to address issues relating to cross-border healthcare in a separate instrument.
The regulation on the co-ordination of social security systems provide for individuals for whom medical treatment becomes necessary during a stay in another Member State to enjoy the same benefits as patients insured in the host Member State, using the European Health Insurance Card.
The regulation also provides for patients to be able to seek healthcare in another EU country, subject to prior authorisation which has to be given if the care cannot be provided within a medically justifiable time. In addition, since 1998 the European Court of Justice has ruled in several judgments that patients have the right to be reimbursed for healthcare received in another Member State that they would have received at home.

Rare diseases: an invisible threat
2009-04-17 - 09:34
Rare diseases contribute heavily to the death rate in Europe but often go unrecorded owing to weaknesses in healthcare data systems. Concerted action at EU and national level is needed to tackle this problem, according to a report tabled to plenary by the Environment and Public Health Committee. Although the incidence of each rare disease is very low, millions of people are affected across the European Union because the number of such diseases is high. There are between 5,000 and 10,000 rare diseases, with a total number of sufferers ranging between 27 and 36 million people.
Action needed soon, say MEPs
Parliament is being asked to comment on a draft Council recommendation that asks the Commission to propose practical measures in five years' time. This is too late, according to the Environment Committee's consultation report, drafted by Antonios Trakatellis (EPP-ED, GR).
The committee's report firstly says that the current EU legislative framework is poorly suited to rare diseases and not well defined. Although rare diseases heavily contribute to morbidity and mortality, they are mostly invisible in health care information systems due to the lack of appropriate coding and classification systems
Secondly, MEPs want the Commission to present implementing measures by 2012, rather than after five years. These should cover inter alia: a) the budgetary measures necessary for the Community Programme on Rare Diseases to be effective; b) the creation of relevant networks of centres of expertise; c) the collection of epidemiological data on rare diseases; d) the mobility of experts and professionals; e) the mobility of patients; and f) consideration of the need for other actions.

War on hospital bugs
2009-04-17 - 09:34
The Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee is urging Parliament to back measures designed to reduce the millions of infections picked up by patients in hospitals each year. The recruitment of specialised nurses, better education, support for research and better information for patients are among the measures proposed.
Patient safety is of increasing concern in healthcare systems everywhere. The most common problems are healthcare associated infections, medication-related events and complications during or after operations. Many such problems could be avoided fairly easily.
To help achieve this aim, MEPs are being asked to approve with amendments, under the consultation procedure, a draft Council recommendation on patient safety, including the prevention and control of healthcare associated infections. The Environment and Public Health Committee's draft report on this subject was drafted by Amalia Sartori (EPP-ED, IT) and adopted unanimously.
MEPs call for a 20% improvement by 2015
The Council recommendation calls for national programmes and policies on patient safety, better information to patients, improved reporting on "adverse events" such as infections, promotion of training for healthcare workers and knowledge sharing between Member States. MEPs believe it is important to set a reduction target for Member States to meet, so the committee amendments include a goal of a 20% reduction by 2015, or 900,000 cases a year. Commission studies indicate that such a reduction is achievable.
Millions affected each year
Adverse events occur in between 8% and 12% of patients admitted to EU hospitals, according to Commission statistics. This amounts to 6.7 to 15 million hospital inpatients.
In addition, some 37 million primary care patients a year suffer adverse effects linked directly to the treatment they have received. Among the most common are infections contracted in hospitals and other points of care. On average, these occur in one hospital patient in 20, giving an annual total of 4.1 million patients.
Even more worryingly, nosocomial infections (those resulting from treatment in a hospital or a healthcare service unit, but secondary to the patient's original condition) kill approximately 37,000 people every year. They are among the most frequent and destructive causes of unintended harm.
Factors that help trigger and spread nosocomial infections include viral antibiotic resistance, a high bed occupancy rate, the increase in patient transfers, an inadequate staff to patient ratio, a failure to pay proper heed to hand hygiene and various other practices serving to prevent infections, incorrect use of medical devices.

Pollution at sea to be punished under criminal law
2009-04-17 - 09:34
Tough legal penalties to help combat pollution at sea are expected to be endorsed by Parliament when it votes at first reading on a report by the Transport Committee on a directive on ship source pollution. The aim of the proposed directive is to tackle a widespread problem in sea transport, namely the worrying increase in illegal operational discharges of ship-source polluting substances.
The directive would require Member States to regard serious cases of pollution as criminal acts and therefore impose penalties under their criminal law. The distinction between serious and minor cases (those not resulting in a deterioration of water quality) will be preserved. Nevertheless, minor cases are to be regarded as criminal offences if they are repeated, deliberate or caused by serious negligence.
Members of the Transport Committee voted overwhelmingly (37 votes for, 1 against, no abstentions) in favour of the first-reading co-decision report drafted by Luis de Grandes Pascual (EPP-ED, ES), who sees this measure as essential for preventing future environmental disasters.
"Serious" or "minor" pollution discharges?
Member States would be entitled to regard pollution incidents that do not seriously affect water quality as "administrative infringements". But if they are repeated, deliberate or caused by serious negligence they must be regarded as criminal offences and punished accordingly, says the report.
MEPs hope thereby to deter the responsible parties in sea transport who would rather pollute because paying an administrative fine costs less than obeying the law.
The directive requires effective and dissuasive penalties, not only for ship owners but also for anyone else who might benefit, such as cargo owners or classification societies.
Damage assessment
Regarding the assessment of any damage caused and the classification of the offence, MEPs backed an amendment proposing that monitoring and surveillance be entrusted to a monitoring laboratory to be set up within the European Maritime Safety Agency.
Background
The draft directive was brought forward following a 2005 ruling of the Court of Justice which stated that the European Community does have the power to ask its Member States to apply criminal law penalties in the transport industry. However, the directive cannot determine the type or exact level of penalties, this being a matter for the Member States.

Action plan for urban mobility
2009-04-17 - 09:34
Parliament will vote on a report by the Transport Committee that seeks to prompt EU action on problems relating to urban mobility such as congestion and pollution. Sixty per cent of Europeans lived in urban areas in 2005, and that number will rise to eighty per cent in 2020, making urban transport a major component of goods and passenger transport in Europe. A significant proportion of greenhouse gases are generated by road traffic in urban areas.
On 25 September 2007, the Commission published a Green Paper on urban transport entitled ‘Towards a new culture for urban mobility’ but a promised action plan did not materialise. The Commission is believed to have delayed progress on the Action Plan because of Germany's concerns that it would undermine subsidiarity.
No more delay, say MEPs
However, the EP Committee on Transport and Tourism, which believes action is needed, has decided in this exceptional case to draw up an own initiative report outlining its ideas for such a plan. Rapporteur Gilles Savary (PES, FR) justifies EU competence in this field by pointing to the EU's right to take measures to achieve its environmental aims and climate change objectives.
In its draft report, the committee calls for integrated sustainable urban travel plans in conurbations with over 100,000 inhabitants. These would cover the development of "soft traffic" infrastructure (for cyclists, pedestrians, etc.), intermodal car parks and exchange platforms, the adaptation of urban mobility networks to the needs of reduced mobility users, better interconnection of transport networks and master plans for freight transport. The report also calls for a charter of pedestrians' and cyclists' rights (similar to the charter of air passengers' rights).
In addition, the committee suggests that a European policy be introduced for the standardisation and certification of equipment as regards safety, comfort (noise, vibrations, etc.), network interoperability (‘busways’, tram-train, etc.), accessibility for people with reduced mobility, soft transport and clean engine technologies (buses, taxis).
EU funding
MEPs suggest creating a new EU fund, as well as drawing money from the TEN-T programme and from the EU economic recovery plan. They also propose that European state aid and co-financing in the field of urban transport be made conditional on the existence of integrated urban travel plans.

Intelligent Transport Systems to make roads safer and more efficient
2009-04-17 - 09:34
Modern information technology can do much to improve road safety and traffic efficiency but the maximum benefit will be reaped only if measures are coordinated at European level. With this in mind, MEPs will be asked to approve with amendments a draft directive on the deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems in the field of road transport. Fresh ideas are needed to cope with increasing congestion on transport systems (freight road transport is expected to increase by 55% and passenger road transport by 36% by 2020) and the related energy consumption and negative environmental impacts (CO2 emissions from transport will grow a further 15% by 2020).
Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) are a means of applying information and communication technologies to make transport more efficient, safer, and cleaner. Such systems can be applied in every transport mode (road, rail, air, water), in both passenger and freight transport but the directive under consideration is concerned purely with road transport.
Examples of ITS in road transport are electronic tolling systems, traffic supervision and warning systems such as the automatic "e-call" that alerts emergency services when drivers are unconscious after an accident.
A broad EU framework, with Member States responsible for implementation
The directive lays down a broad framework for the deployment by EU Member States of Intelligent Transport Systems in road transport and for interfaces with other transport modes. The directive, which must become part of national law within two years of its entry into force, would require all Member States to ensure the coordinated deployment and use of interoperable ITS applications and services within the Community.
Member States would have the responsibility to:
- ensure that road transport data is made available to ITS users and ITS service providers;
- ensure that road traffic and travel data can be exchanged between traffic information and control centres in different regions or in different Member States;
- integrate safety and security-related ITS systems into vehicles and road infrastructure;
- integrate different ITS applications, involving the exchange of information and communication between vehicles and the road infrastructure, within a single platform;
- use satellite infrastructure or any technology providing equivalent levels of precision.
The Commission will establish a European ITS Advisory Group to advise it on business and technical aspects of the deployment and use of ITS in the Community. The group will be composed of high level representatives from ITS service providers, users' associations, transport operators, industry, social partners, professional bodies and local authorities.
MEP Anne Jensen (ALDE, DK) is the author of two related reports on ITS for the EP Transport Committee. In an own-initiative report on the Commission's paper on an action plan for ITS in Europe, the committee gives warm support to the principle of ITS and deplores the delay in setting up common European framework for its implementation.
The committee's first-reading co-decision report on the draft directive backs the legislation while calling for further compatibility between systems, an increased focus on vulnerable road users such as cyclists, respect for data protection and privacy, and for liability issues to be clarified by involving experts and stakeholders.

Shifting freight traffic from road to rail
2009-04-17 - 09:34
Increased funding for projects that seek to shift freight from road to rail, and better compatibility between European rail networks, are the subject of two reports being tabled to plenary by the Transport Committee. More funding to move traffic from road to rail
Ulrich Stockmann (PES, DE) drafted the report on a regulation on "Marco Polo", an EU funding programme which encourages the shift of freight transport from road to other, more sustainable and environmentally-friendly transport modes: rail, sea, and inland waterways. Freight transport companies who present projects which apply this "intermodal shift" are eligible for funding.
The current, second Marco Polo programme runs from 2007-13 with a budget of €450 million. At the end of 2008, the Commission found that the programme had committed only 73% of the available budget for the financial year. The eligibility requirements therefore need to be reformed to encourage as many applicants as possible and to allow more and better funding of the projects.
The reform provides for:
- Facilitating participation by small enterprises and consortiums,
- Lowering the tonne-kilometre thresholds for eligibility,
- Raising funding intensity,
- Simplification of the application procedures.
Freight corridors: striking a balance between goods and passenger transport
Rail is currently the least integrated transport mode at EU level, leading to delays, extra costs and insufficient use of the potential of rail freight.
A report drafted for the Transport Committee by Petr Duchoň (EPP-ED, CZ) deals with a proposed regulation on a European rail network for competitive freight which aims to devise rules for international rail freight corridors. The corridors would link at least two Member States and would be part of the TEN-T (Trans-European Network for Transport) programme.
The regulation provides for a governance body, comprised of the various infrastructure managers involved with the freight corridor, to ensure the management of traffic, especially as regards priority rules in cases of traffic disruption and congestion. A specific category named "facilitated freight" is defined, for highly time-sensitive goods.
In the committee vote, MEPs insisted that granting too high a level of priority to freight transport to the detriment of passenger transport would be unwise. They voted for more flexibility in the management of the corridors, namely through amendments which oblige the infrastructure managers to take into account previous levels of utilisation and estimated market needs before allocating train paths.

New rights for bus, coach and ship passengers
2009-04-17 - 09:34
Parliament will vote at first reading on two regulations designed to replicate for bus, coach and ship passengers certain rights already granted to air travellers under EU rules. There will be stricter rules on compensation for delays and cancellations and on payments in the event of accidents and assistance for disabled passengers. The Transport Committee is tabling the two reports, one by Gabriele Albertini (EPP-ED, IT) on rights of bus and coach passengers, the other by Michel Teychenné (PES, FR) on the rights of passengers travelling by sea and inland waterway.
Compensation for delay or cancellation
Sea and inland waterway transport companies will have to provide passengers with information as well as compensation if a journey is interrupted, on the following basis:
- 25% of the ticket price for a delay of between one and two hours;
- 50% of the ticket price for a delay of two hours or more;
- 100% of the ticket price if the carrier does not provide another transport service under reasonable conditions or information about alternative transport.
Bus and coach passengers, where a trip is cancelled or delayed more than two hours (for journeys scheduled to last at least three hours), will be entitled to other transport services within a comparable time or, if that is impossible, information about other available services. Failing this, companies must pay compensation of half the ticket price.
Advance payments in the event of death or accident
If a passenger is injured or dies as the result of a bus or coach accident, the transport company must pay without delay an advance on the compensation in proportion to the harm suffered. In the event of death, the advance payment may not be less than €21,000.
To protect small road transport firms, an amendment was tabled stating that companies are not required to pay if the accident was caused by circumstances beyond their control.
Force majeure
MEPs agreed to take account of specific nature of water transport, defining cases of force majeure where the compensation rules would not apply: extreme tidal conditions, strong winds, significant wave heights and formation of ice.
Rights of people with disabilities or reduced mobility
People with reduced mobility may not be refused the right to board a ship, bus or coach except where their safety would be endangered. MEPs ensured that the disability of a passenger cannot be used as a reason for denying them the right to board.
Free assistance must be given to disabled people in ports but operators must be informed at the time the reservation is made or at least 48 hours in advance. The staff of a maritime transport company must receive adequate information in order to be able to provide assistance. MEPs added a clause requiring companies to provide passengers with written confirmation of the assistance that will be provided.
Coaches: only national and international transport
MEPs agreed that Member States should be allowed to exclude bus and coach transport in urban, suburban and regional areas from the regulation's scope, reflecting the particular nature of such services. However, special measures to guarantee passengers' rights on these services must be taken by individual Member States.

Transport
Road transport package set to speed through Parliament
2009-04-17 - 09:34
Fewer empty lorries on Europe's roads, longer maximum working hours for coach and bus drivers, and tougher inspections of transport companies are among the key aims of the "road transport package" set to be approved by Parliament in Strasbourg. Members of the EP Transport Committee have hammered out a second-reading agreement with the Council on the three regulations making up the package: on cabotage rules, on maximum working hours for coach and bus drivers and on rules governing road haulage firms.
Fewer empty lorries on the roads
The first regulation deals with the rules on "cabotage": the transport of goods between two points within a given country by a vehicle registered in another country. This practice has generally been restricted by national authorities but liberalising it would help diminish the number of trips made by empty lorries, thus increasing the potential profitability of long-haul journeys for transport companies and reducing damage to the environment.
Under the new regulation, three cabotage operations will be allowed within seven days following an international journey. These operations can be carried out in the Member States through which the driver passes on his return journey, and are also limited to one operation within three days per Member State.
To underline the temporary nature of cabotage, the regulation says such operations "should not be prohibited as long as they are not carried out in a way that creates a permanent or continuous activity within that Member State". The aim is to ensure that cabotage does not upset the national transport market.
Lastly, the European Commission is required to examine in 2013 the possibility of going further with the opening up of the road transport market and the liberalisation of cabotage.
The new rules will apply six months after the regulation is published in the Official Journal (the Council wanted it to be two years). The Transport Committee's report on this subject was drafted by MEP Mathieu Grosch (EPP-ED, BE).
Coach and bus drivers can now work 12 days in a row
With the regulation on access to the market for coach and bus services, MEPs are revisiting a 2007 EU directive which ruled that coach drivers who travel abroad must take at least one rest day every six days. Tour operators complain that this forces them to employ two drivers for most journeys and to claw back the extra cost from their customers.
Following an accord reached with industry representatives in May last year, MEPs backed the reintroduction of the "twelve day rule", which allows the period in which coach drivers can work on international journeys to be raised to twelve days. However, there are restrictions: the journey must be a single trip, not several different ones.
Measures to safeguard public services are also included in this regulation. Where an international coach or bus service would affect the viability of a comparable public service on a given stretch of a route, a Member State can, with the Commission's agreement, withdraw authorisation for that service.
These rules will apply two years and twenty days after the regulation is published in the Official Journal. The Transport Committee's report on this legislation was also drafted by Mr Grosch .
Standard conditions for road transport operators
The aim of the final regulation - on requirements for road transport operators - is to guarantee a high, uniform standard of service throughout the EU and ensure that firms comply with labour regulations and administrative rules in the country where they are based.
National electronic registers are to be established by Member States, containing information on a firm's finances, place of establishment, staff management and any past infringements of the law. At the request of MEPs, these registers must be interconnected by the end of 2012 to enable national authorities to consult data on firms based in other Member States.
To put an end to "letter-box" companies, whereby a firm registers in one Member State but mainly operates in another, a company must be able to show that it is genuinely established in a Member State (i.e. has its offices there), by providing the relevant documentation to the authorities and showing where in that State it parks its unused vehicles.
Transport company managers and the firms themselves must not have been found guilty of a criminal or serious offence relating to road transport. To prove their competence, managers must pass a compulsory written test arranged by the Member State authorities.
The report on this third regulation in the package was drafted by Sylvia Ticau (PES, RO).

Safer and easier e-money transactions
2009-04-17 - 09:34
The offer of e-money services should be enhanced by boosting innovation and improving consumers' confidence with a legislative report put forward by John Purvis (EPP-ED, UK) for the Economics Committee. E-money: room for market expansion
Updating the existing legislation on e-money business to achieve a true single market allowing this industry to expand is the objective of the report.
Members in the committee, while welcoming the substance of the Commission proposal, amended the text to improve, particularly, the provisions related to the safeguard of individuals' savings.
As the Belgium "Proton, the French "Moneo" or the German " Geldkarte" (see below for full list), electronic money is simply the storing of cash in an electronic form, e.g. online payment account, pre-paid mobile phone account or electronic gift voucher. E-money represents also a payment option for those normally without access to bank account, such as children or immigrants.
Facilitating innovation and increasing business
Decreasing the required initial capital can help innovation in this field. In fact, Members in committee approved the proposal to diminish the required threshold to start up an e-money institution (EMI) from €1 million to just €200,000. The Commission had proposed €125.000.
Moreover, to encourage e-money growth, the committee backed the proposal to delete the rule forbidding EMIs to provide any service other than that of e-money. For instance, the new provision would allow the Oyster Card London to offer such a service.
In July 2007, e-money issuers in the EU carried €1053 million outstanding, compared to €670 million in 2005.
Increasing consumers' confidence in e-money services
Electronic money institutions cannot use the funds received for e-money transactions to grant credit, stress the Members. Ensuring that all consumers can convert their electronic credit into cash is in fact necessary to boost citizens' confidence and thus increase business in e-money, according to the economics committee.
E-money issuers would be obliged to give the costumer, upon his request, the monetary value of his electronic credit at any moment during the validity of the contract and free of charge, according to an amendment approved by the committee.
Nevertheless, EMI will have the possibility to charge a fee for the redemption, if the request comes before the end of the contract, only in case the charge is clearly provided in the contract and is proportionate with the actual costs.
Germany (Geldkarte), Austria (Quick), Belgium (Proton), France (Moneo), the Netherlands (Chipknip and Chipper), Switzerland ("Cash"), Norway ("Mondex"), Sweden ("Cash"), Finland ("Avant"), UK ("Mondex"), Denmark ("Danmønt") and Portugal ("Porta-moedas Multibanco").

Solvency II: better financial supervision of the insurance industry
2009-04-17 - 09:34
Peter Skinner (PES; UK) will be putting forward a legislative report on Solvency II, taking up and pursuit of the business of insurance and reinsurance. A first-reading deal has been reached with Council. 1. Aim of the new legislation
The new legislation seeks to achieve a major overhaul of the supervisory framework to enhance the financial stability of the insurance industry.
According to rapporteur Peter Skinner (PES, UK), "This legislation sets a modern global standard, way ahead of the banking system". "Insurance is about risk management and this directive is about controlling the risks management can take".
In a nutshell, the aim of the Solvency II proposals is:
1.1 Financial stability and risk management
To help ensure the financial stability of insurance (and reinsurance) companies by introducing more sophisticated solvency requirements which will take better account of the risks the companies must deal with: insurance risks as at present, but also market, credit and operational risks.
According to Mr Skinner: "Transparency is widely acknowledged as a key tool for regulators to control prospect of dramatic failure: this directive opens up the whole insurance process by making decisions more transparent than ever before".
1.2 New supervisory approach
The new legislation shifts the focus of supervisory authorities from merely checking compliance with a tick-the-box approach based on a set of rules to more pro-actively supervising the risk management of individual companies based on a set of principles.
1.3 Group supervisor
"Solvency II" also sets up a new, unique system for supervising groups of insurance companies, by making one of the authorities take on the role of group supervisor with a leading role in monitoring cross-border companies and involving all supervisors in the decision making process concerning group issues. This would mean also cost reductions for insurance and reinsurance companies operating in the EU.
2. State of play in the procedure: agreement reached
The European Parliament and the Council of Ministers representatives agreed on a common text to have the new legislation approved before the end of current legislative term. This note reflects the content of the agreement.
3. Parliament's main achievements
The European Parliament representatives, during the lengthy negotiations with the Council of Ministers, were able to substantially improve the proposed legislation. Particularly, they made their voice heard on issues such as the capital requirements, the group supervision and the review clause to update the legislation.
Mr Skinner said: "I am particularly pleased of the achieved result in the interests of other countries, especially the US - the biggest insurance market in the world. I welcome Congressional and US governmental moves to introduce a similar style of regulator approach."
4. Capital Requirements: new transparent criteria
The legislation introduces a new relationship between two key criteria for the amounts of capital insurance companies should hold – the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) and the Minimum Capital Requirement (MCR).
The SCR will be calculated according to a risk-based approach: when capital falls below this level, supervisory intervention will be needed.
The MCR is lower – the point at which the company’s licence would need to be withdrawn.
As well as setting absolute minimum levels for the MCR for different types of company, the text agreed indicates that the MCR should be between 25 and 45 per cent of the company’s SCR, with the exact amount being a calculation based on variables which indicate the company’s ability to remain operational.
5. Group supervision: cost reduction for companies
To improve supervision and risk management, Parliament asked and obtained the creation of supervisory colleges – made up of the various national supervisors responsible for a group and its subsidiaries – to facilitate cooperation, exchange of information and consultation between the supervisors.
The new supervisory system would also mean economic gains for company. In fact, EU companies would no longer need to deal with several national regulators, but just with one group.
6. Entry into force and review clause
Member States will have to transpose the new directive by at the latest 31 October 2012.
6.1 Review clause
Two years after the entry into force, the Commission is requested to put forwarded a legislative proposal to improve, if necessary, the application some aspects of the Directive, including the cooperation of supervisory authorities within the colleges.
Three years following the entry into force, Commission will have to propose legislation to enhance group supervision and capital management within a group of insurance. This would also include the provision, proposed by Parliament representatives, on group support.

Credit Rating Agencies: partially responsible for the current financial crisis
2009-04-17 - 09:34
A credit rating agency (CRA) is a company that provides opinions on the future value of companies, securities or obligations. These ratings, despite being just opinions, are used by investors, lenders, issuers and securities regulators and therefore influence global financial transactions. Given this influence on the financial market, CRAs' decisions have to be taken in transparent and independent way. Jean-Paul GAUZÈS (EPP-ED, FR) for the Economics Committee will be putting forward a legislative report on Credit Rating Agencies. MEPs and the Council have reached a first-reading deal on this.
1. Why is it necessary to regulate CRAs?
According to Members of the Economic and Monetary affairs committee, credit rating agencies failed to detect the worsening of the financial market conditions and to adapt their ratings in time. They also failed to adapt to the new risks of the credit market, e.g. structured credit products (derivatives/hedge funds).
This failure contributed, partially, to the current financial turmoil and that is why it is necessary to regulate all ratings used by EU financial institutions, said the committee.
Therefore, with its vote on 23 March 2009, Members in committee approved strict rules to improve transparency and independence of European credit rating.
1.1 State of play of the legislative procedure
Following the vote in the Economics committee, the Parliament and the Council of Ministers delegations have reached an agreement on the new legislation. This would mean ending the legislative procedure with Parliament plenary vote during the April session in Strasbourg, and consequent formal go ahead by the Council.
2. Main objectives of the new legislation
The proposed regulation sets up an obligation for all CRA willing to operate in the EU to register and comply with a set of rules.
The approved provisions aim at enhancing transparency, independence and good governance of credit rating agencies, thus improving the quality and reliability of credit ratings and consumer's trust.
According to rapporteur, Jean Paul Gauzes (EPP-ED, FR), the reasons behind CRAs' failures are certainly many and varied: inadequate models, laxity, conflicts of interest, analysts' qualifications, method of governance, absence of real monitoring of credit ratings' quality. He believes therefore that it is justified that credit rating agencies should be subject to strict regulation and no longer simply to a code of conduct, as it is today.
2.1 Objectives of the regulation
To ensure that credit rating agencies avoid conflicts of interest
To increase transparency by setting disclosure obligations;
To ensure an efficient registration and supervision framework at EU level
To improve the quality of the methodologies and the quality of ratings.
3. Independence and transparency to be enhanced
3.1 Rotation mechanism to avoid conflicts of interest
Avoiding existing or potential conflict of interest between the agency issuing the rating and the rated organisation is a key aim of the legislation. Long lasting relationships with the same rated entities may compromise independence of analysts
those in charge of approving credit ratings.
Therefore, the agreed text proposes that those analysts and persons approving credit ratings should be subject to a rotation mechanism.
At Parliament's representatives' request, the rotation shall take place on an individual basis rather than changing the entire team of the company. The aim is to avoid negative consequences on CRA performance.
3.2 A greater European dimension in the registration and supervision of CRAs
MEPs, when voting on this legislation in the Economics committee, asked a stronger European dimension in the supervision of the financial markets than it is the case today.
The compromise reached does provide a greater role for the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR), which will be in charge of registering CRAs' according to the new rules. This would provide a single point of entry for the submission of applications and thus cost reduction for agencies. CESR should receive applications for registration and inform competent authorities in all Member States. The CESR will also make this information available to the public.
National authorities will take the decision on CRAs registration and compliance with the rules and on possibility of withdrawing an agency's registration should the rules be breached.
Moreover, a college of supervisors, representing the 27 Member States authorities, will also be established, to provide a platform for an exchange of supervisory information among national competent authorities and improve coordination of their activities.
The agreement is regarded as a first step forward and the Commission is asked to report on its application by July 2010 to eventually propose more measures to streamline supervisory cooperation at EU level.
CESR is an independent Committee of European Securities Regulators, established in 2001 to act as an advisory group to assist the EU Commission (see link hereunder).
4. Other provisions on transparency
4.1 Ratings from non-EU agencies will need endorsement
Another issue, widely debated in the Economics committee is how to let European investors use non-EU ratings whilst maintaining the same criteria as for EU ones.
Non-European ratings will have to be endorsed by an EU agency, established according to this new regulation. This agency will be responsible to determine and monitor on an ongoing basis whether rating activities of the non-EU CRA complies with the requirements.
For smaller non-EU agencies, which have no presence in the EU, a specific certification regime will be established. The Commission will decide, on a case by case basis, on the equivalence of the legal framework of the third country with EU rules and therefore on the possible use of that rating within the Community.
4.2 Disclosure of rating methodologies
Under the proposed regulation, each CRA would have to disclose to the public the methodologies used to adopt their ratings.
The company would also need to ensure that the issued ratings are based on all available information. It would also adopt all necessary measures to ensure all used information is of sufficient quality and from reliable sources.
4.3 Structured products
According to the reached compromise, CRAs should play an important role in raising awareness of the users of credit ratings about the specificities of the structured finance products in relation to traditional ones. Therefore credit rating agencies should either use different rating categories when rating structured finance instruments or provide additional information on the different risk characteristics of these products.
4.4 Transparency report
Finally, if the legislation is adopted, a CRA would have to publish annually a transparency report including information on ownership, outcome of the annual internal review of the independence compliance and description of the management and analyst rotation policy.
5. Entry into force and transitory period
The Regulation will be directly applicable in the whole EU 20 days following its publication. Member States will have six months to take the necessary measures to implement the new provisions. As an exception, the provisions on the use of ratings from non EU agencies, this transitory period will last 18 months. Three years later, the Commission will evaluate the effectiveness of the regulation, including the reliance on credit ratings in the Community.
6. Background information on credit rating agencies
Nowadays, credit rating agencies active in the EU are mainly governed by the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) code of conduct, which is based on voluntary compliance, and are subject to a yearly assessment by the CESR.
In October 2007, EU Finance Ministers agreed to a set of conclusions on the crisis (the ‘Ecofin Roadmap’) which included a proposal to assess the role played by credit rating agencies and to address any relevant deficiencies.
At around the same time, other countries started reforms in this field. In the US, where most of the credit rating agencies with significant EU activities have their parent companies, CRAs have been subject to regulation and supervision since the US Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 entered into force in June 2007.
CRAs constitute a de facto oligopoly. Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings are the three biggest ratings providers.

Taxation
Economics Committee calls for the end of tax havens
2009-04-17 - 09:34
All EU Member States should agree to exchange full information on interest earned on saving accounts by July 2014, says the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee. Members also call for an end to tax havens. The report by Benoit Hamon (PES, FR) for the Economics Committee calls for the end of the withholding tax option for certain Member States and asked the Council to take action to put an end to so-called tax havens. The aim of the draft legislation under consideration is to improve action against tax fraud.
Full transparency within the EU and...
Under current EU legislation, Belgium, Austria and Luxembourg benefit from a transitional period during which they are not required to automatically exchange information on tax matters and can instead apply a withholding tax to savings accounts of non-residents as an alternative.
The approved report calls for an end of this transitional period at the latest by July 2014.
...end of tax havens around the world
Moreover, Members in the committee agreed to call on the Community to "take appropriate action" to improve transparency of so-called tax havens. This would mean, for jurisdictions large and small, including the Monaco, Andorra and Liechtenstein, Switzerland and the US, agreeing to apply the OECD standards in the field of transparency and exchange of information on tax matters.
According to the rapporteur, tax fraud in the European Union amounts to more than EUR 200 billion a year, which represents more than 2% of its GDP.
As is usual with taxation issues, Parliament's views are advisory rather than binding and the final decision is for the Council, acting unanimously. Rapporteur Benoît HAMON PSE FR A6-0244/2009 Taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments Procedure : Consultation

Industry
Charges for calling, texting and mobile internet surfing will be cut from 1 July 2009
2009-04-17 - 09:34
Charges for calling, texting and mobile internet surfing will be cut from 1 July 2009. MEPs negotiated a compromise with the Czech Presidency on the extension of the 2007 which will be debated and voted on in Strasbourg. The informal compromise negotiated by Industry Committee MEPs with the Czech Presidency still needs to be backed by the whole Parliament and the Council of Ministers.
Parliament's rapporteur Adina-Ioana Vălean (ALDE, RO) was satisfied with the result: "I am pleased that we have made an important step towards reaching an agreement that strikes a balance between the interests of all the stakeholders involved in the proposed roaming regulation. I am hopeful that all parties will endorse a concrete first-reading agreement so that European consumers can fully benefit from this new regulation by the beginning of this summer."
Cutting the charges for roaming phone calls
The compromise does not fix roaming prices at rates set by the EU, but sets ceilings beneath which mobile operators could compete by offering lower prices. The text stipulates that home operators may charge their customers for roaming phone call:
from 1 July 2009: a maximum of €0.43 per minute (excluding VAT) for outgoing and a maximum of €0.19 per minute (excluding VAT) for incoming roaming calls;
from 1 July 2010: a maximum of €0.39 per minute (excluding VAT) for outgoing and a maximum of €0.15 per minute (excluding VAT) for incoming roaming calls;
from 1 July 2011: a maximum of €0.35 per minute (excluding VAT) for outgoing and a maximum of €0.11 per minute (excluding VAT) for incoming roaming calls.
From 1 July 2009 operators would have to charge their customers by the second but can apply an initial minimum charging period of 30 seconds, says the compromise text.
Cheaper data roaming services
MEPs and the Council Presidency agreed with the Commission that a roamed text message (SMS) should cost a maximum of €0.11 (excluding VAT) from 1 July 2009.
Other data roaming services (such as sending emails and pictures or web-browsing from mobile phones or laptops) will be regulated at wholesale level – i.e. there will be a price cap for the rates the host operator charges a roaming customer’s home operator, calculated on a kilobyte basis:
from 1 July 2009: a maximum of €1.00 per megabyte (excluding VAT);
from 1 July 2010: a maximum of €0.80 per megabyte (excluding VAT);
from 1 July 2011: a maximum of €0.50 per megabyte (excluding VAT).
To prevent "bill shocks", roaming customers would be able to opt free of charge for a maximum financial limit from 1 March 2010, stipulates the compromise. One of these financial limits should be set at €50 (excluding VAT) or the corresponding data volume, agreed MEPs and the Presidency. This limit would automatically apply to all customers who have not made another choice by 1 July 2010, says the compromise text.
The informal agreement says that providers will have to warn their customers when 80% of the agreed limit has been reached. Once the limit is reached, another notification should be sent, indicating the procedure to be followed if the customer wishes to continue data roaming. If the user does not respond the provider should cease all data roaming services.
Review in 2011 - Expiry by mid-2012
On MEPs' initiative the Commission will have to review by mid-2011 at the latest, among other points, “the extent to which consumers have benefited through real reductions in the price of roaming services” and the competitive situation of smaller, independent or newly started operators. In addition, the text requires the Commission to “assess methods other than price regulation" for creating a competitive internal market for roaming.
The regulation will expire by 30 June 2012, says the compromise. The existing regulation for roaming phone calls would otherwise expire by the end of June 2010.

Environment
Deforestation and forest degradation
2009-04-17 - 09:34
Parliament will debate the challenges of deforestation and forest degradation to tackle climate change and biodiversity loss following a statement from the Commission. MEPs will also vote on a resolution on this topic. Recent studies show that there is potential for reducing global greenhouse emissions by 40 % by 2030 and that, at a cost of less than half of one percent of global GDP, wind, solar and other sustainable renewable energies could provide almost a third of total global power needs; whereas energy efficiency could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than a quarter and whereas deforestation could be almost halted.
Deforestation is the permanent destruction of forests and woodlands. While the phenomenon is not new, the current scale and pace of destruction is alarming. Tropical forests are disappearing at a rate of about 13 million hectares per year (approximately the size of Greece) . This magnitude of destruction has an impact not only at a local level, but also globally. Tropical forests are home to much of the planet's biodiversity, hosting about half of all known species.
Forests cover roughly 30% of the world's land area. Three percent of the earth's forest cover was lost between 1990 and 2005 and there has been no significant decrease in the rate of deforestation over the past 20 years. Some 96% of deforestation occurs in tropical regions.
Deforestation and forest degradation account for some 20 % of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and also pose a major threat in the context of climate change since they jeopardise the important function of forests as a carbon sink; whereas deforestation occurs at an alarming rate of 13 million hectares per year, most of it in tropical regions in developing countries. The Commission has estimated that halving deforestation by 2020 will cost EUR 15-25 000 million annually by that year, and that halting deforestation will require even larger amounts.

Stricter rules to keep illegal timber off the EU market
2009-04-17 - 09:34
Stricter rules on timber sold in the EU are needed to combat illegal logging - the main cause of deforestation - says a report by Caroline LUCAS (Greens/EFA, UK) for the Environment Committee. All the operators in the timber supply chain must prove the legality of their timber and illegal timber suppliers must pay penalties that reflect the degree of environmental and economic damage, it added. EU rules need to be more effective, as 20 to 40% of global industrial wood production is from illegal sources, stresses the Environment committee, which wants to toughen the proposed legislation to ensure that illegally harvested timber and timber products are removed from the EU market, through a concrete system of traceability and monitoring.
Shared responsibility, tougher penalties
All operators in the supply chain shall ensure that only legally harvested timber and timber products are made available on the market. Obligations must therefore apply to operators throughout the timber supply chain, not just those placing timber on the market for the first time, as proposed by the Commission.
Financial penalties, to be set by EU Member States, must reflect the degree of environmental and economic damage caused by the illegal activity, add MEPs. These penalties must represent "at least five times the value of the timber products obtained by committing a serious infringement" and they will increase in the event of repeat infringements.
Due diligence - better information, traceability/labelling and monitoring
The "due diligence system", approved by MEPs, requires operators to reduce the risk of placing illegally harvested timber and timber products on the EU market to a minimum, using a system of detailed measures and procedures. This system only applies to operators placing the timber in the market for the first time, since they are considered to have the biggest influence and responsibility.
But to improve timber traceability, MEPs in the committee ask that all operators provide basic information about the source of the products, their country and forest of origin. They will also have to identify the operator who has supplied the timber and to whom it has been supplied, through a traceability system. Member States shall ensure that two years after the entry into force of the Regulation all timber and timber products places and made available on the market are labelled with this information.
Monitoring must also be improved, say MEPs in the committee, who call on the competent authorities to carry out checks on the supply chain and to apply "immediate corrective measures", such as "seizure of illegal logging" and enforcing the "cessation of commercial activity".
Timber from high-risk areas demands extra due diligence
The Environment Committee calls on the Commission to establish certain categories, such as "high-risk" timber or suppliers which will require extra due diligence from the operators. Timber could be classified as high risk if, for example, it were from "countries where there is consistent and reliable information regarding significant failures of forest law governance" or a "high level of corruption". In such cases, operators will be subject to extra due diligence obligations.
No exceptions for biomass timber
The rules should cover all products that could contain illegally-sourced timber, "without exception", say MEPs, who deleted a proposed exemption for products covered by mandatory sustainability criteria, such as timber used for biomass.
Background
Tropical forests are disappearing at a rate of about 13 million hectares per year (approximately the size of Greece).
Deforestation is responsible for around 20% of global CO2 emissions, making it a major contributor to climate change.
20% to 40% of global industrial wood production comes from illegal sources.
The European Union's policy to fight illegal logging and associated trade was defined in 2003 with the Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade Action Plan, regarding the improvement of forest governance and transparency in the forest sector and the implementation of public procurement practices that give preference to legally harvested timber and timber products in the EU Member States.
The European Union proposes to reduce gross tropical deforestation by at least 50 percent by 2020. Rapporteur Caroline LUCAS Greens/EFA UK A6-0115/2009 Obligations of operators who place timber and timber products on the market Procedure : Codecision (1st reading)

Budgetary control
Budgetary control: MEPs set to postpone approving Council spending
2009-04-17 - 09:34
MEPs suggest postponing the approval of the EU Council of Ministers' spending for 2007. The Budgetary Control Committee said Council's administrative spending had in fact become increasingly operational, and that Parliament should therefore have scrutiny over the Council budget. Yet the Council has consistently refused to give the committee the facts. Rapporteur Søren Bo SØNDERGAARD (GUE/NGL, DK) explained that the vote to postpone "granting discharge" was to show that MEPs took this issue very seriously but also to give Council the opportunity to deliver the information requested before the April plenary session, when the full House will vote on budget discharges for the EU institutions and agencies.
Bulk of EU budget spending approved
The Budgetary Control Committee wants to postpone granting discharge to the Police College, and for similar reasons: a lack of information. All other institutions and agencies got their approval, however, including the Commission, which, with the Member States, is responsible for spending the bulk of the EU budget on various policies.
No DAS: Member States should check better
In a resolution drafted by Jean-Pierre AUDY (EPP-ED, FR) the committee voices grave concern that the European Court of Auditors had not been able to issue a "Declaration of Assurance" for the 14th consecutive year, although there were clear improvements in some areas. MEPs urged Member States to co-operate better in checking on EU spending and recovering incorrectly spent funds. To this end, it has repeatedly advocated that Member States sign off such expenditure themselves.
Council operations
Citing its 2002 discharge resolution, which referred to the Council's "increasingly operational nature of expenditure, financed under the Council's administrative budget, in the fields of foreign affairs, security and defence policy, and justice and home affairs" and referring to the creation of a financial mechanism called Athena to administer the financing of "operations having military and defence implications", the Budgetary Control Committee said that the "administrative expenditure of the Council ought to be scrutinized in the same way as that of the other European institutions as part of the discharge procedure".
MEPs in the committee therefore regret that the Council, "unlike other institutions", does not submit an annual activity report to Parliament. The resolution goes on to list Parliament's attempts to elicit information from the Council on its budget execution and a number of specific questions about the Council budget.
General EU budget
Noting once again that "some 80% of EU expenditure is administered by the Member States" and that the European Court of Auditors (ECA) has not been able to approve the expenditure for the 14th time in a row, MEPs stressed that the annual summaries of audits, which Member States have to provide as from 2008, are a first step but that what is really needed are national management declarations.
MEPs in the committee note that according to the ECA a large number of errors as well as less than effective monitoring and control systems were caused by "complicated or unclear legal requirements". They therefore urge the Commission to accelerate its simplification exercise. But Member States should be compelled to make the necessary improvements in their control systems, "in particular by imposing payment suspensions and financial corrections", they added.
Bulgaria and Romania
MEPs in the committee voice support for the temporary suspension of funding to Bulgaria and Romania. They call for quarterly reports from the Commission until the situation is clarified, but also for special reports on the current management and control of all EU funds in Bulgaria and Romania. The report on Romania should also describe progress made in the fight against corruption, they added.
MEPs in the committee even say that the Commission has not treated the accession of Romania and Bulgaria with the necessary seriousness and that "the Commission disregarded the Copenhagen criteria and misled public opinion and Parliament about the readiness of these Member States to the detriment of the reputation of the Union and the steady development of the Member States in question".
Agriculture
MEPs in the committee are concerned at the very high error level in agriculture - 20% of payments at final-beneficiary level audits turned out to be incorrect. The problems in Greece with the implementation of the Integrated Administration and Control System were considered to be "unacceptable". Many Member States had problems with control systems for rural development funds. According to the Court of Auditors, the Netherlands, Portugal, the UK , France and Spain showed inadequacies with the Single Payment Scheme, whereas Greece, Italy Spain, the UK , France and the Netherlands suffered from a number of systemic shortcomings with regard to area-aid eligibility checks.
Structural funds
Important problems exist also with the structural policy funds, which show a rate of at least 11% not being properly reimbursed. MEPs in the committee are concerned that almost all the financial corrections that had to be imposed under the European Regional Development Fund from 2000 to 2006 were accounted for by Spain and Italy, and to a lesser extent the United Kingdom. Similarly, nearly all corrections under the Cohesion Fund were accounted for by Greece and Spain. For the Social Fund, it was mainly Spain and Italy who accounted for the corrections needed.
Good news in research
There was also good news: the error rate in research and technological development has gone down dramatically, to just over 2%.
NGOs
The Budgetary Control committee noted the growing role and number of NGOs in the administration of EU funds. It asked the Commission to review the operating grants for NGOs' headquarters in Brussels and to gradually diminish them, as laid down in the Financial Regulation. It also wants the Commission to compile by the end of this year a comprehensive list of all NGOs which receive EU funds.
Approval for EP spending
The European Parliament's political authorities also got the stamp of approval, although MEPs made a number of comments and recommendations. Noting that the voluntary pension fund for Members had an actuarial deficit of €30.92 million at the end of 2007, the committee voted to say that Parliament should "under no circumstances provide extra money out of the budget to cover the fund's deficit". In a resolution drafted by Paolo CASACA (PES, PT) it also called on Parliament's Bureau to publish a list of members of this pension scheme.
MEPs ask the Secretary-General to make an "overall analysis of all costs generated by the geographical dispersion of parliamentary activities in Strasbourg and Brussels" and they asked for an independent report on the CO2 burden as a result of having 12 plenary sessions per year in Strasbourg.
The six body scanners which Parliament bought in 2005 following a security-risk analysis and a recommendation by an outside consultant should now be sold if possible and in future Members should be involved in the decision-making on such purchases.
Other discharges
The Council and the Police College apart, the Budgetary Control Committee recommended granting discharges to all other institutions and agencies of the EU when the full House votes at its April session in Strasbourg. Budget discharges 2007

EU needs to take action to prevent irregularities and fraud of Community funds
2009-04-17 - 09:34
In 2007, financial irregularities totalled €1,425 million, compared to €1,143 million in 2006, according to the annual report of the Committee on Budgetary Control. Structural actions have the highest levels of irregularities with €828 million reported in 2007. Amongst the measures suggested by the committee to combat further irregularities are improved information flows, more effective administrative checks, and better reporting from Member States. The report, drafted by Antonio De Blasio (EPP-ED, HU), is concerned with the increasing levels of irregularities and recognises that whilst Member States are ultimately responsible for fighting fraud, calls on the European Community to take steps reduce any further inconsistencies.
Own resources and agricultural expenditure
Irregularities in own resources increased by 6%, with televisions and cigarettes being the most affected products. Whilst the report welcomes the Commission's adoption of "a coordinated strategy to improve the fight against VAT fraud", it also believes that "new political impetus" is urgently needed to achieve significant improvements in cooperation in the fight against VAT fraud. One measure to help the fight against fraud would be for the Commission to undertake an assessment of the potential for fraud by product and by country, according to the committee.
Whilst the number of irregularities reported in the agricultural sector dropped by 53%, the amounts of money involved increased by an estimated 44%. Therefore, the report is calling on the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) to pay special attention to the areas with the highest number of reported irregularities, such as rural development. The Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) is also being called on to increase the quality and quantity of its checks in order to "reinforce fraud detection."
Structural actions
Irregularities and sometimes even fraud in this area occur in a very high number of Member States, with 3,832 irregularities reported in 2007. The committee is calling on the Commission to take corrective action when irregularities are suspected, such as "the suspension of payments and the recovery of undue or erroneous payments." However, the report recognises that the administrative costs to Member States are very high, and that these procedures should be simplified, and reporting discipline needs to be dramatically improved.
Recoveries and increasing the powers of OLAF
Recovery rates are still extremely low, with about €375 million still pending. MEPs are therefore calling on the Commission to "include binding and precautionary elements in future legislation" to create a more efficient recovery process. The report also recognises the unique role which OLAF plays and is calling for it to be strengthened to help fight cross-border cases of fraud. Rapporteur Antonio DE BLASIO EPP-ED HU

Western Balkans: reaffirmed European perspective to stabilise the region
2009-04-17 - 09:34
The prospect of future EU membership for countries of the Western Balkans is the primary guarantor of stability and a driver of reforms, say MEPs in a report drafted by Anna Ibrisagic (EPP-ED, SE). Full membership to the EU of countries that satisfy the Copenhagen criteria must not be delayed or denied, says MEPs to the Commission and to the Member States. The EU's leverage in the Western Balkans depends on the credibility of its commitment to a European future for the region. MEPs ask the Commission and the Member States not to unduly delay or deny full membership of the EU for countries that satisfy the Copenhagen criteria.
The accession process must be based on a fair and rigorous application of the principle of conditionality whereby each country will be judged solely in the light of its capacity to meet the criteria laid down. Efforts must be made to avoid a situation whereby differences in the pace of integration result in the erection of new barriers in the region, in particular with regard to the process of visa liberalisation.
Bilateral issues to be solved
The opening of accession negotiations with the countries of the Western Balkans and the opening and closing of individual negotiation chapters should not be obstructed or blocked over questions relating to bilateral disputes . The EU should make every effort to assist and facilitate a comprehensive and lasting settlement of the pending issues. Certain Western Balkan countries have lodged complaints or sought advisory opinions from the International Court of Justice.
Criteria for visa liberalisation to be fulfilled
The Council and the Commission are urged to conduct the dialogue on visa liberalisation transparently. MEPs stress the importance of a liberalisation of the Schengen visa regime for the citizens of the Western Balkans as a means of acquainting the people of the region with the European Union.
A cumbersome visa procedure, compounded by understaffed EU consulates and embassies in the region, is liable to generate hostility towards the EU among the people of the region, say MEPs. Countries of the region have to accelerate their efforts to fulfil the requirements set out in the individual roadmaps, so as to ensure the removal of the visa regime for their countries as rapidly as possible.
Cooperation with the ICTY needed
Full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), is an essential requirement of the accession process. This includes the arrest and extradition of the remaining fugitive inductees, the transfer of evidence and full cooperation before and during the trial process.
A coordinated abolition of all prohibitions and legal obstacles prohibiting the extradition of their own nationals facing indictment in other states of the region, and of the legal obstacles which hamper the transfer of serious criminal proceedings between courts in different countries of the region is asked by MEPs. These provisions restricting extradition can foster impunity for high-level crimes including crimes against humanity, violations of the laws or customs of war, trans-national organised crime, illicit trafficking, and terrorism.
Inter-parliamentary dialogue to be strengthened
MEPs stress the importance of fully involving the national parliaments of the countries of the Western Balkans in the process of European integration. They call on the Parliaments of EU Member States to give their assent promptly to those Stabilisation and Association Agreements which are currently in the ratification process.
The report asks to promote inter-ethnic and intercultural dialogue. The legacy of the wars of the 1990s continues to be a significant impediment to the establishment of security and political stability in the region. The report also expresses concern at the political interference suffered by the media in all Western Balkan states and the intermingling of business, political and media interests .
Efforts to establish by 2010 a comprehensive Western Balkans Investment Framework for the coordination of grants and loans offered by the Commission, by international financial institutions and by individual country donors are backed by Parliament.
MEPs ask to have increased funding and number of scholarships for study and research in the EU available to students and researchers from the Western Balkans under the Erasmus Mundus programme. Participation of the countries of the Western Balkans in Community programmes and agencies is suggested.

Situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina
2009-04-17 - 09:34
MEPs will debate the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina after hearing statements from the Council and Commission. Parliament will also vote on a resolution on this topic. The draft resolution says that only a single sovereign state of Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH) can aspire to join the EU. Concerned at the deteriorating political climate in the country, MEPs deplored the "paucity of attention" paid to it by the Council and the "lack of determination" shown by Member States.
The message addressed to Bosnia-Herzegovina's political leaders is clear: "the prospect of EU membership has been offered to BiH as a single country, not to its constituent parts". Consequently, the "threats of secession or other attempts to undermine the sovereignty of the State are completely unacceptable", stresses the draft resolution proposed by the Foreign Affairs Committee.
MEPs regret that BiH politicians are unable to agree on "a common political vision" for their country and complain of their "short-sighted nationalism', which is compromising the goal of coexistence within the European Union.
Constitutional reform must be the priority
"Bosnia-Herzegovina must have sovereignty to enable the state to function", said rapporteur Doris Pack (EPP-ED, DE) during a debate with Commissioner Olli Rehn. To do this, Bosnia-Herzegovina must complete, as a matter of priority, its constitutional reform, which is prerequisite for meeting the Copenhagen criteria.
This reform must lead to a central state with legislative, budgetary, executive and judicial powers and based on a number of administrative levels which are "proportional to the country's financial resources" and "based on an efficient and effective allocation of responsibilities", says the draft resolution. The aim is "to reduce the bureaucratic burden" of the current administration, which "absorbs 70% of the national budget", as Doris Pack pointed out.
Boosting the mandate of the High Representative
To accompany these changes, the international community's High Representative (HR) in Bosnia-Herzegovina should assist the authorities of the country to implement the five objectives and two conditions set out by the Peace Implementation Council. The HR's office must stay in place until these goals have been achieved and ensure implementation of the 1995 Dayton accords, which include "peaceful coexistence within one single State of different ethnic communities".
Clarifying the role of the EU special representative
Turning to the role of the EU special representative for Bosnia-Herzegovina, who was appointed by the Council in March 2009 and whose mandate starts shortly, MEPs urge the Council to grant him a "strong and clearly defined mandate to facilitate the adoption of the reforms" needed and "to promote dialogue with civil society". He should also have "full and sustained political support" and the authority from the Council necessary "to ensure overall coordination of EU actors".
MEPs also deplore "the paucity of attention paid by the Council to the deterioration of the political climate in BiH and the lack of determination shown so far by Member States to tackle the situation in the country seriously and in a coordinated fashion".
Ethnic minorities
Lastly, in response to a concern expressed by Green and Socialist MEPs, the draft resolution invokes the European Convention on Human Rights to call for all ethnic communities to enjoy the same rights in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This would entail the abolition of ethnic criteria for candidates for election to political office. Council and Commission statements

Music copyright to be extended to 95 years
2009-04-17 - 09:34
Copyright term for music recordings must be extended from 50 years to 95 years, says legislation put forward by Brian Crowley (UEN, IE) for the Legal Affairs Committee. Increasing the term of copyright protection would ensure that performers and producers continue to receive royalties for 95 years from the first publication or performance of their song, according to a Commission proposal backed by the committee.
Ensuring that copyright extension benefits performers
The report amends existing legislation to increase the copyright protection for music recordings to 95 years.
To ensure that performers fully enjoy the additional royalties deriving from copyright extension, the committee amends the original text so as to prevent the use of previous contractual agreements to deduct money from the additional royalties.
A fund for session musicians
A dedicated fund for session musicians was also approved by the committee. This fund would be financed by contributions from producers, who would be obliged to set aside for this purpose, at least once a year, at least 20% of the revenues gained from the proposed extension of copyright term.
Committee members also propose amending a provision relating to this fund so as to give collecting societies, which represent performers' and producers' interests, the right to administer the annual supplementary remuneration.
Copyright extension for audiovisual works, too?
The committee also asks the Commission to launch an impact assessment of the situation in the European audiovisual sector by January 2010, with a view to deciding whether a similar copyright extension would benefit the audiovisual world.
Review legislation after three years
Finally, MEPs ask the Commission to submit three years after the entry into force of the new legislation, and every four years thereafter, an assessment of whether the copyright extension has in fact improved the social situation of performers.

Governance of Common Fisheries Policy must be improved according to MEPs
2009-04-17 - 09:34
MEPs of the Committee on Fisheries are calling for improved governance of the Common Fisheries Policy through better financing and more efficient representation for parliamentarians at all levels of policy making. The report, drafted by Elspeth Attwooll (ALDE, UK) expresses its concern at the lack of formalised participation by MEPs at meetings of the Regional Fisheries Organisations, and is calling for clarification of their position in both regional and international meetings concerning fisheries policies. It is also calling for members of the Fisheries Committee "to be given observer status at meetings of the Council of Fisheries Ministers."
Committee MEPs focus particularly on the role of the Regional Advisory Councils, and believes that they are "under-financed for the level of work that they are undertaking." The Commission should improve their visibility and increase participation by a number of stakeholders, as there is already "evidence that increased compliance with the rules of the CFP results from the involvement of stakeholders in their creation and implementation."
The Committee calls for closer links between RACs, the Parliament, the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee, and suggests that improved parliamentary cooperation could be achieved through appointing a member of the committee to act as a liaison for each RAC, and increasing information flows between the two.

Fisheries control: MEPs to rewrite rules on recreational fishing
2009-04-17 - 09:34
The EP Fisheries Committee suggest rewriting the rules on recreational fishing in its consultative report on a proposed "control regulation" to ensure compliance with common fisheries policy (CFP) rules. It also replaces proposed rules to enable the Commission to close fisheries or reduce quotas with new ones on unused quota transfers, and said that EU budget aid should be available for installing vessel monitoring systems and electronic logbooks. "If those involved in fisheries, from the people on the boats to those who sell the fish to consumers, do not respect the rules, the [common fisheries] policy is doomed to fail. Fish stocks will disappear, along with those who depend upon them", said the rapporteur, Raül ROMEVA I RUEDA (Greens/EFA, ES), adding that "probably the most important quality of a control system that applies to 27 Member States is that everybody be treated equally, that all those involved in the chain of production - fishermen, processers, buyers and others - feel that they are not discriminated against and carry their share of responsibility".
Recreational fishing
Recreational fishing has dominated all discussion of the proposal. In some cases, recreational fishing may have a significant impact on fish stocks, said the rapporteur. "Is it fair to commercial fishermen to continue to allow recreational fishermen to fish with no controls whatsoever?", he asked, adding that "it would be discriminatory to subject commercial fisheries to strict controls and limits while largely exempting non-commercial fisheries".
MEPs in the committee propose amendments rewriting the recreational fishing article to say that such fishing from a vessel in Community marine waters on a stock subject to a multiannual recovery plan "may be evaluated" by Member States. But fishing with rod and reel from shore shall not be included, they added.
According to MEPs, recreational fishing means "non-commercial fishing activities (...) for recreation or sport and including, for instance, recreational angling, sports fishing, sports tournaments and other forms".
The committee also said that, within two years of the date of entry into force of the regulation, "Member States may estimate the impact of recreational fisheries conducted in their waters" and decide, with the Commission, "which recreational fisheries are having a significant impact on such stocks". For those with a significant impact, a "monitoring system that is able to accurately estimate the total recreational catches from each stock" will be developed.
Where a recreational fishery is found to have a significant impact, catches shall be counted against the relevant quota of the flag Member State. That Member State may then establish a share of the quota to be used exclusively for the purpose of that recreational fishery, said MEPs, adding that the marketing of catches from recreational fishing shall be prohibited except for philanthropic purposes.
Furthermore, fish released in recreational fisheries shall not be considered as discards or mortality for the purpose of this regulation.
Quotas
According to the proposal, powers should be conferred to the Commission to close a fishery when a Member State's quota or a total authorised catch is exhausted. The Commission should also be empowered to deduct quotas and refuse quota transfers or quota exchanges to ensure that Member States achieve CFP objectives.
The committee deleted the articles referring to the closure of fisheries by the Commission, the possibility of reducing a Member State's quotas on the Commission's initiative, and to the refusal of quota exchanges, arguing that these measures would mean that the Commission could unilaterally alter the relative stability among the Member States. Instead, the committee added rules on the transfer of unused quotas.
Sanctions
The Commission proposes minimum and maximum administrative sanctions, ranging from at least €5,000 to at least €300,000 for infringements of the common fisheries policy. MEPs add that vessels that have committed serious infringements should not be eligible for public aid.
"Penalty points" should also be assigned to vessels and captains that commit infringements. A holder of a fishing authorization who has been assigned penalty points should be excluded from receiving EU subsidies or national public aid, and repeat offenders may have their fishing authorisations suspended or withdrawn. Where there are no further offences, points would expire after three years.
The committee adds that operators found guilty of seriously infringing the CFP rules should be excluded from benefitting from the European Fisheries Fund, Fisheries Partnership Agreements or other public aid. The sanctions will be accompanied by other sanctions or measures; in particular the recovery of public assistance or subsidies received by illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) vessels during the financing period.
Electronic records
While original (paper) records could be destroyed after three years, MEPs want that data to be kept for a minimum of ten years in an electronic format.
The new regulation, after being approved by the Council, is to be the last of three regulations that will constitute the control system, after the adoption of the IUU regulation and the regulation on fishing authorisations.

Fisheries
Conservation of fisheries resources through technical measures
2009-04-17 - 09:34
The proposal is intended to achieve the protection of juvenile fish, and an important part of these measures is designed to limit their capture, for example, by measures to improve the selectivity of fishing gear or fixing certain closed seasons/areas. It will bring together most of the existing technical measures in various Community regulations for the Atlantic and the North Sea. The proposal intends to simplify, in a comprehensive package of technical measures, the current regulatory framework concerning the conservation of fisheries resources through technical measures by replacing regulations which have been modified at least ten times: the regulation for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms, from 1998, and the regulation establishing additional technical measures for the recovery of the stock of cod in the Irish Sea, from 2000.
In general the new proposal orientation is broadly similar to the 1998 legislation in terms of type of technical measures, the novelties are the increase the number of measures relating to gear and handling, such as maximum length, depth of use and immersion time for gillnets.
The proposal applies to commercial and recreational fishing in all European waters except for the Mediterranean Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, and in fisheries for highly migratory fish stocks in all waters, for which specific rules apply. It will bring together most of the existing technical measures in various Community regulations for the Atlantic and the North Sea.

Immigration
Europe must deliver a common immigration policy, say MEPs
2009-04-17 - 09:34
An own-initiative report by Simon Busuttil (EPP-ED, MT) is proposing a blue-print for a common policy on European immigration. The report recognises the importance of legal immigration, in the face of Europe's ageing population and declining workforce, but also urges Member States to jointly tackle the problems caused by illegal immigration. Committee MEPs describe immigration as "one of the foremost challenges that Europe is currently facing", and believe that it will remain a significant challenge for the coming decades. Furthermore, a common approach to immigration is vital as shared European borders mean that "action or inaction by one Member State has a direct impact on others and on the EU as a whole." If migration is poorly managed, it will not only have a negative impact on the countries of destination but also to the countries of origin and the migrants themselves.
Past and future impact of migrants in Europe
Migrants have always played "a vital role in the development of the EU", and the report stresses the importance of recognising their past and continuing contribution. Therefore, Europe should continue to be a welcoming environment for migrants; especially as, according to Eurostat statistics, the European working age population is expected to fall by 50 million workers by 2060. Well managed immigration could help to provide crucial economic stimulus to the EU in the coming years.
However, committee MEPs are concerned about the effect of the "brain drain" on third countries, and are therefore recommending that a "cycle of exchange of knowledge" should be encouraged, through programmes of temporary migration. They are also proposing a scheme to facilitate training in countries of origin "in order to preserve occupations in key sectors", and are urging Member States to refrain from actively recruiting workers in these sectors, such as health and education, in countries which are already suffering from a lack of workers.
Statistics presented by the Commission suggest that by 2050, the EU will need 60 million migrant workers, which clearly shows that channels for legal migration need to be improved. Committee MEPs regret that so far little has been done to encourage this, and calls on Member States to establish a coordinated approach, "taking into account the demographic and economic situation of the EU."
Integration
Integration should be a key part of EU legislation on immigration. The report supports integration efforts by Member States, to help immigrants to learn the language of their host country and to develop an understanding of the values of the EU and its Member States. However, committee MEPs also recognise that integration is very much a two-way process, and also requires adjustments on behalf of the population of the host state.
The report also supports the view that immigrants from third countries should be granted the right to full mobility in the EU, after a period of five years' legal residence in a Member State. A further recommendation from MEPs suggests that democratic participation is crucial to integration they are therefore calling for migrants to be allowed to vote in local elections.
Successful integration also requires cooperation with third party countries, which regrettably, has so far not achieved sufficient results. The one exception to this is Spain's successful cooperation with third countries, such as Senegal and Mauritania which in 2008 helped to reduce arrivals in the Canary Islands by 70%.
Common European border strategy
Committee MEPs are calling for the replacement of national Schengen visas with universal European Schengen visas, and for a joint consular service for visas to be set up on a gradual and voluntary basis. The report also calls on the Council and Member States to adopt arrangements based on solidarity to share the burden of border policing amongst Member States.
The committee is particularly shocked by the "human tragedy caused by illegal migratory sea routes." The rapporteur states that in 2008, more migrants lost their lives at sea that in the war in Gaza. Therefore, the report is calling for urgent action to stop this tragedy, and to reinforce cooperation with countries of origin. MEPs are concerned that illegal immigration organised by criminal networks has so far proved to be more effective than common European actions, and urges Member States to take action in "the fight against organised crime, human trafficking and smuggling."
FRONTEX, the Warsaw based EU agency designed to coordinate border security cooperation between Member States, should be reinforced and have its powers extended. The report suggests that FRONTEX should be provided with adequate funding and resources so that it has the potential to acquire its own equipment. MEPs are calling on the Commission to investigate the possibility of "upgrading FRONTEX operations at sea into an EU coast guard, without undermining Member States control of their borders."

Security and defence
Strengthening the fight against nuclear proliferation
2009-04-17 - 09:34
The next Review Conference of the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is scheduled for 2010, and according to MEPs, it should be a chance to put the production, use and disarmament of nuclear weapons under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna. The conference also presents an opportunity to reach a consensus on a treaty to end the production of fissile material for military purposes. MEPs of the Committee on Foreign Affairs consider the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to be "one of the most serious threats to international stability and security", and they are "strongly concerned" about the lack of progress made in achieving concrete steps towards the goals of the NPT. Therefore, the report, drafted by Angelika Beer (Greens/EFA, DE), is calling on the Council to take concrete measures towards supporting the NPT. In light of the new American administration, and increased public support for an end to nuclear proliferation, the committee believes that current circumstances provide an excellent opportunity for progress.
MEPs calls for Council action
MEPs are calling on the Council to review update their position on the NPT from 25th April 2005, in preparation for next year's review conference, and to give their support to strengthening toe NPT's three pillars of "non-proliferation, disarmament and cooperation on the civilian use of nuclear energy."
The report also urges increased cooperation with the IAEA to create concrete proposals "to bring the production, use and reprocessing of all nuclear fuel" under its control. This should include support for the creation of an international fuel bank, which will encourage the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The mandate of the IAEA should be strengthened, according to committee MEPs, and sufficient resources should be made available for the institution to achieve its aims of "making nuclear activities secure."
An end to the production of fissile materials for military purposes
The review conference may also provide an opportunity for states to agree to a consensus on a treaty to end the production of fissile materials for military purposes. This would require all current non-nuclear states, as well as the five permanent members of the UN Security Council to abandon any further production of fissile military material, and to take concrete steps to destroy their existing production facilities.

Petitions
MEPs report on the activities of the Committee on Petitions in 2008
2009-04-17 - 09:34
The report, drafted by Mairead McGuinness (EPP-ED, IE), summarises the work of the Committee on Petitions for 2008. The UK submitted the sixth highest number of petitions, whilst Ireland submitted the largest number of petitions per capita. The issues covered ranged from landfill sites to the planned route of the M3 in Ireland to the Equitable Life affair in the UK. The Petitions Committee expresses its hope that its powers will be extended in the next Parliament, to better allow it to represent the views of the European citizens.
In 2008, the Committee on Petitions received 1,886 petitions from across Europe, compared to 1,506 in 2007, and increasingly these petitions are being submitted electronically rather than by letter. The highest number of petitions came from Germany, followed by Spain, Romania, Italy and Poland. Petitions concerning the environment made up the majority of submissions (309), with fundamental rights being the second biggest issue.
Two of the biggest issues for 2008 were the report on the misleading directory companies, and the one-seat petition signed by 1.5m people which is calling for the European Parliament to be located only in Brussels. The committee notes that this issue has not yet been fully dealt with.
Environmental petitions in Ireland
Several groups from Ireland submitted petitions concerning the environment, including the Nevitt Lusk Action group who were opposed to a landfill site due to the potentially harmful impact on the region's horticulture and the lack of consideration by the Irish authorities to the Water Framework Directive, as the site was over an aquifer. The committee was represented at the National Planning Board hearing for this issue.
The committee was also concerned with the actions of Ireland's National Roads Agency, as it ignored EU Directives when planning the route of the M3 motorway, which would have "devastating" effects on some of the nation's most important heritage sites. This was one of a number of ways in which Ireland had not "properly implemented the Environmental impact assessment Directive."
Despite having received a number of petitions on environmental issues in Ireland, the committee welcomes the fact that the Irish Environment Minister acknowledged and acted on many of the points raised by the petitions. In particular, the report mentions positive progress on petitions relating to drinking water.
Equitable Life
In December 2008, Ann Abraham, the UK Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman addressed the committee to present the findings concerning the Equitable Life case. The EP is still waiting for a detailed communication from the British Government, and the committee expresses its disappointment with the response from the British authorities.
Another issue which occupied much of the committee's time was that of rights of property owners, such as the Spanish urbanisation issue, and property owners who are seeking compensation "dating from previous political regimes before democratisation."
Recognition of the work of the committee
The report welcomes "the involvement and contribution" of EU citizens, and hopes to encourage them to keep coming forward with issues concerning the European Union which directly concern them. The committee acknowledges its distinctive role within the European Parliament, as it is uniquely positioned "to assess the reactions of European citizens to the way in which Member States apply, or do not apply European law", and calls on the Commission to ensure that it puts greater emphasis on the petitions process.
National and regional parliaments should remain "vigilant" in the way that Member States apply treaties and EU legislation, according to the report, as they are the representatives of the European citizens.
MEPs acknowledge that infringement processes, even when they are successful may not result in immediate action related to the specific concerns of the petitioner. Therefore, the committee is calling on the Commission and all Member States to ensure that they fully cooperate with the relevant committees in order to find solutions to the issues raised by petitioners.

Justice and home affairs
MEPs call for stricter legislation to protect citizens from the effects of profiling
2009-04-17 - 09:34
At a time when our personal data is accumulating on the internet and in data-bases, a Parliamentary report, drafted by Sarah Ludford (ALDE, UK), warns against the dangers of 'profiling' of European citizens on the basis of criteria such as ethnicity, religion, gender or age, especially by the police. MEPs are warning against the excesses of the system and call on Member States to shed light onto these practices. Member States are increasingly using new technologies which allow for the "acquisition, use, retention or exchange of information" about individuals, as a means to fight crime or terrorism. Profiling is usually used as an investigative technique in the commercial sector, but now it is frequently being used as "an instrument of law enforcement" specifically in the areas of crime prevention and border controls.
Data mining
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs believes that the practice of profiling, which is often carried out through 'mining' of computer-held data should be thoroughly examined and subject to a political debate. Mining is particularly controversial as it departs from traditional rules of law enforcement, where decisions should be based on "an individual's personal conduct" rather than basing it on information such as ethnicity, race, nationality or religion. Committee MEPs are "deeply concerned" with ethnic profiling in relation to anti-discrimination norms.
Data-mining and profiling are contentious issues as they "blur the boundaries" between permitted targeted surveillance and mass surveillance, and therefore could potentially be seen as unlawfully interfering with individuals' privacy. Profiling can be seen as a legitimate investigative toll when it is based on "specific, reliable and timely information", but not when action is taken on the basis of general information or stereotypes which could lead to discriminatory practices.
Inaccurate profiling
The committee is concerned that as a result of this profiling there is a danger that innocent people will be subjected to "arbitrary stops, interrogations, travel restrictions, surveillance or security alerts." If incorrect data is not quickly removed from profiles then it could result in restrictions or travel, visa applications, bans on employment or banking or in a worst case scenario, the loss of liberty.
The effectiveness of data mining is significantly weakened by the amount of data which needs to be searched through. Committee MEPs are concerned that law-abiding citizens leave far more extensive 'digital tracks' than criminals or terrorists, who go to considerable lengths to hide their identities. This could therefore lead to a number of 'false positives' which puts innocent people under suspicion and allows the real suspects to remain anonymous.
In the opinion of the committee it is vital for law enforcement to "always be conducted with respect for fundamental rights", and calls for all international cooperation in the fight against terrorism to comply and respect European laws and values as well as international laws.
Legislative protection
The committee is calling on the Council to ensure that the processing of all personal data for law-enforcement and anti-terrorist purposes should be based on clear legal rules, subject to supervision. Access to any police or secret service files should be allowed on a strictly case-by-case basis and under specific judicial control in each Member State. The report also calls on the Council to ensure that any European or national legislation on profiling should comply with existing European law or international treaties.
Human rights in the UK
The report specifically mentions S. and Marper v the United Kingdom judgement in relation to the UK DNA databases, where it was ruled that blanket retention of DNA or cell samples for people who have not been convicted of an offense is in violation of Article 8 of the ECHR. The report is concerned that this sort of profiling can lead to a "risk of stigmatisation", where innocent people are treated in the same way as criminals, and therefore questions the legality of profiling based on personal data of "persons not found guilty by the courts."
An amendment proposed in the committee, recognises that whilst ethnic statistics can be unhelpful in law enforcement; the creation of anonymous statistical on ethnicity, race, religion or national origin should still be allowed in order to indentify any discrimination in law enforcement practices.

Free movement of services
MEPs call for stricter cross-border debt collection measures
2009-04-17 - 09:34
The Committee on Legal Affairs is calling for measures to prevent barriers to cross-border debt collection. MEPs believe that the late payment or non-payment of debts "jeopardise the interests of businesses and consumers", especially in this time of economic crisis. In general, debt collection is a major problem, but this is exacerbated when claims are cross-border. For small businesses, this is even more of a problem as they may not have the resources, staff or time to dedicate to debt-collection. It would therefore be beneficial for businesses to have access to information about recalcitrant debtors and the assets which they hold across the European Union.
Bringing together national measures
The report, drafted by Neena Gill (PES, UK) stresses that introducing a Community instrument would only be useful if it is shown to be impossible on a national level "to remove an obstacle preventing the establishment or the functioning of the internal market." One measure the report suggests is to draft a manual of national enforcement laws and practices, but it acknowledges that such a manual might be "laborious and expensive to produce." However, in the absence of a feasible cross-border solution, this might be an alternative.
Regardless of which measures are brought in, it is essential that they are proportionate and do not replicate what is already achievable through existing national measures.
Access to data
Another measure the committee proposes is increasing creditor access to information, such as population registers. MEPs recognise that this is a very sensitive issue and as well as raising difficult legal questions, it may also lead to problems of power abuse or may constitute an invasion of privacy.
