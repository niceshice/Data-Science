In adopting a joint resolution on the crisis of the fisheries sector due to the rising fuel price, MEPs expresses their solidarity with the EU fishermen and call on the Commission and the Council to envisage measures in order to resolve the present situation in the fisheries sector. MEPs furthermore call on the Member States to speed up procedures to enable the payment of aid on de minimis aid in the fisheries sector.
MEPs reiterate in this context their call to the Commission to revise the abovementioned regulation so as to increase the aid to EUR 100 000 per vessel instead of per undertaking, so that the level of aid is brought closer to that in other economic sectors.
Parliament asks for the fishing fleet adjustment plans to be brought into force in all the Member States and for the financial means necessary for voluntarily restructuring of fleets to be provided; with this aim:
(a) calls on the Commission to establish priority criteria for the segments of the fleet that have been most affected by this crisis;
(b) considers it essential that national Operational Programmes under the European Fisheries Fund be reviewed to allow for more targeted spending;
(c) calls for assistance with a one-off change in fishing gear to produce a less fuel-intensive fishing method;
(d) encourages the purchase of equipment to improve fuel efficiency;
The House asks the Commission to submit proposals on a 7-year compensation scheme for CO2 reduction in the fisheries sector, based on the current price of â‚¬ 25 per tonne of CO2.
The European Parliament asks the Commission to support the creation of a specific fisheries-oriented research and development fund, within the existing 7th R&D Framework Programme, to help finance projects aimed at investigating alternative energy sources and improving energy efficiency in the fisheries sector-
MEPs urge the Commission to formulate specific proposals to alleviate the situation in the areas most dependent on fisheries.
The resolution was adopted with 454 votes in favour 84 against and 24 abstentions.
