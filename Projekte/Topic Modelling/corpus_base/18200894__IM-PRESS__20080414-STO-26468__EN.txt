President Pöttering and the Emir of Qatar, Doha 13 April
During the 2008 European Year of Intercultural Dialogue one of the European Parliament's key aims is to promote dialogue especially with Arab and Islamic countries. It was in this context that EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering made his first visit to a Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) this weekend. While in Qatar he gave a keynote speech to 8th Doha Forum on Democracy Development and Free Trade.
In his speech he spoke about drawing the GCC into the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, which brings together European parliamentarians and members of parliament from countries around the Mediterranean basin. "I believe that you are definitely the 'next step' in our neighbourhood! Not only because of geographic and geostrategic considerations, but mainly because of the strong convergences that we have set into motion." He will propose that two MPs from GCC countries be included as observers to the Euromed assembly.
Mr Pöttering said the partnership between the EU and GCC is "a key element in ensuring sustained regional geopolitical stability", adding that the EU and Qatar "ought to be partners, partners in dialogue in order to overcome misperceptions and ignorance that far too often engender clashes, violence and extremism ."
During his visit to Qatar, Mr Pöttering discussed energy, the Middle East peace process, Iran and regional stability and religion and tolerance with government officials including the Emir of Qatar.
