The war-ravaged Horn of Africa (Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Uganda) will be on the agenda of the plenary with MEPs asking for "African solutions" to stabilise the region. They also call for consolidation of the EU presence through the appointment of an EU special representative.
MEPs doubt that in a region where five out of seven countries are in conflict with their neighbours, where Somalia has been lacking a functioning government for the last 15 years, where the percentage of the population below poverty is more than 22 % the concept of regional partnership work as a "cure-all" for such a complex inter-related issue.
The House believes that, in its efforts to address the crisis in the Horn of Africa region, the EU should seek African solutions, with the involvement of the regional organisations in place, the African Union (AU) and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) . These organisations should be strengthened through the EU-funded African Peace Facility able to provide the necessary resources.
According to MEPs, the Commission and the Council should to start a consultation process with the UN, AU, IGAD, Arab League, USA and China, on the initiative of convening a Comprehensive Security Peace and Development Conference to deal with the security concerns of all Horn of Africa States simultaneously.
MEPs deplore the fact that neither the European Parliament nor the Parliaments of the African countries, nor the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, nor civil society representatives were duly consulted at any stage of the formulation of the EU-Africa Strategy adopted in December 2005.
The fight against HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria, as well as neglected diseases and female genital mutilation, must be one of the key strategies for eradicating poverty according to the House.
