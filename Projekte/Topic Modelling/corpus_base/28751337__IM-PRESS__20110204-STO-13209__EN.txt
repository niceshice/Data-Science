The UK's Prince Charles joined senior EU leaders at the Low Carbon Prosperity Summit Prince noted that the equivalent of 24,000 football pitches of rainforest a day is still being destroyed "We need to decouple economic growth from growth in consumption" Britain's Prince Charles joined MEPs and senior EU figures to co-host a "Low Carbon Prosperity Summit" at the European Parliament in Brussels on 9 February. Scientists, NGOs and business leaders also came to talk about how Europe and the world can create a low carbon economy. Prince Charles said economic growth should be decoupled from ever greater environmental destruction.
Welcoming guests Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek noted that the EP had been the first to institute an environment committee after the first direct elections in 1979. He said it was a place where "ideas can become laws".
Mr Buzek noted that the EU's "20/20/20" strategy to cut emissions by 20%, increase energy efficiency by 20% and use 20% of renewable energy by 2020 was a step in the right direction. He said the European Energy Community initiated last May was an important step forward for efficiency. He also said that partnerships between public, private and NGOs were essential.
Prince of Wales: "Stopping deforestation is not a lifestyle choice"
In a speech ranging across climate change, agriculture, the rainforest, marine life and accounting, the Prince of Wales said, "ideas generated here help...make things better for tomorrow" and called on MEPs "to set Europe on course for survival and prosperity".
He noted that the equivalent of 24,000 football pitches of rainforest a day is still being destroyed and warned that the very "fabric of the earth's life support system" is in danger of collapsing. "Stopping deforestation is not a lifestyle choice, it is critical."
The Prince said "we need to decouple economic growth from growth in consumption" and called for a change in approach that is focused on the "resilience" of natural capital. "We have to do more today to avert the catastrophes of tomorrow."
More effective land use needed says Prince
Among the instruments that can be used to encourage the "green economy", Prince Charles called for "integrated reporting" from business, focusing on the health of "natural capital", which shows the real costs to the long-term economy.
Noting that in some cases land is only used to 40% of capacity, the Prince called for more effective land and marine management that takes into account the catastrophic effects of intensive farming methods on the natural world. "We need to focus funding on strengthening diversity," he said. "Smart subsidies" are vital to strengthen farm, marine and energy systems "so that we can get through future shocks on international markets."
