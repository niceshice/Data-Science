On Tuesday 1 April 2008, the Environment Committee will hold a hearing with the Cypriot Commissioner designate, Androula Vassiliou. Over three hours, she will answer questions from MEPs about her political career, her views on the EU and her plans for the health portfolio.
Ms Vassiliou has been designated by the Cypriot President to replace Markos Kyprianou, who is leaving the Commission to become Cyprus’s Foreign Minister. Commission President José Manuel Barroso is proposing that she takes on the health portfolio vacated by Mr Kyprianou. She will therefore be taking part in a hearing organised by the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee, with the additional participation of MEPs from the Agriculture Committee and the Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee.
The hearing will take place from 14.00 to 17.00 on 1 April 2008 in room PHS 01A02 (the Anna Lindh room) at the European Parliament in Brussels. It will be shown live on Europe by Satellite and streamed on Parliament’s website, EP Live.

Immediately after the hearing, the Commissioner designate will hold a press briefing in the EP press conference room PHS 0A050.
