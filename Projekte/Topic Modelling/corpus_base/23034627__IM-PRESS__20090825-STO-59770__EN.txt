(L to r) Karel de Gucht, Development: Paweł Samecki, Regional Policy: Algirdas Šemeta, Budget Three prospective new European Commissioners will face questions from MEPs next week at hearings over their suitability for the posts. Karel de Gucht of Belgium has been nominated for the Development and Humanitarian Aid post, Algirdas Šemeta of Lithuania for Financial Programming and Budget and Poland's Paweł Samecki for Regional Policy. They have already taken up their duties on an interim basis since two of their predecessors were elected as MEPs and one President of Lithuania.
MEPs on Development, Budget and Regional Committees respectively will quiz them about their qualifications for the post as well as their views and policy priorities.
If one or all of the candidates is deemed not to pass muster then MEPs can refuse to vote for them to be officially appointed when a vote of all 736 Members of the European Parliament is held on 16 September.
Hearings on Tuesday/Wednesday (1-2 September)
Karel de Gucht is a Flemish ex-MEP and Belgium Foreign Affairs Minister. Algirdas Šemeta is a former Lithuanian Minister of Finance. They will both have their hearings on Tuesday (which can be watched live online) whilst Paweł Samecki, a former board member of Poland's National Bank will have his Q&A with MEPs on Wednesday.
They have all been nominated by national capitals as temporary European Commissioners prior to the new Commission being appointed later in the year.
