A journalist is taking notes while the President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering, opened the last plenary session of the current Parliamentary term The fifth anniversary of the EU's enlargement in 2004, the imprisonment of a journalist in Iran, the execution of another Iranian woman and the shocking incident in Apeldoorn in the Netherlands were the subjects of statements by EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering at the opening of this week's plenary session in Strasbourg.
The President first spoke of the 2004 enlargement which brought ten new Member States into the EU and was followed by the accession of Romania and Bulgaria in 2007. "It is the greatest achievement of our times that this was possible", he said. "Through this process the European Union has gained in strength, diversity and cultural richness. Enlargement was and is an enrichment for each and every Member State and for the European Union as a whole".
However, said Mr Pöttering, "a larger and more diverse European Union needs closer cooperation and a greater ability to take action". The Lisbon Treaty contained the central institutional reforms required to enable this, he said, and, while the treaty process was not yet finalised, he looked forward to its completion in the near future.
Tragic events in Iran and Netherlands
The President then spoke of the "tragic situation of US-Iranian journalist Roxana Saberi", who has been accused in Iran of spying for the USA and sentenced to eight years in prison. She was tried behind closed doors and is currently on hunger strike.
In the name of the EP he supported the statements issued by the United States and the Council of the EU, and called on the Iranian authorities to release her "immediately and without conditions". Her plight "also reflects the dramatic human rights situation in Iran", said Mr Pöttering, a situation which is getting worse as regards civil and political rights, even though Iran has committed itself to a number of international instruments on these matters.
The President also deplored the execution of another young woman, Delara Darabi, for a crime she was accused of having committed as a minor. This execution was "against all the rules of international law", he said.
Lastly, Mr Pöttering spoke of the "terrible events in Apeldoorn in the Netherlands", where a man crashed a car through a crowd of people during the Queen's Day parade. The EP President voiced his deepest concern and expressed Parliament's condolences to the Dutch Queen and the relatives of those killed.
Agenda changes
The House voted to replace Thursday's urgency debate on Fiji, under Rule 115 of the Rules of Procedure, with a debate on the situation of Roxana Saberi. The other two topics remain unchanged: Madagascar and Venezuela: the case of Manuel Rosales.
