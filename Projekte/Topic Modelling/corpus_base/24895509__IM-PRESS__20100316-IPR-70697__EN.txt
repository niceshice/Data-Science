EP Budgets Committee backs aid to unemployed in Lithuania
Budget
2010-03-17 - 11:57
Around 1,100 former furniture and textile workers in Lithuania could get EU aid worth €1.2 million following a vote by the EP Budgets Committee on Wednesday. The aid would finance measures such as training, job-search assistance and business start-ups.
The plans still need to be approved by the full Parliament and the Council of Ministers. If that happens, a total of 1,127 workers will get aid worth €1.8 million, of which the European Globalisation Fund will pay €1.2 million. Of the 1,127 workers, 491 used to work at 45 companies in the clothing sector and 636 were employed by 49 furniture manufacturing firms.
The Lithuanian authorities argue that the clothing and the furniture sectors are suffering from declining demand as a result of the economic crisis. The textile sector in Europe has been weak for some time but the economic crisis has made things even worse for the industry. The furniture companies are also affected by a slowdown in construction activity.
Lithuania has one of the highest rates of unemployment in the EU, meaning alternative job opportunities are few and far between.
The aid measures include information on job opportunities, the development of personalised employment plans, job-search assistance, entrepreneurship and other training, and job-search and training allowances.
Three applications to the European Globalisation Adjustment fund have already been approved so far in 2010: one from Germany (former employees at the Karmann industry) and two from Lithuania (for construction workers and for ex-employees at the refrigerator producer Snaige).
If these two new proposals are adopted, a total of €8,761,966 will have been paid out from the 2010 EU budget under the Globalisation Fund, leaving a maximum of just over €491 million available under the Fund for the rest of the year.
The Budgets Committee, whose reports on the two proposals were drafted by Barbara Matera (EPP, IT), approved the plans by a show of hands. The full Parliament will vote on 25 March.
