The Lisbon Treaty gives the EU new competence in sports. This report is the first one on the subject by the EP. It proposes measures to crack down on sports-related violence and calls for new means to support mass participation sports.
Fair play on and off the pitch
Among the other proposals, the report calls for:
trafficking in doping substances, match-fixing, illegal betting, and money laundering related to professional sports to be made criminal offences
the creation of an EU database listing people banned from stadia to help crack down on violence
better exchange of information on hooligans between member states to prevent their attending international matches
revenues from audiovisual rights be distributed fairly between elite and mass participation sport
betting operators should contribute to funding mass participation sport, as their commercial activity is linked to sports
In addition, the report says major sport events should not be broadcast on an exclusive basis. "Audiovisual rights should be obtained by the corresponding leagues and not directly by the clubs," Mr Fisas Ayxela said. "Sports event organisers should be able to sell audiovisual rights at a different price in the different member states."
The report also wants to strengthen the European identity in sport by:
organising a European day of sports each year
designating a European capital of sports each year
setting up a European mobility programme for young athletes
