Debates on the Middle East and Europe's economy are just two issues that the Parliament's website will be covering this week. Tuesday sees the EP's working group on the Middle East debate possible ways forward with leading European figures (watch it live at 17.15). Wednesday sees a debate in the Hemicycle on the outcome of the last European summit (live from 14.00). Also this week we speak to Rajendra K. Pachauri, the Chair of the UN's climate change panel and learn about this year's spring day.
Midweek online will see a full report of the debates from the Hemicycle Chamber in Brussels where MEPs will debate the results of the EU summit. When they met in mid-March EU leaders discussed the state of Europe's economy.
Also on Wednesday we look at the launch of the annual "spring day for Europe" which aims to get school children talking about European values and issues that affect their daily lives. This year it will run through to the end of June and will look at cultural diversity among young people in Europe in this, the European year of intercultural dialogue.
Fresh from a speech he will deliver to MEPs on climate change and global security on Wednesday, we speak to Rajendra K. Pachauri, Chair of the United Nation's climate change panel. On Thursday we carry an exclusive interview with the Nobel winner.
As Easter celebrations wind down for most Europeans, we ask MEPs to share with us their thoughts and traditions from Easter in their respective countries.
All of these stories and more news from the European Parliament are available here online.
