Promoting democracy, trade and supporting the environment will be among the priorities of EUROLAT, a new parliamentary assembly that brings together MEPs and lawmakers from Latin America. Inaugurated in the European Parliament, its 120 members are hoping that it will provide a strong parliamentary link to existing political, human and economic ties between the EU and Latin America. All participants stressed their desire to strengthen and expand those links.
By joining this parliamentary assembly the 25 states of the European Union will be entering into closer partnership with the countries of Latin America - Mexico, Central America, South America and the Caribbean. It includes small countries like El Salvador and major international players like Brazil and Argentina.
Last year the EU exported €58 billion worth of goods to the region - mainly capital goods, transport equipment and chemical products. In turn it imported €67 billion worth of agricultural products, transport equipment and energy.
A "lively affair"
In the opening ceremony on Wednesday 8 November, Parliament's President Josep Borrell stressed the relationship is not just about trade but also "shared values". An important part of the meeting was the election of EUROLAT's two Co-Presidents and 12 Vice-Presidents. Spanish MEP José Ignacio Salafranca from the European People's Party and Ney Lopes - current president of the Latin America Parliament - will act as Co-Presidents. Mr Salafranca said he hoped the new assembly would remain a "lively affair". Mr Lopes said the challenge is to "make sure...it grows, develops and consolidates".
The origins of the European Parliament's involvement lie in resolutions adopted in 2001 and 2006 in favour of a body to improve cooperation with Latin America. In Vienna last year heads of government meeting at the EU-Latin American Summit in Vienna expressed their support.
Latin America has three main regional bodies for stimulating cooperation in the region. They are Mercosur (Mercado del Sur), SICA (Central American Integration System) and the Andean Community. Mexico and Chile are not members of any of these regional organisations and so the EU has developed specific relations with them.
The establishment of EUROLAT builds on the 17 EU-Latin American parliamentary summits that have taken place since 1974.
