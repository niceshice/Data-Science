The European Parliament will once again mark "Earth Hour" by switching off lights in all its buildings for one hour this Friday and Saturday. The official Earth Hour is on Saturday 27 March from 20.30h, but to boost the impact, Parliament will also switch its lights off on Friday, March 26 at 18.00h. "Earth Hour" is a global environmental initiative.
Earth Hour is a global WWF initiative aimed at fighting climate change. It began in Sydney in 2007. In 2008, 50 million people took part and by 2009, over 4,000 cities in 88 countries officially switched off to pledge their support for the planet. This year, over 120 countries and territories worldwide will turn off their lights for one hour to show their support for fighting climate change. Individuals, businesses, governments and communities are invited to turn out their lights for one hour on Saturday March 27 from 20.30h to 21.30h to show their support for action on climate change.
