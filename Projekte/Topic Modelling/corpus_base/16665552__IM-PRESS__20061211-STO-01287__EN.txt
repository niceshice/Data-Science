Elmar Brok / Alexander Stubb: reports focus on EU enlargement
A European Union that began with 6 members will have 27 in two weeks. The continued desire of countries to join is a tribute to its success, but raises two key questions: what are the limits of the EU and can it enlarge without reforming the way it works? On Wednesday morning MEPs will debate two reports on these issues during the plenary session. A day later EU leaders meet - with Turkey's troubled EU aspirations on the agenda.
In just two weeks Bulgaria and Romania will join the EU. As it stands Turkey, Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are currently in the EU's "waiting room" as possible future members. They have been classified as "candidate countries" meaning negotiations on membership have begun. Albania, Bosnia Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia are "potential candidate countries" where formal negotiations have not begun.
The two reports being debated in Parliament this week look at the EU's "main challenges" in this area in the coming years and whether the Union has the ability to "absorb" new members.
"Institutional overhaul of the Union is a need"
The first, drafted by German Christian Democrat Elmar Brok, Chair of Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, calls for urgent treaty reforms ahead of the 2009 European elections. It also says that an "institutional overhaul of the Union is a need per se". It calls on Turkey to resolve differences with Cyprus and welcomes the progress of Croatia and the prospects of countries in the Western Balkans.
The report also restates the need to keep to the "Copenhagen criteria" in the enlargement process. Outlined in 1993 these state the conditions of EU membership - democracy, rule of law, respect for human rights and protection minorities.
However, they also state that the EU must have the "absorption capacity" to accept new members. Bluntly, this means will the Union be able to function if new members continue to join? The position of the Brok report is that at the moment the answer to this question is "No".
Public opinion must be fully taken into account
This is underlined in the second report being debated on Wednesday - by Finnish People's Party MEP Alexander Stubb. He urges the EU to keep to "existing commitments" as regards new members, but says that the current "decision making structures are outdated". It says that some policies are 50 years old and need to be adapted. It also states that public opinion should be taken more fully into account when new EU members are considered.
The last point could be taken as a reference to the "No" votes on the EU Constitution in France and the Netherlands in 2005. Some commentators put a part of this down to "enlargement fatigue" one year after 10 new members were admitted.
After 2004 the EU developed a "neighbourhood policy" towards 10 countries in the Mediterranean and 6 ex-Soviet states. They have no possibility to join the EU either because they don't fulfil membership conditions or they don't wish to join. Instead the EU is developing trade and economic links to ensure the EU has "friendly" countries on its borders.
