Simpler, clearer laws will make life easier for everyone
The drive for clearer and simpler EU regulation is likely to be boosted later today when MEPs debate four reports on the subject. They are expected to call for full involvement of the Parliament, the Council and the Commission when laws are being drafted. It will also call for stakeholders such as NGOs to be consulted more widely as well as greater transparency in the overall process. The own initiative reports have already been backed by Parliament's Legal Affairs Committee.
The reports will add to the Commission's "better regulation" initiative. Launched in 2005 it came in part after figures released in 2002 showed that there were 14,500 pieces of binding EU legislation. If written down it would amount to 97,000 pages in the EU's rulebook the "Official Journal" - which as any reader will tell you is not exactly bedtime reading. With such an amount, the question arises, are they all necessary?
The scale and complexity of EU legislation is often blamed for many citizens' lack of interest in the EU. Over-regulation can also be bad for business, especially for smaller and medium ones who employ two thirds of Europe's workforce.
"Bonfire of the regulations"?
In May last year, the European Parliament adopted several reports and a resolution strongly in favour of the European Commission's "better regulation" initiative of October 2005. Dubbed by some the "Bonfire of the regulations" it aims to simplify, codify (merge several laws into one) and modify 222 basic pieces of legislation and 1,400 legal acts.
The "big picture" strategy of the Commission is, together with EU members, to reduce the administrative burden on companies by 25% within six years.
In May last year Arlene McCarthy, the British Labour MEP who Chairs Parliament's Internal Market Committee, drafted a report on the implementation and impact of current internal market legislation. Her conclusions were that "too often it is consumers and citizens who pay the price for poorly drafted or poorly implemented laws, as unnecessary or bad law is costly for business".
A similar report in 2006 on lawmaking in the EU by Italian Green Monica Frassoni stressed the need to focus on the quality, not just quantity of EU legislation, as well as its implementation. She said "it is a cause for concern that the Commission does not apply the same zeal to prosecuting the failure to implement EU law....She went on to call for more resources to control "the implementation of EU law instead of thinking of only cutting the laws".
The four reports mentioned at the head of this article will be debated later today (Monday 3 September) when Parliament's September Plenary session opens in Strasbourg. You can watch the debate live online using the second link below.
