Air quality: MEPs want to go further than Council

On Tuesday 9 October the EP Environment Committee adopted its draft second-reading recommendation on the air quality directive. MEPs chose to re-table a number of first-reading amendments not accepted by the Council in its common position, notably on the particles most dangerous to health - the PM 2.5 - while providing for some derogations. MEPs hope to reach a second-reading agreement under the Portuguese presidency.
The recommendation, drafted by Holger Krahmer (ALDE, DE) and adopted by 35 votes to 4 with 9 abstentions, deals with a new directive on air quality which envisages maximum concentration levels for the atmospheric microparticles or dust most hazardous to human health, the PM2.5, which were not regulated until now.
Fine particles (PM 2.5)
For the finest particles (PM2.5), which do the most damage to lungs, MEPs propose setting, during an initial stage, a "target value" (which would be less binding than a "limit value"). However, this target value would be lower than the one proposed by the Council ((20µg/m3 from 2010 instead of 25µg/m3) and would become binding when the directive is revised in 2015 (and would still be 20µg/m3) whereas the Council would keep the 25µg/m3 level.
Larger particles (PM 10)
MEPs suggest reducing maximum concentration levels of the largest particles - known as PM10 - to 33 µg/m3 on average per year from 2010, whereas the Council wants to keep the limit at 40µg/m3, as proposed by the Commission.
Regarding the daily limits for these same particles, MEPs agreed to the Council's common position, which says that a figure of 50µg/m3 should not be exceeded more than 35 times per year.
Derogation
The Environment Committee is calling for a three-year exemption, as from the entry into force of the directive, in areas or cities which cannot meet the targets "because of site-specific dispersion characteristics, adverse climatic conditions or transboundary contributions". This applies to the PM10 limit values.
However, MEPs want greater flexibility as regards the possibility of prolonging the exemption by two further years for PM2.5 and PM10 alone. This exemption would be granted provided a plan is submitted showing why these maximum figures for particles cannot be met despite any measures taken at national and local level.
Lastly, the committee argues that, within two years of the entry into force of the legislation, the Commission should propose binding measures to reduce atmospheric pollution from motor vehicles, including boats and aircraft, as well as the application of Euro VI norms for heavy goods vehicles, new standards for domestic heating equipment and lower emissions for the latter as well as for emissions from farming.
