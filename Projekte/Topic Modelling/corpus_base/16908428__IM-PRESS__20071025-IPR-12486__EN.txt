MEPs endorsed a resolution in plenary on the Akkas Gas Field in Western Iraq calling on the Commission "to withdraw or amend its draft decision establishing Special Measure for Iraq", and to submit a new draft decision. According to the EP, the special measures for the exploration of the Akkas Gas Field in Western Iraq in view of linking its output to the Syrian gas pipeline network are not in line with the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI)'s main objective which is poverty alleviation.
The resolution says that "the Commission exceeds the implementing powers laid down in the basic act by selecting as one of the areas of intervention â€˜Feasibility Study for the Akkas Gas Field".
