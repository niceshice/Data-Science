European Council
Preparation for the European Council - reaction to budget proposals
2006-05-29 - 11:06
MEPs will debate one of the most important summits of recent times just one day before the European Council in Brussels is due to start. Douglas ALEXANDER, UK Minister for Europe, will lead the debate for the Council. Prime Minister Tony BLAIR will briefly be in Strasbourg on Thursday 15 December for a working lunch with the leaders of the Parliament's political groups. He will then travel on to Brussels for the start of the summit.
Budget negotiations will dominate the summit's agenda with the UK Presidency looking for agreement on the EU's financial perspective for 2007 to 2013. President Josep BORRELL will address the Council in Brussels at 6pm on Thursday 15 December.
President Josep Borrell has spoken of his deep reservations about the British presidency's draft compromise on the next Financial Perspective for 2007-13.
This proposal "differs radically from the position adopted by the EP in its plenary vote," says Josep Borrell. "I do not think Parliament will be able to accept it." Mr Borrell advises the Member States "not to waste too much time on a proposal which has no chance of working". There can be no doubt about the determination of the European institutions to reach an ambitious financing deal for 2007-13: "If the Commission and Parliament see this agreement as unacceptable, then it is stillborn."
Parliament reached its position on the next Financial Perspective last June, with the adoption of a report by Reimer BÔGE (EPP-ED, DE) which sets out a total of €974 billion in commitment appropriations for 2007-13. The British presidency's compromise proposal is considerably lower, setting the limit at €847 billion.
The Financial Perspective system is not set out in the existing treaties - instead it is based on an insterinstitutional agreement between the Parliament, Commission and Council. The disagreement of any one of the three would prevent the establishment of this financial framework.
A further report from Mr Böge, adopted by Parliament on 1 December, confirms Parliament's intention to defend its position regarding the figures. The final compromise, according to this report, must also take on board qualitative aspects, such as a reform of the own resources system, improvements in budgetary management and a new " flexibility instrument ."

Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought to be awarded on 14 December in Strasbourg
2006-05-29 - 11:06
The Cuban opposition movement "Damas de Blanco", the Nigerian human rights lawyer Hauwa Ibrahim and the international organisation "Reporters without Borders" are this year's joint winners of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. The Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament decided to award the prize to all three short-listed candidates.
The Sakharov Prize will be presented to the winners in Strasbourg at midday on Wednesday 14 December during the plenary session of the European Parliament.
On Tuesday 13 December, from 11.00 am - 12.00 noon, there will be the possibility to interview all laureates at the "Tulips" (near the main Chamber). Following the awarding of the prizes in the main Chamber at midday on Wednesday, a press conference with the winners will take place at 1pm. Press kits on the Sakharov Prize will be available in the press rooms in Strasbourg and Brussels.
Three winners:
" Women in White " holds peaceful demonstrations every Sunday against the detention of their husbands and sons who are imprisoned for political reasons. Hauwa Ibrahim is a lawyer defending women who face being stoned to death for adultery and young people who face amputation for theft under Islamic Sharia law. Reporters without Borders campaigns for press freedom throughout the world and their defence of journalists against censorship and harassment.
Nigerian lawyer Hauwa Ibrahim has built up what can only be described as an extraordinary practice: defending women condemned to death by stoning. In those Nigerian states which apply Islamic law, adultery carries the death penalty. A Muslim herself, Hauwa Ibrahim works tirelessly - voluntarily and despite intimidation - to fight religious fundamentalism. Will the provisions of her own country’s Constitution and international support be enough to win the battle? She believes so.
" Reporters Without Borders " - a group that campaigns for press freedom around the world - is the third and final nominee for Parliament's Sakharov prize for freedom of thought. The group, celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, defends and supports journalists and others working in the media from persecution and censorship.
They call themselves the " Ladies in White " (" Damas de blanco ") and were formed in early 2004. By wearing white to symbolise innocence and purity they echo Argentine women in the 1970's who used a similar tactic to demand information about their missing children during the military dictatorship. The arrest of political dissidents in 2003 continues to cast a shadow over Cuba. Most of the 75 men detained are still in jail - imprisoned for criticising the lack of political freedom in the country. However, the attempt to silence them has failed as their wives and daughters have brought international attention to the issue by their peaceful protests every Sunday.
Frequently Asked Questions
1. Who was Andrei Sakharov?
The prize is named after Andrei Sakharov (1921-1989), who achieved world renown as one of the inventors of the Soviet hydrogen bomb. Realizing the dangers of its potential abuse, he spent a lot of time raising awareness of the nuclear arms race. In the Soviet Union he was seen as a dissident and was jailed for his beliefs. He also founded a committee to defend human rights and the victims of political trials in 1970. Five years later his efforts for international peace won him the Nobel Prize.
2. So, who picks the winner?
Every year MEPs and Political Groups in the Parliament nominate candidates - from this list the Committee on Foreign Affairs select three "finalists". The chairpersons of the political groups (the "Conference of Presidents") then select a winner. The prize is formally awarded by the President of the Parliament during the December Plenary session. The winner receives a certificate and a cheque for 50,000 euros.
3. What is the purpose of the award?
By rewarding outstanding achievements in the fight to protect freedom of thought and expression against intolerance, fanaticism and hatred, the Parliament seeks to raise awareness about human rights. This reflects its conviction that fundamental freedoms include not only the right to life and physical integrity, but also freedom of expression and of the press, two of the most effective means of fighting oppression and key yardsticks by which to judge whether a society is democratic and open.
4. Who won last year?
The 2004 Sakharov prize went to the Belarusian Association of Journalists for their work in promoting press freedom in Belarus. The first award was in 1988 and was awarded jointly to Nelson Mandela and Anatoli Marchenko.

White Paper on Information Strategy
2006-05-29 - 11:06
MEPs will react to a Commission statement on the launch of a preparatory document for the long awaited White Paper on information strategy.
This comes after the Commission launched its so called " Plan-D " which seeks to improve the way that the Commission presents its activities to the outside world. The forthcoming White Paper on communication strategy and democracy will start a consultation process on the principles behind communication policy in the European Union and the areas of co-operation with the other European institutions and bodies. Together with Plan-D these initiatives set out a long-term plan to reinvigorate European democracy and help the emergence of a European public sphere, where citizens are given the information and the tools to actively participate in the decision making process and gain ownership of the European project.

Deal before end of year on EU data retention law?
2006-05-29 - 11:06
At the time of print, the Council and Parliament are in negotiations as to a first reading agreement on data retention. The draft directive aims to facilitate judicial co-operation in criminal matters by approximating Member States' legislation on the retention of data processed by providers of telecommunications services. The text covers traffic and location data generated by telephony, SMS and internet, but not the content of the information communicated.
Parliament's Civil Liberties Committee recommends approving a new EU law which will help national authorities to track down possible criminals and terrorists by granting them access to a list of all telephone calls, SMS or Internet connections made by suspects during the previous few months. However, MEPs are proposing a number of amendments seeking to safeguard individual privacy.
Limited access to data
In the report drafted by Alexander Nuno ALVARO (ALDE, DE), the Civil Liberties Committee is proposing a number of amendments to the Commission text to restrict the use of retained data and ensure that the future law fully respects the privacy of the telephone and internet users.
On the purpose of the directive, MEPs in the committee agree with the need to retain data for the detection, investigation and prosecution of crime, but only for “ specified forms ” of serious criminal offences (terrorism and organised crime), and not for the mere “ prevention ” of all kinds of crime. Committee members feel that the concept of prevention is too vague and could lead to abuse of the system from national authorities. They also propose deleting a paragraph from the Commission proposal authorising Member States to use data retention for “ other related purposes ”.
MEPs in the committee provide for data to be retained by the telecommunications companies for a minimum of six months and a maximum of 12, (the Council's position is set out below). The committee also proposes adding a provision for “ effective, proportionate and dissuasive ” penal sanctions for the companies who fail to store the data or misuse the retained information.
Only judicial authorities from an EU Member State should have access to the retained data from phone or internet providers, say MEPs in the committee. Furthermore, access would be granted to third countries such as the USA only by means of an international agreement. MEPs in the committee also insist that if national authorities from the EU which are responsible for the investigation of serious crimes in a Member State need to have access to concrete data they would need to get judicial authorisation. The Commission and the Council prefer to grant access to any competent authority determined by Member States. In addition, MEPs in the committee want access to retained data to be limited to specific purposes and to be granted on a case-by-case basis (the " push system "): the authorities would need to request each time to the telecom company the data related to a specific suspect, instead of having access granted to the whole database, as the Council prefers.
As for the type of data to be retained, MEPs in the committee support the registration of location data on successful calls, SMS and internet use, but prefer to leave up to the Member States the retention of data on unsuccessful calls. The problem is that telecom companies do not currently register lost calls for billing purposes and so to do this using new technologies would be expensive. Some Spanish members support the Council position and would have preferred to include the retention of unsuccessful calls, since the terrorist attacks in Madrid were prosecuted thanks to the investigation of specific lost calls from mobile phones.
Who foots the bill?
Finally, MEPs in the committee argue that the telecom companies should be fully reimbursed by the Member States for all costs of retention, storage and transmission of data, including investment and operational costs. The Council does not agree with this and the Commission had only provided for the reimbursement of “demonstrated additional costs”.
Council's position
The Council agrees to reach a " first reading deal " with the European Parliament on a Directive on data retention by the end of the year.
Ireland , Slovakia and Slovenia entered reservations. In particular, the Irish authorities announced that the Irish government is considering bringing the case before the European Court of Justice (ECJ) if the European Parliament approves the scheme saying it regards the matter as an issue between Member States, excluding EU competence.
Some of the elements of the Council position are the following:
• Serious criminal offences
A reference to serious crime is included in the text of the Directive, as defined by each Member State in its national law. Member States shall have due regard to the crimes listed in article 2(2) of the Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant (2002/534/JHA) and crime involving telecommunication.
• Retention periods
Member States should ensure that the categories of data referred to in the draft Directive are retained for periods of not less than 6 months and for a maximum of two years from the date of the communication.
• Internet data
The Council is in favour of an obligation to retain data on Internet access, Internet e-mail and Internet telephony.
• Unsuccessful calls
The Council is in favour of including the retention of data in relation to unsuccessful call attempts where that data is generated or processed, and stored (as regards telephony data) or logged (as regards Internet data) by providers of publicly available electronic communications services or of a public communications network within their jurisdiction in the process of supplying the communication services concerned. This Directive shall not require the retention of data in relation to unconnected calls.
• Flexibility
Article 15(1) of Directive 2002/58/EC would continue to apply in relation to data, including data related to unsuccessful calls, which are not specifically required to be retained under the present Directive and therefore fall outside the scope of this Directive, and for retention for purposes, including judicial purposes, other than that covered by this Directive.

Romania: further reforms a precondition for accession in 2007
2006-05-29 - 11:06
The Foreign Affairs Committee is warning Romania that "immediate steps" are needed to deal with widespread corruption, discrimination against minorities and other issues if the country is to be ready to join the EU on 1 January 2007.
In a report on Romania's readiness for EU accession, drafted by Pierre MOSCOVICI (PES, FR), MEPs in the committee note that " significant improvements " had been made in Romania's preparations for accession. However, they point out that progress had not been satisfactory in several areas. Citing " persistent delays " in the fight against corruption and the implementation of legislation on agriculture, public contracts and the environment, the committee calls on Romania to take " immediate steps to make good these shortcomings " in order to join the Union on 1 January 2007. MEPs in the committee support Romania's efforts to accede on that date.
Committee members are proposing three key compromise amendments. These include provisions on the fight against corruption, especially at the highest level, minorities' issues in general and the Hungarian minority problem in particular.
Determined efforts must be made to combat corruption, at every level of the judiciary, law-enforcement services and the public administration. This is " one of the highest priorities ", the Foreign Affairs Committee concludes.
MEPs in the committee also complain about discriminatory measures still contained in Romanian electoral laws and repeated in a draft law on minorities, and called for legislation on minorities to be adopted as soon as possible, in line with the Copenhagen criteria. " Additional measures need to be taken to ensure the protection of the Hungarian minority in accordance with the principles of subsidiarity and self-governance ", say MEPs in the committee, calling on the Romanian authorities to fully sustain higher education for the Hungarian minority by providing the necessary financial resources.
The document reiterates the priorities pointed out by the European Commission, which stresses that Romania must continue the course and pace of reforms. Committee members support the Commission’s plan to reach a decision on whether or not to postpone the date of accession on the basis of the results obtained by Romania by the spring of 2006.

Bulgaria's entry in 2007 looking on track?
2006-05-29 - 11:06
The Foreign Affairs Committee supports Bulgaria's accession to the EU on 1 January 2007 on condition that it implements reforms in a number of key areas. The committee's report on Bulgaria's preparedness for EU membership, which is based on the latest monitoring report of the European Commission and urges the Bulgarian government to show "increased and visible determination" concerning problematic areas and "to demonstrate in a concrete manner" that action has been taken before April 2006.
MEPs in the committee call on the Bulgarian government to step up efforts in the fight against organised crime and are concerned about " the brazen nature of Bulgarian organised criminal elements, their contempt for the law and challenge to the authority of the state ". High-level corruption is another issue raised in the report. The committee calls on the Bulgarian government to continue work on its anti-corruption strategy and urges continued reform of the judiciary. The report notes the need for a constitutional amendment that will guarantee clearer division of responsibilities and greater effectiveness in the prosecution and investigation of crime. Other problematic areas remain Roma integration, child welfare, psychiatric care and the agricultural system. Committee members also call on the government to improve all aspects of border control and to make increased efforts in all areas of the internal market.
MEPs in the committee believe Bulgaria remains on course to meet the common objective of membership on 1 January 2007, " by which time she must have fulfilled the conditions laid down in the Treaty of Accession ." They emphasise that the accession of the country should depend exclusively on its own merits yet express the hope that the accession of Romania and Bulgaria will take place at the same time.

Sugar reform: more financial support for ACP countries in 2006
2006-05-29 - 11:06
Bernard LEHIDEUX (ALDE, FR) for the Development Committee is demanding extra aid for the ACP countries hit by the overhaul of the Community sugar regime. MEPs in the committee want the EU to provide €80m in 2006, double the €40m proposed by the European Commission when it unveiled the reform in June this year.
The figure of €80m would come from the External action budget heading, a key area in the ongoing negotiations between Parliament and Council on the 2006 budget.
At the same time the Development Committee urges ACP countries affected by the reform to promote non-food uses of sugar such as bioethanol production. And MEPs want the reform's flanking measures to be extended automatically to 2007 if negotiations on the next financial perspective drag on, thereby delaying implementation of the new instrument for development aid and economic cooperation.

Fisheries: women's networks and financing arrangements
2006-05-29 - 11:06
Parliament is to debate three reports from the Fisheries Committee. The first two, under the consultation procedure, deal with the financing of the Common Fisheries Policy and contributions to Member States' fisheries control programmes. The third, an own-initiative report, looks at the role of women's networks in fishing, farming and diversification.
The report by Paolo CASACA (PES, PT) deals with community financing for Member States fisheries control programmes. As well as some amendments clarifying the text, MEPs in the committee want to remove the provisions relating to the Commission's own fisheries activities, which should be dealt with elsewhere. In some areas, the report calls for community financing for the new Member States to be up to 75 per cent of the costs.
Catherine STIHLER (PES, UK) has drawn up the report on financial measures for implementing the CFP and the Law of the Sea. Here the Commission proposal involved consolidating a number of existing regulations into one text. MEPs in the committee want this text explicitly to include the objectives of Community financial measures. The also want funding for regional advisory councils (RACs) to continue for more than the initial five year period. Another point in the report is that the Council should adopt a framework regulation on fisheries agreements with third countries, rather than these being negotiated on an ad-hoc basis.
The own initiative report, by Elspeth ATTWOOL (ALDE, UK) considers the role of women's networks in the fishing industry. The report stresses the important, if often unnoticed, role women play in fisheries dependent communities and calls on the Commission to produce a report on the activities of women's networks in these communities. The committee wants the Commission and Member States to look into ways of supporting the development and creation of such networks, while also aiming to eliminate barriers to women's full participation in the industry.

Budget
Green light for 2006 budget?
2006-05-29 - 11:06
Parliament will debate the EU budget for 2006. After initial disagreement, there has been agreement between Council and Parliament on the figures. A European Parliament delegation met the UK presidency on Wednesday 30 November to address the issues that scuppered the conciliation meeting on the 2006 budget. An agreement was reached on the level of payments for 2006 and special financing arrangements for the EU's external action.
The figure for payment appropriations will be €111,969 billion, equivalent to 1.01% of the European Union's gross national income. Gianni PITTELLA (PES, IT), Parliament's general rapporteur on the 2006 budget, said the result was "important in the light of the upcoming discussions on the next financial perspective, as the level of payments decided for 2006 is higher than that proposed in the Luxembourg and British compromises for 2007-2013". It is important to bear in mind that, were there to be no agreement on the next financial perspective, it is the 2006 budget which would serve as the basis for negotiations to set subsequent annual budgets.
Janusz LEWANDOWSKI (EPP-ED, PL), chair of the Budgets Committee, also sees the compromise as "a good omen" ahead of the EU summit in mid-December as well as proof that "the Parliament and Council can agree on complex financial dossiers".
It should also be noted that, as with the 2005 budget, it will be possible to find extra funding for structural measures if money runs short in the course of the year.
Around €275 million is envisaged over and above the ceiling of the current financial perspective for the heading External action via the flexibility instrument. This was a major bone of contention at the conciliation between Parliament and Council (with the latter refusing to go above 200 million) but this use of the flexibility instrument will make it possible to finance reconstruction in Iraq and in countries hit by the tsunami of December 2004. It will also help the ACP countries (African, Caribbean and Pacific) affected by the sugar reform and provide more money for the common foreign and security policy (CFSP).
The total funding for the CFSP for 2006 rises to €102.6 million, an increase of 40 million compared to the 2006 preliminary draft budget. Information meetings on CFSP actions between MEPs in the committee and ambassadors representing the Council must now be held every three months.
Lastly, the Council accepted Parliament's request to provide €100 million in extra funding for a range of programmes directly affecting the public which are crucial to the Lisbon strategy: Life, Socrates and programmes for research, small and medium-sized firms, young people and cultural organisations.

Economic and monetary affairs
Application of MiFID to be postponed
2006-05-29 - 11:06
The deadlines for the implementation of the Directive on Markets in Financial Instruments (MiFID) will be postponed by a total of 18 months if Parliament accepts the advice of its Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee. In a co-decision report by Pia Noora KAUPPI (EPP-ED, FI), the committee supports the consensus reached in the Council, which would allow this change to take effect at this first reading stage.
MiFID was originally intended to be transposed into national legislation after the standard period of two years from adoption, in this case by April 2006. Many players in the financial services industry and a number of Member States have told the Commission this is too short a period in which to implement this complex piece of legislation. The present proposal from the Commission is to extend by six months the deadline for changing national laws and add a further six months before firms are expected to apply the new rules. The Economics Committee is proposing that the delay should be nine months followed by nine months, with the final date for application being 1 November 2007. [Am 4, Article 1, Point 3] This is in line with the consensus reached between national ministers in the Council, so, if the plenary agrees, the change can be made at this first reading stage.
The only other significant change made by the committee concerns the provisions for implementing measures to be adopted by the Commission using the 'comitology' procedure. Here, Ms Kauppi's report inserts the same text agreed by the Council, Commission and Parliament during the passage of the capital requirements directive, which limits to two years the powers granted to the Commission, pending a review of the system to be agreed between the three institutions.

Energy
Parliament and Council close to agreement on energy efficiency?
2006-05-29 - 11:06
Agreement has been reached between a European Parliament delegation, made up of representatives from the main political groups, and the Council on a directive aiming to encourage Member States to save energy and use it more efficiently when it is sold to private households or the public sector. Mechtild ROTHE (PES, DE) will be recommending that Parliament approve this agreement is in second reading.
The compromise asks Member States to save 9% of the energy supplied to end users in the nine years following the directive's entry into force. The Council had been arguing for a 6% reduction over six years. Some of the MEPs regretted that the goals were not binding, but merely advisory, in accordance with Member States' wishes. Nevertheless, "the Member States will have to adopt multiannual Energy Efficiency Action Plans, in which they must set out intermediate goals and the measures needed to attain them," said Mrs Rothe.
The agreement sets out that Member States will have a period of two years to transpose the directive into national laws - nevertheless, they will have to send the Commission their first action plans before 30 June 2007.
Another positive point for Parliament is that the public sector will have to give an example. Member States are invited to develop guidance aiming to include energy efficiency as a criterion for public procurement processes. More information will be provided to consumers - they will receive detailed and regular statements on their energy consumption, something the rapporteur welcomed.
This directive, which aimed to encourage energy saving, covers the great majority of forms of energy sold to end users: electricity, gas, heating oil and transport fuels. It was tabled as part of the Commission's December 2003 energy package.

Transport
Easier air travel for passengers with disabilities
2006-05-29 - 11:06
MEPs are to debate a plan to improve the rights of air passengers with disabilities. They will vote on a first reading co-decision report from Robert EVANS (PES, UK) for the Transport Committee which aims to broaden the proposed regulation, by explicitly including rights for people who are blind, partially sighted, deaf and hard of hearing. This would be in addition to a those already covered by a reference to passengers with reduced mobility.
The committee is proposing a number of other change to the Commission's draft. While the Commission wanted airport managing bodies to provide the services directly to disabled people, MEPs in the committee say they should be able to contract out the service to other providers, taking into account existing services provided at the airport, for example by some airlines. The committee insists that assistance must be available from relevant arrival points accessible by all means of transport to the airport. MEPs says disabled people can be denied boarding only in order to meet legal safety requirements or if the size of aircraft or its doors make it impossible to accept the passenger concerned, though in the latter case an alternative must be offered. In any case, passengers denied boarding must be offered full reimbursement of their costs or the opportunity to book onto another flight at no extra cost. The committee stipulates that appropriate services must be available if the passenger has notified the carrier or tour operator 48 hours before their flight.
Under the new regulation, airport staff should be able to move disabled people from a designated arrival point to the check-in counter and enable them to check-in and register their baggage, proceed from the check-in counter to the aircraft and board the aircraft, with provision of lifts, wheelchairs or any other assistance needed. When people with reduced mobility are assisted by an accompanying person, this person must, if a request is made, be allowed to provide assistance in the airport with embarking and disembarking. The carriage of recognised guide dogs to and from the cabin should also be guaranteed.
Since the vote in committee, informal talks between the rapporteur and the Council have been underway with a view to reaching a first reading compromise on this text, allowing it to become law straight away.

Green light for revision of Eurovignette directive
2006-05-29 - 11:06
Corien WORTMANN-KOOL (EPP-ED, NL) for the Transport Committee will recommend that Partliament approves a draft legislative report which will represent an important step towards the introduction of a harmonised European system for the calculation of tolls and road charging for heavy good vehicles. This is one of the priorities of European transport policy for the near future.
The directive aims to harmonise transport tariffs in all Member States in order to strengthen the Internal Market and establish a fair system of charging for the use of infrastructure based on the " user pays " and the " polluter pays " principles. It seeks to introduce standard methods for calculating the costs of transport modes. And it aims to promote the use of transportation with the least environmental impact and stimulate new investment in transport infrastructure. MEPs in the committee argue that an agreement was urgently needed as a growing number of Member States were considering introducing tolls and/or road charging.
The committee is proposing a number of compromise amendments addressing the most controversial issues of this directive, such as the definition of external costs, the geographical scope of the directive, the types of lorries concerned, toll variations and the concepts of " earmarking of revenue " and an " urban mark-up ".
External costs
" External costs " are those clearly caused by the road freight system but not calculated in the market price of their services. These can include chargeable congestion costs, environmental costs, noise, landscape damage and social costs such as health and indirect accident costs which are not covered by insurance.
The Transport Committee calls on the Commission to present no later than two years after the entry into force of this directive a generally applicable and comprehensible model for the assessment of all external environment- congestion- and health-related costs to serve as the basis for future calculations of infrastructure charges. This model shall be accompanied by an impact analysis of the internalisation of external costs for all modes of transport. After that, the Commission can come up with a new proposal. The committee also proposes that if a revision of the directive is not adopted within three years after the presentation of the model, Member States may add no more than 60% of the infrastructure costs to reflect a minimum of extra costs.
Lorries over 3.5 tonnes to be covered by the directive
Although the Council of Transport Ministers had proposed that tolls and/or user charges be applicable only to vehicles with a permissible laden weigh of 12 tonnes or more, the Committee takes the view that lorries of 3,5 tonnes or more should be covered by the Directive by 2010 at the latest.
Earmarking of toll revenue
Two compromise amendments are proposed on the earmarking of revenue: where Member States levy tolls or user charges for use of roads in the trans-European networks (TENs) this revenue should be used for the maintenance of the infrastructure concerned and the transport sector as a whole.
Geographical scope
Tolls and user charges are supposed to be applied to the whole of the trans-European road network. But the committee wants that Member States be allowed to exempt from tolls or user charges any part of the network where there is a need to encourage and maintain the economic integration of isolated or economically weak regions or where there is a need to avoid perverse incentives for diverting traffic.
Urban mark-ups
Over and above the provisions of the directive, the relevant authorities may impose urban traffic charges and regulatory charges on any road, notably in areas including TENs roads which cross an urban area. The committee is also in favour of mark-ups of a maximum 25% in urban areas, to be known as "urban mark-ups".

Regional policy
State aid as a tool for regional development - call for a more lenient application
2006-05-29 - 11:06
The reformed rules on state aid as a tool for regional development should be more generous to regions suffering from natural, geographic or demographic disadvantages, according to the Regional Development Committee. Miloš KOTEREC (PES, SK) for will be putting forward an own-iniative report on the subject. MEPs in the committee call for the ceilings for the so-called 'statistical effect' regions to remain unchanged during the next Financial Perspective (2007-2013).
The Committee on Regional Development supports the view that the " statistical effect " regions should maintain Objective 1 status and receive the same treatment with regard to state aids (Article 87 (3) a) as the Union's other poorest regions for the duration of the 2007-2013 programming period. They thus unequivocally reject the Commission's suggestion that this should be reviewed after three years.
Commenting on the lack of precision and details in the new guidelines regarding regional policy and especially on the lack of detailed rules for the recovery of aid, MEPs in the committee stress the importance of taking into account all dimensions of cohesion. They also request appropriate attention be paid to rural areas, areas affected by industrial transition, and regions which suffer from severe and permanent or demographic handicaps such as the northernmost regions with very low population density and islands, cross border and mountain regions.

Environment
Batteries - reducing waste and dangerous chemicals
2006-05-29 - 11:06
Johannes Blokland (IND/DEM, NL) for the Environment Committee will be tabling a legislative resolution on batteries, accumulators and their waste. Mr Blokland deplores that the common position does not reflect a number of first reading amendments and defines less ambitious targets for collection of batteries and accumulators. He insists on the need to strictly limit the use of heavy metals since alternatives are widely available and already produced by most of the operators.
The main objective of the Directive initially proposed by the Commission is to restrict and reduce the disposal of waste batteries and accumulators and to increase the level of their collection and recycling.
On the legal base, the committee says Article 175 of the EC Treaty (environment) should be the only legal base instead of the dual base proposed (Art. 175 and Art. 95, internal market)
On collection schemes, the committee wants individual producers may not refuse to take back waste industrial batteries and accumulators provided these have a similar chemical composition to those placed on the market by that producer. End-users should be obliged to return their waste industrial and automotive batteries and accumulators. Distributors should be obliged to take back spent portable batteries from end-users at no charge.
The Environment Committee also say more ambitious targets should be set for portable batteries and accumulators: 40 % after 6 years and 60 % after 10 years (rather than 25% and 45% as proposed by the Council). After seven years the Commission should put forward proposals to increase collection targets.
On financing, the committee says producers should finance any net costs arising from public information campaigns on collection and recycling. Responsibility for meeting the costs of collection, treatment, recycling and disposal of " historic waste " (batteries placed on the market before the entry into force of the Directive) should lie with producers. Member States must ensure that producers are allowed to recover their costs but that these costs are not shown separately at the time of sale to the end-user.

Consumers
A consumer culture in the new Member States
2006-05-29 - 11:06
MEPs from the Internal Market committee are calling for increased support for consumer organisations and the development of a 'consumer culture' in the new EU Member States. This comes in a report by Henrik Dam KRISTENSEN (PES, DK) which is now to be debated by the plenary session.
The creation of a ‘consumer culture’ based on a high level of awareness is "essential for better enforcement and application of the existing legal framework" , say committee members. The internal market, they insist, will not function properly as long as consumers in some Member States are protected less than in others. Though new Member States have succeeded in transposing existing Community legislation on consumer rights into their legal systems, implementation will not be completed until their citizens become ready and able to act as "political consumers".
The new Member States' consumer protection authorities have a key role to play in creating such a consumer culture, according to the report. Still, such authorities often face numerous challenges and the committee is calling on Parliament and Council to devote more money to enhancing consumer protection in the new Member States and urging the Commission to support awareness-raising campaigns and training programmes for consumer organisations and their staff. MEPs in the committee also underline the need for cooperation between organisations in the new and the old Member States -- be it through twinning projects, mentoring projects or other knowledge-sharing programmes.
The committee observes that Commission requirements for obtaining project grants are "strict and difficult to meet" for under-funded consumer organisations in the new Member States. MEPs accordingly ask the EU executive to examine whether such criteria could be made more flexible.
The committee also wants the Commission to launch an objective information and education campaign "to prepare consumers for the adoption of the Euro in the new Member States".

Taxation
Backing for a common company tax base
2006-05-29 - 11:06
Parliament is to debate a report which backs the idea of a common consolidated corporate tax base within the EU. The report from the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee was drawn up by Pier Luigi BERSANI (PES, IT). It also support a pilot scheme on home country taxation for small businesses.
Noting that European companies are hampered by tax obstacles, problems of double taxation and high compliance costs when they invest or operate in another Member State, the committee welcomes the Commission's proposals for a common consolidated corporate tax base at European level. This would make it possible to determine the taxable revenue of a group of companies according to a set of common rules defined at European level. The aim would be to remove barriers set up by different national tax systems, to reduce bureaucracy and compliance costs, to create equal conditions for companies based in different Member States and to remove problems of double taxation and tax evasion.
MEPs in the committee reaffirms that this would not in any way prejudice the fundamental rights of the Member States on tax matters, in particular the right to set the rates of corporate taxation. [§9] They regret that some Member States still reject the need for greater cooperation on tax matters, in particular tax bases applicable to companies. They say the best way forward would be via an EU regulation creating a common tax base and a method of apportionment among the Member States, allowing companies to offset and consolidate profits and losses globally throughout the EU. A second best approach would be to use the enhanced cooperation mechanism, which allows some Member States to go ahead with a project applying only to those in favour if the necessary unanimity for EU-wide action cannot be found. There should, says the committee, be a step by step approach, initially giving companies the choice of whether to apply the EU or national system, with an assessment then being made of whether to make the common base compulsory.
On the issue of home state taxation for SMEs, the committee supports the Commission proposal for a pilot project to test the scheme, which would allow SMEs to calculate the taxable revenue of a parent company and all its branches and subsidiaries in other Member States applying the tax rules of the home State. Agreements on sharing of revenue between the participating Member States would be essential.

MEPs are to debate the second reading of a proposed directive aimed at modernising and simplifying EU legislation on machinery. A recommendation by Andreas SCHWAB (EPP-ED, DE) for the Internal Market Committee proposes a limited number of amendments, many of which aim to clarify the obligations placed on businesses and reduce unnecessary or unworkable burdens placed upon them. Rapporteur Andreas Schwab EPP-ED DE A6-0338/2005 Machinery, lifts: free movement, safety, health and consumers protection (recast direct. 98/37/EC, amend. 95/16/EC) Procedure : Codecision (2nd reading)

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Supporting 2007 as European Year of Equal Opportunities for All
2006-05-29 - 11:06
The European Commission is proposing that 2007 should be the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All. Parliament is now to hold first reading debate on the EU decision setting out the basis of activities during this year, which will have four main objectives:
Raising public awareness of people’s rights in the field of equality and non‑discrimination;
Fuelling the debate on ways to strengthen social participation by under‑represented groups;
Celebrating diversity;
Promoting respect and tolerance.
In a report by Martine ROURE (PES, FR), the Civil Liberties Committee supports this project and makes a number of amendments. Many are simply textual clarifications, but the MEPs in the committee also want to ensure that the issue of multiple discrimination is included and that the administrative procedures involved in funding different projects and events are simplified. Rapporteur Martine Roure PES FR A6-0366/2005 Non discrimination and gender equality: European year of equal opportunities for all 2007 Procedure : Codecision (1st reading)
