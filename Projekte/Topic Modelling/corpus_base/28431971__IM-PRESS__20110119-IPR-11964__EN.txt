The EU should step up co-operation and support to improve prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care for patients with Alzheimer's disease or other dementias, said Parliament on Wednesday.
"The incidence of Alzheimer's disease doubles every 20 years, but European responses are too often absent or very weak. The situation of patients, their families and carers is very imbalanced across Europe. It is therefore a priority to strengthen efforts towards early diagnosis and prevention, research, and proper health services", commented Marisa Matias (GUE/NGL, PT), who drafted the non-legislative report.
An estimated that 10 million Europeans suffer from dementia, with Alzheimer's accounting for the vast majority of cases. Women make up a disproportionately high share of both sufferers and carers.
MEPs call for dementia to be made an EU health priority and urge Member States to develop dedicated national plans and strategies (only seven EU countries currently have national strategies in place). These strategies should address the social and health consequences, as well as services and support for sufferers and their families.
The report welcomes the fact that the EU is already investing €159 million in neurodegenerative disease research projects. However, MEPs also say funding arrangements for the next funding period should address the fragmented nature of research. They highlight the need to raise awareness of the issues and propose a European Year of Mental Health.
The Matias report was approved with 646 votes in favour, 6 against and 6 abstentions.
