Getting people plugged into the opportunities of the internet is key
The first ever forum on internet governance (how the internet is managed) starts today in Athens. A key part of the meeting - attended by a delegation of MEPs - will be the “digital divide” that deepens the abyss between rich and poor. Also considered will be how freedom of expression can easily be trampled on the internet and cultural issues like the fact that 95% of the world's languages have never been used online. As globalisation advances - managing these issues will be vital in the future.
We seem to live in a world of permanent technological innovation. The internet and the increasing role it plays in communication, work, shopping, politics and even relationships continues to evolve rapidly. How to make the best of the opportunities this presents while safeguarding them against abuse is a key issue in the growing field of internet governance.
Prior to leaving for Athens, the delegation of MEPs held a public hearing organised by Parliament's industry committee to discuss the core themes that are on the forum's agenda, namely: openness, security, diversity and access.
The internet - a tool for competitiveness and democracy
The conclusions reached were: if the opportunities the internet presents are to be fully grasped - then people - be they in government, civil society or in business must share the responsibilities and cooperate. Secondly, security measures to protect children and guard against fraud are required - but a "surveillance society" was rejected. Finally, the internet must be a tool for competitiveness and democracy.
Catherine Trautman, the French Socialist MEP who chaired the hearing and who will lead the delegation in Athens said that, “the internet has evolved into a global facility available to the public - and its governance should constitute a core issue of the information society agenda”.
Patrik Fältström of the US computer company Cisco Systems, who also advises the Swedish government, said that not only will computers be "everywhere in future" but cell phone technology could lead to "greater interconnectivity" between work, home and every items.
Language diversity encouraged
Promoting cultural awareness and widening the linguistic use of the internet is a key area. Teressa Serra i Majem, member of the Parliament of Catalonia in Spain, explained to the hearing that education promoting digital literacy and appreciation of different cultures and languages could be highly effective.
The hearing also heard that the availability and affordability of the internet were vital in spreading its usage to those in poorer nations.
Athens is follow up of the "Second World Summit in Information Society", which took place in Tunis in November 2005. The agenda of the forum in Athens contains five plenary sessions and will focus on four main themes: openness (including freedom of expression / information), security (spam, privacy), diversity (multilingualism and local content) and access.
