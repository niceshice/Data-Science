Would you feel safer on board a flight if there was an armed "sky marshal" sitting next to you ready to defend the plane? For some the answer would be an unequivocal "yes", for others visions of a mid-air gun battle fill them with horror. In Plenary next week MEPs will vote on a report that accepts the idea of sky marshals but says they must be highly trained, that no country will be obliged to accept them and that a decision on whether they can be armed is up to the national authorities.
The use of such marshals is hardly new. The Israeli national carrier El Al and Air India have used them for years. However, it was the 9/11 attacks on the United States that pushed them into the spotlight as a possible way of preventing future hijackings. In 2003 the US ordered all foreign airlines to have armed guards as a precaution against terrorist attacks.
MEPs reject compulsory measures
Last week Parliament's Transport Committee voted unanimously on a revision of the "Common Rules in the field of aviation security". Following the vote, Parliament's rapporteur Paolo Costa for the Liberal ALDE group said that "the regulation does not require sky marshals to be on flights. It simply recognises that this will happen where the competent national security authorities consider it necessary". His comments made it clear that the Transport Committee had rejected any compulsory measures, instead insisting that no country will be obliged to accept sky marshals.
On the issue of training for possible marshals he said "my report requires in-flight security officers to be properly trained and specific authorisation to carry weapons is also required". Mr Costa said the authorities "on the ground" were "best placed to judge where the balance of advantage lies in specific cases".
In practice this would mean the country that grants an airline the operating licence - for example the UK with British Airways - would take the final decision.
Mr Costa is also concerned about how the costs of new security measures would be met and by whom. The report calls for airline passengers and countries to bear the cost.
MEPs meeting in Strasbourg next week for the April Plenary session will hold a vote on the report, you can follow it here live on the website.
