These include: security of food supply; better food quality and food safety; environmental and climate issues; the economic viability of farming and preservation of the social fabric in rural areas. Overcoming these challenges will also enable the CAP to contribute to the EU 2020 goals of smart, inclusive and sustainable growth. The reformed CAP will start in 2013, at the same time as the EU's next Multiannual Financial Framework.
Separately, the Food Quality package aims to assist farmers to better communicate the qualities and characteristics of agricultural products and at the same time help consumers have better information about those products. There are several schemes at European level for designation of origin of a product (PDOs) or geographical indications (PGIs), as well as a system for recognising traditional specialities (TSG).
The workshop will provide an opportunity to question Members of Parliament on their views on both these issues and on the various options available. 09:00 13:30 Brussels, room PHS 7 C 050 Link to programme Paula Fernández Hervás PORT +32 498 98 32 36 Michel Plumley PORT +32 498 98 32 38 Yannis Darmis BXL +32 2 28 43816 Jan Jakubov PORT +32 498 98 35 90 2011-06-23 Plenary session Plenary agenda
