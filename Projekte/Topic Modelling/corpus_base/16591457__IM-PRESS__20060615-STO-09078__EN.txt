New EP President Jerzy Buzek wants the public to be better informed about the importance of EP Committees After the inaugural plenary session in Strasbourg MEPs return to Brussels for the first Committee week of this term. Already last week several of the newly formed committees elected their chairs; the remaining will follow suit today. Subsequently the committees are set to deal with different subjects on Parliament’s agenda ranging from EU budget and climate changes to European satellite radio navigation programmes.
The responsibilities of the committees The Parliament has 20 permanent committees and 2 subcommittees covering issues as diverse as foreign affairs and fisheries, which act as motor to the Parliament's legislative "engine room". Each committee consists of between 24 and 76 MEPs and reflects the balance of political groups within the EP. Between plenary sessions the committees meet with the representatives of other institutions, organisations and civil society. They draw up reports about, and make amendments to, proposed legislation, for which they have responsibility alongside ministers. They can also draw up own-initiative reports. The committees hold public hearings on the wide range of subjects that fall within their remit, with speakers from a variety of fields and backgrounds. During the plenary session the committee "Rapporteur" responsible for drawing up a report presents its position and amendments to the full chamber so that the subject can be discussed and voted on by all MEPs. And for special cases… The Parliament also sets up special committees to look into specific issues or to investigate perceived violations of European law or its application. It set up two temporary committees in the 2009-2009 term, one to investigate whether European countries and the CIA cooperated in the illegal detention and transportation of prisoners, the second on the collapse of Britain's Equitable Life insurance company.
