EU energy summit under the spotlight
2011-01-31 - 11:36
Ahead of the European Council meeting of 4 February, which will focus on energy and innovation, MEPs in Brussels this week will debate the EU's energy strategy priorities with the Council and the Commission. The discussion is scheduled for Wednesday. Energy policy, the shift towards a low-carbon economy, security of supplies and the introduction of binding targets are likely to be among issues raised during the debate. Parliament is also keen to hear more about plans to complete the European Research Area, improve framework conditions for innovation and simplify and rationalise EU research programmes.

Better management of e-waste
2011-01-31 - 11:36
From broken fridges to unwanted phones, the volume of Europe's electric and electrical waste is growing rapidly. Parliament will vote on Thursday on updated rules to improve collection and recycling and stop the illegal export of such waste. This draft law is an update of the 2003 Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive and is being steered through Parliament by Karl Heinz Florenz (EPP, DE). It aims to address shortcomings and inconsistent application of the current rules, partly by simplifying rules and cutting administration costs.
Collection, treatment and recycling targets are set to be based on the quantity of electric and electrical goods going to market. The EP Environment Committee has recommended that Member States should collect 85% of WEEE by 2016 and recycle 50-75% (depending on the category). Recovering valuable raw materials has clear economic and environmental benefits.
MEPs also want to stem the illegal flow of e-waste outside the EU, which poses risks to health and the environment when it is processed in sub-standard conditions. Tighter definitions could help differentiate between reusable goods, which are allowed for export, and waste, which is not. This would need to be backed up with tougher inspections.
No agreement has yet been reached with Council, which will reconsider its position after Parliament's plenary vote.

Turmoil in Egypt and Tunisia
2011-01-31 - 11:36
MEPs will discuss the political crises in Egypt and Tunisia on Wednesday with Catherine Ashton, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs. On Thursday Parliament will adopt a resolution on the EU's relations with Tunisia in the aftermath of the Jasmine Revolution. A resolution on Egypt will come before the Strasbourg plenary of 14 to 17 February. "The authorities have today a unique opportunity to truly respond to the grievances of the Egyptian people. They should embrace people's legitimate aspirations – social and political – for more freedom, pluralism and democracy", said EP President Jerzy Buzek in Brussels on 26 January.

Financial supervisory authorities
2011-01-31 - 11:36
MEPs have asked for guarantees from the Council and Commission on the independence and resourcing of the EU's new financial supervisory authorities. As a result, Council and Commission are expected to make statements on this issue to the plenary, followed by a round of political group speakers. On Tuesday, the Economics Committee decided to postpone any recommendation on the candidates to lead the new bodies. Parliament has the right to take a plenary vote on the candidates if it wishes to object to their nomination.

South Sudan after the referendum
2011-01-31 - 11:36
Following the recent referendum on the future status of Southern Sudan, MEPs will discuss the situation with High Representative Catherine Ashton. With partial results indicating that voters have backed the separation of Juba from the north, many challenges lie ahead, including the border demarcation issue, the distribution of oil revenues and the creation of a viable state.
The referendum's preliminary results are expected to be announced by 2 February. Veronique De Keyser (S&D, BE) led the EU observation mission and Mariya Nedelcheva (EPP, BG) led Parliament's six-strong observation mission on the ground.

EU recognition of Roma genocide in World War II
2011-01-31 - 11:36
At the opening of the session, Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek will make a statement on the EU's recognition of the Roma genocide in World War II. This will be followed by contributions from the political group representatives. During World War II tens of thousands of Roma were murdered by the Nazi regime and its allies. Some EU Member States, such as Germany in 1982, have already recognised the genocide of the Roma during World War II. The same act by the EU would be a historic event for Europe's biggest minority. On 27 January 2011, the EU commemorated the 66th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi concentration and extermination camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau.

Democratic oversight of development and human rights funding
2011-01-31 - 11:36
MEPs are expected to stick to their demand for better parliamentary scrutiny of EU funding for development, democracy and human rights projects in third countries when they vote at second reading on the revision of EU external financing instruments.
At its first-reading vote last October, Parliament overwhelmingly backed a call to use "delegated acts" for external assistance financing instruments. This would give Parliament a de facto veto, enabling MEPs to demand changes to such projects.
EU governments rejected Parliament's demands but the Foreign Affairs, Development and International Trade committees are recommending that Parliament stick to its guns at second reading. As the Council seems unlikely to accept Parliament's position, the legislation may well go to conciliation.
This money pays for a range of causes, from civil society organisations in Belarus to Tunisian human rights and democracy activists. One of the best known instruments is the European Initiative for the promotion of Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), which has a budget of €1.104 million for 2007-2013.
With the Lisbon Treaty in force, Parliament co-decides with the Council on almost all new laws, but lacks real control over implementing EU instruments for external co-operation. However, Article 290 of the Lisbon Treaty empowers Parliament to object to or even to revoke certain decisions proposed by the Commission on where and how money is spent.

Sixteen-year banana war to end
2011-01-31 - 11:36
Parliament is expected to ratify the 2009 Geneva deal on banana trade tariffs, which has put an end to the 16-year trade dispute with Latin American countries. MEPs nevertheless warn that this deal will not fully reconcile the interests of all parties. The EU has agreed to gradually end its preferential treatment of banana exporters in African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries in exchange for an agreement by Latin American countries to drop their complaints at the WTO. The decision now requires Parliament's consent.
The EU's gradual cut in its import tariff on bananas from Latin America, from €176 per tonne at the outset to €114 in 2017 will make Latin American bananas more competitive on the EU market. The main ACP banana-producing countries are to receive compensation from the EU budget of up to €200 million.
What happens to EU banana producers?
Francesca Balzani (S&D, IT) believes the special financial provisions for the EU's banana-producing outermost regions are not enough. In a separate resolution, MEPs therefore ask the Commission to submit an assessment of the agreement's impact on banana-producing developing countries and on the EU's outmost regions up to 2020.
They also urge the EU to adjust the POSEI arrangements ("Programme d'Options Spécifiques à l'Eloignement et à l'Insularité" or "Specific Options for Remoteness and Insularity Programme") to ensure sufficient financial support is provided to the EU's outermost regions: La Réunion, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Guyane, Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands.
