Age Regulations - the hardest yet? Do they present a greater challenge than sex, race or disability discrimination

EU laws banning age discrimination came into effect on 1 October 2006 in the UK
Recent weeks have seen a sudden flurry of press articles and broadcast interviews on the UK's new Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006 which come into force on 1 October bringing discussion and analysis of what they will mean for employers and employees alike.
The regulations outlaw unjustified age discrimination in employment and vocational training, including pay and pensions. A range of leaflets and guides has now been produced to help people understand the implications and advise what to do in the case of potential discrimination (see links below). The focus of the media a week before the appearance of the Regulations seems to suggest that they come almost as a surprise. In fact they implement the age strand of the European Employment Directive from 2000 which provided for a period up to end 2006 for national implementation. Since then debate has raged in the UK as to what our age discrimination laws should cover and a range of help-lines and specialist websites have been in operation for some months to encourage preparation for 1 October.
The Directive has been implemented across many Member States already (see link below). Pension provisions, forming part of the Government’s new age-discrimination legislation, will not now come into force in the UK until 1st December 2006. This delay will give schemes more time to adjust to the new rules.
Recent research by the Ludic Group with the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), commissioned and designed by employment law experts Croner revealed that the new age regulations are likely to present organisations with far greater challenges than sex, race or disability discrimination. Ageism was considered more socially acceptable than other prejudices, such as race and religion. Research participants thought that certain jobs in their company came with an age tag and accepted this as the 'way it has always been.'
Research from The Employers Forum on Age (EFA) has discovered:
16.6 million Brits (61%) in employment have been aware of ageist behaviour happening in their workplace.
Nearly a third of people are happy to work until they're 70
More than one in ten people dread retirement
45-59 year olds now form the largest group in the labour force
68% of employers seeking skilled staff are experiencing recruitment difficulties
95% of 55-65 year old men were working in 1975. In 1999 it was close to 60%
75% of people in Local Government employment are retiring early
Nine out of 10 people aged 50 and over receive no training from their employer at all
At least 40% of people who retired early feel that they were forced to against their will and would rather have continued to work
A significant proportion of IT professionals think the term older worker can be applied to someone younger than 35
Close to half of young workers say they've been held back at work because of their age
UK MEPs who worked closely with interested UK organisations and who took part actively in the debates on the EU Employment Directive, now speak six years later about how they feel on finally seeing the directive in UK law.
Philip Bushill-Matthews , spokesman for the Conservatives and co-President of the Intergroup on Ageing in the European Parliament says: "This EU legislation supports the aims of the Lisbon agenda: removing barriers to increasing the participation of older people in the labour market as well as in training.
However there are grave concerns about how the legislation is being implemented in the UK. The government has refused to remove (or raise) the mandatory retirement age despite mounting evidence that people in their 50s and 60s want the choice to continue working should they so desire. Many people in the UK also report that their employer has forced them to retire against their wishes. The government should address the impact of this wasted potential - which mostly amount to higher costs in terms of pension payment, lost output and unfulfilled members of society. Employers should be more creative in accommodating older people who want to continue in the labour force. People can learn from the experiences in Finland where workplaces and working conditions are more flexible, and better adapted to the needs of older workers: the result is an over 50% participation rate in the labour force of people over the age of 70" He adds a final note of caution: "Any anti-discrimination legislation is a potential minefield. We should all remember that its purpose is to provide more opportunities for older people, not bigger pay packets for lawyers."
Liz Lynne for the Liberal Democrats welcomes the fact that: "At last the UK government has fulfilled its obligations and brought forward legislation outlawing discrimination in the workplace on the basis of age". She points out that: "What it will mean is that employers will have to have far better reasons for not employing older people and will not be able to put age limits in their job adverts. The current UK Government, fought incredibly fiercely to exclude age from this directive and that it was only due to pressure from the European Liberal Democrats, Age Concern and others that it was included."
She adds: "The fight is not over - the new law doesn’t apply to the provision of goods and services so it will still be lawful for some companies and health care providers to discriminate on the grounds of age, which is clearly an unacceptable situation. This is why I will continue to urge the Commission to bring forward a new directive outlawing discrimination on the basis of age in the provision of goods and services.”
Jean Lambert on behalf of the Green Party emphasised just: "What an extremely important piece of legislation it is. What we need to make sure now is that people know the legislation exists and what their rights are, otherwise there is a danger it will remain lifeless and will not help change attitudes or ways of behaving."
Richard Howitt MEP - Labour's rapporteur on the Package in 2000 and member of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee says: "Ageism is the last great discrimination in our society to go unconfronted. Our population is growing older, thankfully people are living longer healthier lives, and many want the opportunity to work longer. When you think that one in three of our workers will be over fifty in fifteen years time you see that this legislation is not just desirable, it is absolutely vital.
"We cannot allow this longer life to be spent in poverty and isolation as people who want to continue on in work are excluded from work and the social outlet of work by an arbitrary label of being "too old".
"This law not only acts to help older people, but people of all ages who feel that they are been prejudiced against on the basis not of their skills, experience or qualifications but merely because of their age. As one of the rapporteurs in the European Parliament who worked on this package in 2000, I am deeply proud to now see it coming to fruition. This is not just about changing the law, it is about creating a change in the culture of how our society views and deals with age."
