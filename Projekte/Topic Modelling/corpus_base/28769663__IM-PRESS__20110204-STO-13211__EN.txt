Members of the Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee discuss Turkey and Montenegro Turkey: Constitutional amendments welcome but more needed Montenegro: MEPs endorse "candidate status" but concerned about organised crime The expansion in the number of European Union countries from 6 to 27 has been one of the most remarkable stories in post war and post-Communist Europe. However, there are still a number of countries like Turkey and Croatia that are official "candidate countries". For any country to join the Union it must pass a successful vote on EU membership in the European Parliament. Today (10 February) Members of the Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee discussed Turkey and Montenegro.
MEPs were debating parliamentary resolutions on the European Commission's annual "progress reports" on each country. (More details of the discussions on Turkey and Montenegro can be found using the first two links below).
Turkey : Constitutional changes welcome
In the case of Turkey Members of the cross party committee welcomed the Constitutional amendments enacted in Turkey after a referendum in 2010 as a step in the right direction - though not a final step as overall Constitutional reform is still needed according to MEPs.
Members noted that freedom of the press, women's rights and protection of religious minorities were still slowing down negotiations as is the deadlock in negotiations between Cyprus and Turkey.
Montenegro : corruption, organised crime a concern
On Montenegro MEPs endorsed the decision by European Governments to grant the country "candidate status" allowing formal negotiations to begin.
However, they are concerned about corruption and organised crime - above all money laundering and smuggling. In addition there are some concerns about media freedoms. MEPs would like talks about EU accession to start sometime after the Commission issues its annual progress report later in the year.
Also in the EU queue
In addition to Montenegro and Turkey several other countries also wish to join the European Union. Croatia, Iceland, and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) are so called "candidate countries".
The other countries of the Western Balkans - Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Kosovo under United Nations Resolution 1244/99 - are "potential candidates" and have the prospect to join the EU when they are ready.
Of all the countries Croatia is seen by many as the one most likely to join first. Meeting on 26 January MEPs on the Foreign Affairs Committee said that EU membership negotiations with Croatia can be completed in the first half of 2011 provided its reforms stay on the right track. The position of Croatia will be debated by the full European Parliament on Wednesday morning (16 February).
How does a country "join" the European Union?
To join the European Union a country must pass a series of democratic, political and economic benchmarks (the "Copenhagen criteria"). Negotiations on membership are divided into approximately 30 "Chapters". These are assessed independently by the European Commission which then leaves it to the governments of existing EU member states to decide whether they have been met. A Chapter is closed when the conditions are met. When all Chapters are closed then a country is theoretically ready for EU membership.
