Four questions to Britain's most recent MEP
Brian Simpson MEP replaces the longstanding and recently retired Terry Wynn as a Labour MEP for the North West of England. Mr Simpson was an MEP for 15 years from 1989 to 2004 and has been working for the railway industry for the last two years. In this brief interview, Mr Simpson outlines his priorities for the rest of his term and his views on the portrayal of the EU in the British media.
How does it feel to be replacing Terry Wynn as Labour MEP for the North West?
There is no doubt that I am delighted to be back in Parliament although I'm also a little sad that Terry has retired. Terry Wynn was an excellent MEP for our region and although I have had 15 years experience of my own in the European Parliament it is still difficult following in Terry's footsteps. We will still see each other though as we sit next to one another at Wigan Warriors home games. But I'm happy to be back representing the best region in the world!
As you say, you were an MEP for many years until 2004. Have two years away from the European Parliament given you a different perspective on the work of the European Parliament and on your role as an MEP?
It has, and interestingly enough I've had more press coverage doing the job for our railways than I ever did as an MEP.
What the break has shown me is that there is a life outside of politics and that having an "expertise" helps when the electorate turn against you. It has also given me an insight as to how business and particularly small business has to deal with everyday life. I was lucky that I could work in something that I loved i.e. railways and made some important contacts that I hope will enable me to do my job here a lot better.
What will be your priorities for the remainder of your mandate?
Transport of course...but also agriculture. But also I want to effectively represent our region and do the best that I can from this privileged position that has been entrusted to me.
What are your thoughts on how the European Parliament is covered in the UK media?
I don't believe the British written media are the slightest bit interested in good news stories from the European Union.
But I'm not sure they are interested in good news stories from anywhere come to think of it! All they want is negativity and scandal and this has led in my view to a failing standard of journalism throughout the country. TV and radio and particularly local radio are better but even they can't resist the temptation to be negative at times. All I would ask from the media is for the European Parliament and the EU to get a fair hearing, but I'm perhaps living more in hope than expectation in this regard.
