Briefing - 22-25 October 2007 - Strasbourg plenary session
2007-10-18 - 09:25
Selected highlights of the Strasbourg plenary session include:
The key debate of the Strasbourg week is the outcome of the Informal Summit and the Reform Treaty with MEPs debating with Portuguese Prime Minister José Sócrates and Commission President José Manuel Barroso. Parliament will debate and vote on three reports on pesticides. Smoking in public places will come under close scrutiny. The House also debates and votes on carbon dioxide emissions from passenger cars. Two prize-winners will be announced: the winner of the Sakharov Prize for freedom of expression and the Lux (light) Prize for European cinema. The House also debates and votes on the EU 2008 budget. Afghanistan, Serbia and Russia are among the key debates on foreign affairs.
Monday 22 October 2007
The session starts with MEPs debating three reports on plans to modernise EU law on pesticides (part of the "pesticides package"). From their different standpoints, the chemicals industry, farmers, health professionals, environmentalists and the general public will be watching to see if the plenary endorses the amendments adopted by the EP Environment Committee. The vote takes place on Tuesday 23 October. A press conference follows at 3pm on Tuesday.
Later on Monday evening, Parliament will debate a report on conventional energy sources and energy technology . The need to produce and use energy more safely, efficiently and sustainably across the Union is underlined in an own-initiative report proposed by the EP Industry Committee.
Richard Corbett (PES, UK, Labour Yorkshire) will present his report on the verbatim coverage of debates in plenary.
On Monday evening, the EP debates a non-binding report from Chris Davies (ALDE, UK, Liberal Democrat, North West) saying that carbon dioxide emissions from passenger cars should be capped at an average of 120g/km from 2012, because the industry's voluntary commitment to reduce them is not working. About 19% of the EU's CO2 emissions come from passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. The vote takes place on Wednesday.
As part of a joint debate on Community statistics, Sharon Bowles (ALDE, UK, Liberal Democrat, South East) will present her legislative report on the European Statistical Governance Advisory Board.
Tuesday 23 October 2007
At 10am on Tuesday morning, MEPs will debate the outcome of the informal summit of heads and state government taking place in Lisbon on 18 and 19 October. The Portuguese Prime Minister José Sócrates will explain the outcome of the key summit with Commission President José Manuel Barroso giving his view.
Tuesday afternoon is dedicated to the first reading of the EU budget for 2008 . MEPs in the Budgets Committee wish to reduce the amount allocated in the budget to the Common Foreign and Security Policy and to use the flexibility instrument to fund the EU's external policy. Funding for Galileo and the European Institute of Technology is sharply increased. If the plenary approves these proposals, some hard bargaining with the Council is in store. The vote takes place on Thursday.
On Tuesday evening, MEPs will debate a report from the Environment Committee on w ide-ranging restrictions on smoking in public places and rules to make it harder for underage people to buy cigarettes. The own-initiative report, drafted by Karl-Heinz FLORENZ (EPP-ED, DE) in response to a Commission consultation paper, says that 650,000 people a year die from smoking, including 80,000 from passive smoking, with children and unborn babies being particularly vulnerable.
Wednesday 24 October 2007
Wednesday starts with a debate on EU-Turkey relations with the Foreign Affairs Committee welcoming the recent elections in Turkey, especially the new government's renewed commitment to reforms. In a resolution being proposed, two years after the accession negotiations with Turkey began, the committee also indicates areas in which further progress was still necessary, especially concerning the content of upcoming constitutional reforms.
The House will also debate the forthcoming EU-Russia summit to be held in Mafra (Portugal) on Friday 26 October 2007. President Putin recently announced that he would take part in Russia's legislative elections.
At 11.50am the LUX (light) Prize for European cinema will be awarded by the European Parliament President, Hans-Gert Pöttering. The prize goes to the director of the winning film from the three films in competition.

Portuguese PM and the results of the Lisbon Informal Summit - new Reform Treaty
2007-10-18 - 09:25
The Portuguese Prime Minister José Sócrates will explain the outcome of the key summit being held in Lisbon on 18 and 19 October. Commission President, José Manuel Barroso will also take part in the debate with MEPs. EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering will take part in the informal European Council in Lisbon. The summit is expected to end the Intergovernmental Conference, the new Reform Treaty is likely to be signed in December in Lisbon. The three MEPs who represented Parliament in ministerial level meetings of the IGC - Elmar BROK (EPP-ED, DE), Enrique BARÓN CRESPO (PES, ES) and Andrew DUFF (ALDE, UK) - will also be in Lisbon.
Background to the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)
The problems encountered in 2005 during the process of ratifying the Constitutional Treaty led the Union to engage in a process of reflection on future reform. This resulted in June 2006 in an invitation from the European Council to the future German Presidency to prepare a report on the way forward.
This report, together with the work undertaken by the German Presidency, allowed the European Council at its meeting on 21-22 June 2007 to agree on the convening of an IGC in order to draw up a "Reform Treaty" amending the existing treaties with a view to enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the enlarged Union, as well as the coherence of its external action. The IGC is carrying out its work in accordance with the detailed mandate agreed by the European Council (see link).
The IGC is due to complete its work as quickly as possible, and in any case before the end of 2007, so as to allow for sufficient time to ratify the resulting Reform Treaty before the European Parliament elections in June 2009. As agreed by the European Council, the Portuguese Presidency have drawn up the draft Reform Treaty text in line with the terms of the mandate and will be submitting it to the Summit.

Bringing pesticides legislation into the 21st century
2007-10-18 - 09:25
Next week in Strasbourg, Parliament votes on three reports on plans to modernise EU law on pesticides (part of the "pesticides package"). From their different standpoints, the chemicals industry, farmers, health professionals, environmentalists and the general public will be watching to see if the plenary endorses the amendments adopted by the EP Environment Committee. The debate takes place on Monday 22nd October, the vote on Tuesday 23rd. A press conference follows at 3pm on Tuesday.
Pesticides have a three-stage life-cycle: the placing on the market of new pesticide products; the day-to-day use of pesticides; and the end-of-life or "waste" stage. The pesticides package deals only with the first two stages, as waste is covered by other legislation. The package consists of a Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides (a set of policy guidelines) together with legislation to implement the Strategy.
Parliament's response to the Strategy itself is contained in an own-initiative report by Irena Belohorská (NA, SK), adopted by the Environment Committee by 54 votes to 0, with 1 abstention. The committee makes various recommendations, including a call on Member States to promote low pesticide-input farming, giving priority to non-chemical alternatives. It also stresses that only "quantitative use reduction targets" (set by the Member States themselves) will prompt governments to lower the amount of pesticides used .
Speedier approval - but stricter standards - for new pesticides
Turning to the legislation on the first stage - the placing of new plant protection products on the market - the first-reading co-decision report by Hiltrud Breyer (Greens/EFA, DE) examines a regulation on this subject which updates an EU directive from 1991. Procedures for approving new pesticides will be overhauled with the aim of improving environmental and health protection and reducing animal testing, while boosting competition among manufacturers, to the benefit of farmers and other users.
Two steps: substances to be approved at EU level, products at national level
Under the regulation, a positive list of active substances (the key ingredients of pesticides) will be drawn up at EU level, with the European Food Safety Authority playing a major role. New plant protection products (i.e. pesticides) will then be authorised at national level on the basis of this list. The new rules on pesticide ingredients are separate from the REACH regulation, so these substances will not have to undergo two approval procedures.
Substance approval: time-limits, ban on harmful substances, animal testing as last resort
Under the Commission proposal, most new substances would be approved initially for 10 years though low-risk ones would be approved for 15 years. Those which could be replaced by less toxic substances would be approved for only 7 years. In the latter case, the Environment Committee wants to cut the period to 5 years to encourage the use of non-chemical alternatives. The Commission proposes that all subsequent renewals should be for unlimited periods but the Environment Committee is more wary, voting for approval to be renewed "once or repeatedly for a period not exceeding 10 years".
The committee supports the Commission's proposed ban on substances that are genotoxic, carcinogenic, reprotoxic or endocrine-disrupting, but it wants to further restrict even those minor exceptions the Commission would allow. The committee has also added substances with neurotoxic or immunotoxic effects to the banned category and is calling for special account to be taken of vulnerable groups such as pregnant women, foetuses and children.
In addition, it wishes to tighten up the proposed rules on animal testing, saying this should only be used "as a last resort".
Product approval: MEPs say no to a three-zone EU
For product approval, the Commission suggests dividing the EU into three geographical zones (north, centre and south): any product authorised by one Member State within a zone would be approved by the other countries in that zone. The Environment Committee voted against this idea, preferring a single EU-wide system of mutual recognition within which Member States would have some flexibility to confirm, reject or restrict the approval depending on their national circumstances
The committee also insists that suspected "cocktail" effects of combining different ingredients in a product must be carefully evaluated.
Using pesticides in forests, farms and parks: everyday practice
The second phase in the life-cycle, the manner in which pesticides are used in everyday life (e.g. in farming, forestry and parks), is not yet governed by EU law. To fill this gap, the second piece of legislation generated by the Strategy is a directive on the sustainable use of pesticides. Among the many measures proposed by the Commission:
Member States would draw up National Action Plans to identify the crops, activities or areas most at risk from pesticides, together with targets for tackling the problems;
a ban on aerial spraying with pesticides, albeit with derogations;
measures to identify areas where zero or very little pesticide use is to be allowed.
In a first-reading co-decision report adopted by 34 votes to 11, with 5 abstentions, the Environment Committee voted in some cases for tougher rules than the Commission or Parliament's rapporteur Christa Klass (EPP-ED, DE) proposed.
Ambitious targets needed
While backing the idea of National Action Plans (NAPs), MEPs insist - following the line of the Belohorská report - that the NAPs should meet a specific EU reduction target of 25% within 5 years and 50% within 10 years, and contain national targets, including special ones for particularly active or toxic substances. They also want taxes or levies on pesticides, for two reasons: at Member State level to fund the NAPs and at Community level to discourage pesticide use.
Ban on aerial spraying; protection for water courses, parks and playgrounds
The committee endorses the Commission's proposal for a ban (with derogations) on aerial spraying with pesticides (a widespread practice, for example in forestry and vinegrowing), given the risk that the spray can drift into populated or environmentally sensitive areas. In addition, the committee wants compulsory advance warning for "neighbours" of any spraying operations allowed under the derogations.
To protect water courses, the Commission proposes "buffer zones" where pesticides may not be used or stored. MEPs specify that these zones should be at least 10 metres wide.
Lastly, the Commission is proposing a ban on pesticides in areas used by the general public, namely "parks, public gardens, sports grounds, school grounds and playgrounds". The Environment Committee goes further, adding "residential areas" and areas around "public healthcare facilities" and demanding "substantial no-spray zones" around all these areas.
Next steps
Under the co-decision procedure the EP has an equal say with the Council on the final shape of this legislation, which looks set to go at least to second reading. Following Parliament's first-reading vote on 23 October, the Portuguese presidency, which has made this legislation one of its priorities, hopes to broker an agreement on a common position between Member States at the Agriculture Council meeting on 26 November.

Smoke free Europe? MEPs weigh in on restricting tobacco use
2007-10-18 - 09:25
Wide-ranging restrictions on smoking in public places and rules to make it harder for underage people to buy cigarettes are among the measures proposed by the Environment Committee in their report. The own-initiative report, drafted by Karl-Heinz FLORENZ (EPP-ED, DE) in response to a Commission consultation paper, says that 650,000 people a year die from smoking, including 80,000 from passive smoking, with children and unborn babies being particularly vulnerable. While 70% of Europeans are non-smokers, 86% are in favour of a ban on smoking at work, 84% in other public places, 61% in bars and pubs and 77% in restaurants, notes the committee.
MEPs in the committee therefore welcome the Commission's Green Paper "Towards a Europe free from tobacco smoke: policy options at EU level" but regard it only as a starting point. They urge the Commission to designate environmental tobacco smoke a class 1 carcinogen and call on Member States to introduce, within two years, an unrestricted smoking ban in all enclosed workplaces, including catering establishments, as well as in all enclosed public buildings and transport. The Commission is asked to produce a report on the cost incurred to national health systems and the EU economy as a result of smoking and tobacco smoke.
Toughen existing rules, say MEPs in the committee
The Environment Committee believes an existing directive, from 2001, on tobacco products should be updated to toughen the rules on tobacco additives, including those which are carcinogenic or addiction-enhancing. The report also insists that the same directive include "a renewed library of larger, hard-hitting picture warnings", to be made mandatory "on all tobacco products sold in the European Union".
The report asks the Commission to examine measures such as introducing an EU-wide ban on the sale of tobacco products to people under 18 years of age, allowing cigarette machines to be placed only where they are inaccessible to young people, removing tobacco products from self-service displays in retail outlets and banning distance sales of tobacco products to young people (e.g. over the internet). In the same breath, the committee calls on Member States to commit themselves "to reduce smoking among youth by at least 50% by 2025."
Smoking in the European Parliament
Directing their attention to their own workplace, MEPs in the committee call for Parliament - "in the light of its duty to set an example" - to adopt a smoking ban "with no exemptions" in all areas of the House.
The report also condemns the disregard shown by some Members and staff of the European Parliament for the restrictions on smoking in the European Parliament, e.g. by smoking in staircases or in the open Members' bar in Strasbourg.

Cap cars' CO2 emissions at 120g/km, says Environment Committee
2007-10-18 - 09:25
Carbon dioxide emissions from passenger cars should be capped at an average of 120g/km from 2012, because the industry's voluntary commitment to reduce them is not working, says an own-initiative report proposed by the EP Environment Committee. About 19% of the EU's CO2 emissions come from passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. The vote takes place on Wednesday. Even though "the technology is there to make a significant difference in a short period of time", said rapporteur Chris DAVIES (ALDE, UK) before the vote in the committee, "industry has stalled in reducing CO2 emissions". Welcoming the Commission's plan to propose binding legislation in this field, which MEPs see as "necessary [...] to help the EU meet its target of reducing emissions by at least 20% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels", the committee proposes that binding annual emissions targets be set with effect from 1 January 2009.
He said: " The European Parliament has to choose whether to make the gesture of sending a strong but unrealistic message to the Council or whether to make proposals which can command broad support and are likely to reflect the final outcome of negotiations.
The CO2 reduction targets set for car manufacturers should be achievable at modest cost that must be backed up by a regime of tough financial penalties that can be applied against any companies that fail to comply".
70g CO2/km or less by 2025?
Aligning themselves with the Commission, MEPs in the committee stress the need to ensure that average emissions from all passenger cars placed on the EU market from 1 January 2012 do not exceed 120g CO2/km. As of 2020, average emissions should not exceed 95g CO2/km. Long-term targets should be determined by no later than 2016, and "will possibly require further emissions reductions to 70g CO2/km or less by 2025".
Special cases
Recognising that some specialist manufacturers may have difficulty in reducing average emissions across the limited range of cars they produce, members stress the importance of allowing particular vehicles to exceed emission limits to avoid excessive disruptions to the car market. To that end, they also propose that each manufacturer should have the right "to exclude 500 identified vehicles annually from inclusion in the data used to determine average emissions".
Carbon credits
Finally, the report proposes a "Carbon Allowance Reductions System (CARS)", to be introduced in 2011, under which carmakers would have to pay penalties for exceeding the emission limits. Such penalties "may be offset by redeemable credits awarded to newly-registered passenger cars" (from the same manufacturer), with emissions below the limit values. Information on vehicle emission performance should be made available to the public.

Praise for Turkey's renewed commitment to reform, but concerns remain
2007-10-18 - 09:25
The Foreign Affairs Committee welcomes the recent elections in Turkey, especially the new government's renewed commitment to reforms. In a resolution being proposed, two years after the accession negotiations with Turkey began, the committee also indicates areas in which further progress was still necessary, especially concerning the content of upcoming constitutional reforms. The resolution on EU-Turkey relations, drafted by Ria Oomen-Ruijten (EPP-ED, NL) and adopted without opposition, congratulates Turkey on its recent legislative elections, and "welcome[s] the election of the new President as a sign of strength of the Turkish democracy." It also welcomes "the commitment of the new government to enhance the reform process in the coming months and years," as well as "the intention of the new Turkish government to adopt a new and civilian constitution which would protect fundamental human rights and freedoms."
Turkish-Armenian reconciliation
The committee attaches great importance to Turkey's commitment to good neighbourly relations. The committee reiterates its call upon Turkey to engage in serious and intensive efforts for the resolution of outstanding disputes with all its neighbours, in accordance with the UN Charter and other relevant international conventions, and including a frank and open discussion on past events.
The committee also reiterates its call upon the Turkish and Armenian Governments to start a process of reconciliation for the present and the past, and calls on the Commission to facilitate the Turkish-Armenian reconciliation while taking advantage of regional cooperation realised within the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Black Sea Synergy Policy.
Members support the opening of negotiations on the energy chapter, and encourage Turkey to join the European Energy Community, given the country's importance as a transit hub for gas supplies.
Political reforms
The report strongly condemns the murders of Hrant Dink and Andrea Santoro, and "underlines the urgent need to efficiently combat all types of extremism and violence." The Committee stresses that "further efforts are needed to ensure full and effective civilian control over the military," and calls for parliamentary supervision of the secret services, gendarmerie, and police forces, as well. The report "deplores that a number of persons is still being prosecuted under Article 301 of the penal code" and regards the freedom of expression and the freedom of the press as "a number one priority of the government."
The report urges the Turkish government "to implement the provisions stemming from the Association Agreement and its Additional Protocol," noting specifically in relation to the Cyprus question that "the withdrawal of Turkish forces would facilitate the negotiation of a settlement." While strongly condemning the violence perpetrated by the PKK, the report "urges the new government to launch a political initiative favouring a lasting settlement of the Kurdish issue," and points out the need for a "comprehensive strategy for the social-economic development of the South East of Turkey." MEPs in the committee also underline the need to "pursue the fight against terrorism proportionate to the threat, and with full commitment towards international legal instruments," and call on Turkey to refrain from violating Iraq's territory.
Commission
The text asks the Commission to provide "targeted support to civil society," with particular attention to the South East of the country. MEPs in the committee also ask the Commission to report specifically on the implementation and effectiveness of the financial support instrument to the Turkish Cypriot community. Finally, the report calls for the Commission to publish the results of its monitoring of political criteria in its forthcoming progress report, including the following aspects: judiciary reforms, combating corruption, respect for fundamental rights and freedoms, implementation of the zero-tolerance-to-torture policy, and the protection of women and minority, religious, and cultural rights.
The Commission and the Council will make a statement on EU-Turkey relations to Parliament's plenary in Strasbourg on Wednesday, 24 October, to be followed by a debate with MEPs. The resolution from the Foreign Affairs Committee will be put to the vote during the same session, in advance of the Commission's annual progress report on Turkey's accession, which is due to be published on 7 November.

The Budgets Committee will put forward a report on its first-reading of the 2008 draft budget. MEPs in the committee wish to reduce the amount allocated in the budget to the Common Foreign and Security Policy and to use the flexibility instrument to fund the EU's external policy. Funding for Galileo and the European Institute of Technology is sharply increased. If the plenary approves these proposals, some hard bargaining with the Council is in store. In general the Budgets Committee proposes restoring the level of expenditure entered in the preliminary draft budget and making full use of the margins envisaged under the Interinstitutional Agreement for 2007-2013. MEPs in the committee want the overall amount of payment appropriations to be higher than in the Commission's preliminary draft budget (0.97%) and the Council's draft budget, while not exceeding 0.99% of the EU's gross national income. The most significant increases would be for Galileo and aid for Palestine and Kosovo.
Galileo: clash looming
The committee wants to increase the commitments proposed by the Council for Galileo (the European satellite navigation system), by €739m, to reach a total in 2008 of €890m (€400m in payments). MEPs in the committee believe this figure is needed to complete the project on schedule. The committee wants Galileo to be funded wholly by the Community. The project could fail for good unless sufficient funding is provided.
The funding level proposed by the Council in its first reading (€151m in commitments), is regarded as utterly inadequate by both MEPs and the Commission (which in September put forward a new funding plan). However, since an agreement is needed with the Council, a tough battle lies ahead: a consensus will have to be reached between the institutions if the expenditure ceiling laid down in the 2007-2013 financial perspective is to be exceeded.
EIT to follow model of EU agencies
The same applies to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT): the Budgets Committee proposes a figure of €2.9m (in commitments and payments), for the funding of the EIT board and the creation of a new budget line for Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs). Like the EU agencies, the EIT's administrative budget would be separate from its operational budget. The EIT's operational budget would be transferred from the "education and culture" heading to "research and innovation".
To fund the EIT and Galileo, MEPs in the committee are calling for a review of the multiannual financial framework. However, in case no deal can be reached with Council on this point, MEPs in the committee propose an amendment transferring this amount to the 7th research framework programme, so that the amount earmarked for funding Galileo does not disappear from the budget.
External relations: the EU on the world stage
Parliament has said many times that the funding available for the EU's action outside its borders for the period 2007-2013 is inadequate. The Budgets Committee is proposing to reduce by 20% the funds allocated to the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) in the budget and to use the €40 million thereby released to finance other objectives in Category 4 ("The EU as a global partner"), which the committee sees as seriously underfunded.
To fund aid to Kosovo and Palestine, MEPs suggest drawing on €87m via the flexibility instrument. Of this figure, €40m would be added to funds already envisaged for the missions to Kosovo and Palestine (to be divided equally between these two objectives).
The flexibility instrument could also be used to fund unforeseen expenditure on the CFSP. Ultimately, the CFSP would still be allocated €200m, as originally planned, since the CFSP's €40m, which could be found via the flexibility instrument, is exactly the same as the cut of 20% proposed by MEPs in the committee. A discussion on the level of funding of Category 4 and other policies would seem to be needed between Parliament and Council, inter alia on these CFSP-related matters.
Agencies: a boost for Frontex
The Budgets Committee does not support the expenditure cuts on the agencies desired by the Council. MEPs believe the agencies have fully justified their budget needs, as demanded by the EP.
The one exception is Frontex, the agency for the EU's external frontiers, whose budget has virtually doubled, with €30m extra for operational costs. The figure earmarked for this agency thus rises to €70m in total. This decision is in line with Parliament's political priorities in the area of "freedom, security and justice" but MEPs in the committee remain critical of the results achieved by Frontex and the committee is therefore calling for 30% of its administrative costs to be placed in reserve. This funding would only be released if the head of the agency can provide Parliament with an explanation of the agency's known failures and above all a plan to improve its operational effectiveness.
Lastly, MEPs in the committee reverse the latest round of cuts made by the Council to the "Lisbon" headings (competitiveness, growth, employment - heading 1a), and in most cases restored the funding for cohesion (heading 1b) proposed by the Commission in its preliminary draft budget.
Parliament's budget for 2008
2008 budget - other sections - European Parliament
In a report by Ville ITÄLÄ (EPP-ED, FI) on the EU 2008 budget (other sections), the Budgets Committee underlines that this is the last full year of this legislature and the last year before the entrance into force of the new Members’ Statute. The committee considers that this should be taken into account in view of the forthcoming financing requirements.
Environmental concerns
The Budgets Committee regrets that, more than five years after the start of the EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme) process in the budget procedure, EMAS registration is still pending and the impact on the environment as well as the savings and the investments in relation to its implementation are still not known.
Regarding the Parliaments three places of work (Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg), the Budget Committee was the administration to encourage the staff, while travelling between the three places of work, to use the most environmentally friendly means.
The report considers that the Presidencies of the Parliament and the Council should take into account EU citizens' opinion as regards the geographical dispersion of the Parliament amongst the three places of work and the related costs and environmental consequences.
The committee invites the two Presidencies to negotiate while retaining the important symbolic value of Strasbourg, to bring up a proposal to hold plenary sittings there twice a year in order to respond to citizens' concerns in terms of savings and environment.
Parliament's first reading of the 2008 budget will take place on 23 October with the vote on 25 October. Negotiations with Council are expected to begin on 23 November.

Mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund: redundancies in the car production sector in France
2007-10-18 - 09:25
Parliament will vote on a report from Reimer BÖGE (EPP-ED, DE) approving the use of the Mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for redundancies in the car production sector in France. In March 2007, France requested assistance in respect of two cases concerning redundancies in the automobile sector, specifically suppliers to Peugeot-Citroen and Renault. The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is intended to provide additional support for workers who suffer from the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns, to assist them with their reintegration into the labour market.
On 12 July, the Commission adopted its proposal for a decision on the mobilisation of the Fund for a total amount of €3 816 280, to be allocated under heading 1a of the financial framework 2007-2013. Parliament's vote will approve the release of this funding for France.

How can tax systems help improve economic performance?
2007-10-18 - 09:25
MEPs are to debate a report on how taxation and customs policies can support the aim of making the European economy more competitive. Among other things, the report supports fiscal incentives for investment in R&amp;D and environmental projects, healthy tax competition, lower rates of VAT for labour intensive services and a common consolidated corporate tax base. The report, from the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, sets out ideas on the contribution of taxation policy to the Lisbon Strategy, the EU’s plan for improving competitiveness, boosting growth and creating more jobs.
MEPs in the committee argue that fiscal incentives to businesses are “the main instrument for developing and increasing the number of jobs, but also for increasing R&D investment and environmentally friendly technologies.” They point out that “the overall taxation level in Europe remains higher in comparison to that of the other OECD countries,” and argue for corporate tax arrangements which are favourable to companies, particularly small businesses.
While warning that a lack of coordination between tax systems may lead to abuses and an erosion of revenue, they also support “healthy tax competition” and say competitive tax levels need not undermine government finances. MEPs in the committee say “a radical change is needed in the way that fiscal services operate” if they are to be effective in combating tax fraud.
The committee calls for greater fairness in the distribution of the tax burden and criticises the upward trend of VAT rates. It also supports the idea of giving Member States flexibility to lower VAT on labour intensive services provided at a local level, which would not distort cross-border competition. The report also calls for a further reduction in taxes on employment to help meet the Lisbon goal of a 70 per cent employment rate. On excise duties, MEPs in the committee argue for a new approach, replacing minimum rates with a generic code of conduct to encourage convergence of rates.
The report reiterates Parliament’s support for a common consolidated corporate tax base, which would not affect Member States’ right to set whatever rate of corporation tax they wished. They welcome the Commission’s intention to launch this under the “enhanced cooperation” system (whereby a group of Member States can proceed with a project which not all 27 wish to join) even if this is a second best option.
This own initiative report was drawn up by Sahra Wagenknecht (GUE/NGL, DE), but was modified so thoroughly during the vote in committee that she voted against the final version. The report was adopted with 25 votes in favour, 8 against and 7 abstentions in the Economics Committee – amendments are likely to be tabled at the plenary session to many of its key points.

Business registers for statistical purposes
2007-10-18 - 09:25
MEPs will vote at second reading on a proposal to update the regulation on statistics on the characteristics of businesses operating in the EU - their number, size, structure and so on. The only remaining point at issue with the Council has now been resolved, so the draft regulation should become law at this stage of the procedure. The update was needed to take account of changes in the business world in the light of ongoing globalisation and the further development of the internal market. At the first reading stage in June 2006, Parliament adopted a number of amendments, mostly aimed at reducing the administrative burden on businesses from the collection of data for statistics. All of these were accepted by the Council, but the reform of provisions to do with the Commission’s implementing powers under EU legislation (so-called “comitology”) led to a disagreement about the breadth of these powers in this case. In this second reading report, the rapporteur, Hans-Peter MARTIN (NI, AT) and the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee are proposing to remove the “purpose” and “scope” of the transmission of data from the area covered by the implementing powers since these are better left for primary legislation.
The Council has indicated it can accept this change, so the legislation should enter force shortly after Parliament adopts it.

Two new bodies aiming for better quality EU statistics
2007-10-18 - 09:25
Parliament will debate and vote on the creation of two bodies aimed at improving and monitoring the European statistical system. Following a first reading compromise with the Council, legislation setting up the European Statistical Governance Advisory Board and the European Advisory Committee on Community Statistical Information Policy is likely to be adopted at this, first reading, stage. The first of these bodies, the European Statistical Governance Advisory Board, is intended to give independent oversight to the implementation of the European Statistics Code of Practice and thereby enhance the independent, integrity and accountability of Eurostat, the Commission’s statistical arm, and the European Statistical System more generally.
The second body, the European Advisory Committee on Community Statistical Information Policy, will replace an existing committee which has a narrower remit. Its aim is to act as a channel for advice from users, respondents and producers of statistical information on the objectives of the Community’s statistical information policy. To this end, it will be consulted by the Commission during the drawing up of the Community statistical programme. It can also provide other suggestions on statistical policy to the Commission, and give opinions to other EU institutions.
In reports adopted by the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee in September, MEPs put forward a series of amendments to enhance the independence and effectiveness of these two bodies. In informal discussions between the rapporteurs Sharon Bowles (ALDE, UK) for the Board and Ieke van den Burg (PES, NL) for the Committee, the Commission and the Council Presidency, compromise texts were agreed which took on board the substance of many of MEPs’ amendments. This should enable the two pieces of legislation to be adopted at this first reading stage by both Parliament and Council.

International Financial Reporting Standard 8
2007-10-18 - 09:25
MEPs are to set out their views on the proposed adoption of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 8, following the publication by the Commission of a new analysis of the impact of this new accounting standard. Once endorsed by the EU, these standards apply to listed companies. The European Commission is proposing that IFRS 8, drawn up by the International Accounting Standards Board, be approved as a replacement for the existing international accounting standard (IAS14) relating to the way in which companies present information on the performance of different segments of their business.
In April 2007, the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee proposed a draft resolution to Parliament expressing concern at the proposed approval of IFRS 8, on the grounds that it offered too much flexibility to company managements in how they present the information, thereby making comparison between companies more difficult. There was also concern that, by endorsing IFRS 8, the EU would be importing a standard directly from the United States model without having conducted an adequate impact assessment. Since the Commission agreed to undertake an impact assessment, Parliament postponed the plenary vote on this resolution.
The Commission has recently produced its analysis of the impact of introducing IFRS 8, which it continues to support. This was presented to the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee by Internal Market Commissioner Charlie McCreevy on 11 September 2007. The Economics Committee will meet on Monday evening in Strasbourg to vote on a new resolution on the issue in the light of the analysis presented by the Commission. Once adopted in committee, this resolution will be put to a vote in plenary on Tuesday.
The endorsement of accounting standards is delegated to the Commission under legislation adopted by the Council and Parliament in 2002, but the EP still has the right to scrutinise proposals before the Commission acts. While Parliament’s position in such cases is not formally binding, when it comes to financial services legislation, the Commission has undertaken to take the fullest possible account of Parliament’s views.

Call to produce legal analgesics instead of illicit opium in Afghanistan
2007-10-18 - 09:25
The EP Foreign Affairs Committee is urging the Council to put forward a plan to the Afghan government which would include the possibility of a pilot project to turn part of the illicit poppy crop into legal opium-based analgesics. In an own-initiative report drafted by Marco CAPPATO (ALDE, IT), and adopted on 12 September by 33 votes in favour to 8 against with 23 abstentions, the committee notes that "insurgents, warlords, the Taliban and terrorist groups are obtaining their major source of funding through trade in illicit narcotics", thereby jeopardising the political stability and economic development of Afghanistan.
Almost 40% of Afghanistan's GDP is opium-related and, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Afghanistan produces 93% of the opiates on the world market.
Fight against corruption
MEPs in the committee want the Council to look at "the possibility of pilot projects for small-scale conversion of parts of the current illicit poppy cultivation into fields for the production of legal opium-based analgesics".
The report also urges the Council to devise and submit to the Afghan government a "comprehensive plan and strategy aimed at controlling drug production in Afghanistan", by "tackling corruption at the highest levels of the Afghan administration", especially the Ministry of the Interior.
Eradication
Lastly, the report calls for measures to improve rural development in the poorest areas of the country, especially in those not yet producing opium on a large scale, by "carefully and selectively engaging in manual eradication".
The European Union is the biggest donor as regards efforts aimed at reducing the opium supply through projects to promote alternative livelihoods for Afghan farmers.
ALDE group position - allow the production of poppies for medical purposes
In a separate minority position, the ALDE group urges the Council to adopt a common position - concerning a comprehensive 'counter-narcotics' strategy in Afghanistan, which should provide for the production of poppies for medical purposes to be used, in the framework of an internationally managed pilot project, for the production of opium-based analgesics for the national Afghan market and possibly for those countries that experience a lack of availability of opiates.

EU-Russia Summit - Mafra (Portugal) - 26 October
2007-10-18 - 09:25
The House will debate the forthcoming EU-Russia summit to be held in Mafra (Portugal) on Friday 26 October 2007. President Putin recently announced that he would take part in Russia's legislative elections. The twice-yearly summits are hosted by Russia and by the country holding the rotating presidency of the European Union, which Portugal took over from Germany this month.
At the last EU-Russia summit in May in the Samara region of western Russia, the two sides disagreed over a number of issues, including democratic freedoms in Russia and economic ties.
Key EU-Russia partnership talks are governed by an agreement that runs out this year. While it can be renewed, Poland says it will veto the move until Moscow lifts an embargo on meat imports from Poland. Council and Commission statements - EU-Russia Summit

EU-Serbia relations - improvement but four fugitives still at large
2007-10-18 - 09:25
Jelko KACIN (ALDE, SI) for the Foreign Affairs Committee will be tabling an own-initiative report on the relations between the EU and Serbia. The committee believes that Serbia deserves special commendation for the peaceful resolution of a series of difficult challenges over the past year, including the dissolution of the State Union of Serbia Montenegro, fair and free parliamentary elections and the formation of a new government with a pro-European engagement. Kosovo
The report takes the view that a resolution to the status of Kosovo will both consolidate stability in the Western Balkans and facilitate the integration of the region into the European Union.
The committee strongly believes that a key human rights issue is to find durable solutions for refugees and internally displaced people (IDPs), especially since Serbia is still hosting a very high number of refugees, mostly from Croatia and partly from Bosnia-Herzegovina, and IDPs from Kosovo.
Truth and reconciliation
The committee believes that the citizens of Serbia are entitled to be told the truth about the recent policies of war and genocide committed in their name, and to have knowledge of the perpetrators of war crimes; believes that Serbia must honestly confront its recent past in order to progress and that coming to terms with the past is an integral part of the road to reconciliation with Serbia's neighbours; calls on the government to re-open the Truth and Reconciliation Commission established in 2001, not least in order to secure an end to the climate of fear that persists in some parts of the country.

The report welcomes the resumption of negotiations on an SAA (Stabilisation and Association Agreement) between the Serbian Government and the EU after a 13-month break. MEPs in the committee encourage both parties to move forward quickly with the negotiations and to make all the necessary arrangements in order to avoid technical delays in the interim period between the initialling and the signature of the Agreement, so that the signature can take place before the end of 2007.
Two of the six fugitive war crimes indictees wanted by the ICTY have recently been arrested and transferred to The Hague and four remain at large, including Ratko Mladić and Radovan Karadžić.
The committee also welcomes the Serbian Government's desire to cooperate with the ICTY, which opens the way to further cooperation with the EU. The committee believes, given the timetable for closure of the ICTY, which currently envisages the conclusion of trials by 2008, that it would be necessary to consider extending the mandate of the ICTY were indicted war criminals to be arrested after that date.

TRIPS accord: EP assent to be voted in committee
2007-10-18 - 09:25
The International Trade Committee will vote on Monday 22 October on granting Parliament's assent to amendment to the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). If the committee takes its vote, Parliament will debate and vote in plenary on the report by Gianluca SUSTA (ALDE, IT). Previously, MEPs were awaiting Council undertakings on when developing countries may use the flexibility provided for under the TRIPS agreement to produce or import generic substitutes for patented medicines.
The International Trade Committee postponed this vote to 22 October in Strasbourg, because the EU's Portuguese presidency still had not replied to the requests set out in a resolution voted in plenary session on 12 July 2007 in Strasbourg. Parliament, Council and Commission representatives are meeting informally on 17 October to try to respond to MEPs' requests.
Parliament's conditions
In its 12 July 2007 resolution, the EP called on the Council to state, in a joint political declaration, that the Member States are free to use the exception provision of the TRIPS Agreement to authorise production and export "to address public health needs in importing Members".
For MEPs, the mechanism created by the Doha declaration and set in place in 2003 is only a "part of the solution to the problem". So far only Rwanda has stated (on 19 July) its intention to using compulsory licensing as an importer. Canada was the first country to notify the World Trade Organization (WTO), on 4 october 2007, that it had authorized a company to manufacture a generic version of a patented medicine for export: TriAvir, a combination of three AIDS drugs, will be exported to Rwanda.
Economic partnership agreements
Parliament also urged the Council to restrict the Commission's negotiating mandate to ensure that it does not negotiate pharmaceutical-related "TRIPS-plus" provisions affecting public health and access to medicines in Economic Partnership Agreements with the African, Caribbean and Pacific states and other future and regional agreements with developing countries.
Doha declaration
This mechanism was set in train by the Doha declaration adopted at the WTO ministerial conference in November 2001. It was then confirmed by a decision of the WTO General Council on 30 August 2003, which authorised countries that lack the capacity to manufacture generic substitutes for patented medicines under locally-granted compulsory licences, to obtain imports of these medicines.
Ratification
As soon as two thirds of WTO members (100 of its 151 member states) have formally accepted the amendment, it will apply to those members that have accepted it and replace the 2003 derogation. As of 28 September 2007, eleven countries had accepted the amendment: Australia, the USA, India, Israel, Japan, Norway, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, Salvador, Singapore and Switzerland.

Consumers
Price rises: Foodstuffs, Consumer protection and Significant increases in food prices and consumer protection
2007-10-18 - 09:25
As part of a joint debate on prices, MEPs will ask a series of questions to the Council and Commission on Foodstuffs, Consumer protection and Significant increases in food prices and consumer protection. The House will also vote on a resolution on this topic. Joseph DAUL (EPP-ED, FR), Lutz GOEPEL (EPP-ED, DE)and Neil PARISH (EPP-ED UK), on behalf of the EPP-ED Group will be asking the following question to the Commission on the rise in foodstuff prices:
Strongly rising world demand, the increase in food-related needs, especially in the emerging countries, the strong demand for source products for animal feedingstuffs, the rising influence of non-food uses of agricultural products, with biofuels taking pride of place, the worldwide decline in stocks, rising oil prices, speculation by some investors and the impact of climatic events in reducing harvests have all helped boost the phenomenon of the rise in the price of agricultural raw materials at the production stage.
These farm produce price rises are having an impact on food products. The first to be affected by these increases are stockbreeders, who are major users of cereals. The second victims are of course consumers, whose purchasing power is thus reduced.
The cereal price rise is likely to be limited as a result of the EU Council of Agricultural Ministers’ decision of 26 September, approved by Parliament, to provisionally lift the set-aside requirements for the 2008 marketing year, and by the Commission proposal to suspend import duties on cereals.
However, the rise in the price and milk and raw materials for animal feedingstuffs calls for further measures.
Is the Commission planning further measures to anticipate and counteract the rising trend in basic commodities and prevent these rises from having an impact on their consumers?
Luis Manuel CAPOULAS SANTOS (PES, PT), on behalf of the PES Group will be asking the following questions to the Commission on consumer protection and rise in prices:
The recent cases of increases in consumer prices linked to the rise in the cost of primary agricultural products have obliged the Commission to take certain measures such as lifting set-aside for cereals, and to start thinking about urgent solutions for other sectors such as the dairy sector, which has been affected by the rise in prices for commodities destined for animal feed.
As well as affecting European production sectors, this situation is also having a strong direct impact on European consumers and family economies.
Even though the European Parliament welcomes measures such as the lifting of set-aside and the Commission's announcement at the Strasbourg part-session that it will be extending this measure by a further marketing year if necessary, it also expresses its concern at the current price rises, a situation which demands fresh urgent measures and merits more thorough consideration on the part of the European institutions, and not only in the context of the 'health check'.
Can the Commission specify what steps it will take with the sectors affected in order to deal with the above situation?
Does the Commission envisage specific measures with regard to consumer protection and safeguarding family economies?
Does the Commission not believe that the various price rises merit more wide-ranging consideration, going beyond the introduction of specific measures for each situation (cereals, milk, etc.)? Debate: 23.10.2007

Energy
EU will need conventional energy sources for sometime yet, says Industry Committee
2007-10-18 - 09:25
On current trends, the EU will rely on imports to meet 65% of its energy needs by 2030. Yet gas and oil supplies are dogged by uncertainty due to geopolitical risks and growing demand elsewhere. The need to produce and use energy more safely, efficiently and sustainably across the Union is underlined in an own-initiative report on "conventional energy sources" proposed by the EP Industry Committee. Nuclear energy "indispensable" for some time to come
Acknowledging that nuclear energy is a key component of power supply in most EU Member States, providing one-third of the EU’s electricity supply, MEPs in the committee say that nuclear energy is "indispensable if basic energy needs are to be met in Europe in the medium term." Given that "nuclear energy is currently the largest low-CO2 energy source in Europe", they added, "the renunciation of nuclear power will make it impossible to achieve the objectives set regarding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and the combating of climate change".
The report also notes that Finland, France, Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, Lithuania (with the collaboration of Latvia and Estonia), the United Kingdom , Poland and the Czech Republic are building new nuclear power plants, or are planning to build them or are investigating such a possibility.
Welcoming the Commission’s communications on sustainable power production from fossil fuels, MEPs in the committee underline that these and other conventional sources will remain highly important in ensuring the EU’s security of energy supply. Given the EU's commitment to tackling climate change, however, MEPs in the committee stress that the Union and its Member States should redouble their R&D efforts "with a view to enhancing the efficiency of energy production and supply, reducing environmental impact, improving the safety of existing technologies [and] developing storage techniques for renewables."
Carbon capture
MEPs in the committee call on the Commission quickly to table legislative proposals on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology "so as to respond to the legal issues surrounding the storage and transportation of CO2." They underline "that CCS should be fitted to fossil fuel plants at the earliest practical opportunity". The committee nonetheless acknowledged that CCS technology is linked to losses of efficiency in power stations and called for research to address the issue.
Members also stress the significant potential of energy generation from biomass, the need for the EU to support synthetic fuels technology and, with a view to the diversification of gas imports, the importance of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Education
Job qualifications should be comparable EU wide by 2012
2007-10-18 - 09:25
Job qualifications earned in any EU Member State should be comparable throughout the EU by 2012, but Member States should be given a year longer than planned to implement the proposed European Qualification Framework (EQF) and it should be accompanied by a system of vocational training credits, says the Employment Committee. The EQF aims to ease cross-border mobility for workers and learners, and help meet labour market needs, by using a common language to describe qualifications. Under the EQF proposal, all qualifications, from school-leavers' diplomas through vocational training certificates to the highest academic degrees are to be assigned to one of eight reference levels, based on knowledge, skills and competence acquired.
A year more to build mutual trust
The Committee says that Member States should be given until 2010 - a year longer than the Commission proposed - to relate their national qualifications systems to the EQF and to build the "mutual trust" needed to implement the proposal (which, as a European Parliament and Council recommendation, would not be binding upon Member States).
EU-compatible by 2010
By 2012, all new qualification certificates, diplomas and "Europass" attestation documents issued by the competent authorities "should contain a clear reference to an EQF's reference level, says the report, by Mario MANTOVANI (EPP-ED, IT).

EU strategy for Africa: Development Committee calls for stronger parliamentary dimension
2007-10-18 - 09:25
The EU Strategy for Africa needs a stronger parliamentary dimension, says an own-initiative report, proposed by the EP Development Committee, that sets out priorities for the EU-Africa Strategy to be adopted at the second EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon in December. MEPs will meet African MPs in Lisbon prior to the Summit. "The 2005 EU Strategy for Africa was adopted without in-depth consultation with the African Union (AU) institutions and African governments and parliaments", notes the committee, which wants to see co-operation between the EP, the Pan-African Parliament (PAP) and the African regional parliaments encouraged.
The committee report, drafted by Maria MARTENS (EPP-ED, NL), was adopted unanimously.
Lisbon parliamentary meeting
A 25-strong delegation of MEPs, most of whom are Development Committee members, will meet 25 members of the Pan-African Parliament in Lisbon on 7 December, where a joint declaration by both Parliaments is likely to be adopted. EP President Hans-Gert PÖTTERING and PAP President Gertrude MONGELLA will be invited to address the Heads of States and Governments meeting on 8 December.
Arms control
The report says that existing commitments to control the arms trade should be implemented in full and that the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports should be upgraded to a legally-binding Common Foreign and Security Policy Common Position. The EU should also accelerate the implementation of the EU Strategy to Combat the Illicit Accumulation and Trafficking of small arms and light weapons (SALW), it adds.
Migration and brain drain
The joint strategy should address the root causes of migration and to pay particular attention to the rights and the integration of migrants and to the issue of the "brain drain", particularly in the health sector, by proposing practical solutions for successful "circular" migration, says the report.
Crimes against humanity and impunity
Provisions to address impunity should be included in the joint strategy, says the committee, which calls for Africa’s legal and judicial systems to be strengthened, in accordance with human rights, to enable them to try perpetrators of serious crimes against humanity in Africa itself.
EPAs
MEPs in the committee acknowledge that the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) can "become an important tool for African trade and regional integration, but only on condition that their substance fully accords with development policy objectives", by providing exemptions and long transition periods where necessary to enable domestic producers and industries to adapt to new market situations and to allow regional integration to proceed at its own pace.

International treaty to ban cluster munitions
2007-10-18 - 09:25
Since the adoption of the Oslo Declaration on 23 February 2007 calling for an international treaty to globally ban cluster munitions and the follow-up Lima conference on cluster munitions which took place on 24-25 May 2007, around 80 states have decided to support the process leading to such a Treaty, including almost all EU Member States. Belgium will host a high level regional meeting on this issue at the end of October 2007. In December there will be a third global conference in Vienna, following up the Oslo and Lima meetings.
Josep BORRELL (PES, ES), on behalf of the Committee on Development, will be putting the following questions to the Commission.
1. Which initiatives has the Commission taken to follow up Parliament's previous resolutions supporting the Oslo process, in particular the resolution on the Convention on the Prohibition of Biological and Toxin Weapons (BTWC), cluster bombs and conventional arms of 16 November 2006, asking the EU to support the initiative "to establish a comprehensive and effective convention to ban cluster munitions worldwide"?
2. Which initiatives has the Commission taken to encourage EU Member States to adopt national measures banning cluster bombs, and at international level to encourage all states which have not yet done so to sign the Oslo Declaration? Which initiatives is the Commission taking to support the implementation of existing commitments within the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) and specifically the Protocol V on Explosive Remnants of War?
4. Which programmes and projects does the Commission support or plan to support in third countries as regards the assistance to communities and individuals affected by unexploded cluster munitions, the clearance of contaminated areas, risk education and destruction of stockpiles of prohibited cluster munitions?
5. Will the Commission consider holding an international conference on the role of the EU in tackling post-conflict socio-economic, humanitarian and developmental consequences of explosive remnants of war in the context of recent international initiatives? Oral question to the Commission:

Petitions
European Ombudsman annual report for 2006
2007-10-18 - 09:25
MEPs will debate a report on the activities of the European Ombudsman in 2006 - Mr Nikoforos Diamandouros. The report says that the Ombudsman has continued to exercise his powers in a balanced and energetic way both with regard to examining and handling complaints, and conducting and concluding enquiries, and with regard to maintaining constructive relations with the European Union's institutions and encouraging citizens to avail themselves of their rights in relation to those institutions. Slothful, negligent or lacking in transparency
The committee agrees that the term 'maladministration by the Community' should be broadly interpreted so as to include not only unlawful administrative acts or infringements of binding legal rules or principles, but also, for example, cases where the administrative authorities have been slothful, negligent or lacking in transparency or have infringed other principles of good administration.
European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO)
The report calls on the European Personnel Selection Office to ensure it complies effectively and fully with the rules and established practice as regards the openness and transparency of competition procedures, particularly with regard to candidates' access to information relating to them about the marking of papers, to put an end to linguistic discrimination and to refrain from evading its own responsibilities by reference to decisions made by selection boards.
Examination of the statistics
The figures for 2006 record that the Ombudsman received 3830 complaints, 2% fewer than in 2005, but at the same record level attained in 2004, which represented a 53% increase compared to previous years. A complaint was transmitted electronically in 57% of cases, most of which, i.e. 3619 cases, were sent by individual citizens, and only 211 of which were submitted by associations or firms. The nationality of the authors, in descending order was: Spanish (20.4%), German (14%), French (8.7%), Belgian (6.3%), Polish (6%), Italian (5.4%) and British (3.8%). This ranking changes, however, if the percentage of complaints submitted by a country is divided by the percentage of the EU population it represents. On this calculation, in only 22 countries is the quotient greater than one; a ratio greater than one indicates that the country in questions submits more complaints to the Ombudsman than might be expected given the size of its population, as in the case of Luxembourg (with a quotient of 14.2), Malta (10), Cyprus (7.6), Belgium (2.8), Slovenia (2.7) and Spain (2.2). Turning to the question of language distribution of complaints, English and Spanish each account for over 20% of complaints, German and French each account for over 10% and Polish for over 5%.
In the 95% of cases where the examination of admissibility was completed, once again the majority did not fall within the mandate of the European Ombudsman (78.5%), either because the complaints were not made against a Community institution or body (93.7%) or because they did not involve maladministration (5.4%). Of the 21.5% of cases which did fall within the Ombudsman's remit, 449 of the 838 complaints were formally declared admissible, of which 258 led to an inquiry. In 2006, the Ombudsman carried out 582 enquiries in total; of which 315 were already underway in 2005 and 9 were launched on the Ombudsman's own initiative.
As in previous years, the institutional body which was the subject of most enquiries was the Commission, which accounted for 66% of enquiries (387); the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO) accounted for 13% (74) the European Parliament for 8% (49) and the Council of the European Union for 2% (11). The predominant type of maladministration alleged was lack of transparency, including refusal of information (25%) followed by unfairness or abuse of power (19%) and a variety of other types of maladministration, culminating in the least-frequently alleged categories of legal error (5%) and failure to ensure fulfilment of Treaty obligations by the Commission (4%).

Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and Madagascar
2007-10-18 - 09:25
The Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the EC and Madagascar is a tuna agreement which allocates fishing opportunities according to three categories of vessels from Spain, France, Italy, Portugal and the United Kingdom. It also introduces the possibility for an additional five vessels to carry out exploratory fishing for demersal species. The Fisheries Committee are recommending that Parliament approve the proposal on the conclusion of the agreement with some amendments. According to the rapporteur, Margie SUDRE (EPP-ED, FR), this new agreement is "highly satisfactory, for both the European Community and the Republic of Madagascar", since "it provides fishery resources for community vessels whilst enabling Madagascar to receive income for stocks which the country would not have the technical capacity to exploit". She has, however, tabled some amendments aimed at improving the information forwarded to the European Parliament. Furthermore, the Commission is asked to submit a report on the application of the agreement to the EP and the Council during the final year of the protocol's validity and before another agreement is concluded on its renewal.
The new Partnership Agreement was signed for a renewable period of six years, from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2012, and it grants the following fishing opportunities:

As financial contribution , The EC is paying Madagascar a sum of €1,197,000 per year for a reference tonnage of 13,300 tonnes per year. This sum will be divided up into € 864,500 per year equivalent to the reference tonnage and €332,500 per year for the support and implementation of Madagascar's sectoral fisheries policy. Payment of the financial contribution is to be made no later than 31 December 2007 for the first year and no later than 28 February 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 for the following years. 80% of the financial contribution and fees paid by shipowners will go towards supporting and implementing initiatives taken within the framework of the sectoral fisheries policy drawn up by Madagascar.
Licences are valid for one year and are renewable. The fee has been set at €35 per tonne caught within Madagascar's fishing zone in the case of tuna seiners and surface longliners, as against €25 previously.
Owners of tuna seiners and surface longliners must employ at least 20% ACP nationals among the seamen signed on. For the first category of vessel, however, a minimum of 70 seamen out of the total European fleet must be from the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) member countries.

Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and Mozambique
2007-10-18 - 09:25
The Fisheries Committee will be recommending the EP approve, with some amendments, a proposal for a regulation on the conclusion of a new Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and Mozambique. The agreement has been signed for a period of five years (renewable) from its entry into force and it grants fishing opportunities to vessels from Spain, France, Italy, Portugal and the United Kingdom. The rapporteur, Emanuel Jardim FERNANDES (PES, PT), has tabled several amendments to improve the information forwarded to the European Parliament. He also calls for the Commission to submit a report on the application of the agreement to the EP and the Council during the final year of the protocol's validity and before another agreement is concluded on its renewal.
As regards the fishing opportunities granted to Community vessels, 44 purse seine vessels and 45 surface longliners are allowed to fish:

Emanuel Jardim FERNANDES considers that Portugal has a number of licences that "falls below its real capacities for exploitation and is disproportionate, in view of the number of licences granted and Portugal's history of fishing in Mozambique". He therefore proposes, in his consultative report, that Portugal is entitled to nine licences, instead of seven.
The protocol fixes a reference tonnage of 10,000 tonnes of tuna per year. It is established that the EC fishing effort in Mozambique's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) will have to be in line with appropriate tuna stock assessments based on scientific criteria, including the scientific overviews conducted by the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC).
The financial contribution is fixed at €900,000 to be paid annually by the Community during the period of application of the protocol. The payment will be made no later than 31 October 2007 for the first year and no later than 15 January 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 for the following years. 100% of the financial contribution will be used to support the implementation of the sectoral fisheries policy drawn up by the Mozambican Government.
Fishing licences are valid for a maximum of one year (renewable), from 1 January to 31 December of each year. The fee has been set at €35 per tonne caught within Mozambique's fishing zone.
Shipowners undertake to employ, for the tuna-fishing season in Mozambique's fishing zone, at least 20% of seamen of ACP origin, of which, if possible, at least 40% Mozambican. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work will apply as of right to seamen signed on by Community vessels.
The new agreement granting fishing opportunities to Community fishermen in the Mozambique fishing zone has been initialled on 21 December 2006. Accompanied by a protocol and an annex, the agreement has been signed for a period of five years (renewable) from its entry into force.

Improving the efficiency of the enforcement of judgments: attachment of bank accounts
2007-10-18 - 09:25
Kurt LECHNER (EPP-ED, DE) for the Legal Affairs Committee will be tabling an own-initiative report on Improving the efficiency of the enforcement of judgments: the attachment of bank accounts. The report welcomes the fact that, by publishing the Green Paper, the Commission has taken an initiative aimed at establishing a cross-border European procedure for temporarily freezing bank deposits. With its Green Paper on "Improving the efficiency of the enforcement of judgments in the European Union: the Attachment of Bank Accounts" of October 2006, the European Commission launched a broad consultation among interested parties on how to improve the enforcement of monetary claims in Europe. Enforcement law has often been termed the “Achilles’ heel” of the European Civil Judicial Area.
While a number of Community instruments provide for the jurisdiction of the courts, the procedure to have judgments recognised and declared enforceable and mechanisms for cooperation of courts in civil procedures, no legislative proposal has yet been made for actual measures of enforcement. To date, execution of a court order after it has been declared enforceable in another Member State remains entirely a matter of national law.
The committee suggests that, when further studies are conducted, statistics should also be compiled with a view to gauging the real extent of those instances in which debtors evade justice and hence to giving a more accurate indication of the expediency of the measures to be proposed.
The committee also believes that a standard European system should exist independently of, and in addition to, the Member States’ respective national enforcement rules.
A possible solution to the problems arising from the current fragmentation of national rules on enforcement would be to create a European procedure for the attachment of bank accounts, which would allow a creditor in certain circumstances to secure the payment of a sum of money due to him by preventing the removal or transfer of funds held to the credit of his debtor in one or several bank accounts within the territory of the European Union. Such an order would have protective effect only, i.e. it would block the debtor’s funds in a bank account without transferring these to a creditor. The procedure would be subject to conditions for granting of the order including an adequate level of debtor protection. An attachment order issued in one Member State would be recognised and enforceable throughout the European Union without the need for a declaration of enforceability. Such a system could be established by designing a new and self-standing European procedure, which would be available in addition to measures existing under national law, or by harmonising Member States' national rules on the attachment of bank accounts by means of a directive, subject to an impact assessment.

Sentencing across the EU
2007-10-18 - 09:25
Maria da Assunção ESTEVES (EPP-ED, PT) for the Civil Liberties Committee will be putting forward a non-binding report on laying down the rules according to which one Member State is to supervise suspended sentences, or alternative sanctions, contained in a judgment given in another Member States. The purpose of the Framework Decision is to facilitate a sentenced person's reintegration into society, to provide better protection for victims and society as a whole and to facilitate the enforcement of appropriate suspended sentences, alternative sanctions and conditional sentences in the case of offenders who are not resident in the State in which they were sentenced.
The committee underlines that the Framework Decision should apply only to the recognition of judgments and the transfer of responsibility for the supervision and execution of suspended sentences, alternative sanctions and conditional sentences, and for all other subsequent decisions provided for in this Framework Decision.
Objectives
As to the objectives, the report says the Framework Decision should seek to facilitate the social re-integration of sentenced persons, to improve the protection of victims and society and to facilitate the application of appropriate suspended sentences, alternative sanctions and conditional sentences in the case of offenders who are not resident in the sentencing State. With a view to achieving these objectives, this Framework Decision should lay down rules pursuant to which the Member State, in which the sentenced person has his lawful and ordinary residence, should recognise the judgments passed in another Member State and should supervise and execute suspended sentences, alternative sanctions and conditional sentences. Rapporteur Maria da Assunção ESTEVES EPP-ED PT A6-0356/2007 Judicial cooperation: recognition and supervision of suspended sentences, alternative sanctions and conditional sentences.

Parliament's Rules of Procedure
Audiovisual record of all debates in plenary
2007-10-18 - 09:25
Richard CORBETT (PES, UK) will be putting forward a report amending Parliament's Rules of Procedure regarding the translation of verbatim reports from plenary. Instead of every speech being translated into 22 other languages, the report says "that a complete audiovisual record of the proceedings of each sitting, including the soundtracks from all interpretation booths, shall be produced and preserved in the records of Parliament. It shall be accessible to the public via the Internet." The translation department estimates that the cost of translating the debates of Parliament could be kept to a figure in the region of €10m per annum. This is not by any means an insubstantial amount, and considerably exceeds even the highest cost estimate of running an EP Web TV channel in 23 languages for a year.
All European Parliament plenary sessions are broadcast live in 23 languages via the European Parliament's website and previous sessions can also be accessed on demand via the link hereunder.
