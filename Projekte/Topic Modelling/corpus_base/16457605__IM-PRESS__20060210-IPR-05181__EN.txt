Parliament adopted a report today suggesting a stronger focus on young farmers, the modernisation of agriculture, and the protection of the rural cultural heritage as key strategic guidelines for rural development. MEPs underlined the importance of "the provision of essential funding to the new Member States in order to reduce the gap between them and the EU 15."
The consultation report by Mairead McGUINNESS (EPP-ED, IE) on strategic guidelines for rural development was adopted by a large majority (455 votes in favour 16 against with 10 abstentions) in Parliament.
Palriament welcomed the Commission proposals but sought to add more references to helping young farmers and the necessity of modernising the agricultural sector. Parliament also called for the " safeguarding of the rural cultural heritage " to counteract rural depopulation. Additional suggestions included the promotion of local and regional products, the " incorporation of women into the labour market ," and " support for investment and training in the field of non-food production ," as well as green tourism.
The House also highlighted " village renewal and development ," for instance by investing in " childcare and old people's centres, subsidised housing and rented accommodation, cultural centres, transport " and other infrastructure projects.
