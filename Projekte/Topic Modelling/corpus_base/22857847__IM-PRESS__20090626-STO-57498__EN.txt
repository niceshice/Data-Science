2009 elections

2009-07-02 - 12:42
European Parliament, Tuesday and Wednesday, 30 June, 1 July. Kristiina Ojuland (Estonian) and Finn Timo Soini arrive for their first day at the office. Time to reflect on what the next 5 years will bring. Checking in and getting essential documents is key - as is finding some of the meeting rooms. Their respective mottos are: Soini: "What doesn't kill you hurts like hell". Ojuland: "Don't fly higher than your wings can carry you". Finding their way around the corridors of Brussels and Strasbourg will be one of their first tasks. An ability to deal confidently with the media and get your point across are keys aspects of being a modern MEP. Two new MEPs hoping to make their mark are Estonia's Kristiina Ojuland and Finland's Timo Soini. They are hoping to use their new position as a platform to raise issues about northern Europe and the countries that surround the Baltic Sea. Ms Ojuland is a former diplomat who wants to be active in foreign affairs whilst Mr Soini wants to use Brussels as a way of becoming an "even better" politician in Finland.
Prior to being elected as a Liberal candidate Kristiina Ojuland was Estonia's foreign Minister (2002-2004). She lists Margaret Thatcher among the people the 43-year old admires.
Timo Soini is leader and co-founder of the "True Finns" party which he formerly represented in the Finnish Parliament. This populist politician will sit with the successor to the Independence and Democracy group in Brussels and Strasbourg. He told us that John the Baptist ("a voice in the wilderness") and Mother Theresa are among his heroes.
We caught up with both of them when they arrived in Brussels to get acquainted with their new surroundings. See what they had to say below. For both the first session of the Parliament will be in Strasbourg from 14-16 July.
Kristiina Ojuland
Timo Soini
Is it your first time in Brussels – or are you already like a fish in water?
Perhaps not so much in Brussels but more in Strasbourg where I have worked since 1992 on and off. I don't know Brussels at all but I learn quickly.
Is becoming a MEP for you a springboard or a culmination of your career?
I guess it is a stage in my life and I have lots of expectations about it. I have been in European politics for many years but I do not have the experience of being an MEP. I hope to profit from this experience.
How do you think the work of an MEP differs from that of an MP?
There is no big difference - you represent certain citizens and political views. I am not going to get lost in the corridors here and retire in 5 years - I want to be active here and in Estonia.
What drove you to enter politics?
I entered politics in 1992 with the first free elections to support the most innovative political party. I entered as a young diplomat because that was what I wanted to be but life made its corrections and I am very happy about it.
In which areas would you like to put most of your efforts?
I hope to become a member of foreign affairs and defence and security committees. I have been involved with those areas before. Also I have been involved with energy politics.
Your favourite qualities in a politician?
You must believe in what you do. There must be some passion and you must work hard.
How would you make a mark here?
There are 736 members and it is difficult to become known. My aim in 5 years is that people know I am representing Estonia.
Which Baltic/Nordic issues are you going to push?
I would like the Baltic Sea Strategy to promote more cooperation in education. Our students could learn in the same educational environment. In the future it could expand into the whole EU.
What picture will you hang first in your new office?
The Reform party group from Riigikogu (Estonian Parliament) gave me a drawing which is picturing the port of Kaberneeme (her home). It is me sailing towards the sea, a cuckoo (her partner's name is Kägu - "cuckoo" in Estonian) waving back and a tree full of squirrels (the mascot of the party).
Who are your heroes?
Margaret Thatcher. Her biggest service to the Great Britain was bringing the country out of a deep economic crisis using liberal economic policies.
Your favourite motto?
My grandmother told me not fly higher than your wings can carry you. I try to keep touch with reality.
Being an MEP requires a lot of travelling. How are you going to share time between Brussels and home?
Difficult to say, I have no idea.
Which languages do you speak?
After Estonian I speak English, Russian and French.
What is your favourite occupation when not working?
I discovered sports quite late but I like jogging in the morning, I play tennis and I relax the best when I am alone - walk at home on the sea or in the forest and spend time with my pets.
First time in Brussels – or are you already like a fish in water?
Maybe for the tenth time, but I don't know the city. I've been to many conference rooms...but I do know Luxembourg square and O'Farrells pub... and the Euroflat Hotel.
Is becoming a MEP for you a springboard or a culmination of your career?
I'm still on my journey, but this is a necessary waypoint to become an even better politician in Finland.
How do you think the work of an MEP differs from that of an MP?
I think the basis doesn't differ that much. Though I assume I will have less and not constant publicity. Work in Committees is probably quite similar. And I will hardly get to talk here as much as in the Finnish parliament. I will be combining the work of a MEP and a party leader, as, unfortunately, 70% of our laws are made here. I don't think that is good, but it is a fact.
What drove you to enter politics? I felt pain for the world's injustice (he laughs).
In which areas would you like to put most of your efforts?
If I get on the Education and Culture Committee, there are things I intend to drive forward. I am going to do something different than in my home country. And the question of independence never expires of course; I see the EU as an intermediary phase.
Your favourite qualities in a politician?
To push for the cause of the people that elected you. To know what you do and to be able to explain, in plain language, to voters and political rivals, what you mean, and what you think. If you succeed in this, you're a good politician.
How would you like to be remembered?
As a good, fair and honest jack.
Are you going to drive some Baltic/Nordic issues?
Absolutely. The Baltic Sea and Kola (peninsula) are important. Northern Dimension is still rather a word. We in the north should be able to pump as much resources in remote and sparsely populated areas as the southerners do. As long as regional and structural policy is a mainly EU policy, we have to work this way (through Brussels), the powers having been handed over.
What picture will you hang first in your new office?
It may be one of a race horse, which I partly own. Or a favourite football team ...or my children or wife (laughs).
Who are your heroes?
Starting from the Bible, John the Baptist was quite a voice in the wilderness, fighting against inequities. Veikko Vennamo (founder of the predecessor to the True Finns party) is one...Us Catholics are very naïve... therefore also Mother Teresa, Pope John Paul II ... and, of course and Status Quo!
Your favourite motto?
What doesn't kill you hurts like hell (laughs).
Being an MEP requires a lot of travelling. How are you going to share time between Brussels and home?
Half and half. When you are here you do things, but life is not just about job. Combining the work of a party leader and MEP is not exactly easy, but one must try. However, this is something new, as I have been party leader for 12 years. Now a little airing is needed!
Which languages do you speak?
Finnish, English and compulsory Swedish (laughs).
What is your favourite occupation when not working, and will you have time for it?
It is horse racing, and I will need to find the time for it. I have a share in a race horse. I play football... And there must be time for the family of course; I am bringing my family here for a week in July.
