Austrian MEP Paul Rübig - roaming negotiator
You go abroad on holiday or business and make a few calls from your mobile phone. These can be charged at as much as €3 a minute and the European Commission and MEPs are determined to get a better deal for consumers. They want to cap calls at 49 cents a minute with incoming calls at 24 cents. A vote today by MEPs and a 7 June vote by EU ministers could mean cheaper calls by summer. Austrian MEP Paul Rübig of the EPP-ED Group helped negotiate the final deal. We spoke to him ahead of the vote.
Mr Rübig, you said that the phone bill should not be higher than the room bill during holidays. With the new EU pricing rules this could become a reality by summer. How was agreement reached in such a short time?
There was a clear message from the Spring Council of heads of state and government, that there should be an agreement before the summer. Commissioner Viviane Reding was strongly behind this move. Thus, it was very clear for the Parliament that we should support these aims as well. We negotiated very intensively, day and night, over the last three months, because the differences were initially very big.
Why has a price-capping mechanism, which is relatively unusual in EU law, been chosen as the method to get lower roaming costs?
Well it is not price regulation as such, but a factual tariff to protect the consumer. It represents an absolute maximum level, which will prevent market abuse. In some Member States the call rates have already been reduced to approximately 10% of the amount which we suggested. We have fixed a level of 49 cents, one member state already has a tariff of 4.9 cents. The cap is intended to protect against exorbitant charges, which can sometimes be 72 times the tariff of 4.9 cents. In order to stop abuse, we have decided to pass a regulation, which will come into effect immediately.
The agreed prices are only an upper limit. Do you believe that competition might lead to a situation where it will cost the same to make a call anywhere in the EU as in your domestic market?
This will be a starting signal for the telecoms industry over competition for new roaming customers. It will become a massive movement before the summer holidays, because there are millions of European customers waiting for the protective tariff. The company offering it first will be a big winner on the market. We are therefore relatively sure, that the price limits will not be applied. Instead, considerably cheaper call rates will be made available. For the first time a European flat rate will be offered.
In principle the two objectives are to create a domestic market and to provide for more transparency for consumers. They will receive information about pricing by way of an SMS, before they take advantage of the service on offer.
What do citizens have to do now, in order to access the new benefits and to call home at a cheaper rate during the summer holidays?
I would advise people to write a letter to their telecoms provider and ask for the Euro-tariff, so that there is no delay. When the regulation enters into force, operators will have to make an offer anyway, for which consumers can then subscribe. Those who do not want to make a decision will receive the European protective calling rate automatically after three months. It is thus a very safe regulation for the consumer. Those who make a decision immediately will be the first to benefit from the new call rate.
Next steps
The Council of telecoms ministers will vote on the issue on the 7 June. As the proposed law is an EU regulation, it enters into effect immediately after publication in the Official Journal in all the official languages of the EU. Mr Rübig noted that even though it is not possible to give a clear date for adoption, it is technically possible to pass the legislation before the end of June. Under this optimistic scenario, customers could benefit from the reduced rates in August.
