A fast track procedure to rapidly approve intervention measures for the dairy market was approved by Parliament on Tuesday. This will allow MEPs to debate and vote this week on the new proposals put forward by the Commission.
"Although we know that what has been done so far [by the Commission] is not enough, I believe we should vote anyway in favour of the request for the urgent procedure: European farmers are waiting for immediate answers", said Agriculture Committee chair Paolo De Castro (PES, IT), speaking before the vote.
The positive vote on this fast-track method allows Parliament to speed up the normal decision-making process. The new measures just proposed by the Commission will be debated on Tuesday evening and put to a vote by MEPs on Thursday.
Not all Members favoured approving the emergency procedure. According to Martin Hausling (Greens/EFA, DE): "The Commission is not able to solve the crisis: it is part of the problem and cannot be the solution". "We do not want to give the EC a blank cheque", he added.
The Commission asked Parliament's Agriculture Committee to approve the urgent procedure at a meeting on Monday where Commissioner Marianne Fischer Boel presented her new proposals for dealing with the dairy market crisis to MEPs
