They continue to suffer serious systematic discrimination in education, housing, employment and often have limited or no access to healthcare and other public services. "Roma are EU citizens like everyone else," said Kinga Göncz (S&D) who is drafting the opinion of the Employment Committee on Roma inclusion. A recent hearing looked at the plight of the Roma in Europe and ways to improve their lives.
The hearing by the Civil Liberties Committee on 30 November- 1 December brought together all those involved and affected by the EU's "Strategy on Roma inclusion". Hungarian MEP Lívia Járóka has just drafted a report on the strategy and the issues involved. It formed a basis for much of the debate .
Education and employment vital
The hearing was told of the interlinking factors that make it next to impossible for the Roma to break the cycle of poverty and dispair. In particular those present heard that education and employment two key factors to fight the exclusion of the Roma. "Poverty is transmitted from generation to generation between Roma, we must increase employability by increasing education" said László Andor, the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion.
Lívia Járóka's report points out that inclusion of Roma is a long-term investment as over 20-30 years it is more lucrative to integrate Roma than to sustain their substandard socio-economic conditions.
Grassroots investment
Speakers at the hearing welcomed advances in Roma strategy and policies towards the Roma as they pointed out that several years ago there were none. However, they emphasised the continuing need for action. The Járóka report stresses the need to start working at the local level. Commissioner Viviane Reding, (Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship) agreed, underling the importance of the involvement of all 27 EU members in adopting strategies to solve the Roma issue and calling for their cooperation with the Roma task force. "Roma integration is on the agenda, but not in practice in many member states", she said.
Participants also called for the involvement of Roma people, saying decisions about Roma shouldn't be taken without them and that grassroots expertise is required for these policies.
Is European money being spent properly?
Ensuring that EU funding to alleviate problems is properly monitored was an area of discussion. One suggestion was for countries to draw up reports on how the money is spent.
László Andor pointed out that "1/6 of European Social fund's resources - which is more than 10 billion euros - is spent supporting measures for Roma inclusion. Most member states already use EU funds, but often not in an effective way".
France, Italy draw criticism
France and Italy were criticised by Lívia Járóka and civil society organisations for their treatment of the Roma. Marilisa Fantacci from French organisation "Collectif des Roms en Europe" reported that nothing had changed since the summer and Roma are still being expelled from France. "We wonder how in these conditions France can develop an inclusion strategy" she asked.
Commissioner Viviane Reding said that France has formally complied with the requirements of the Commission, but added that monitoring will continue. She pointed out that basic rules should be applied not only in France, but in any other countries. "The application of directive of free movement is the best safeguard," she added.
