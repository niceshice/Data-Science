A workshop for journalists on the proposed hedge funds directive and the financial supervision package will be held at 10.00h on Wednesday 2 June in PHS 5B001. These proposals are currently being negotiated by the European Parliament and Council and it is hoped that an agreement on both can be reached before the summer.
A technical briefing with experts from the EP secretariat on the details of the hedge funds directive should help journalists familiarise themselves with Parliament's current position. A rapporteur and a vice-chair of Parliament's economic and monetary affairs committee will then explain the committee's position on the financial supervisory package. Finally, there will be a round-table discussion between the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs on the hedge funds directive. Any accredited journalist may attend the event, without needing to register. The round table, starting at 12.00h, will be attended by the following MEPs:
Jean-Paul GAUZÈS (EPP, FR), rapporteur
Robert GOEBBELS (S&D, LU), shadow rapporteur
Wolf KLINZ (ALDE, DE), shadow rapporteur
Pascal CANFIN (Greens/EFA, FR), shadow rapporteur
Syed KAMALL (ECR, UK), shadow rapporteur
Jürgen KLUTE (GUE/NGL, DE), shadow rapporteur
MEP Marta ANDREASEN (EFD, UK), shadow rapporteur
We look forward to seeing you at the workshop.
