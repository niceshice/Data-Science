It’s not always about MEPs: prominent individuals from the world of politics and beyond are often invited to bring their knowledge, perspectives and experiences to enrich the political work of Parliament. When they do, we meet them. This dossier gathers the some of the interviews conducted since the summer.
One guru, one nurse, two Speakers of Parliament: read again the words of some of the talkative personalities we met in September and October 2007. No matter if they talk about the EU, about love or about hope: they speak of the world we live in.

Speaker of Iraqi Parliament at the EP
Mahmoud AL-Mashadani form the Iraqi Parliament at the EP Mahmoud al-Mashhadani, the speaker of the Iraqi Parliament, met European Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering Monday in the course of a two-day visit to Brussels. The first elected Iraqi speaker to visit the EP discussed refugees, EU-Iraq relations, the establishment of a new bilateral inter-parliamentary delegation and the future role of EU diplomatic representation in the region. He and a group of Iraqi MPs met with the EP Foreign Affairs Committee Tuesday.
Mr Pöttering welcomed the visit: “We feel very committed to the great challenges Iraq is facing, especially we see with greatest regret the suffering of its people”. He added: “we insist on the sovereignty of Iraq…it is the responsibility of the international community to do its utmost so that peace, sovereignty, freedom and democracy have a chance.” The President said, “The EP clearly positions itself in favour of the integrity of the Iraqi nation, we are supporting within our limits and responsibilities all efforts aiming at ethical and religious reconciliation. We are already supporting economically and socially the development of the country and we will continue doing so. We know security is the basis of everything, without it there is no hope.” Commenting on the economic situation, he said Iraq is “a rich nation” and it is very important that “Iraq and the Iraqis can make autonomous use of all its resources" to achieve further development. What the speaker had to say We had the opportunity to ask Mr Mashhadani some questions about his country and its relations with the EU. Iraqis participated enthusiastically in parliamentary elections and massively supported the country's new constitution. Yet it seems very hard to restore normal political life to the country. Why? Because of the occupation. We do not have full sovereignty yet…and no democratic practises or experiment can be complete without full sovereignty. Do you know about the Petraeus plan which was adopted by the US congress...is it natural that the future and the plans of Iraq should be decided upon in the US Congress? There is a big problem and there is a giant lie which has to do with sovereignty. What can the EU do, politically, diplomatically and practically, to help Iraq overcome its current difficulties and help entrench democracy? First of all we hope that UN will be able to play an important role and that the EU will help us to fight poverty and to make a real reconciliation...With its support we will succeed in security and sovereignty and this will allow a beginning for the future of my country. It is a very great pleasure to see that the EU has open arms and open ears… we count on the strong friendship between us. What do you expect to gain from your visit to the European Parliament? I expect the EP's support for the Iraqi Parliament and for the reconstruction of my country...and also to balance the American stay in Iraq. Mr Mashhadani also welcomed the idea of a future standing parliamentary delegation between the EP and the Iraqi Parliament "to strengthen our relationship”. “We are now studying this project, there is already an initial plan for the structure and we will continue to work on it.” EP resolution: EU/Iraq - A framework for engagement Iraqi refugees - press info Kirkuk referendum - Press service Iraq and the EU - more engagement needed Foreign Affairs Committee
Indian guru Satguru Baba Ji, EP President discuss spiritual side of politics
Indian guru brings enlightment The European Parliament has received its fair share of religious leaders and on 26 September it was the turn of Indian spiritual leader Satguru Baba Hardev Ji. He leads the Sant Nirankari Mission, a spiritual movement dedicated to human welfare and promoting the idea of universal brotherhood. The mission has over 2000 centres worldwide and millions of followers.
Satguru Baba Ji was invited by the chair of the India Delegation, Neena Gill and met with EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering in the context of next year's European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. Following the meeting, Mr Pöttering said, "I am convinced that religious leaders dedicated to peaceful and tolerant co-existence can make an enormous contribution to our societies. I particularly welcome the initiative of Satguru Baba Ji's movement in promoting interfaith dialogue in South Asia. His method of bringing leaders of different religions together to discuss the role of spirituality in promoting universal human values is something which we have mirrored within the EU." "The spiritual side of politics" We talked with Satguru Baba Hardev Ji in Strasbourg about knowledge, spirituality and the peaceful coexistence of people and cultures: Your Holiness, you have just met Hans-Gert Pöttering. What value is there in meetings between spiritual leaders and political leaders? What message did you wish to convey to him? Principally we were discussing the principles and values of the Nirankari Mission. We focus on human beings, whether they live in Europe or in India. And so we are bringing about awareness, that as mankind we have to peacefully coexist. Since politicians run governments and institutions, they have a very big role to play. Their role is not just managing the affairs of countries, but also incorporating a human touch. We were discussing the spiritual side of politics and ways to bring about harmony between human beings. Next year is the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. Looking at today's Europe, and drawing on your experience, how can our different ethnic, cultural and religious groups live harmoniously together? It is love and compassion that brings us closer...you are using 23 languages in the European Parliament...There are differences and that is diversity. Like you, we say that there is "unity in diversity". The right thing is to work on it. When different cultures meet they should flourish together. In a garden, a rose does not tell a tulip: "you do not exist". Many say that there is a crisis of spirituality in Europe, associated with a decline in attendance at traditional churches. In your view, does this make it harder or easier to achieve a peaceful multicultural society? It makes things a bit more difficult. People give more importance to materialistic achievements. They visit traditional places of worship less. But religion in its true sense is the religion of humanity, love and compassion. A poet in India once wrote: "One does not need religious places as such, because one can worship God by loving mankind." We have to ask ourselves: do we love and have compassion for others, are we humble, are we able to help others not out of greed or selfishness but out of love and selflessness? You teach that to gain knowledge, people must ask for it. In the EU we often talk about life-long learning. What should people do to stay open to knowledge? Learning...should be an ongoing process that continues until the last breath. True knowledge is beneficial to oneself and to mankind. It allows the establishment of a good and harmonious environment. People in Europe should remain open-minded and open-hearted. That was the basis for past developments. Although there are so many countries in Europe now they are joined together and have the European Parliament. And this humane touch is important for ordinary people. We are one family. Brothers can argue over property but finally we have to adopt this brother-brother relationship. Indian Delegation
Serbia's "European Destiny": Oliver Dulić, President of the Serbian Parliament
70% support for EU integration process The convening of the Serbian parliament by its President Oliver Dulić of the Serbian Democratic Party on 1 October marked the end of a protracted period of national political deadlock whose battle lines were largely drawn around attitudes to European integration. Former student protest leader Dulić, at 32 the youngest ever incumbent of his position, is a leader of pro-integration opinion.
With its tormented recent history – the Milošović years, the bloody break-up of Yugoslavia, violence in Kosovo, UN sanctions, the 1999 NATO bombing campaign, the assassination of its prime minister, the ongoing search for indicted war criminals – Serbia has been cut off from the European mainstream for many years. Even now, fully 70% of Serbian students have never travelled outside their borders. However, many Serbs now seek to turn the page and a new generation of young reform-minded politicians is looking to a more hopeful European future for their country. During a recent seminar for parliamentary officials in Belgrade organised by the European Parliament, the web team took the opportunity to talk to Speaker Dulić about Serbia's path towards European integration, its people and its mood. Mr Dulić, Serbia's European integration process is a highly contentious issue in the Serbian Parliament. What are the big issues in this debate? The biggest factor in our relations with the EU is the final status of Kosovo. We have a very tough debate here about the role of the EU in this process. As a European-oriented politician, I am always very glad to see that the EU plays a very positive role, seeking a solution in accordance with international standards respecting the interest of both sides. A compromise in this process is crucial for Serbia. This is not only a face-saving policy for our country, but a crucial part in the historical reconciliation between Serbs and Albanians, which is most important for the stability of the Balkans. Then there is of course the internal debate in the EU. There are persistent questions on the European side about "enlargement fatigue" or possible doubts over whether the Western Balkans should be part of the EU or not. However, if we find a solution on Kosovo avoiding unilateral recognition by the US and EU and which ensures a Serbian voice in this process, and if the enlargement process develops normally, I am sure that our European integration process will continue without major problems. How does the Serbian population see European integration? As a pro-European politician, how do you "sell" Europe to voters? Latest polls show nearly 70% support for the EU integration process, which is very encouraging for those of us working for change in our society. Of course, as in other countries, some people will probably turn against the integration process as it actually impacts their own lives. In the early part of the process, you always feel more negative than positive impacts. But in strategic terms people understand that European integration is our destiny. The EU guarantees a normal, safe life as well as a better economic perspective for our country. So I am optimistic about the support of the Serbian population. However, this is a very particular moment. We have a powerful and dangerous mixture of, on one hand, national frustrations and open status questions, and, on the other, a very tough economic situation. This is rich soil for radicals and populists in gaining an edge over more rational opponents who try to explain the realities of the situation. We pro-integrationists point to the good examples in the region of those who have chosen European integration as their final destination. We show that the EU is a stabilising factor; we show how EU integration provides answers for many problems in our society. Serbia's recent history has been traumatic, with the 1990's referred to as the "lost decade". How do you assess the morale of the country? Is it a self-confident county? An uncertain country? More uncertain than self-confident. Unfortunately, we like to show we are strong, but this is our weakness. We are an interesting, talented people, but sometimes very destructive, especially in the region. When Serbia exports security, stability, good ideas, we are the best players in the region. Sadly, we can also export destruction - and we are also very good at that. So we have to find our role. We have to play an important role in stabilising this region, using all those good characteristics which are part of our identity. It is remarkable to see such a young individual occupying your position as the president of a national parliament. Do you see your youth as an asset? It's true, I'm pretty young, I'm 32. But I'm twice the age of democracy in Serbia! So I'm probably representative of the new generation of politicians in Serbia, one not loaded with the problems of the past. I am a pretty tolerant guy; I come from a multiethnic background; I am always ready to find a compromise with people on various issues, which is probably why I'm here. I arrived at a very tough moment for political life in Serbia, with massive quarrels between the political parties, and a reason why I was proposed by my party is that we want to push new, young people and to provoke other parties to do the same. Now is the time to bring forward a new generation of politicians free from the old quarrels of the past. I'm only the first in this process, and I think my youth is more an advantage than a disadvantage.

"Do not lose hope!" says Bulgarian nurse freed from Libyan death sentence
Kristiana Valcheva: "there is always hope" MEPs stood and applauded yesterday in tribute to a group of Bulgarian medics in the public gallery. The 5 Bulgarian medics and 1 Palestinian doctor had until recently been on death row in Libya falsely accused of infecting children with the AIDS virus in Benghazi hospital. The group had been jailed in Libya for over eight years prior to their release in July. One of the group - Kristiana Valcheva - has recently written a book "Head Up". She spoke to us about her imprisonment and liberation.
Kristiana Valcheva is now 48. She first arrived in Libya with her husband in 1991. In 1999 she was working at the Hauari hospital in Benghazi when they were arrested over the outbreak of AIDS there. He husband was later released but stayed on at the Bulgarian embassy to be close to her. The international campaign to clear the medics has always emphasised that they had been made scapegoats for the failures of the Libyan health system. They were in Parliament on 10 October - a day designated by the Council of Europe as international day against the death penalty. "Dictatorial regime with terrorist manners imprisoned us" We began by asking her what she had discussed when she met Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering. Kristiana Valcheva: I thanked him for the solidarity Europe has shown to us. Success can be reached when people cooperate. He explained to us the steps the Parliament has taken, and assured us that everybody is happy that the events took a good turn eventually. For us it was very precious and emotional to hear, that the European Parliament stands up against the death penalty everywhere in the world. We were innocent. A dictatorial regime with terrorist manners imprisoned us for more than eight years and wanted to take our lives. Question: What role did the EU play in your liberation? Kristiana Valcheva: : The European Union played an enormous role in our liberation. Without it, we would not be free today. I have personally told Mr Pöttering that we are grateful for all the efforts of the European Parliament. All the time people here were aware of our situation. But at the same, it took the European Union a long time to react. Meanwhile, every single day of our life in the Libyan prison was full of suffering. For the sake of the victims, I would wish that if such cases should happen again in the future, a response would come earlier. Of course, it is even better to prevent such cases from happening in the first place. "Everything can be mended" Question: What is the main message of your book? ("J´ai gardé la tête haute" in its original French) Kristiana Valcheva: : The main message is that no matter how difficult, terrible, inevitable and hopeless a situation might be, there are always things which can return faith and hope. Everything can be mended as long as you stay alive. I believe that there are many people who were or still are in a situation like me. To them I would like to say "Do not lose hope!" Question: You have said that "hope dies last". How do you maintain hope and how is your life today? Kristiana Valcheva: : There is always hope to be found. I am an optimistic person, I always look for it. I believe that I got this from my mother, who is a proud and strong woman. During all these years it was my faith in divine justice, which kept me going. Now that I am free, I am sure that my life will go well. There are many things I missed during these eight and a half years. Now I want to catch up with all of them. 24 July - Pöttering welcomes release of Bulgarian medics

Edge of Heaven with the European Parliament LUX prize
A film about human relationships between German and Turkish people has won the first European Parliament "LUX" cinema prize. MEPs voted Fatih Akin's "Auf der Anderen Seite" (The Edge of Heaven) their favourite film from a shortlist of 3 on Wednesday 24 October. EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering presented the prize in the hemicycle debating chamber. In Strasbourg to collect the prize was the film's producer Klaus Maeck. We caught up with him to get his thoughts on the film and the prize.
Death, love, hope, fear
For those who have yet to see it, a brief synopsis of the film follows. Despite the misgivings of his son Nejat, Ali, a widower, decides to move in with Yeter, a prostitute who shares his Turkish origin. Nejat, warms to Yeter when he realises that she sends most of what she earns to her daughter in Turkey to pay for her university education. Yeter’s accidental death drives a wedge between father and son. Nejat goes to Istanbul to search for Ayten, unaware that the 20-year-old political activist, has fled to Germany to escape the Turkish police. In Hamburg Ayten becomes friendly with Lotte, a German student, who invites her to stay, despite the qualms of her mother Susanne. Ayten is arrested and put in detention, and ultimately deported to Turkey, where she is sent to prison. Lotte decides to go to Turkey, where her efforts to secure Ayten’s release run into a brick wall of bureaucracy. She meets Nejat and they become flat-mates. A tragic event prompts Susanne to travel to Istanbul to continue her daughter’s quest. As he grows closer to Susanne, Nejat feels the need to be reconciled with his father, who now lives in Turkey, by the Black Sea.
A few words with producer Klaus Maeck:
For those who have not seen the film, could you explain its main message?
The main message of the film is death, reconciliation and then forgiveness. It's because the protagonist learns from those who died how to live
How can the LUX Prize help European film makers?
I have great respect for this prize. In Europe we don't hear much regarding art and culture from Parliaments. It's great that it will be in 23 languages and that it will reach a wider audience - which will enhance integration in Europe.
Your film raises issues of nationality and identity: what do you think Europeans can learn this?
When we were filming in Turkey, Turkish film makers, artists and actors - they don't think much in terms of borders and the accession of Turkey to the EU. They think more in terms of humans travelling and building relationships.
What is your favourite film?
It's a film from the 1970's called "Themroc" with Michel Piccoli - who in fact happens to be here in the Parliament today. ("Themroc is a 1973 film which has no dialogue and examines the power of authority, sexuality and the limitations of modern society).
So could we assume you are a pro-European?
Yes I am indeed. It's a very good idea the subtitling my film in 23 languages - as it allows it to reach more people around Europe. Award of the LUX Prize EP committed to culture Parliament's new film prize to boost European cinema
