A selection of the most popular stories throughout 2009 EU citizens voted for a new Parliament in June, so it's not surprising that articles about the election were very popular. Readers were also interested in issues that affect us all directly like mobile phone prices, the European health insurance card and the risks of electro-magnetic fields.
Interest in the workings of parliament continued into the second half of the year, as our interview with the first EP president from the former Eastern bloc proved popular. While our invitation to you to submit photos to us attracted photographers and readers. Among other popular stories in 2009 were the return of wonky fruit and veg, the future of the internet and environmental stories, including pollution in the Baltic Sea and an interview with the chairman of the International Climate Change Panel ahead of the Copenhagen summit.
