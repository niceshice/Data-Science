Cigarette smuggling (EC-Philip Morris agreement)
Budgetary control
2007-10-11 - 13:11
MEPs adopted a non-binding report on cigarette smuggling (EC-Philip Morris agreement). The European Parliament, supported by the Council and the European Court of Auditors, is recommending that, in order to prevent fraud, transit movements be computerised, the legal framework be revised and the Commission and the Member States improve physical checks based on common risk analysis
UK affected
The report observes that the House of Lords considers that approximately 4% of the UK's potential VAT revenue is being lost each year due to carousel fraud; notes the House of Lords' findings that, although it appeared more lucrative to commit VAT fraud in intra-Community trade, it can also occur in trade involving trade with third countries. The committee is deeply concerned about the House of Lords' explanations that, in the latter cases, the abuse of the Community transit system forms part of the classical pattern of carousel fraud.
The European Parliament is grateful that the House of Lords addressed the vulnerability of the Community transit system to fraud, although the European Court of Auditors had not focused on the UK in particular. The House warmly welcomes the House of Lords' recommendation "that Government works with other Member States to ensure that the European Court of Auditors' proposed changes to the Community Transit system are prioritised in order to attack the supply chain for this variant of (...) fraud."
The report calls on the other Member States to cooperate with the UK Government in order finally to make the Community Transit System fraud proof.
The agreement with Philip Morris
The report recalls that the agreement with Philip Morris to end all litigation between parties, under which Philip Morris was committed to pay US$1.25bn over a period of 12 years, and which aimed at combating fraud and illicit cigarette trade, was a major step forward.
The European Parliament notes that, under the agreement, Philip Morris will enhance the tracing and tracking of its products so as to assist law enforcement authorities in combating illegal trade.
The report also notes that, under the agreement, Philip Morris has to pay compensation for loss of duties in case of seizures of cigarettes bearing the Philip Morris trademark. Finally, the European Parliament calls on the UK government to join the agreement, the UK being the only Member State which has not yet signed it. In view of its work on fraud in the EU, the committee invites the House of Lord to support this request.
