MEPs, Assistants and Civil Servants walk hurriedly to the hemicycle before the start of the day's debates; EP Plenary Session - October, Strasbourg On the 20th of October 2009, just a few weeks before the opening of the international negotiations on climate change in Copenhagen, the EP Greens/EFA political group commissioned this sculpture of an 'ice man' on the European Parliament's parvis (Strasbourg). The artist who made this, sculptor Vosgien Christian, remarked that "it will melt in just two days and will thus show just how quickly this precious material evaporates nowadays" The following EP Political Groups held Press Conferences : EPP, S&D, ALDE, Greens/EFA, GUE and ECR (the political group EFD did not made a group press conference); EP Plenary Session - October, Strasbourg. EP president Jerzy Buzek enters the Chamber to officially open the European Parliament's October plenary session in Strasbourg.

One of the ways to the Chamber; October plenary session of the EP in Strasburg. Stormy debates and surprise votes spiced up this week at the European Parliament in Strasbourg. The 2010 budget, the European Council, Sakharov Prize and the freedom of press made up an interesting agenda. As well as the words were the images and we bring a few of them here to you in the accompanying slideshow.
Sakharov Prize : The European Parliament's 2009 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought has been awarded to Russian civil rights defence organization Memorial, and their three representatives Oleg Orlov, Sergei Kovalev and Lyudmila Alexeyeva, as well as all other human rights defenders in Russia. Announcing the winners EP President Jerzy Buzek said: "we hope to contribute to ending the circle of fear and violence surrounding human rights defenders in the Russian Federation".
2010 budget : Thursday afternoon MEPs voted on the scope of the EU budget for 2010. They ask for an extra €1.5 billion to boost Europe's economy and for a €300 million dairy fund to support Europe's beleaguered dairy farmers.
338 to 338, 8 abstentions - MEPs narrowly voted down all nine motions for a resolution tabled on freedom of press in Italy and other EU countries, the last one on a tied vote.
Klaus before Christmas? MEPs discussed Czech president's readiness to sign the Treaty if the Constitutional court approves it.
One for all, all for one: It is possible to say a lot in 1 minute. For the first time a "question time" took place in the EP - MEPs had 1 minute time to ask, Commission President Barroso - 1 minute to answer.
Milk boost: The Parliament decided in a super fast mode to grant the rescue for the milk farmers in distress. Direct aid fund will be launched even by the end of the year, said the agriculture Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel.
Drip, drip, drip: Ice sculpture in the main courtyard of the EP in Strasbourg was erected to remind of the climate change. While the statue slowly melted in the cold Strasbourg air, the MEPs prepared for the crucial December climate meeting in Copenhagen.
The wild, the endangered and the protected: Grus grus (common crane), Cursorius cursor (cream-colored courser), or Eurasian woodcock (Scolopax rusticola) are among the dozens of wild birds protected under European law. The EP gave a green light to simplify this oldest piece of common legislation on environmental protection (April 1979).
Internal accountability for external action: MEPs want more control over the new European external action service set up by the Lisbon Treaty.
Parliamentary Twitter - For the first time ever the European Parliament ' tweeted ' a plenary debate minute by minute.
