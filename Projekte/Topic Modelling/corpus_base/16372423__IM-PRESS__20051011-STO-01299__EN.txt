World democracy under the microscope

The orange revolution in the Ukraine
For the European Union, the defence of human rights is a fundamental issue and the cornerstone of its foreign policy. In the European Parliament 34 delegations make sure that cooperation with countries outside the EU serves to strengthen democracy in the world. Far from confining themselves to mere declarations, members actively pursue this goal through EU observation missions to all corners of the world.
It comes as no surprise to find that members of the European Parliament often travel between Brussels, Strasbourg and their constituencies. But their travels do not end at the Union’s borders. For many years, they have taken part in parliamentary activities in countries outside the Union. These come in two forms: visits within the framework of regular cooperation with national parliaments and election assistance and observation missions.
The aim is clear: it is about strengthening political cooperation between democracies, establishing democracy where it doesn’t exist and, where it has been weakened, strengthening it through defending human rights and the concept of a constitutional state (notably through actions which contribute towards reinforcing the parliamentary system). Democracy is a process that can never be taken for granted. To survive and function it needs specific institutions and mechanisms, of which elections are a part. So it is not surprising that election assistance and observation missions are key elements of the EU’s overall strategy of promoting democracy in the world.
Recently, when EU observers discovered irregularities during the Ukrainian elections, the European Parliament passed a resolution demanding a new ballot. The role of members, whose delegation made two visits to Kiev, was crucial. In the next few days an EP delegation will be observing elections in Liberia, another has returned in the past month from Afghanistan and a third will be off to Azerbaijan in November. In the context of cooperation with the Russian parliament (Duma), members are visiting Kaliningrad. Other recent destinations have included Palestine, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and the Lebanon. It is the Conference of Presidents which decides where members will go. In many cases this takes place within a framework where actions are coordinated with the European Commission and Council.
These missions are essentially aimed at strengthening the legitimacy of the electoral process, increasing citizens’ confidence in it, avoiding electoral fraud, greater protection of human rights and contributing towards conflict resolution. Their success greatly depends on overall relations between the EU and the countries concerned and in post-electoral follow-ups: in areas like the installation of a new government, the peaceful transfer of power and even, if needs be, the government’s determination to pursue those involved in acts of political violence. At stake are the viability of democracy and the credibility of the electoral process.
