Pipeline construction a way to diversify says report
This week in Strasbourg energy issues will be on the agenda as MEPs debate renewable sources of energy and a common foreign policy on energy. Both debates are in response to own-initiative reports by Danish Socialist Britta Thomsen and Polish Conservative Jacek Saryusz-Wolski. The Thomsen report - to be debated Monday - wants a fifth of EU energy to be from renewable sources by 2020. The Saryusz-Wolski report (debate Tuesday) calls for a single policy on energy and a "High Official" to run it.
During the March 2007 European Summit, member states set a binding target to produce 20% of all the energy consumed in EU from renewable sources. The Thomsen report calls on the European Commission to present a proposal for a renewable energy legislative framework by the end of the year. It wants clear and realistic binding targets for the electricity, transport and heating and cooling sectors.
Ms Thomsen believes that fulfilling the renewables target is an opportunity for the EU, not a burden and will lead to a more green and a more competitive Europe. "More green energy will create new jobs, generate research and innovation and will in addition contribute to increased energy security and less CO2 emissions." Ms Thomsen believes that the target for renewable energy cannot be seen as separate from other energy policy ambitions. It will aim to create a real internal market for electricity, improving energy efficiency by 20% and revise the CO2 emissions trading scheme.
Energy foreign policy debated Tuesday
On Tuesday 25 September MEPs debate the Saryusz-Wolksi report which calls for a common European foreign policy on energy. Mr Saryusz-Wolksi also wants more energetic energy diplomacy by the EU - using its economic power to influence suppliers. Energy security clauses in international agreements and a "High Official" to coordinate policy would be two ways of achieving this. He sees the "Energy Charter Treaty" as a "cornerstone" of European and international cooperation on energy. The report will be put to the vote later in the week.
Ahead of the debate Mr Saryusz-Wolksi outlined the main goals of his report. "The aim of the report is to create, in the long-term, a genuine European foreign policy on energy."
He added that "the underlying principles of the report are diversification - prioritising strategic projects such as the Nabucco pipeline, unity in defending the Union's interest and solidarity in crisis situations". He went on to say that "Europe needs energy solidarity. When third countries use energy as a foreign policy tool, energy is no longer a commodity".
The report strongly supports the emergence of an energy "corridor" from Central Asia to the South Caucasus through to Europe.
January 2006 Russia-Ukraine sends chill through EU
In January 2006 a Russia-Ukraine gas dispute interrupted supplies to several EU states and acted as a wake up call regarding the EU's dependence on imported oil and gas. The report pulls no punches in pointing out that the Union's energy supply comes from "unstable" and "authoritarian regimes". It calls for the EU to use its economic weight to exert greater pressure on Russia to adopt "open, fair and transparent" energy markets.
The report calls for the EU to tie its foreign and energy policy closer together in a more assertive fashion. It says that energy should be treated as "essential component" of EU security that will promote EU values of human rights, democracy and respect for the law. The need to meet Kyoto targets and fight climate change is also mentioned.
How can action be taken?
Mr Saryusz-Wolski believes that a few practical steps need to be taken to make an energy foreign policy a reality. As well as the "Energy Charter Treaty" and the "High Official" to coordinate the EU"s energy policy, the Polish MEP wants more European Parliament and Commission involvement in energy policy. The High Official would ensure that every agreement the EU concludes internationally has an "energy security clause" to protect supply.
In terms of timetable, Mr Saryusz-Wolski wants a roadmap established by the end of this year for future progress. The Intergovernmental conference which gave a mandate to the drafters of the new Reform Treaty has also included energy issues in the treaty. He said this new opportunity should be seized.
You can watch both this debates live from Strasbourg on Monday from 5pm and on Tuesday evening.
