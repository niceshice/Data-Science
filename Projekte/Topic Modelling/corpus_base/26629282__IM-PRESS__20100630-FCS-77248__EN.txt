Food Clone Wars
Food Clone Wars Cloned animals sticking point Use of nanotechnology under scrutiny Nanotechnologies used in food products extend the shelf life, but could potentially be toxic in certain cases. But the sticking point in negotiations between Parliament and Commission on new foodstuffs has been over products derived from cloned animals. With stakeholders in the US, the Commission is proceeding cautiously, but may be at loggerheads with MEPs.
Safe trucking
Europarltv - safe trucking Fatigue a potential killer Concerns over too much regulation Working time for self-employed truckers is back in the spotlight ahead of a crucial vote. With one truck accident in five due to driver fatigue, MEPs put safety first.
Super Size EU
Europarltv - food labelling Food labelling proves hot potato Controversy over traffic light scheme Wouldn't you want to know when a sandwich is more fatty than a Big Mac? MEPs think so. But EU institutions are divided on food labels to help consumers make the right choice.
Building A Greener Europe
europarltv - building a greener Europe How can energy needs be met? Are large cuts really feasible? Our homes and offices must cut energy consumption by 20% says Europe. But as the crisis hits taxpayersâ€™ pockets, will the politicians pay for the measures needed? Could tax incentives be the answer?
Fishing for answers
Europe's fisheries industries facing falling catches and prices Falling prices affecting industry Ever tighter quotas to prevent collapse of stocks The EU imports over 60% of its farmed fish. Cutting red tape may boost fish farm output, but are there hidden costs?
Turning hot air to energy
MEPs look to alternatives after Copenhagen Strong support for more ambitious targets After the failed Copenhagen summit in December 2009, climate negotiators met in Bonn. Looking for more ambitions C02 targets, MEPs cited the success of wind turbines in Germany as a possible solution.
The Greek Patient
Europarltv - the Greek patient Cash injection Athens gets EU bail out The ailing economy in Greece will finally be given a cash injection. A 110 billion joint IMF-EU loan has been decided upon. But MEPs want to go further and tackle the root of the problem and are calling for a revision of the Growth and Stability Pact, so that the Eurozone has tools to deal with such problems before they become terminal.
