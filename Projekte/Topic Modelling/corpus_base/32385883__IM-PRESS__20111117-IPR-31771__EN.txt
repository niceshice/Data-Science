How much money does the EU spend in your country? What is it spent on and how does that expenditure relate to EU spending in other countries? And where does all that money come from? These and other questions are answered in our updated multi-media application on the EU Budget.
The application has been updated with the latest figures, which come from the annual financial report 2010, prepared by the European Commission. It should be helpful when you are reporting on EU annual budgets or putting discussion on the EU's future Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) in your national context.
NB. The application provides objective financial data. It does not reflect the underlying values of the EU budget. Nor does it take into account of the national budget savings that result of organising tasks on a European scale.
