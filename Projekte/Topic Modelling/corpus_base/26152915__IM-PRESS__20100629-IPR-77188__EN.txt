The Conference of Presidents, made up of leaders of Parliament’s political groups, met the President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, on Tuesday morning to discuss the work of the task force of EU finance ministers which he is chairing with the aim of strengthening economic governance. The MEPs stressed the importance of associating Parliament with the task force’s work.
The Conference of Presidents was chaired by EP first Vice-President Gianni Pittella, and also included a number of the chairs of the relevant parliamentary committees.
The MEPs made clear, in their discussion with Mr Van Rompuy, that the European Parliament wishes to be more closely involved with the work of the task force, in order better to coordinate the different analyses underway as various legislative proposals are being developed. Greater involvement of the European Parliament would also improve the transparency of a process which has so far received little public attention.
Vice-President Pittella stressed the importance of Mr Van Rompuy’s decision to hold this discussion with the Conference of Presidents, and in particular of his willingness to look into ways in which Parliament could be more closely associated with the work the task force is undertaking. He said he would return to the subject at a future meeting of the Conference.
A number of MEPs spoke of the importance of widening the discussions also to national parliaments, to avoid having the EU’s budgetary policy being decided behind closed doors.
The inclusion of Parliament in the process is all the more necessary given that a significant part of the proposals put forward by the task force could have budgetary consequences, and that, whether at national or European level, no decision on the budget can be taken without parliamentary involvement.
