The European Parliament gave the go-ahead on Tuesday for EU funding for 3,731 workers in Portugal, the Netherlands, Spain and Denmark. The money will go to people who became redundant following to the closure of their companies.
The total financial assistance approved by Parliament today is €14,489,399.
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was established to provide support for workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation or the financial crisis and to assist them with their reintegration into the labour market. The annual ceiling of the fund is €500 million.
Funding for Portugal will go to 839 people who used to work for Qimonda AG, a multinational firm operating in the electronic sector in the Norte region. In the Netherlands the assistance is for 512 ex-employees of NXP Semiconductors, operating in the electronic sector in the Gelderland and Eindhoven regions. In Spain support will go to the region of Cataluña, where 1,429 people from 23 different car manufacturing companies were laid off. Lastly, in Denmark the funding is for 851 people formerly employed by 45 companies manufacturing machinery equipment in the region of Nordjylland.
Following the green light by Parliament, the Council of Ministers still has to give its approval.
