Guillermo Fariñas is the winner of this year's Sahkarov Prize for Freedom of Thought. The award ceremony takes place, most likely with an empty chair, on Wednesday, 15 December, in Strasbourg. President Buzek deeply regrets that Mr Fariñas has not been given permission to leave Cuba in order to receive the prize in person.
During the opening of the plenary session president Buzek declared the following with regard to this year's winner of the Sakharov prize:
"On October 21 Cuban dissident Guillermo Fariñas was chosen as the winner of this year's Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. Regrettably, Mr Fariñas is experiencing problems leaving the country, even though I made a personal appeal in a letter to the President of Cuba, Mr Raul Castro. We expect that Lady Ashton will take due note of these problems and that she will take this into account in future relations with Cuba. If Guillermo Fariñas were to leave in the next few hours, he could still be here in time to receive his prize".
The Sakharov ceremony will take place on Wednesday as scheduled, at 13.00h.
Guillermo Fari ñas is the third winner from Cuba to receive the €50,000 prize, after Oswaldo José Payá Sardiñas in 2002 and Ladies in White in 2005.
A doctor of psychology, journalist and former soldier, 48-year-old Guillermo Fariñas's has denounced the Castro regime. He is the founder of "Cubanacán Press," an independent press agency aimed at raising awareness of the fate of political prisoners in Cuba.
Fariñas has spent years in confinement and has gone on hunger strike 23 times so far, a non-violent means of fighting oppression in Cuba. His efforts to secure free internet for all earned him a Reporters Without Borders Cyber-Freedom Prize in 2006.
"Guillermo Fariñas was ready to sacrifice and risk his own health and life as a means of pressure to achieve change in Cuba. I hope to hand over the award to him in person, here in Strasbourg, in December, which would be a tremendous moment for the European Parliament and for all Cuban prisoners of conscience," said Mr Jerzy Buzek, president of the European Parliament.
In July, Mr Fariñas nearly died after a five-month-long hunger strike he began on February 24, following the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo, a fellow political activist who passed away after 80 days of fasting. He ended the strike after the Cuban government gave in to his plea and released 52 political prisoners.
MEPs backing Mr Fariñas' nomination said his "struggle has been, and still is, a shining example for all defenders of freedom and democracy." José Ignacio Salafranca (EPP, SP) described Mr Fariñas as "the epitome of someone defending peaceful resistance."

Fariñas chosen from three finalists
Guillermo Fariñas competed with Israeli NGO Breaking the Silence and Ethiopian politician Birtukan Mideksa, also shortlisted for the 2010 Sakharov Prize. Mr Fariñas was nominated by the Group of the European People's Party, the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, Edvard Kožušník and 91 other MEPs. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left supported the nomination of Breaking the Silence, while Birtukan Mideksa was backed up by the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament.
Breaking the Silence works to shed light on the injustices of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem, through exposing the Israeli public to the realities of the occupation as seen through the eyes of Israeli soldiers. Birtukan Mideksa is a politician and former judge, fighting for democracy, human rights and the rule of law in Ethiopia.
Each September, candidates for the Sakharov prize are nominated by political groups and at least 40 MEPs. After discussions on the proposed contenders, a joint vote of the Committees on Foreign Affairs and Development decides the short list of 3 nominees. In October, the final winner is then chosen by the Conference of Presidents. The prize is then awarded during the Parliament's plenary session in December in Strasbourg.
The Sakharov Prize and the EP commitment to human rights
The Sakharov Prize is the European Parliament's way of honouring outstanding achievements in the ­fight to protect freedom of thought and expression against intolerance, fanaticism and hatred. This reflects the Parliament's conviction that fundamental freedoms include not only the right to life and physical integrity, but also freedom of expression and of the press.
The prize is named after Andrei Sakharov (1921-1989) a renowned physicist, dissident and Nobel Peace Prize winner.
The European Parliament is committed to ensuring that rights and freedoms are defended and promoted, both within and outside the European Union. The Parliament promotes initiatives in areas such as torture prevention, the protection of minorities, conflict prevention, the promotion of women's rights and children's rights and the protection of human rights activists.
Each year, the Parliament publishes a report on human rights around the world, while every month it adopts urgent resolutions on serious human rights violations or attacks on freedom of speech. This year's report, drafted by Laima Liucija Andrikienė (EPP, LT) advocated a strong and effective EU human rights policy that guarantees greater consistency between internal and external policies. This was the first EP human rights report drafted following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, and addresses issues such as a global moratorium on death penalty, violence against women, children's rights and the fate of Guantánamo prisoners.
