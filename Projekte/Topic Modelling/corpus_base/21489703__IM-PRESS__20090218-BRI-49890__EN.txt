Opening of the Brussels plenary session: Pöttering on Polish engineer in Pakistan, bushfires in Australia, Baha'i in Iran and expulsion of Spanish MEP from Venezuela
At the opening of the plenary session in Brussels, EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering made four statements: 1) on the killing of Piotr Stańczak, a Polish engineer by terrorists in Pakistan, 2) on the tragic bushfires in southern Australia 3) on members of the Baha'i religion in Iran and 4) on the expulsion of Spanish MEP Luis Herrero from Venezuela.
Czech President Václav Klaus questions ever closer European political integration in speech to the European Parliament
The Lisbon Treaty would worsen the EU's democratic deficit, argued Czech President Klaus in a speech to the EP, in which he questioned the role of the EP itself. EP President Pöttering responded by describing Mr Klaus's views as "an expression of the diversity in Europe" and pointed out that "in a democracy it's the view of the majority that counts". Without the EP, Europe would be in the hands of bureaucrats, he cautioned. A wide majority of MEPs strongly welcomed Mr Pöttering's response.
Gaza: increased humanitarian aid, end of the blockade and damage assessment needed
In a joint resolution adopted by 488 votes in favour 5 against and 19 abstentions, MEPs call for a damage assessment in Gaza and an in-depth evaluation of the needs of the Gaza population. This evaluation could serve as a basis for reconstruction plans. MEPs call for increased humanitarian aid and for an end to the blockade of the Gaza Strip, the immediate and sustainable reopening of the crossing points, and the prevention of smuggling of and illicit trafficking in arms and ammunition. The debate preceding the vote took place on Wednesday, 18 February with the participation of the High Representative of the CFSP, Javier Solana , External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner and political group speakers
EU-NATO relations: MEPs call for strengthened cooperation
MEPs say that the EU and NATO could strengthen each other by avoiding competition and developing greater cooperation in crisis management operations. The report supports the establishment of a permanent EU Operational Headquarters. The first report of the European Parliament on NATO comes a few months ahead of the Alliance's 60th anniversary Summit to be held in Strasbourg and Kehl in April 2009. The report was adopted by 293 votes in favour, 283 against and 60 abstentions.
'Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean' contributes towards peace and prosperity
Opening up the 'Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean' to countries not involved in the partnership "increases the likelihood of establishing parity in relations between the EU and the Mediterranean partner countries and of tackling the problems of the region in a comprehensive way". So says the European Parliament in a report adapted with 521 votes in favour, 44 against and 13 abstentions.
Review of the European Neighbourhood Policy Instrument
Parliament adopted an own-initiative report drafted on the review of the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI). Members call on the Commission, together with the partner governments, to develop further mechanisms for consultation with civil society and local authorities, in order better to involve them in the design and monitoring of the implementation of the ENPI and of the national reform programmes.
MEPs adopt legislative resolution on crackdown on employers of illegal immigrants
Parliament adopted the legislative resolution on the crackdown on employers of illegal immigrants, following the vote on the amendments in Strasbourg on 4 February. Between 4.5 and 8 million illegal immigrants work in the construction, farming, hotel and other sectors in the EU. One of the factors encouraging illegal immigration into the EU is the possibility of finding work. This legislation aims to reduce that pull factor by targeting the employment of third-country nationals who are illegally staying in the EU.
Extraordinary renditions: EU Member states are also responsible, MEPs say
As recent developments confirm that EU governments have been involved in extraordinary renditions, EU Member states bear a share of moral responsibility for detentions in Guantánamo, the European Parliament says in a resolution adopted with 334 votes in favour, 247 against and 86 abstentions. The resolution makes reference to statements by the British government on the matter. The text was tabled by the PES, ALDE, Greens/EFA and GUE/NGL groups.The resolution recalls the statements by the UK Foreign Secretary on two US extraordinary rendition flights carrying two prisoners that landed on UK territory in 2002 and the compiling of a list of suspect flights that would be sent to US authorities to request specific assurances that they had not been used for rendition, as well as the statements by the Prime Minister in this regard; the referral by the UK Home Secretary to the Attorney General of the question of possible 'criminal wrongdoing' by MI5 and the CIA in relation to Binyam Mohamed's treatment.
Reduce VAT on restaurants, audio books and local services say MEPs
Member States should be allowed to reduce VAT rates on a new series of goods and services, such as restaurants, children's car seats, audio books and beauty treatments – and other locally supplied services if there is no distortion of competition in the EU Internal Market, say MEPs. The report was adopted with 636 votes in favour, 14 against and 18 abstentions. This measure will have positive effects in terms of job creation and the fight against the underground economy.
A social economy "would reduce speculation in financial markets"
Businesses which focus on people rather than capital play an essential role in the European economy and could help regulate financial markets, says the European Parliament. But, the House warns, this "social economy" sector "remains little-known and is often the target of criticism stemming from misguided technical approaches". The report was adopted with 580 votes in favour, 27 against and 44 abstentions.
Adopt framework on informing and consulting employees or face consequences
Noting that a significant number of Member States have yet to fully adopt a framework for informing and consulting employees, the European Parliament is urging those countries to do so "as soon as possible" or face possible infringement proceedings. The report was adopted with 598 votes in favour, 21 against and 32 abstentions.
Awareness of mental health in the EU
One in four people experience mental health problems at least once in their lives, and many more are indirectly affected. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is calling on Member States to develop awareness-raising campaigns, to combat stigma and social exclusion and to improve mental health legislation. The report was adopted with 616 votes in favour, 24 against and 12 votes abstentions. In its report, drafted by Evangelia TZAMPAZI (PES, EL), Member States are called on to draw up "up-to-date mental health legislation, which is in line with international obligations as regards human rights … and which codifies and enshrines the basic principles, values and objectives of mental health policy".
European Parliament calls for action to eliminate whaling
Almost one in four cetacean (whale, dolphin and porpoise) species are currently regarded as under threat, with nine species listed as either endangered or critically endangered, and the status of others remains unclear. According to the report drawn up by Elspeth ATTWOOLL (ALDE, UK), although some whale populations have recovered somewhat since the introduction of the moratorium in 1986, others have not and their ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions remains unknown. MEPs are arguing for the elimination of lethal whaling for scientific purposes and the maintenance of the global moratorium on commercial whaling. In a non-binding report, MEPs call for the EU to work towards obtaining a "universal agreement" on whaling. The report was adopted with 626 votes in favour, 12 against and 19 abstentions.
Need for responsible, high-quality fisheries research
In a report on applied research relating to the Common Fisheries Policy, the European Parliament calls on the Commission to review the 7th framework programme when the mid-term evaluation is carried out, scheduled for 2010, paying greater attention to the specific problems of fisheries and aquaculture. The report was adopted with 616 votes in favour, 18 against and 24 abstentions. Parliament is convinced that both policy-makers and operators in the fisheries sector have a "crucial need for a more practical type of research" and, given the duration of the 7th framework programme, "it is imperative to include the objectives to be achieved".
North-East Atlantic Fisheries
The European Parliament adopted a non-binding report giving green light to the amendment of the Convention on future multilateral co-operation in the North-East Atlantic Fisheries (NEAFC). The proposal aims to transpose into Community law the amendments to the Convention adopted by the NEAFC at its 23rd annual meeting in November 2004, allowing it to adopt recommendations establishing procedures for the settlement of disputes arising from the Convention.
MEPs promote a strong and effective foreign, security and defence policy
MEPs point out that the European Union needs to develop its strategic autonomy. This strategic autonomy will help the EU to promote peace and international security, to defend its interests in the world, to protect the security of its own citizens, to contribute to effective multilateralism, to advance respect for human rights and democratic values worldwide and to safeguard world peace. The report was adopted with 482 votes in favour, 111 against with 55 abstentions.
A special place for children in EU
The European Parliament adopted a report by Glenys KINNOCK (PES; UK), welcoming the Commission's Communication on “A Special Place for Children in EU External Action” and the accompanying Council Conclusions as "important steps forward towards an EU strategy on the Rights of the Child", but underlines that "much remains to be done to put the political commitments into practice".
Follow-up of the energy efficiency national action plans
Member States' failure to submit national energy efficiency plans highlights deficiencies that might "endanger the attainment of the EU's efficiency and climate protection objectives", says the European Parliament in a report adopted with 616 votes in favour, 24 against and 17 abstentions. According to the report, the European Union wastes more than 20 % of its energy due to inefficiency and, if the saving objective of 20 % were met, the EU would use about 400 Mtoe (million tonnes of oil equivalent) less primary energy and the CO2 emissions reduction would be about 860Mt.
European professional card for service providers
Parliament adopted an own-initiative report on the creation of a European professional card for service providers. The report stresses that greater mobility of persons and services between Member States and between regions is an essential element in achieving the Lisbon agenda for growth and jobs. The House adopted the report with 607 votes in favour, 21 against and 27 abstentions. 20090218BRI49890 Texts adopted 18-19 February 2009 Verbatim debates (18-19 February) Draft agenda 9-12 March 2009 (Strasbourg plenary)

Opening of the Brussels plenary session: Pöttering on Polish engineer in Pakistan, bushfires in Australia, Baha'i in Iran and expulsion of Spanish MEP from Venezuela
2009-02-20 - 13:08
At the opening of the plenary session in Brussels, EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering made four statements: 1) on the killing of Piotr Stańczak, a Polish engineer by terrorists in Pakistan, 2) on the tragic bushfires in southern Australia 3) on members of the Baha'i religion in Iran and 4) on the expulsion of Spanish MEP Luis Herrero from Venezuela. Polish engineer killed in Pakistan
EP President Pöttering conveyed, on behalf of the European Parliament, sent his "most sincere condolences and deepest sympathy" to the family and friends of Mr Piotr Stańczak, who was murdered two weeks ago after five months of being held hostage by terrorists in Pakistan. Mr Stańczak, a Polish engineer, was kidnapped in September 2008.
"I strongly condemn this barbaric act on an innocent Polish and European Union citizen. This is a crime that cannot be tolerated under any circumstances", said President Pöttering.
"Terrorism represents today one of the greatest dangers to security, stability and democratic values of the international community, for our way of life. Fighting terrorism must remain an essential and key political priority for the international community. It is a global problem and a challenge for everyone. We must use all the resources that the rule of law places at our disposal to defeat terrorism together once and for all," he added.
President Pöttering saluted Mr Stańczak in Polish and MEPs observed a minute of silence in tribute.
Bushfires in Australia
EP President Pöttering paid tribute to those who lost their lives "in an appalling manner" to the bushfires in Australia. "On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to express solidarity with Australia, its people and its authorities at this time of sorrow," he said. Next week, a delegation of MEPs will visit Australia and will be "able to express our condolences in person," he added. Giles Chichester (EPP-ED, UK) Chairman of the EP-Australia New Zealand delegation shared the President's views and said that he looked forward to delivering them in person.
Members of the Baha'i faith in Iran
President Pöttering on behalf of the European Parliament denounced the detention of seven leaders of the Baha'i faith by Iranian authorities, which, according to alarming reports, "does not respect the requirements of the rule of law". Members of the Baha'i faith have been kept under detention for eight months, Nobel Peace laureate Shirin Ebadi, the lawyer who was to defend them, has received death threats. President Pöttering called on the Iranian authorities to again respect human rights and to release the prisoner without delay.
Expulsion of Spanish MEP Luis Herrero
To conclude, the President strongly protested and condemned the arrest and expulsion on Friday 13 February 2009 of Luis Herrero-Tejedor, member of the EPP-ED group, who had been officially invited to Venezuela by the opposition party.
Changes to the agenda
The report by Herbert REUL (EPP-ED, DE) on facing challenges in relation to oil supply report was postponed after a request from Mr Reul to send it back to the Industry and Energy Committee.
The Jonathan EVANS (EPP-ED, UK) report on competition Policy 2006 and 2007 was postponed to the next plenary session. Briefing - 18-19 February 2009 Final draft agenda EuroparlTV

Czech President Václav Klaus questions ever closer European political integration in speech to the European Parliament
2009-02-20 - 13:08
The Lisbon Treaty would worsen the EU's democratic deficit, argued Czech President Klaus in a speech to the EP, in which he questioned the role of the EP itself. EP President Pöttering responded by describing Mr Klaus's views as "an expression of the diversity in Europe" and pointed out that "in a democracy it's the view of the majority that counts". Without the EP, Europe would be in the hands of bureaucrats, he cautioned. A wide majority of MEPs strongly welcomed Mr Pöttering's response. President Klaus, addressing a formal sitting of the House in Brussels in his role as head of state of the country holding the EU's six-month rotating presidency, chose to speak on what he called "issues of extraordinary importance for the further development of the European integration project". The Czech Republic, he said, knew full well that when it joined the EU "it was not a utopian construction, put together without authentic human interests, visions, views and ideas". He added "for us there was and there is no alternative to European Union membership". "We have therefore been really hurt by the repeated and growing attacks we have been facing; attacks based on the unfounded assumption that the Czechs are searching for some other integration project than the one they became members of five years ago. This is not true". The key tasks of European integration, said the Czech president, were "to remove unnecessary - and for human freedom and prosperity counterproductive - barriers to the free movement of people, goods, services, ideas…" and "a joint care of public goods at continental level". Decision-making in Brussels not always best, says Czech President However, he then questioned whether decision-making in Brussels was always the best way to achieve these goals, and asked MEPs "are you really convinced that every time you take a vote, you are deciding something that must be decided here in this Chamber and not closer to the citizens, i.e. inside the individual European states?". Developing his theme, Mr Klaus explained that while there was no alternative to EU membership, "the methods and forms of European integration do, on the contrary, have quite a number of possible and legitimate variants". Moreover, "claiming that the status quo, the present institutional form of the EU, is forever uncriticisable dogma, is a mistake", as is the assumption that "there is only one possible and correct future for European integration, which is 'ever-closer Union'". Any given institutional arrangement should be seen merely as a means to the ends of "human freedom and an economic system that brings prosperity", with a market economy being the key tool for achieving this. No real opposition in the European Parliament, says Klaus The Czech President argued that "the present decision-making system in the European Union is different from a classic parliamentary democracy, tried and tested by history. In a normal parliamentary system, part of the MPs support the government and part support the opposition. In the European Parliament this arrangement has been missing. Here only one single option is being promoted and those who dare think about a different option are labelled enemies of European integration." In addition, he continued, there is "a great distance (not only in a geographical sense) between citizens and Union representatives, which is much greater than inside the Member countries. This distance is often described as the democratic deficit, the loss of democratic accountability" and in Mr Klaus' view, "the proposals to change the current state of affairs - included in the rejected European Constitution or in the not very different Lisbon Treaty - would make this defect even worse". Warming to his theme, the president maintained "Since there is no European demos - and no European nation - this defect cannot be solved by strengthening the role of the European Parliament either". (Note: At this point a number of MEPs walked out of the Chamber) Mr Klaus believed that "attempts to speed up and deepen integration" could "endanger all the positive things achieved in Europe in the last half a century" and he urged that the situation must not be allowed "where the citizens of Member countries would live their lives with a resigned feeling that the EU is not their own, that it is developing differently than they would wish, that they are only forced to accept it". Priority to the market economy Turning to economic aspects, he argued that "the present economic system of the EU is a system of a suppressed market, a system of a permanently strengthening centrally controlled economy" and called instead for "liberalisation and deregulation of the European economy". Free debate the best way to solve disagreement Concluding the Czech President told the House "I say all of this because I do feel a strong responsibility for the democratic and prosperous future of Europe", adding "the most important task is to make sure that free discussion about these problems is not silenced as an attack on the very idea of European integration". EP President responds In his introduction, Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering had described the Czech nation as being historically "the beating heart of European thinking". He highlighted the approval of the Lisbon Treaty, by a large majority, in the Lower House of the Czech Parliament earlier this week and he also praised Mr Klaus as an "advocate of a free, effective market economy". After Mr Klaus had delivered his speech, Mr Pöttering responded by saying that Mr Klaus was only able to speak in this way because "we live in European democracy where everyone can express his or her own opinion. In a " Parliament of the past" you wouldn't have been able to give this speech". He thanked the Czech president for his visit, describing it as "an expression of the diversity in Europe" but pointed out that "in a democracy it's the view of the majority that counts". audio 25:34 - President Vaclav Klaus President Klaus's speech in pdf format (EN)

Gaza: increased humanitarian aid, end of the blockade and damage assessment needed
2009-02-20 - 13:08
In a joint resolution adopted by 488 votes in favour 5 against and 19 abstentions, MEPs call for a damage assessment in Gaza and an in-depth evaluation of the needs of the Gaza population. This evaluation could serve as a basis for reconstruction plans. MEPs call for increased humanitarian aid and for an end to the blockade of the Gaza Strip, the immediate and sustainable reopening of the crossing points, and the prevention of smuggling of and illicit trafficking in arms and ammunition. MEPs recognise the sufferings of the Palestinian population in the Gaza Strip and call for increased humanitarian aid to them. Parliament once again calls for an end to the blockade of the Gaza Strip, in compliance with the Agreement on Movement and Access of November 2005, and for the immediate reopening of the crossing points for people and goods. Damage assessment and reconstruction of the Gaza Strip The resolution calls for a detailed damage assessment in the Gaza Strip and an in-depth evaluation of the needs of the Gaza population which can serve as a basis for reconstruction plans. The financial, economic and social rehabilitation of the Gaza Strip is an essential element of security in the region. Aid should include payments in cash to pay salaries, pensions and allowances for the most vulnerable people and families. Parliament calls on the Commission to draw up an evaluation of prospects for reconstruction projects in the Gaza Strip financed by the European Union within the framework of PEGASE and ECHO and their budgetary implications. MEPs stress that the European Union's financial support to the Palestinians should not be undermined by continuous destruction, which is diminishing support for reconstruction projects in European public opinion. International donor's conference In view of the International Conference in support of the Palestinian Economy for the Reconstruction of Gaza to be held in Sharm El Sheikh on 2 March 2009, MEPs believe that any sustainable reconstruction and development policy in the Gaza Strip needs a durable cease-fire. The resumption of "serious" peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians together with a Palestinian national reconciliation process is also needed, says the resolution. Parliament urges other donors to make pledges at the forthcoming donors’ conference and to commit to the pledges they made at the last donors’ conference in Paris in December 2007. Debate preceding the vote on the resolution - Wednesday 18 February 2009 Conflict resolution and multilateralism crucial, says Javier Solana In his speech to the House, Mr Solana singled out conflict resolution and a multilateral approach as the keys to a peace settlement in the Middle East. He described the humanitarian situation in Gaza as "heartbreaking" and said an urgent solution was needed to reduce the suffering of the people there. "The parameters for a solution are known", he said. What was needed now was "the political will". America and Europe can work together Europe maintained its commitment to a viable Palestinian state, living side-by-side with Israel, and would give firm backing to all who wanted a peaceful solution. Moreover, "the conditions for America and Europe to work together for peace in the Middle East are probably better than ever", said the High Representative, who has recently returned from a visit to Washington. Post-election Israel, Palestinian reconciliation Turning to the parties to the conflict, Mr Solana said that following the recent Israeli elections, "we hope the new prime minister and government will be solid interlocutors for peace talks". At the same time, "the Palestinians must get their house in order" and he described intra-Palestinian reconciliation as the "key to peace, stability and development". A multilateral approach needed The EU was prepared to assist, as always, and Mr Solana also praised the work of UNRWA. But, he stressed, "it is clear that no single country, no single organisation can tackle the conflicts alone". What was needed was "multilateral solutions", including a role for the Quartet, which he noted the USA administration was committed to. Border crossings must be opened Looking to the longer term, the High Representative said the occupied territories would have to be part of a Palestinian state and for this purpose "Gaza must become economically and politically viable". He issued a call for the border crossings to be opened for humanitarian assistance as well as the transit of people and goods. Other regional actors Peace in the Middle East requires a united Arab world, emphasised Mr Solana, and he saw the upcoming Arab summit as crucial. He had earlier described the Arab Peace Initiative as crucial to progress. The Iranian elections would be important too, and he stressed the need for "trust" between Iran the west. Need for focus on conflict resolution Concluding, the High Representative said that in the year 2009 we are "at a crossroads", the choice being between continuing with the same policies and getting the same results or working "with synergy and determination" and adjusting policies. Above all, there must be a focus on "conflict resolution" as this was "the only way to end the cycle of death and destruction". European Commission "This is a moment of transition for the Middle East" said External relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner , pointing out that Israel would soon have a new government, and that the new US government was now defining its foreign policy priorities. "Changing dynamics such as these can create opportunities", she said, hoping that a transition would soon be under way in the Israeli occupied territories, too. The Gaza conflict has left the peace process "particularly fragile" - this is "not where we wanted to be", but "if there is to be peace, then we must all do all we can to get talks back on track", she said. "We must make it clear to all Israeli leaders that we expect sustained commitment to a solution", she continued, also stressing the need to agree a joint way forward with the US administration, back the diplomatic efforts of neighbouring countries, and "step up engagement with the Arab League". Political group speakers "Gaza gets worse every day" said Joseph DAUL (FR) for the EPP-ED group. The Israeli embargo means that all aid has to run a military gauntlet, and hospitals cannot cope, despite the fact that "EU support has done much to help". "We cannot tolerate aid being taken hostage" he continued, condemning the confiscation by Hamas of an aid shipment as "disgraceful". Economic and social reconstruction are essential to stability, and there can be "no more reconstruction without a lasting ceasefire", said Mr Daul, adding that "Hamas must take the first step, by ceasing to launch missiles". "We must open all diplomatic channels" to restart negotiations, he concluded, stressing the important role to be played by Egypt and the Arab League. The message must be that there is no violent solution, no military solution, and no solution to be had through terrorist violence. Violence simply breeds more violence", said Martin SCHULZ (DE) for the Socialist group. "Dialogue is vital, but insecurity makes it extremely difficult" he said. The arrival of a new US foreign policy team, focused on dialogue and co-operation, offers "a glimmer of hope", but "look at Jerusalem - Netanyahu is a risk for the peace process", he added. "Whether Hezbollah can be integrated depends on who's in charge in Tehran", said Mr Schulz, stressing that the outcome of Iran's election would determine whether its government and president are radical, or prepared to talk. "We favour a unity government for Palestinians, but can Hamas go for this?" he asked, stressing that "somebody had to talk to Hamas" and that those who are prepared to do so deserve support. Further Israeli settlement-building in the occupied territories will "destabilise" the peace process, because in the Middle East, "everything hangs together". Arabs who are prepared to renounce violence and recognise Israel need support - "bombing them won't help", and neither will bombing EU-funded infrastructure projects, he concluded. Graham WATSON (ALDE, UK) said that while it is our "moral obligation" to assist, we need a new, positive approach with or without the US. The EU must take the lead, he said, yet the Council, Commission and Czech Presidency have not said what their response will be to the turn in events. Yes, we can use the Quartet but, he recalled, seven years of extremism took place under its watch and its envoy Tony Blair hasn't even been to Gaza. Brian CROWLEY (UEN, IE) noted that "it is not a negotiation of equals. There is strength on one side, weakness and division on the other side". Secondly, he said, it is not an equal participation of outside influences or outside media coverage (…), and thirdly, most importantly, it is the same innocent people who are continuing to suffer. Aid, assistance and insisting on talks all require "a strategic, brave move from Europe", he concluded. Jill EVANS (Greens/ EFA, UK), who was a member of the delegation that visited Gaza last week, stressed that "we have to put pressure on Israel to end the blockade and open the crossings, and any assessment of the damage caused in Gaza must draw attention to the deliberate targeting to destroy the infrastructure and economy". Francis WURTZ (GUE/NGL, FR) said that he was not proud of Europe and the lack of political courage and vision on the Gaza conflict. Israeli leaders were acting inhumanely undermining basic human values and rights. "We have to say enough is enough to Israel", he said. The acts of the Israeli army and government had not strengthened the Israeli peace camp. The Palestinians and Arafat had recognised Israel for over 20 years but with nothing in return. The Arab League has a peace proposal on the table since 2002 which had been widely ignored. Kathy SINNOTT (IND/DEM, IE) stressed that she spoke not on behalf of her group, which did not have a position in this debate, but for herself and her people. She stressed above all the need for humanitarian to get through as the "recent aggression" had left the people of Gaza "desperate". In addition, she criticised the EU for not imposing trade sanctions on Israel, saying this showed it was prepared to do "business as usual". Lastly, she underlined the plight of the "thousands of people, especially children, who have been disabled for life" following the attacks with "particularly vicious weaponry" in January. She also believed evidence should be gathered of targeted attacks with a possible view to bringing war crimes charges. Jean-Marie Le PEN (NA, FR) said Europe could scarcely play a mediating role in this conflict. He argued that "burden-sharing" in this case seemed to consist of "the Americans and Israelis blowing things up and the Europeans financing the reconstruction". He saw Israeli party leaders Avigdor Lieberman and Binyamin Netanyahu as opponents of peace and criticised the continued expansion of Jewish settlements. However, he then argued that there were "hawks on both sides" and wondered if they would ever sit down together.

EU-NATO relations: MEPs call for strengthened cooperation

MEPs say that the EU and NATO could strengthen each other by avoiding competition and developing greater cooperation in crisis management operations. The report supports the establishment of a permanent EU Operational Headquarters. The first report of the European Parliament on NATO comes a few months ahead of the Alliance's 60th anniversary Summit to be held in Strasbourg and Kehl in April 2009. The report was adopted by 293 votes in favour, 283 against and 60 abstentions. The report recognises the important role of NATO in the security architecture of the Europe and takes the view that the future collective defence of the EU should as far as possible be organised in cooperation with NATO. Following the election of the new President of the United States, there is a growing consensus on both sides of the Atlantic about the decreasing usefulness of nuclear weapons in the face of current threats and a new sense of urgency about the need to decrease the size of nuclear arsenals . New security risks such as international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), failed States, intractable conflicts, organised crime, cyberthreats and environmental deterioration require closer partnership and concentration on strengthening the core capabilities of the EU and NATO, and closer coordination in the areas of planning, technology, equipment and training. MEPs are of the view that the EU and NATO could strengthen each other by avoiding competition and developing greater cooperation in crisis management operations. MEPs support the proposal of the French government for the establishment of systematic contact between the secretaries-general of NATO and the EU Council, in particular so as to avoid confusion where the EU and NATO operate side by side, as in Kosovo and Afghanistan. The resolution notes that the “Berlin plus” arrangements, which allow the EU to have recourse to NATO assets and capabilities, need to be improved in order to allow the two organisations to intervene and effectively deliver relief in current crises MEPs believe in the further need for the EU and NATO to develop a comprehensive approach to crisis management. The resolution calls on the EU to continue deploying missions while ensuring greater sustainability of European Security and Defence Policy so as to prevent conflicts and promote stability. The report supports the establishment of a permanent EU Operational Headquarters, under the authority of the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative. The mandate of this Headquarter would be to plan and conduct ESDP military operations. Compatibility between NATO and EU Memberships Out of the 27 EU Member States, 6 are not members of the Alliance (Austria, Cyprus, Finland, Ireland, Malta and Sweden). MEPs insist that all the EU Member States must be present at the joint EU-NATO meetings without discrimination. The resolution also proposes that candidate countries that are NATO Allies should be more involved in the work of the ESDP and the European Defence Agency. The resolution deplores the fact that the Turkish-Cypriot dispute continues to badly impair the development of EU-NATO cooperation, given that, on the one hand, Turkey refuses to allow Cyprus to participate in ESDP missions involving NATO intelligence and resources and that, on the other hand, in response, Cyprus refuses to allow Turkey to engage in the overall development of ESDP to an extent commensurate with Turkey's military weight and strategic importance to Europe and transatlantic alliance. MEPs encourage Cyprus to review its political position on its membership of the Partnership for Peace and also calls on NATO member states to refrain from using their veto to prevent EU Member States from becoming members of NATO. Relations with Russia On relations with Russia, MEPs consider that the EU and NATO must maintain a realistic and frank dialogue with this country Russia, including the prospect of Russia's membership in all Euro-Atlantic structures if and when Russia becomes a genuine democracy and refuses military threat as political pressure on its neighbours. Burden sharing Parliament is of the view that, in addition to the need for the much more efficient use of military resources, a better and more efficient coordination of investments in defence, in the interest of synergy, by EU Member States is essential in the interests of European security. The House calls for a significant increase in the proportion of common costs in every NATO and EU military operation; notes the significant difference in scale as well as effectiveness between the defence spending of European members of NATO, on the one hand, and the USA, on the other and calls on the EU to commit itself to fairer global burden-sharing. Parliament also calls on the USA to show a greater willingness to consult its European allies on issues related to peace and security. Text adopted (click on 19 February)

'Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean' contributes towards peace and prosperity
2009-02-20 - 13:08
Opening up the 'Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean' to countries not involved in the partnership "increases the likelihood of establishing parity in relations between the EU and the Mediterranean partner countries and of tackling the problems of the region in a comprehensive way". So says the European Parliament in a report adapted with 521 votes in favour, 44 against and 13 abstentions. Provided that the proposal entitled 'Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean' adopted by Heads of State and Government on 13 July, 2008 "delivers its promises and yields concrete and visible results", it contributes towards peace and prosperity and constitutes "a step towards economic and regional integration as well as ecological and climatic co-operation between the Mediterranean countries", the report states. The report also welcomes the decision of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Union for the Mediterranean to include the League of Arab States as a participant at all meetings at all levels, considering its positive contribution to the goals of peace, prosperity and stability in the Mediterranean region. New name proposed: 'Union for the Mediterranean' Parliament is of the view that changing the name to 'Union for the Mediterranean' - a change proposed at a meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs held in Marseilles on 3-4 November, 2008 - would help to highlight the joint nature of the partnership, but considers it necessary that the strategic value of Euro Mediterranean relations and the Barcelona Process acquis, including the involvement of civil society, be reaffirmed. The report calls for the Secretariat to be brought into operation as a matter of urgency, in order to prove that it is possible to overcome current tensions by promoting real and concrete projects of mutual cooperation. Accession prospects not affected The report stresses that participation in the Union for the Mediterranean does not constitute an alternative to enlargement of the EU and does not affect the accession prospects of any current or future candidate state and considers that the Union for the Mediterranean will not hamper other regional cooperation initiatives. The House also calls on the Council and the Commission to ensure that all member countries of the Union for the Mediterranean are able to access the regional programmes already provided for under the Euro Mediterranean partnership, pointing to the importance of extending the scope of Community programmes to include participation by partner countries, not least in the fields of education, research and professional training (student exchanges, etc.). Leadership role of EU in conflict resolution Parliament believes that the EU must assume the role of leadership in the resolution of conflicts in the region by winning the confidence of all parties involved. It is hoped that the strengthening of Euro Mediterranean relations will provide a "boost to the development of an area of peace and prosperity". Funding The report points out that the projects financed within the framework of the Union for the Mediterranean should be supported by funding from the Community, from partner states and from private financing. It calls on the Council and Commission to specify the role and strengthen the initiatives of the Facility for Euro Mediterranean Investment and Partnership (FEMIP) which, through its investment programme, is facilitating the economic opening up and modernisation of the Mediterranean countries. It also reiterates its support for the creation of a Euro Mediterranean Investment Bank and coordination with international investors and emphasises the importance of the remittance of savings by emigrants from the Southern Mediterranean countries to their countries of origin, considering this to be "a tremendous and as yet insufficiently used lever for development".

Review of the European Neighbourhood Policy Instrument
2009-02-20 - 13:08
Parliament adopted an own-initiative report drafted on the review of the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI). Members call on the Commission, together with the partner governments, to develop further mechanisms for consultation with civil society and local authorities, in order better to involve them in the design and monitoring of the implementation of the ENPI and of the national reform programmes. The report states that sectoral and general budget support under the ENPI should be made available only to governments which are able to implement it in a transparent and accountable manner and where it constitutes a real incentive. The Commission is asked to review the appropriateness of budget support in countries which have problems with budgetary management and control procedures and high levels of corruption. Furthermore, there should be a country-specific approach with regard to political conditionality, designed inter alia to promote democracy, the rule of law and good governance, respect for human rights and minority rights and the independence of the judiciary. MEPs underline the need to increase the ENPI financial envelope in order to enable the ENP to attain its increasingly ambitious objectives. They go on to recall that, during the negotiations on the ENPI's legal basis, Parliament had legitimate concerns over how the medium and short-term strategy papers and country papers, often containing indicative financial amounts, would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. They call for an evaluation of how these indicative financial commitments have been implemented during the past two years. The committee is concerned about the high level of requested budgetary transfers, which already amount to a cumulative increase of EUR 410 million in commitments and EUR 635 million in payments for the years 2007 and 2008. Country and region-specific remarks: the committee notes the progress made under the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM initiative), but stresses that: the ENPI financing of the ENP initiative for the South or East should not be used to the detriment of each other; Parliament should be adequately informed of the UfM projects funded from the ENPI; when ENPI funds are used, the transparency of other sources, including private funding, is particularly important. The report also makes the following points: the Mediterranean component of the ENP should complement the Barcelona Process, and the ENP's objectives need to be more clearly defined in order to strengthen the Barcelona Process by favouring a multilateral regional approach; there should be enhanced EU involvement in the Black Sea region and an ambitious Eastern Partnership. The committee stresses the need to accelerate the establishment of a free-trade zone in relation to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ukraine and Moldova in particular, as soon as partner countries are ready; an Eastern Neighbourhood assembly ("Euroeast"), with the participation of the European Parliament, should be created on the same lines as the Euromed and EuroLat assemblies with a view to implementing the ENPI in the countries of eastern Europe, namely Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine and Belarus. calls for enhanced cooperation with Turkey in the Black Sea, given its strategic importance and the future role it could play in the common foreign and security policy, as well as with Russia, emphasising the need for the full involvement of those countries in the resolution of regional conflicts and in the promotion of peace and stability in the European neighbourhood; takes the view that several projects of common interest could be implemented within this framework. Financial envelope Finally, MEPs underline the need to increase the ENPI financial envelope in order to enable the ENP to attain its increasingly ambitious objectives and to support its new regional initiatives; asks that, when this occurs, the Mediterranean countries and the countries of eastern Europe can both benefit Adopted text (click on 19 February)

Immigration
MEPs adopt legislative resolution on crackdown on employers of illegal immigrants
2009-02-20 - 13:08
Parliament adopted the legislative resolution on the crackdown on employers of illegal immigrants, following the vote on the amendments in Strasbourg on 4 February. At the time, MEPs decided to postpone the final vote at the request of the rapporteur Claudio FAVA (PES, IT) to allow the addition of a declaration providing reassurance that this directive will not prevent further legislation on subcontractors. Criminalising the employer, not the migrant Between 4.5 and 8 million illegal immigrants work in the construction, farming, hotel and other sectors in the EU. One of the factors encouraging illegal immigration into the EU is the possibility of finding work. This legislation aims to reduce that pull factor by targeting the employment of third-country nationals who are illegally staying in the EU. The Commission’s draft legislation is supposed to complement other measures, such as the “return directive” and the “blue card” directive, the overall aim being to combat illegal immigration more firmly while encouraging legal immigration. The “sanctions directive" would introduce minimum penalties at European level against employers of illegal immigrants. Employers could be fined, forced to pay wages in arrears at legal levels or even banned for up to five years from bidding for public sector contracts or from receiving state aid – whether national or European. Criminal law penalties in the most serious cases The directive would also lay down criminal law penalties against employers for repeat offences, where a large number of people in an irregular situation are employed, where the working conditions are exploitative, where the employee is a victim of human trafficking and this is known to the employer, or if the employee is a minor. Automatic recovery of unpaid wages An employer who is found guilty must also refund any state aid received the previous year and pay a graduated fine according to the number of illegal immigrants employed. In addition, he must pay a sum equal to the amount of taxes and other levies he would have paid if the worker had been employed legally and, where applicable, the cost of returning the migrant. The employment relationship will be assumed to have lasted at least three months unless the employer or worker supplies proof to the contrary. MEPs demanded that the procedures necessary for the employee to recover the unpaid wages must be automatic, without any need for the employee to take action. MEPs successfully argued that Member States should establish lower financial penalties for people using clandestine immigrants as domestic staff, provided the working conditions are not exploitative. Grievance procedure Parliament also wants Member States to set up mechanisms to enable illegal immigrants to lodge complaints. Third parties designated by Member States, such as voluntary bodies or trade unions, should be allowed to report a guilty employer without running the risk of being subsequently taken to court for assisting someone to stay in the country illegally. Irregular immigrants will, if they cooperate with the legal action against their employer, be able to get a temporary residence permit. Firms that use subcontractors to be liable If the guilty employer is a subcontractor, the contracting firm must also be held liable, and even fully liable if it turns out that the contracting employer knew the subcontractor was acting illegally. A list of employers who have infringed the directive may be made public – another successful demand by MEPs. Effective and sufficient inspections The Member States are asked to conduct effective inspections sufficiently frequently to check on the employment of non-EU nationals in an irregular situation. They must also require employers to check that their non-EU employees have a valid residence permit and inform a national authority of any new recruitment of non-EU nationals. UK not opting-in The UK government supports the general purpose of the draft directive as part of the wider fight against illegal immigration. Nevertheless, it has a number of concerns and has not opted-in to this directive. The UK government believes there is no legal basis or Community competence for criminal sanctions in this directive, nor would we support measures which could create a pull factor for illegal immigrants (e.g: back payments, facilitation of complaints procedures and any associated delays in returning illegal migrants Text adopted on 4 February 2009 Parliament votes on "sanctions directive" - background note Briefing article + related links audio, 04:21 - Rapporteur Claudio Fava audio, 04:09 - Commissioner Jacques Barrot audio 20:07 - Political group speakers

Justice and home affairs
Extraordinary renditions: EU Member states are also responsible, MEPs say
2009-02-20 - 13:08
As recent developments confirm that EU governments have been involved in extraordinary renditions, EU Member states bear a share of moral responsibility for detentions in Guantánamo, the European Parliament says in a resolution adopted with 334 votes in favour, 247 against and 86 abstentions. The resolution makes reference to statements by the British government on the matter. The text was tabled by the PES, ALDE, Greens/EFA and GUE/NGL groups. British government The resolution recalls the statements by the UK Foreign Secretary on two US extraordinary rendition flights carrying two prisoners that landed on UK territory in 2002 and the compiling of a list of suspect flights that would be sent to US authorities to request specific assurances that they had not been used for rendition, as well as the statements by the Prime Minister in this regard; the referral by the UK Home Secretary to the Attorney General of the question of possible 'criminal wrongdoing' by MI5 and the CIA in relation to Binyam Mohamed's treatment. The resolution also recalls the High Court's ruling of 5 February 2009 that it was unable to order the disclosure of information about the alleged torture of Binyam Mohamed because the UK Foreign Secretary asserted that the UK was threatened by the US with the blocking of intelligence-sharing about terrorism, and the legal challenge to the ruling based on doubts about the veracity of that assertion. Lack of action by Member states MEPs underline that "subsequent events have confirmed that several EU Member states had been involved in, or had cooperated actively or passively with the US authorities" in illegal activities "as proven by some recently disclosed information concerning governments' authorisations of US requests for over-flight and by government information on secret prisons". Thus, "EU Member states bear a particular share of political, moral and legal responsibility for the transportation and detention of those imprisoned in Guantánamo and in secret detention facilities". Members denounce the lack of action taken so far by Member States and the Council to shed light on the extraordinary renditions programme and to implement Parliament's recommendations. They deplore the lack of satisfactory answers given by the Council to Parliament during the plenary debate on 3 February. They call on the EU institutions and Member States to fully implement the recommendations made by Parliament in its 2007 report and to assist in ascertaining the truth by opening inquiries or collaborating with the competent bodies. Responsibility for secret detention centres, including Guantánamo, and the extraordinary rendition programme should be established. Members say those kidnapped in some Member states under the extraordinary rendition programme have been flown to Guantánamo of to other states by the US authorities on military or CIA flights, which have often flown over EU territory and in some cases have also made stopovers in certain EU member states. Those taken to third countries have undergone torture in local prisons, they say. Officials of some Member states have had access to prisoners in Guantánamo or in other detention centres and interrogated them, thus legitimating the existence of these facilities. Among developments which took place since the adoption of the EP temporary committee report drafted by Claudio Fava (PSE, IT) in February 2007, Members remind of decisions and statements by officials or press information on the UK, Poland, and Spain, confirming that EU Member states have been involved in extraordinary renditions. MEPs note that state secrecy requirements have been imposed, in some Member states, on information relevant to the inquiries into rendition, as in Italy with the Abu Omar case or on the alleged torture of UK-resident Binyam Mohamed because of threats by the US to block intelligence-sharing about terrorism with the UK. President Obama's executive orders "a big step forward", but ambiguities persist Although Members welcome the executive orders by US President Barack Obama (closing the Guantánamo detention centre, halting the proceedings of military commissions and ending the use of torture and shutting secret prisons abroad), as "a big step forward", they "do not seem to fully address the issues of secret detention and abduction or the of the use of torture", they say, as "some ambiguities persist as to the limited maintenance of rendition schemes and of secret detention facilities". They also recall that extraordinary renditions and secret detention are contrary to international human rights law, the UN convention against torture, the European convention on Human rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights. On 18 January 2006, The European Parliament set a temporary committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners, chaired by MEP Carlos Coelho (EPP-ED, PT).

Taxation
Reduce VAT on restaurants, audio books and local services say MEPs
2009-02-20 - 13:08
Member States should be allowed to reduce VAT rates on a new series of goods and services, such as restaurants, children's car seats, audio books and beauty treatments – and other locally supplied services if there is no distortion of competition in the EU Internal Market, say MEPs. The report was adopted with 636 votes in favour, 14 against and 18 abstentions. According to Members, this measure can have positive effects in terms of job creation and the fight against the underground economy. The report, drafted by Ieke van den Burg (PES, NL) supports the Commission plans to extend in time and scope the existing range of goods and services on which Member States may apply reduced rates of VAT. Option to reduce VAT on restaurant services... On an experimental basis, Member States were allowed to apply lower rates on certain labour intensive services. This experiment runs to 2010. The Commission is now proposing that this possibility should continue indefinitely and also incorporate some additional labour-intensive or locally supplied services where there is no risk of distorting the single market - and this would now include: restaurant services, domestic care services for the young, sick, disabled or elderly and beauty treatments of the sort provided in hairdressing salons MEPs confirmed the view previously expressed by Parliament that reducing VAT of locally supplied services does not alter competition in the EU Internal Market since the concerned goods and services cannot be supplied from a different location and are only directed to a local market. ...and audio books In addition, a number of updates and additions are proposed to the other categories where reduced rates of VAT are permitted. This notably includes making audio books or books supplied on CD-Rom eligible for reduced rates (printed books are already included) as well as children's car seats. No reduced VAT on alcohol Finally, an amendment to extend the possibility to reduce VAT rates also to alcoholic drinks served in restaurants has been rejected by 334 votes against, 312 in favour and 13 abstentions. As usual with taxation issues, Parliament's views are advisory rather than binding and the final decision is for the Council, acting unanimously. The UK has already introduced a VAT cut from 17.5% to 15% on 1 December for a period of 13 months. The basic rules for VAT rates are simple: goods and services subject to VAT are normally subject to a rate of at least 15%. The Member States may apply reduced rates of not less than 5% to goods and services set out in a restricted list. However, these simple rules are complicated by a multitude of derogations granted to certain Member States – and not to others – during the negotiations preceding the introduction of the VAT rates Directive (1992) or in Acts of Accession. For example 11 Member States currently apply a reduced rate to restaurant services while the 16 remaining Member States cannot. A similar situation of derogations exists for labour intensive services. Text adopted by the EP (click on 19 February) VAT rates in the EU

Social policy
A social economy "would reduce speculation in financial markets"
2009-02-20 - 13:08
Businesses which focus on people rather than capital play an essential role in the European economy and could help regulate financial markets, says the European Parliament. But, the House warns, this "social economy" sector "remains little-known and is often the target of criticism stemming from misguided technical approaches". The report was adopted with 580 votes in favour, 27 against and 44 abstentions. MEPs point out that an economic system in which social economy enterprises play a more significant role would "reduce exposure to speculation in financial markets on which some private companies are not subject to the supervision of shareholders and regulatory bodies". They also stress that the social economy helps to "rectify three major labour market imbalances: unemployment, job instability and the social and labour exclusion of the unemployed". The report, drafted by Patrizia TOIA (ALDE, IT), considers that "social economy enterprises should not be subject to the same application of competition rules as other undertakings" and that "they need a secure legal framework, based on recognition of their specific values". A lot the Commission could do MEPs therefore ask the Commission to promote businesses driven by social benefits rather than profit motive in its policies and to introduce "effective legal barriers to entry", so that only social economy organisations are able to benefit from financing destined social economy enterprises. The report also calls for a European legal framework to be devised by the Commission, enabling "territorial partnerships to be established and maintained between the social economy sector and local authorities", and for the Commission to look into "reactivating the budget heading specifically for the social economy". Member States, together with the Commission, are called on to develop programmes offering financial support, information, advice and training and to simplify the process of establishment, including reducing the initial capital requirements for companies in this sector.

Employment policy
Adopt framework on informing and consulting employees or face consequences
2009-02-20 - 13:08
Noting that a significant number of Member States have yet to fully adopt a framework for informing and consulting employees, the European Parliament is urging those countries to do so "as soon as possible" or face possible infringement proceedings. The report was adopted with 598 votes in favour, 21 against and 32 abstentions. Many Member States are late in transposing a directive adopted in March 2002, which seeks to strengthen the process of informing and consulting employees within the EU. While some countries have "confined themselves to transcribing certain aspects of its minimum applicable provisions". Various Member States have failed to take account of some young workers, women working part-time or workers employed for short periods on fixed-term contracts, says the report by Jean Louis COTTIGNY (PES, FR). The report stresses that Member States cannot "invoke subsidiarity" to justify not imposing sanctions on employers who do not meet the requirements of the legislative framework. Measures for Member States to take The report calls on Member States to define precisely the term 'information', leaving no scope for alternative interpretations. It also asks that workers' representatives be allowed to scrutinise the information provided, that information be provided in good time before consultation, and that trade unions be involved in the process, in order to "consolidate social dialogue". It suggests that those Member States "in which protection for employees' representatives is traditionally guaranteed by means of an agreement negotiated between trade unions and employers' associations provide for a high level of subsidiary protection for such employees' representatives should the negotiations fail". Member States face possible infringement proceedings MEPs are urging the Commission to take immediate measures to guarantee effective transposition of the directive and to initiate infringement proceedings against those Member States which have failed to transpose the directive or which have not done so correctly.

Public health
Awareness of mental health in the EU
2009-02-20 - 13:08
One in four people experience mental health problems at least once in their lives, and many more are indirectly affected. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is calling on Member States to develop awareness-raising campaigns, to combat stigma and social exclusion and to improve mental health legislation. The report was adopted with 616 votes in favour, 24 against and 12 votes abstentions. In its report, drafted by Evangelia TZAMPAZI (PES, GR), Member States are called on to draw up "up-to-date mental health legislation, which is in line with international obligations as regards human rights … and which codifies and enshrines the basic principles, values and objectives of mental health policy". It also calls on Member States to develop an awareness of the importance of good mental health, particularly among healthcare professionals and target groups such as parents, teachers, those providing social and legal services, employers, carers and, particularly, the public at large. The media, the Internet, schools and workplaces, all have an important role to play in the organisation of public information and awareness campaigns, the report says, their role being to "promote mental health, increase knowledge about the most common symptoms of depression and suicidal tendencies, de-stigmatise mental disorders, encourage people to seek the best and most effective assistance and promote the active integration of people experiencing mental health problems". Funding available The financial cost of mental ill-health to society is estimated at between 3% and 4% of the Member States' GDP, and in 2006 the cost to the EU of mental illness was €436 billion. The EU should use the funding facilities available under the Seventh Framework Programme, the report says. This would be for more research in the field of mental health and well-being and the interaction between mental and physical health problems. Moreover, Member States should explore the funding facilities for mental health initiatives under the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund. Mental health and the workplace In recognition of the important role the workplace plays in the social integration of people with mental health problems, the report calls on employers to promote a healthy working climate, paying attention to work-related stress, the underlying causes of mental disorder at the workplace, and tackling those causes. It also calls on the Commission to "require businesses and public bodies to publish annually a report on their policy and work for the mental health of their employees on the same basis as they report on physical health and safety at work". While Member States are asked to ensure that people who are entitled to sickness or disability benefits because of mental health problems are not deprived of their right of access to employment and that they will not lose the benefits related to their disability/sickness as soon as they find a new job. EU emergency number is 112 Finally, the report calls for more information to be made available on the EU emergency number 112. While it does not replace existing national emergency numbers, it offers European citizens in distress access to emergency services in nearly all Member States.

European Parliament calls for action to eliminate whaling
2009-02-20 - 13:08
MEPs are arguing for the elimination of lethal whaling for scientific purposes and the maintenance of the global moratorium on commercial whaling. In a non-binding report, MEPs call for the EU to work towards obtaining a "universal agreement" on whaling. The report was adopted with 626 votes in favour, 12 against and 19 abstentions. Almost one in four cetacean (whale, dolphin and porpoise) species are currently regarded as under threat, with nine species listed as either endangered or critically endangered, and the status of others remains unclear. According to the report drawn up by Elspeth ATTWOOLL (ALDE, UK), although some whale populations have recovered somewhat since the introduction of the moratorium in 1986, others have not and their ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions remains unknown.
Exceptions to the current moratorium
The present moratorium applies only to commercial whaling. In addition to the exception for aboriginal whaling, scientific research can be undertaken under special permits which are issued by the country undertaking the research. Not all members of the International Whaling Commission (20 out of 27 EU Member States are members of the IWC) have signed up to the moratorium so commercial whaling still takes place.
"There are suggestions, too, that the commercial use of whale meat is a by-product of scientific whaling", says Ms Attwooll.
The European Parliament is calling on the Council, the Commission and those Member States participating in the working group of the IWC to work toward the achievement of a "universal agreement" on whaling.
The tragic history of commercial whaling, combined with the numerous threats currently faced by whale populations, means, says the House, that the EU must promote the highest level of protection for whales at a global level.
Maintain global moratorium on commercial whaling and end scientific whaling
MEPs support the maintenance of the global moratorium on commercial whaling and a ban on international commercial trade in whale products. They seek to end "scientific whaling" and support the designation of substantial regions of ocean and seas as sanctuaries in which all whaling is indefinitely prohibited.
Parliament notes that the EU Habitats Directive defining the Community position with respect to whales (and dolphins) "would not allow the resumption of commercial whaling in respect of any stock of whales in EU waters".
The report accepts the need for a limited amount of hunting to be done by those with a tradition of hunting whales for their own sustenance, but calls for much greater emphasis on research into, and the employment of, humane killing methods. The House calls for any such hunting to take place only with "clear quotas" and "under strict controls".
More Marine Protected Areas
MEPs call also for the establishment, in suitable locations around the world, of more Marine Protected Areas in which whales would receive special protection and for the use of more selective fishing gear to avoid by-catches of other species, particularly cetaceans. Threats to the cetacean population arising from climate change, pollution, ship strikes, fishing gear, anthropogenic ocean noise (including sonar, seismic surveys and vessel noise) and other hazards should also be tackled outside such protected areas. The European Parliament considers that the Commission should, in advance of global action, bring forward further proposals to counter such threats in respect of EU waters and EU vessels.
The Commission should also define a revised regulatory framework for the practice of whale-watching that protects the economic and social interests of coastal regions where this activity is carried out, taking account of its recent development, MEPs say.

Fisheries
Need for responsible, high-quality fisheries research
2009-02-20 - 13:08
In a report on applied research relating to the Common Fisheries Policy, the European Parliament calls on the Commission to review the 7th framework programme when the mid-term evaluation is carried out, scheduled for 2010, paying greater attention to the specific problems of fisheries and aquaculture. The report was adopted with 616 votes in favour, 18 against and 24 abstentions. Parliament is convinced that both policy-makers and operators in the fisheries sector have a "crucial need for a more practical type of research" and, given the duration of the 7th framework programme, "it is imperative to include the objectives to be achieved". "We insist on the need urgently to implement a specific science policy geared to fishery resources, accompanied by a significant financial effort", says the rapporteur, Rosa MIGUÉLEZ RAMOS (PES, ES). The rapporteur recommends that, in the field of scientific marine research, priority be given not only to research to gain knowledge of the state of fish stocks but also to the ecosystemic, commercial, economic and social aspects that determine fisheries management, since all these aspects are of crucial importance. The report stresses that "the CFP is among the Community policies most dependent on scientific research and the credibility of the measures adopted under this policy rests on high-quality scientific opinions". It notes a "clear conflict of interest between fishermen and scientists in the short term, whereas their long-term objectives are more compatible", calling on the Commission to "promote better cooperation between fishermen and scientists". MEPs call on the Commission and the Member States to "demonstrate and better convey to fishermen that it is in their interest to take into account the economic benefit that they can expect in the medium or long term in the assessment of their presumed short-term economic loss".

North-East Atlantic Fisheries
2009-02-20 - 13:08
The European Parliament adopted a non-binding report giving green light to the amendment of the Convention on future multilateral co-operation in the North-East Atlantic Fisheries (NEAFC). The report was adopted with 615 votes in favour, 15 against and 11 abstentions. The proposal aims to transpose into Community law the amendments to the Convention adopted by the NEAFC at its 23rd annual meeting in November 2004, allowing it to adopt recommendations establishing procedures for the settlement of disputes arising from the Convention. Given that the amendments made to the Convention "are likely to facilitate its application, in particular as regards the settlement of disputes, and that they also improve the sustainable management of fisheries resources", the rapporteur is in favour of the proposal for a decision.

Security and defence
MEPs promote a strong and effective foreign, security and defence policy
2009-02-20 - 13:08
MEPs point out that the European Union needs to develop its strategic autonomy. This strategic autonomy will help the EU to promote peace and international security, to defend its interests in the world, to protect the security of its own citizens, to contribute to effective multilateralism, to advance respect for human rights and democratic values worldwide and to safeguard world peace. The report was adopted with 482 votes in favour, 111 against with 55 abstentions. The Parliament recognises the need for the EU to develop its strategic autonomy through multilateral cooperation in international organisations, above all the United Nations, and through partnerships with other key actors, according to the report on the European Security Strategy (ESS) and European security and defence policy (ESDP), drafted by Karl Von Wogau (EPP-ED, DE). MEPs reiterate the need for a reform of the United Nations Organization in order to make it capable of fully meeting its responsibilities and acting effectively in providing solutions to global challenges and responding to key threats. The resolution embraces the concept of the “responsibility to protect”, adopted by the UN in 2005, and the concept of "human security", which is based on the primacy of the individual and not of the state (AM 7). Parliament calls for the setting-up of an autonomous and permanent EU Operational Headquarters with the capacity to undertake strategic planning and to conduct ESDP operations and missions. The report also supports the idea of creating a Council of Defence Ministers. " SAFE” – Synchronised Armed Forces Europe The cooperation between national armed forces should increasingly synchronised and called “SAFE” – Synchronised Armed Forces Europe. The European Parliament notes that a common defence policy in Europe requires an integrated European Armed Force which needs to be equipped with common weapon systems so as to guarantee commonality and interoperability. European Security Strategy MEPs note that the 2003 ESS highlights the main threats faced by the European Union: terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, regional conflicts, state failure and organised crime. Otherwise, according to MEPs, the security interests of the Union also include the protection of its citizens and its interests inside the EU as well as abroad, the security of its neighbourhood and the protection of its external borders and critical infrastructure. Furthermore, it includes the improvement of its cyber security, the security of energy supply and sea lanes, the protection of its space assets and protection against the consequences of climate change. Parliament stresses that the European Union gives priority to crisis prevention in the ESDP. It suggests that the ESS should be reviewed every five years at the beginning of a new EU legislative period. MEPs strongly request that the European Union and its Member States focus their efforts on common capabilities which can be used for both defence and security purposes. In this context, they consider satellite-based intelligence, surveillance and warning equipment, unmanned air vehicles, helicopters and telecommunication equipment and air and sea transport to be crucial. MEPs also demand a common technical standard for protected telecommunications and ways of protecting critical infrastructure. Civilian and military operations MEPs also call for further initiatives concerning common training for personnel who are to work together in civilian and military operations. They ask for increased interaction between the armed forces and civilian personnel of EU Member States, coordination of crisis-related training, exchange programmes among armed forces in Europe and the opening-up of armies to citizens of other EU Member States.

Development and cooperation
A special place for children in EU
2009-02-20 - 13:08
The European Parliament adopted a report by Glenys Kinnock (PES; UK), welcoming the Commission's Communication on “A Special Place for Children in EU External Action” and the accompanying Council Conclusions as "important steps forward towards an EU strategy on the Rights of the Child", but underlines that "much remains to be done to put the political commitments into practice". The report notes that despite the recent positive developments at EU level, the EU institutions and staff resources devoted to children’s rights remain inadequate. MEPs stress that "none of the plans will be realised unless adequate funding is available". More funding needed MEPs believe that the participation of children must be institutionalised and better funded in partner countries and at EU level. They insist that the general budget support of the EU should include funds for capacity- building for relevant ministries (such as Ministries of Welfare, Health, Education and Justice) to ensure that they have the appropriate policies and tools to budget and implement services for children. Welcoming the Commission's plan to address education in its humanitarian aid operations, the report calls for sufficient funding and staffing at EU level to implement the new policy commitment. The report also urges Member States to fulfil their pledges "to provide adequate, predictable funding through timetabled budgetary aid designed to meet the 2010 benchmarks". Agreements with third countries should protect children Turning to third countries, MEPs stress that children's rights must be systematically included in the EU's political dialogue and policy discussions with partner countries, and all EU policies with a likely effect on children in third countries should be subject to consistent child rights impact assessments prior to their adoption. They call on the Commission to draw up a report examining whether the existing international agreements between the European Union and third countries already contain a legally binding clause on the protection of children's rights and, if not, whether such a clause could be inserted into agreements. The Commission and Member States are also asked to support institutional structures in partner countries to protect and promote children’s rights, including independent ombudspersons. Consumers have the power to limit child labour Observing that purchasers in the developing world "are in a key position" to "bring direct and effective economic pressure" on organisations that use child labour, MEPs call on the European Community and Member States to provide more support to fair trade and labelling initiatives which encourage companies not to use child labour. It recommends that compliance with voluntary codes of conduct regarding core labour rights should be better controlled and made transparent to European consumers. MEPs also urge the Commission to propose a uniform method for labelling products imported into the European Union so as to certify that they have been manufactured without the use of child labour at each stage in the chain of production, for example, by placing the indication 'without child labour' on the packaging of the products in question. This would ensure that this system is in line with the WTO's international trade rules. Text adopted (click on 19 February)

Energy
Follow-up of the energy efficiency national action plans
2009-02-20 - 13:08
Member States' failure to submit national energy efficiency plans highlights deficiencies that might "endanger the attainment of the EU's efficiency and climate protection objectives", says the European Parliament in a report adopted with 616 votes in favour, 24 against and 17 abstentions. According to the report, the European Union wastes more than 20 % of its energy due to inefficiency and, if the saving objective of 20 % were met, the EU would use about 400 Mtoe (million tonnes of oil equivalent) less primary energy and the CO2 emissions reduction would be about 860Mt. Parliament notes "with regret" that in the majority of Member States the funding allocated to energy efficiency projects is still insufficient and fails to adequately account for regional differences. Moreover, individual sector policies continue to run counter to the EU's endeavour to be energy efficient, the report says. Member States should be more ambitious in their energy saving targets MEPs call on Member States to "increase their level of ambition" by going beyond the national indicative energy saving target of 9% by 2016. Countries of the EU are also urged to turn their National Energy Efficiency Action Plans (NEEAPs) into a "practical tool for delivery", in order to meet the wider and longer term target of improving energy efficiency by at least 20% by 2020. Residential buildings are among the most energy-wasteful sectors, the report says. Therefore, financial support at both national and Community levels for the energy performance of buildings should be increased and existing financial incentives should be compared with the commitments set out in the National Action Plans. Cars: increasing demand for transport an issue Turning to the car industry, the MEPs underline the importance of stringent future emissions targets to be set as soon as possible in the interests of industry certainty and express their disappointment that the 95g CO2 limit for 2020 called for by Parliament is not yet confirmed. While they welcome the regulation on conditions governing carbon dioxide emissions from cars, they note, "with concern" that the new legislation will not offset the increasing energy demand for transport. Small businesses do not have capacity to abide by legislation SMEs also have an important role to play in improving energy efficiency, the report says, but "they do not have the same capacity to comply with legislation or new standards in the energy sector". MEPs therefore consider it necessary for National Action Plans to place special emphasis on how governments intend to promote and support energy efficiency investments on the part of SMEs. Awareness campaigns to tackle poverty In view of the fact that rising energy prices can lead to poverty, Member States are encouraged to include appropriate financial instruments for energy saving in their national action plans, and to develop long-term energy efficiency awareness campaigns as a matter of urgency. Looking to alternative energy sources, Member States are "encouraged" to make substantial use of renewable energy such as wind, biomass, biofuels and also wave and tidal energy, where possible. Finally, MEPs call on the Commission to make the 20% energy efficiency target by 2020 "legally binding as part of the assessment it must prepare on the progress of the Community towards this target."

Free movement of services
European professional card for service providers
2009-02-20 - 13:08
Parliament adopted an own-initiative report on the creation of a European professional card for service providers. The report stresses that greater mobility of persons and services between Member States and between regions is an essential element in achieving the Lisbon agenda for growth and jobs. The House adopted the report with 607 votes in favour, 21 against and 27 abstentions. There are still major obstacles for persons wanting to work in another Member State: 20% of complaints received by SOLVIT in 2007 concerned the recognition of professional qualifications required to pursue a regulated profession. Directive 2005/36/EC states that the introduction, at European level, of professional cards by professional associations or organisations could facilitate the mobility of professionals, in particular by speeding up the exchange of information between the host Member State and the Member State of origin. In its resolution on the impact and consequences of the exclusion of health services from the Directive on services in the internal market, the Parliament called for the setting up of ‘a European card to provide access to information on the skills of health care professionals. Based on theses facts, the report encourages all initiatives that aim to facilitate cross-border mobility as a means to the efficient functioning of the services and labour markets. In this context, MEPs call on the Commission to assess the transposition of Directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications and call on the Member States to strive for a more harmonised approach to the recognition of qualifications and competences, to simplify the administrative processes involved and to reduce the costs incurred by professionals. MEPs stress that a European professional card could be an advantage even for non-regulated and non-harmonised professions, as it would have an information role particularly for employers and consumers, which would be the case for most liberal professions. They therefore call on the Commission to take stock of different initiatives concerning the development of professional cards and to report to Parliament on a representative inventory. If there is sufficient demand to develop one, MEPs consider that a professional card should be as simple, easy and liberal as possible, avoiding any new bureaucratic burdens, and that it could establish a "common language" in the qualifications of certain professions. In any event, a European professional card should not have a negative effect on cross-border mobility, and should only be used as proof of the right to move without being a condition for such movement. Information on a European professional card should be reliable, validated and updated by the competent national authorities and should comply with the highest standards of the protection of privacy. Where appropriate, information contained in EUROPASS CVs could also be included on the European professional card. Finally, MEPs consider that the professions themselves should finance the development and implementation of a European professional card, if felt appropriate.
