Lampedusa crisis: coping with migrants from North Africa
2011-03-31 - 19:01
A stronger EU response is needed to the wave of migrants fleeing unrest in North Africa to the Italian island of Lampedusa, MEPs will tell the European Commission in a debate on Monday. 15,000 North African migrants are said to have arrived there since the start of the crisis. A resolution on ways to cope with migrants fleeing conflict areas will be put to a vote on Tuesday. Some Socialist MEPs have already urged the European Commission to call an immediate meeting of EU home affairs ministers to set out a joint response to the emergency in Lampedusa.
Others, most from the EPP group, have asked Commissioner Malmström to activate the "solidarity mechanism" envisaged in EU law for dealing with massive inflows of displaced persons. Visiting Lampedusa on 30 March, Italy's Prime Minister Berlusconi promised that the island would be free of migrants "in 48 hours".
In a draft resolution by Italian MEP Fiorello Provera (EFD), Foreign Affairs Committee MEPs say that the currently-suspended EU-Libya cooperation agreement on migration should be restored as soon as a new transition government able to respect human rights is in place.
The text also puts forward measures to fight unemployment in migrants' countries of origin and transit as the best long-term solution.

Spotlight on outcome of European Council
2011-03-31 - 19:01
On Tuesday morning European Council President Herman Van Rompuy will discuss the result of the latest EU summit with MEPs. The eurozone crisis and economic governance, as well as Japan, nuclear issues and Libya, are likely to be raised. The need for EU laws rather than just intergovernmental commitments to fully resolve the crisis in the eurozone, as well as the need to place growth and employment at the heart of any economic governance model, are of particular concern to MEPs. The European Parliament shares legislative power with Member States on the six-text legislative package on economic governance. Negotiations between the two sides are expected to begin by the end of April with the aim of reaching a deal by June.

Syria, Bahrain and Yemen, plus call for radical rethink of relations with EU neighbours
2011-03-31 - 19:01
Parliament will debate the conflicts in Syria, Bahrain and Yemen with EU foreign policy High Representative Catherine Ashton on Wednesday and then adopt a resolution on Thursday. It will also call for a radical review of the EU's relations with its eastern and southern neighbours, in two further resolutions to be put to the vote on Thursday. The EU's relations with its eastern and Mediterranean neighbours have often neglected dialogue with civil society and sought to ensure stability, rather than to promote human rights, say Foreign Affairs MEPs, who argue that the EU should have "an active role as a player, not only a payer".
For southern neighbours, MEPs want greater clarity about how "advanced status" partnership is granted to certain countries. They also want to make it easier to suspend agreements with third countries in response to serious human rights violations.
The text on eastern neighbours says that they should be more clearly differentiated according to their merits, so as to give the most advanced ones "a faster path" towards European prospects.
Countries covered by the Neighbourhood Policy
The Eastern Dimension of the European Neighbourhood Policy covers 16 countries in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, North Africa and the Middle East. The list includes six post-Soviet states: Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus (although ENP co-operation is not yet operational there), Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. The Southern Dimension includes Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, the Palestinian Territories, Syria and Tunisia.

Iceland and former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ready for EU?
2011-03-31 - 19:01
The EU membership prospects of Iceland and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will be debated in Strasbourg on Wednesday by MEPs, who will then vote on a resolution on each country on Thursday. The draft resolutions by the Foreign Affairs Committee look forward to Iceland's accession provided certain outstanding issues are resolved, and call for formal talks with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to begin without delay.
Iceland
On Iceland, whose membership negotiations kicked off last year, the committee's draft resolution prepared by Cristian Preda (EPP, RO) welcomes the prospect of bringing on board one of Europe's oldest democracies.
The Icesave banking dispute with the UK and the Netherlands, on which a proposed solution will be put to a referendum in Iceland on 9 April, is one of the remaining difficulties highlighted by MEPs. Whale hunting (banned in the EU) and Iceland's desire to protect its fisheries and agriculture markets are other bones of contention that must be resolved before accession can go ahead.
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
On the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the draft resolution calls for the opening of accession negotiations immediately, while regretting the fact that the name dispute with Greece continues to block the country’s road to EU accession. MEPs also urge an end to the political deadlock between the government and the opposition, and worry about issues surrounding corruption, media freedom and judiciary reform.

Parliament's 2012 budget to fall in real terms
2011-03-31 - 19:01
Next year's European Parliament budget would rise by less than the inflation rate, under proposals for an EP budget of €1.725 billion for 2012 on which MEPs will vote on Wednesday. Although this figure represents an increase of 2.3% over the 2011 figure, it is below the EU-27 inflation rate of 2.8%.
"In the light of the difficult economic and budgetary conditions in the Member States, the Parliament should show its budgetary responsibility and self-restraint by staying under the current inflation rate", says a motion for a resolution on Parliament's draft budget estimates for next year tabled by José Manuel Fernandes (EPP, PT) on behalf of the EP Budgets Committee.
To reduce real growth in Parliament's budget, the committee is recommending savings worth €13.7 million, including lower funding than originally planned for political parties and foundations, information campaigns, IT and buildings maintenance. The special and additional provisions for 18 new MEPs, a direct result of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, and costs relating to the likely future enlargement with Croatia, have been postponed until the final decisions are taken.
The other EU institutions have also submitted budget estimates to the European Commission, which will present its draft 2012 budget for the whole EU on 20 April.

New fisheries agreement with Comoros and rules on imports from Greenland
2011-03-31 - 19:01
The renewal of the EU fisheries agreement with the Comoros islands and rules on imports of fishery products and by-products from Greenland will be debated Tuesday evening and put to a vote on Wednesday. Parliament should be more extensively involved in monitoring the operation of fisheries agreements and negotiating future ones, says a draft recommendation for renewing the EU-Comoros fisheries agreement. If approved, the new agreement will increase from 57 to 70 the number of vessels from France, Italy, Portugal and Spain authorised to fish in the waters of the Comoros.
Besides a financial contribution provided for in the agreement, the Comoros will receive an extra €300,000 per year. The money should be used primarily to build infrastructure enabling EU vessels to land their catches in Comorian ports rather than taking them as far as the Seychelles, a practice that is costly and rather dangerous due to increased activity of pirates in the Western Indian Ocean.
Greenland
Parliament will seek to ensure that MEPs share legislative power with Member States over the rules on imports from Greenland, rather than merely being consulted, as in the past.

The Single Market: raising the game
2011-03-31 - 19:01
MEPs will vote on Wednesday on three resolutions on the Single Market Act, the broad action plan unveiled by the Commission last October to give a fresh boost to the EU internal market on the eve of the 20th anniversary of Jacques Delors' original Single Market programme. "Efforts to complete the Single Market need to concentrate on the concerns and rights of citizens, consumers, public service users and businesses and bring them tangible benefits in order to regain their full confidence in the Single Market", argues one of the three draft resolutions, titled "A Single Market for Europeans".
Among other things it calls for easier recognition of professional qualifications across borders and the establishment of a European Skills Passport, an extension of the existing roaming regulation, greater transparency and comparability of banking charges and full portability of pension rights.
Proposals by the S&D, Greens/EFA and GUE/NGL groups to include a social clause and to protect social services of general interest were voted down at committee level, causing the S&D to abstain on the final vote while the Greens and GUE/NGL voted against.
Broad principles now, detailed legislation later
Taken as a whole, the three coordinated resolutions on "Governance and Partnership in the Single Market", "A Single Market for Enterprises and Growth" and "A Single Market for Europeans", all tabled by the Internal Market Committee, will represent Parliament's initial response and recommendations to the Commission's plans.
Detailed scrutiny and voting on legislation will follow at a later stage, as each new law proposed by the Commission comes before Parliament, which shares final decision-making power with the Council of Ministers.
Commissioner Barnier will unveil details on 13 April of the concrete measures to be introduced under the Single Market Act.

Parliament set to approve aid to central European flood victims
2011-03-31 - 19:01
The release of €182.4 million from the EU Solidarity Fund to help repair the 2010 flood damage in Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Croatia and Romania is set to be approved by Parliament on Wednesday. The funding was approved on 31 March by the Budgets Committee, despite MEPs' reservations about the funding method chosen by the Council. The total direct cost of the damage is estimated at €5.5 billion. MEPs disapproved of the source of the funding, a "negative reserve", as proposed by the Council of Ministers, as a "once-only solution", since the maximum available for this reserve is €200 million.
They nonetheless voted for the Council proposal, because they felt that they could not let flood victims also become victims of an institutional battle between the Member States and MEPs.

Asylum: a single EU procedure to ensure better safeguards for refugees
2011-03-31 - 19:01
An accessible, fair and effective asylum procedure throughout the EU is the aim of the revised "asylum procedures directive" on which Parliament will vote on Tuesday. The directive would provide standard EU-wide guarantees for people in need of protection as well as enabling Member States to distinguish more quickly between asylum seekers and other migrants.
The EP Civil Liberties Committee is proposing additional safeguards for vulnerable people and stresses that Member States must comply with the "non-refoulement" principle.
The European Commission has in fact announced that it plans to present a revised version of its draft directive in the coming months, so Parliament will have to vote on that in due course. In practice, therefore, the present amendments by MEPs are intended to influence the Commission's new draft.

EU legal status for European political parties
2011-03-31 - 19:01
MEPs want to change the rules governing European political parties, to give them legal personality, greater flexibility in financing, the ability to attract more funding and the right to take part in referendum campaigns. A non-binding resolution to this effect by the Constitutional Affairs Committee will be put to the vote on Wednesday.
Currently most political parties at European level are registered as non-governmental organisations in several different countries. The draft resolution, prepared by Greek MEP Marietta Giannakou (EPP), argues that more organisational convergence is needed and therefore proposes that these parties be given a legal and fiscal status based on EU law.
The resolution also recommends relaxing the current rules on the own resources required from the parties, raising the ceiling for donations from €12,000 to €25,000 per year per donor and lifting the existing ban on their participation in EU referendum campaigns.
European-level political parties are umbrella organisations of national political parties in the Member States. They are currently governed by a 2003 EU law (regulation). MEPs hope that Parliament's non-legislative resolution will lead to draft legislation to amend the existing rules.
Current criteria for European-level political parties
the party must have legal personality in the Member State where its headquarters is located,
it must be represented, in at least one quarter of Member States, by Members of the European Parliament or by MPs of national or regional Parliaments or in the regional assemblies,
it must observe the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law,
it must have taken part in elections to the European Parliament, or expressed the intention to do so.
Procedure: Non-legislative resolution

Sex crimes must lead to automatic prosecution, say MEPs
2011-03-31 - 19:01
Rape and other forms of sexual violence against women should be recognised as crimes in all EU countries and lead to automatic prosecution, the Women's Rights Committee will argue in Strasbourg next week. Europe's women do not have equal protection against male violence across the EU, as national laws and policies differ from one Member State to another. In several Member States, rape is not treated as a state offence and does not lead to automatic prosecution, points out a draft resolution prepared for the Women's Rights Committee by Eva-Britt Svensson (GUE/NGL, SV). The resolution also calls for an EU criminal-law instrument against gender-based violence.
On Wednesday evening MEPs will debate sexual violence in war and armed conflicts in the Middle East and northern Africa with the Commission. A resolution on this subject will be put to the vote on Thursday.

Scrutiny of nuclear power plant closures in Bulgaria, Lithuania and Slovakia
2011-03-31 - 19:01
A resolution that criticises plans for decommissioning old nuclear power plants in three new Member States, including costs, delays and the possible funding of energy-related projects other than decommissioning, will be debated on Monday and voted on Tuesday. The resolution assesses theefficiency and effectiveness of EU funding for the decommissioning of Ignalina in Lithuania, Bohunice in Slovakia and Kozloduy in Bulgaria.
While welcoming the progress made, MEPs will also ask the Commission to increase its supervision and coordination of the three programmes. The European Court of Auditors will write a special report on the three decommission programmes, to be published this autumn.

Impact of Moroccan tomato imports on EU producers
2011-03-31 - 19:01
The impact of low-priced Moroccan tomato imports on EU producers will be debated on Thursday. MEPs will urge the European Commission to take measures against abusive practices such as evading payment of additional duties when tomato prices fall beneath EU thresholds. The debate follows a petition submitted to Parliament by Spanish tomato producers. The Petitions Committee asks the Commission to explain why measures have not been taken to adjust the EU market entry prices of tomatoes and to put an end to evasive practices condemned by the European Anti-Fraud Office.

Dual-use exports: stricter EP scrutiny of how Commission applies rules
2011-03-31 - 19:01
The European Commission's implementation of rules on the export of dual-use goods - those that can be used for both civilian and military purposes, such as nuclear centrifuges, harmful viruses or cryptography programmes - is set to be put under stricter control by the European Parliament. MEPs are willing to give the go-ahead for extending the number of non-sensitive items that can be exported to non-sensitive countries at Community level, in exchange for more information-sharing and parliamentary oversight of the notification system.

Fight against fraud: MEPs critical of report on EU spending irregularities
2011-03-31 - 19:01
The Commission's annual report on the fight against EU budget fraud is short on useful information about irregularities and fraud in individual Member States, believes the EP Budgetary Control Committee. Parliament will debate the Commission's report for 2009 on the protection of the Communities' financial interests and the fight against fraud, in Strasbourg on Tuesday, before voting on a resolution drafted by the committee.
A few critical remarks about individual countries - Italy, Spain, Slovakia, Romania, Austria, the UK, Finland, the Netherlands and Bulgaria - are made in the Commission report, acknowledge MEPs. These relate to irregularities, late reporting, bad or non-recovery of funds spent incorrectly and problems to do with the collection of own resources,
However, given the large differences in the quality of reporting between Member States, it is almost impossible to have an overview of actual irregularities and fraud in Member States and to identify and discipline the bad performers, says the Budgetary Control Committee.
MEPs believe the Commission should press Member States to provide the necessary information so as to make these analyses possible, even if it would have to introduce new penalties for not meeting reporting requirements.

DHA in baby food: Parliament to rule on health claim
2011-03-31 - 19:01
Parliament will decide in Strasbourg this week whether to allow baby food manufacturers to claim that adding docosahexaenoic acid (a natural fatty acid commonly known as DHA) to baby food "contributes to the normal visual development of infants up to 12 months of age". The EP's own Public Health and Food Safety Committee is recommending that Parliament should not authorise this health claim, as it believes more research is needed into the effects of DHA supplements. DHA is a fatty acid naturally occurring in breast milk. Many baby milk formulae include it as a synthetic additive. Manufacturers have applied for permission to make the health claim for DHA added to baby food, including follow-on formulae, for infants from 6-12 months.

An update of existing EU legislation on bluetongue disease to allow a more effective use of vaccines and reduce red tape for farmers is expected to be approved by the Agriculture Committee on Monday and by the full Parliament on Thursday. Since the early 2000s, bluetongue disease has been affecting cattle, sheep and goats, killing many animals and inflicting significant losses on livestock farmers in several Member States.

Reconciling EU trade policy with Member States' export credits
2011-03-31 - 19:01
Parliament's International Trade Committee will be asking the plenary for a strong mandate to negotiate with Council and Commission on new rules on Member States' export credit guarantees. MEPs want more robust reporting of national export credits to the European Commission, and insist that they must form a coherent part of the EU's overall external trade policy. Export credit agencies in EU Member States may offer credit guarantees for EU exporters to third countries. EU law on these agencies must be updated to bring them into line with recent revisions of international agreements, and Parliament is to vote on the Commission's proposals on Tuesday.
The plenary is expected to vote on the amendments tabled, but refer the report back to the International Trade Committee, so that negotiations can begin with Council to reach a first reading agreement on the subject (Rule 57/2).

A fresh approach to aid for least-developed countries
2011-03-31 - 19:01
A more innovative approach to aid is needed to help the 49 least developed countries (LDCs) tackle their poverty, food insecurity, fragile economies and environmental vulnerability, says a draft resolution setting out MEPs' views ahead of the Fourth UN Conference on LDCs in Istanbul. Despite the economic crisis, the EU and developed countries must stick to their commitments in terms of development aid, so that by the end of the decade half of the least developed countries can "graduate" from LDC status by moving on to a sustainable path, urges the draft resolution tabled by EP political groups.
The EP delegation to the Istanbul conference, which takes place on 9-13 May 2011, is composed of the following MEPs: Eleni Theocharus (EPP, CY), Corina Cretu (S&D, RO), Judith Sargentini (Greens/EFA, NL) and Nirj Deva (ECR, UK).
