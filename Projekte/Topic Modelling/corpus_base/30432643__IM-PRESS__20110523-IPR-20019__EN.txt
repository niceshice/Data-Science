Talks on future EU spending kick off shortly. Is the EU, in the midst of an economic crisis, ready to back the ambitious long-term aims of the EU2020 strategy? And if so, what becomes of policies that traditionally take large shares of the budget, such as agriculture and regional development? How big will the EU budget be? Will it be funded differently? And what happens to temporary rebates for certain Member States? Parliament's Policy Challenges Committee sets out its ideas on 25 and 26 May.
Parliament is the first EU institution to outline its starting position. On 25 and 26 May, its Policy Challenges Committee will vote on its proposals for the EU's next long-term budget, or "financial perspectives" (2014-2020).
The report, prepared by Salvador Garriga Polledo (EPP, ES) is expected to play an important role in further talks. These Q&A are intended as background information for journalists.
