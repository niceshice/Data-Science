MEPs debated the rights of children on Tuesday
New proposals for consumer credit and an action plan on children's rights were discussed by MEPs on Tuesday. The credit proposals aim to make it easier to get credit from another country although there were differences between MEPs over the details of the proposals. This is the year of intercultural dialogue and the Grand Mufti of Syria, Ahmad Badr Al-Din Hassoun, addressed MEPs at midday with a message of peace and tolerance between peoples of different faiths.
EU-wide consumer market under the spotlight
New rules on obtaining credit were discussed ahead of a vote on Wednesday. The proposed legislation aims to create a Europe-wide market in credit - at present people primarily borrow from banks and credit companies based in their own countries. This leads to large differences in how much interest people pay.
The new rules cover loans from €200 to €75,000, but do not cover mortgages. The proposals deal with the amount of information that lenders must make available as well as the amount people must pay in penalties if they pay off a loan early. In what is expected to be a close result MEPs will vote Wednesday at 1200 CET.
In the debate MEPs stressed the need for trustworthy and clear information that is standardised across the Union. Parliament's rapporteur on the issue, Kurt Lechner said that "confidence of the consumer is vital in this area".
Right of children to be protected
The rights of children and what strategy the European Union should take to safeguard them was debated in Strasbourg on Tuesday. The rise of paedophiles using the internet to contact children and exchange child pornography was a particular cause for concern. Efforts to work with credit card companies to stop people buying child pornography and blocking access to certain sites were among the measures discussed in the report by Roberta Angelilli (UEN).
In the debate Ms Angelilli stressed that the rights of children should be considered "in all aspects of child policy". Hungarian MEP Kinga G á l spoke of the need to prevent poverty and discrimination - both of which undermine children's rights. Swedish Socialist MEP Inger Segelström said all children should be covered by EU legislation and each EU country had a responsibility to prevent human trafficking. Estonian Liberal Siiri Oviir called the protection of children's rights "the basis of the society of tomorrow".
Grand Mufti of Syria speaks to MEPs on intercultural dialogue
Speaking to MEPs on intercultural dialogue, the Grand Mufti of Syria, Ahmad Badr Al-Din Hassoun, called for peace and tolerance between cultures and religions. He told the House that there is only one civilisation, that of mankind. He said "that religions - whether Christianity, Judaism or Islamism - have given culture its moral values, by placing the Supreme Being, holiness and human dignity at the centre of everything. He rejected the idea of a holy war, saying "peace is holy".
Welcoming the Grand Mufti Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering said "tolerance is central to intercultural dialogue. But tolerance does not mean indifference. Tolerance means defending one's views, hearing out others and respecting their convictions".
