EuroparlTV interviews José Manuel Barroso The European Parliament has approved the re-appointment of José Manuel Barroso as President of the European Commission. It will be Mr Barroso's second five-year term as Commission President.
Mr Barroso was elected by 382 votes in favour, 219 against and 117 abstentions in a vote held by secret ballot on Wednesday. The approval required a simple majority of the votes cast as the vote took place under the rules of the Nice Treaty. Abstentions did not count.
"This is the right result for Europe," said EP President Jerzy Buzek as he congratulated Mr Barroso and continued: "We are no longer in a political vacuum and President Barroso can start to build on his detailed programme and construct his team of Commissioners. The European Parliament has shown that it has teeth."
Commission President Barroso expressed his warm thanks to the Parliament for its "enormous confidence." He added: "This is a signal from the European Parliament that it is fully involved in the ambitious programme I have for the next five years... I want to work with all political groups that have signed up for the programme." Previous votes on Commission Presidents

On Tuesday, MEPs heard Barroso's final pitch for the Commission presidency
The Parliament debated José Manuel Barroso's statement on Tuesday before the vote on his appointment for Commission President on Wednesday. Having defended his programme for the next five years before the political groups last week, Mr Barroso now presented his political guidelines to the full Parliament. The different political groups expressed their support for, or lack of faith in, Mr Barroso, some demanding more concrete action.
Mr BARROSO focused on economic recovery combined with a social market, listing proposals he wants to implement if elected. "I am committed to fighting social dumping" he said, announcing a revision of the working time directive. He also promised measures to eliminate the gender pay gap. As for the EU budget, Mr Barroso proposed to "move towards an approach based on solidarity". He stressed "the EU must have a more transparent and efficient way of financing its policies".
Mr Barroso also promised changes in the Commission structure, with the appointment of commissioners for justice, fundamental rights and civil liberties, for internal affairs and migration, and for climate action, as well as "a scientific adviser for research and innovation".
Leaders of the political groups
The leader of the EPP group, Joseph DAUL (FR), confirmed that his group would support Barroso's candidacy, although he warned that "this is not a blank cheque and you will have to fulfil our expectations". He also called on Mr Barroso to waste no time in setting up a new college of commissioners. "Citizens of Europe spoke in June in favour of the EPP" and "we now back Mr Barroso" because he has proved to be a "high-profile candidate".
Martin SCHULZ (DE) stated that Mr Barroso did not have the support of the S-D group, although he confirmed that the group would meet tonight to take its final decision. "Europe needs a real change of direction", said Mr Schulz, and Mr Barroso would be measured on this basis. He stressed the need for new European laws such as a directive on public services: "This is about your programme, Mr Barroso, we cannot reduce Europe to just one man".
Guy VERHOFSTADT (BE) explained that the ALDE group would support Mr Barroso's candidacy provided he responds to its demands for a common plan to clean up the banking system and a mid-term review to beef up banking supervision. "Some groups are not convinced by Mr Barroso's guidelines, but we have the responsibility to take a final decision as soon as possible".
"The Greens/EFA group does not have faith in you", said Daniel COHN-BENDIT (FR), adding that "we think we deserve somebody better than you". He also demanded the postponement of the vote to take into account the result of Ireland's referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. "If the Irish people vote 'yes' to Lisbon, we will have a new situation for the Commission".
Michał Tomasz KAMIŃSKI (PL) of the ECR expressed his support for the appointment of president-designate Barroso. "There are many issues over which we disagree with Mr Barroso, for example the Lisbon Treaty, but he is against national selfishness and that is why we support him."
Lothar BISKY (DE) of the GUE/NGL outlined the need for a "social, peaceful and environmentally friendly Europe" and said Mr Barroso was the "wrong man for president if we want that kind of Europe".
Nigel FARAGE (UK), on behalf of the EFD, said that the EP should not vote on Mr Barroso's candidacy until the Irish people had voted on the Lisbon Treaty.
Krisztina MORVAI (HU, NI) argued for a "fundamental change" in Europe and stressed that "we have to promote people's fundamental rights".
Council
Cecilia MALMSTRÖM , speaking on behalf of the Council, stressed again that Mr Barroso was appointed unanimously by 27 heads of state or government from different political parties. The importance of certainty, stability and effective action were some of the words used by the Swedish minister for EU affairs to highlight the need to resolve the appointment of the Commission President.
