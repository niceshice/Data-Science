A highly charged debate about the new Hungarian constitution pitted the EPP against the other political groups in the European Parliament on Wednesday. The EPP insisted that Member States' constitutions fall under national sovereignty and that any number of European constitutions might be liable to dissection if the same standards of scrutiny were applied to them. The other groups argued that fundamental EU values and principles were at stake.
The debate was highly confrontational at times, with several quick-fire exchanges among MEPs. Fundamental Rights Commissioner Viviane Reding stressed that the Commission does not intervene in the constitutional processes of Member States, although it could do so "when the constitution is translated into legislative practice". She would "not hesitate a moment to intervene" if fundamental EU values or principles were infringed by national legislation.
Parliament is scheduled to vote on a resolution on this subject during the July plenary session.
