New faces will be looking out over the Chamber from next week
January is set to see crucial elections that will bring significant changes to the leadership of the European Parliament. On Tuesday MEPs will vote to elect a new President, 14 Vice-Presidents and 6 Quaestors (who handle administrative matters for Members). Later in the month the Chairs of all of Parliament's Committee's will also be decided. The elections mark the mid-point of the 2004-2009 parliamentary term.
The successful candidates will sit on two important decision-making committees inside the Parliament: the President will chair the "Conference of Presidents" where leaders of the political groups meet 2-3 times a month. Together, they determine the political direction of the Parliament by setting the agenda, legislative planning and agreeing on the composition of committees.
The President also sits on the "Bureau" with the Vice-Presidents and Quaestors. The Bureau deals with the administrative, financial and organisational running of the institution.
"An overwhelming responsibility"'
It is the election of a new President that is the most high profile of the new appointments as they act as the "public face" of the institution. The President holds office for two and a half years. Standing down next week is Spanish Socialist Josep Borrell who is the 25th holder of the office since the Common Assembly, the forerunner of the EP, was formed in 1952.
The President has a myriad of responsibilities: One former occupant - Nicole Fontaine of the European People's Party (1999-2002) - described the job as "an overwhelming responsibility but an exciting task".
The tasks of the President include:
Acting as "speaker" by chairing Parliamentary sessions.
Ensuring rules of procedure are applied so that the Plenary sessions function properly.
Chairing meetings of political group leaders and the Bureau.
Representing the Parliament - visiting heads of state and government are received by the President.
Presenting Parliament's viewpoint to EU leaders prior to European Council meetings.
Signing the EU budget and all legislation adopted under the co-decision procedure.
14 Vice-Presidents: 14 specific roles
The role of a Vice-President is to fill in for the President. Gérard Onesta of the Greens says the post has "three dimensions, it implies the management of the institution (buildings, civil servants), running of the plenary (presiding) and finally a protocol role".
It is common practice for a Vice-President to be given a specific area to deal with. Pierre Moscovici of the Socialist PSE group is in charge of relations with National Parliaments. He sees his role as to "strive to improve the legitimacy, quality and efficiency of EU lawmaking, in order to strengthen the knowledge of and support for the Union".
