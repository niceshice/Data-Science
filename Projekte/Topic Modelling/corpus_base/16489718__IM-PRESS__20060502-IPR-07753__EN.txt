Medicines for children: second-reading deal in the offing?

Children should soon be able to take medicines designed for their metabolism rather than small doses of drugs intended for adults. This is the upshot of a vote on a report on medicinal products for paediatric use which took place at the Environment Committee on Thursday and could pave the way for a second-reading agreement with the Council.
"The encouraging results of the common position will perhaps enable us to avoid conciliation and reach an agreement with the Council at second reading" , said Françoise Grossetête (EPP-ED, FR), whose report was approved by 39 votes to 2 with 2 abstentions.
In their amendments to the Member States' common position, MEPs are keen to strengthen the independence of the members of the Paediatric Committee, a scientific committee which will operate within the European Medicines Agency. MEPs believe that members of this committee should not "have financial or other interests in the pharmaceutical industry which could affect their impartiality, should undertake to act in the public interest and in an independent manner, and should make an annual declaration of their financial interests" .
Where the development of medicines for children could hamper the development of medicines for adults, MEPs wish to allow "justified derogations" from the requirement, proposed by the Commission, for firms to present the results of paediatric studies at the same time as human pharmaco-kinetic studies in adults.
Regarding the need to encourage the pharmaceutical industry to invest in new medicines, MEPs approved a transitional clause which states that, for five years after the regulation enters into force, "the application for an extension of the duration of a certificate already granted shall be lodged not later than six months before the expiry" of a Supplementary Protection Certificate.
To avoid being dependent on decisions by national authorities concerning the setting of prices for medicines or their inclusion in national health insurance schemes, products for which paediatric data is supposed to be submitted but which have received marketing authorisation in all Member States will be granted a 6-month extension of the Supplementary Protection Certificate.
