Clamping down on the derivatives trade
2012-03-26 - 15:37
Legislation to make trade over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives safer and more transparent will be put to a vote on Thursday. Derivatives trading is widely believed to have contributed to the global financial crisis. The draft regulation was provisionally agreed by Parliament and Council negotiators on 9 February. Obligatory clearing for OTC derivatives, reporting for all derivatives
The draft regulation lays down that OTC derivative contracts would have to be cleared through central counterparties (CCPs), thus reducing counterparty credit risk, i.e. the risk that one party to the contract may default.
In negotiations, MEPs secured a requirement that all derivative contracts (not only OTC derivatives), would have to be reported to central data centres or "trade repositories", which would have to publish aggregate positions by class of derivatives, thereby offering market players a clearer view of the market.
Strong role for ESMA
The work of trade repositories would be monitored by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), which would be responsible for granting or withdrawing their registration.
Parliament's negotiators strengthened ESMA's role by making it easier for it to block the authorisation of a CCP to operate on the EU's internal market. They also provided for binding mediation by ESMA in disputes among national authorities over the authorisation of CCPs.
Pension schemes
Finally, MEPs secured a "light touch" regime for pension schemes with regard to the clearing obligation. For these schemes, the obligation would not apply for three years, extendable by another two years plus one, subject to proper justification.
Background
The legislation puts into effect commitments given in Pittsburgh in September 2009 by G-20 leaders. That was about one year after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, a major player in the OTC derivatives market. The OTC derivatives market, which was valued at around â‚¬425 trillion in 2009. The legislation will enter into force 20 days after publication in the Official Journal.

Turkey's progress: MEPs to call for better treatment of journalists
2012-03-26 - 15:37
Turkey's laws curbing media freedom and numerous trials of journalists will be a key issue in Wednesday's debate on its EU accession prospects. On Thursday, MEPs will vote a resolution urging it to do more to reform the judiciary and protect civil liberties. The draft resolution voices concerns about the deterioration of media freedom and laws limiting the freedom of expression in Turkey, many court cases against journalists and excessively long pre-trial detention periods.
It stresses that reform for a modern, independent and impartial judiciary should create the right conditions for opening negotiations on justice and fundamental rights.
It says Turkey must put the 2010 constitutional reform package into effect, ensure that the political process works smoothly.
The draft regrets Turkey's statements that it will freeze relations with the EU's Cyprus Presidency if the northern Cyprus issue is not resolved by mid-2012. It nonetheless cites Turkey as a "source of inspiration for democratising Arab States."

Progress of Serbia, Kosovo and Montenegro towards joining the EU
2012-03-26 - 15:37
MEPs will assess the progress of Serbia, Kosovo and Montenegro towards joining the EU in a debate on Wednesday and a resolution to be voted on Thursday. Serbia
The draft resolution says EU accession negotiations with Serbia should start as soon as possible, provided that Serbia pursues its reforms, in particular of the judiciary and prosecution service.
It also welcomes the February 2012 agreement between Belgrade and Pristina on how Serbia and Kosovo will manage their joint borders, but voices grave concerns about the clashes between NATO soldiers and ethnic Serbs in north Kosovo in the second half of 2011.
Kosovo
The draft resolution recommends that the five EU Member States that have yet to recognise Kosovo's independence should do so, noting that 85 countries have already done so. It also reiterates that the EU must engage with Kosovo to preserve stability and security in the EU's immediate neighbourhood.
The key remaining challenges for Kosovo include returning refugees and internally displaced people, corruption and the unstable and tense situation in the north, adds the draft.
Montenegro
The draft resolution notes Montenegro's "significant progress" ands welcome the Council's intention to start EU accession negotiations with it in June.
However, the draft also underlines the need to implement reforms, most importantly to combat corruption and organized crime.

MEPs to urge Commission to strengthen air passenger rights
2012-03-26 - 15:37
Airlines should give stranded passengers clear information and immediate help, MEPs say in a draft resolution to be voted on Thursday. When airlines go bankrupt or cease flying, passengers should be repatriated free of charge, it adds. Air carriers should be obliged to ensure that there are competent contact personnel who can give passengers useful contact details, including help by telephone, says the resolution, drafted by Keith Taylor (Greens/EFA, UK). MEPs also call on the Commission to draw up a standard form for complaints in all EU languages, to be handed to passengers in the event of disruption.
Passengers stranded when airlines go bankrupt or cease operations should be repatriated free of charge, it adds.
The resolution also urges the Commission to harmonise rules on hand luggage and to put an end to unfair commercial practices such as unclear pricing and non-optional-extra fees when booking online, unilateral rescheduling of flights and price discrimination against passengers based on their country of residence. Passengers should have the right to withdraw or change their ticket reservations free of charge within two hours, it says.
Finally, safe children seats should be foreseen on each plane and airlines should review their pricing policy to offer reduced fares for children over 2 years old.

EU resettlement programme for refugees
2012-03-26 - 15:37
EU countries would get more EU support to resettle refugees on their territory if Parliament approves a new joint resettlement programme on Thursday. Starting in 2013, the programme would focus on vulnerable refugees, such as women at risk and unaccompanied minors. The programme would resettle in the EU people who have been granted refugee status in third countries (for example, Libyan refugees in Tunisia).
It aims to encourage EU Member States to take up more refugees, by extending the list of those whose resettlement would be financed by the European Refugee Fund, such as children and women at risk, unaccompanied minors, people with serious medical needs and, at Parliament's request, refugees in need of urgent resettlement for legal or physical reasons.
The programme would also set a series of annual geographical priorities. In 2013, these would include Iraqi refugees in Turkey, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan; Afghan refugees in Turkey, Pakistan and Iran; Congolese refugees in Burundi, Malawi, Rwanda and Zambia and Somali refugees in Ethiopia.
In line with MEPs' proposals, EU countries resettling refugees for the first time would receive additional financial support from the European Refugee Fund (â‚¬6,000 per resettled person in the first year, â‚¬5,000 in the second year and â‚¬4,000 in subsequent years).

EP budget 2013 to be frozen in real terms
2012-03-26 - 15:37
Parliament votes on its administrative budget for 2013 on Thursday. The Budgets Committee recommends that the increase in the budget should not exceed the EU-wide inflation rate of 1.9%, which means freezing it in real terms. However, â‚¬8,5 million should be added to accommodate the arrival of Croatian MEPs, it says. MEPs will also point to the substantial savings that could be made by having only one work place instead of three (Brussels, Strasbourg, Luxembourg), and will seek to ensure that no European Parliament money is granted to non-democratic parties.

2012-03-26 - 15:37
MEPs will ask the European Commission on Thursday when it will table legislation to keep the EU's food aid for the needy programme running after 2013. In February 2012, the programme, on which 18 million of the EU's poorest citizens in 20 Member States now rely, won a reprieve until the end of 2013, despite opposition from some EU Member States.
Parliament is a strong advocate of keeping the EU programme.
