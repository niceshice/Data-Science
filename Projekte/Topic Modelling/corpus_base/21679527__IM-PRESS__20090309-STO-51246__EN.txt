Swedish MEP Jan Andersson in his office in Strasbourg. 10 March 2009 The New Deal helped revive America's economy in the 1930's but could a similar thing work in Europe now? Swedish Social Democrat Jan Andersson believes so and his plans will be debated by MEPs Wednesday morning. With Eurozone unemployment at 8.2% and growing, he wants "green jobs" created through renovating energy inefficient houses and investment in green transport like trains. Up to 7 million more people could be jobless in two years and Wednesday morning sees MEPs debate the economy.
Debate this issue! We want you to tell us how the European Union should create jobs. Click on the first link below and scroll to the bottom to offer your opinion.
The levels of unemployment vary widely across the EU. The highest is in Spain at 14.8% and the lowest is in the Netherlands with 2.8%. In Germany it is 7.2% and in France 7.9%.
Families and pensioners targeted
Speaking to us ahead of the debate Mr Andersson said he also wanted measures to stimulate consumption by providing extra money to "vulnerable groups like families and pensioners."
In terms of who would pay for this the Swede believes that every EU member should devote at least 2% of its GDP to these issues. He also believes that the European Social Fund, the Globalisation Fund and the European Investment Bank should play a role. In November last year the European Commission launched the "European Economic Recovery Plan" which proposed a stimulus of 1.5% of EU GDP or 200 billion Euros as well as other measures.
Unemployment a "catastrophe" for young
In particular Jan Andersson is concerned about young people not being able to find work. He wants every country to create "a job, apprenticeship, additional training or other kinds of employability" for everyone who leaves school.
He went on to warn: "It's a catastrophe if young people leave school and head into unemployment. We know from experience in the 1990s if they are unemployed for several years then perhaps they never get back into the labour market."
Now tell us what you think!
