The Flame of Peace at the EP
European Parliament President Josep Borrell Monday received the "Flame of Peace" at the beginning of the final plenary session of the year in Strasbourg. The flame comes from Bethlehem, passes through Austria and will be carried into all 25 countries of the European Union.
The Flame of Peace "reminds us of the Nativity as a symbol of peace and understanding among the people of the world," Borrell said. "Because Europe has not always lived in peace, on the contrary, and peace is something that has to be conquered day by day, I sincerely appreciate that you brought this flame of peace to the European Parliament, so that we can remember," he added.
The Parliament has received the flame of peace for the past nine years. The ceremony was opened by organiser Austrian People's Party MEP Paul RÃ¼big. "This is a perfect introduction to the upcoming Austrian Presidency of the EU," Borrell said.
The Peace Light of Bethlehem started life in 1986 in Austria, where it was part of a charitable relief mission for handicapped children and people in need. The flame came from Bethlehem (the birthplace of Jesus Christ) to Austria, where it was distributed throughout the country by the Scout movement. The main idea of the project was to bring the message of light and peace to as many people as possible.
