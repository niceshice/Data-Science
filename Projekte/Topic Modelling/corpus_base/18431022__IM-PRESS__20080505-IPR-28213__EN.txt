MEPs adopted a non-binding report drawn up by Josu ORTUONDO LARREA (ALDE, ES) recommending approval to the conclusion of a fisheries agreement between the European Community and Seychelles. Fishing opportunities remain unchanged (40 tuna seiners from France, Spain and Italy and 12 surface longliners from France, Spain and Portugal), the annual financial contribution increases from 4 125 000 euros to 5 355 000 euros and the reference tonnage from 55 000 tonnes to 63.000 tonnes.
In the explanatory statement of the report, Josu ORTUONDO LARREA highlights that this is the Communityâ€™s biggest tuna agreement with a third country in terms of both reference tonnage and financial contribution and a key element ensuring the consistency and viability of other tuna agreements between the Community and other countries in the Indian Ocean (Madagascar, Comoros, Mauritius, Mozambique).
The purpose of the proposed agreement is to amend the existing Protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Seychelles, adopted on 23 January 2006, which repealed and replaced the agreement of 1987.
The Protocol, which will apply until 17 January 2011, sets out the following fishing opportunities:
Tuna seiners
Spain: 22 vessels
France: 17 vessels
Italy: 1 vessel
Surface longliners
Spain: 2 vessels
France: 5 vessels
Portugal: 5 vessels
