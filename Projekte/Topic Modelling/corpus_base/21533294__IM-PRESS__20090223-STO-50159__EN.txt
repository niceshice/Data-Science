All the paper used in the EP is recycled and chlorine-free Climate change is something that needs to be addressed by everybody, including public institutions. It's a well-known adage that actions speak louder than words, which is the reason the European Parliament is planning to cut its CO2 emissions 30% by 2020.
It is already at work. Since 2007, the Parliament has implemented the Ecological Management and Audit scheme standard (EMAS), it uses chlorine-free paper, which it recycles, computers automatically shut down in the evening and energy consumption is down by 25%.
Last week, the Parliament agreed measures to reduce its carbon footprint 30% by 2020 compared with 2006. Measures include:
Improved energy performance : Use of photovoltaic and solar thermal energy. Construction of "passive buildings" (buildings that harness natural heat from the sun and inhabitants).
Transport : Promote the use of bicycles, public transport (train, bus, subway) and walking.
Fresh thinking : Launch a communication plan to raise the awareness and change the behaviour of EP staff.
Suppliers : Encourage them to reduce their carbon emissions.
Annual EP CO2 savingsâ€¦
Use of green energy at the EP's 3 sites - 18000 tonnes
Recycling paper - 800 tonnes
25% cut in energy consumption - 2500 tonnes
