MEPs voted to support a €21 million anti-drug programme
Consumer protection and action against drug use were just two of the issues MEPs gave their support to on Thursday. The day also saw MEPs urge greater coherence in the EU's consumer protection rules. In particular fears over the safety of Chinese toys and protection for online shoppers featured in the debate. The day also saw two written declarations adopted - one calling for the European "112" emergency number to be more publicised and another one calling for an end to testing on primates.
Consumer protection: MEPs support more coherent rules
Members gave their support to a European Commission Green Paper which aims to give greater coherence to the 8 EU directives that currently cover consumer protection. The House voted to support a report drafted by French Socialist Béatrice Patrie. Two issues raised in the debate were concerns raised over the standards of Chinese toys following recent recalls of products for safety reasons in the US.
Speaking in the debate, Liberal MEP Diana Wallis, from the Parliament's Legal Affairs Committee, stressed the importance of coherence in Consumer protection. In particular she addressed her remarks to the Meglena Kuneva - the European Commissioner responsible who also took part in the debate.
MEPs were also concerned about the protection afforded to consumers by online shopping - especially as this form of trade is increasingly making national borders irrelevant. Finnish member Alex Stubb of the centre right EPP-ED regaled his colleagues with his own experiences: "I am a mega shopper - I love to shop on the internet". However, he said that "things do not often go well, you buy something and Amazon.com send you the wrong books". He called for a revision and a modernisation of the present consumers´ rights.
The European Commission's "review of the Consumer Acquis" (EU law) was launched in 2004 and forms part of the wider "better regulation" drive aimed at simpler, clearer European law.
MEPs support €21 million anti-drugs drive
Yesterday members of the European Parliament gave their backing for a 7 year anti-drug programme across the European Union. With €21.35 million allocated to prevent and reduce drug addiction MEPs are hopeful it can help improve the lives of many people living with drug addiction across the 27 countries of the Union. The vote by members at the second reading stage on Thursday followed a report by Swedish Social Democrat Inger Segelström. It forms part of the "Fundamental Rights and Justice Programme" which runs until 2013.
112 distress number - more callers needed
If you have an emergency while abroad you can use the 112 emergency number to call for help. Unfortunately not many people across the European Union know this. A total of 512 MEPs have signed a written declaration calling for the Commission to promote the number and ensure it works effectively in all EU states. One idea mentioned in the declaration is a "European 112 Day" to raise awareness.
A written declaration is a method MEPs use to start or prompt a debate on a particular subject. To be formally adopted the declaration must be signed by over half of the 732 members.
Opposition to primate testing and experimentation
Another written declaration on Thursday saw MEPs unite in opposition to the use of apes and wild-caught monkeys in scientific experiments. It is believed that 10,000 primates are used in experiments across the European Union each year.
Primates share more than 90% of their DNA with humans and there capacity for suffering and distress has been well proven. Speaking after the debate, Slovenian Liberal member Mojca Drčar Murko said that "biologists convinced me that a gradual replacement of scientific experiments on primates by alternative methods is needed". She called such experiments "morally questionable".
The MEPs also adopted report on human rights dialogues on human rights with third countries.
The session ended with a debate and vote on human rights issues, namely in Burma, Bangladesh and about the financing of the Special Court for Sierra Leone. The next plenary will take place 24-27 September in Strasbourg.
