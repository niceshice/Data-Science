350 MEPs, MPs and IT experts will take part in the 2 day conference The recent US elections have shown the power and influence that new technologies can exert in mobilising people to vote. The role that the internet, websites and web-TV can play in parliamentary politics will be debated by over 350 MEPs, MPs and IT experts in a two day conference at the European Parliament in Brussels 25-26 November. You can watch the debates live online here.
The conference will be an attempt to share best practices and lessons learned from the use of "Information and Communication Technologies" (ICT) in parliaments around the world.
It will discuss ways in which parliaments around the globe can properly embrace new technology and make it work for elected MPs and the public who vote for them.
The two days of debates will also look at what role IT can play in strengthening the legislative and oversight functions of democratic institutions, as well as getting people more involved in the workings of their parliaments.
The conference builds on the results of the World e-Parliament Conference held in Geneva in October 2007, as well as the outcome of the World e-Parliament Report 2008 - the first publication on this topic issued by the United Nations.
You can watch it live online on Tuesday 1100-1300 and Wednesday 11.00-13.00 and in the afternoon from 15.00-16.30.
