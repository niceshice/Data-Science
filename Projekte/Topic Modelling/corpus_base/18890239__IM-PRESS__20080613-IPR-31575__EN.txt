Speaking at the opening of the Strasbourg plenary, EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering said: "The referendum result of 13 June 2008 in Ireland confronts the EU with one of the most difficult challenges in its history. The Lisbon Reform Treaty, derived from the Constitutional Treaty, which itself was drafted by a Convention meeting in public and comprising members of national parliaments and the European Parliament, allows the EU more democracy, greater ability to act and greater transparency.
It strengthens the European Parliament, gives national parliaments more responsibility in determining the course of European policy, allows citizens of the European Union a power of initiative in relation to the European Institutions, and guarantees local self-government.
The Lisbon Treaty is the answer to criticisms which citizens have levelled at the deficits of the European Union. This Treaty brings the European Union closer to its citizens. We must make it abundantly clear that the adoption of the Reform Treaty is an absolute necessity, to enable the European Union to defend its values and interests in the 21st century. Without the reforms which are made possible by the Lisbon Treaty, the accession of further countries to the European Union is hardly conceivable. We call upon the EU Summit on Thursday and Friday in Brussels to take all appropriate steps to make the Reform Treaty a reality.
The ratification process must continue without reservation. We call upon the Irish Government, for its part, to submit proposals as to how we can jointly progress beyond this difficult phase in European politics. The European Parliament will devote all its energies and display maximum commitment to overcoming these challenges. We expect the same of the European Commission and of the governments of all European Union Member States. We equally expect the European Parliament to be comprehensively involved in the work concerned. It remains our goal to see the Lisbon Treaty enter into force before the elections of June 2009 to the European Parliament. Provided that you agree to this, I shall resolutely defend these principles to the European Council on 19 and 20 June in Brussels."
