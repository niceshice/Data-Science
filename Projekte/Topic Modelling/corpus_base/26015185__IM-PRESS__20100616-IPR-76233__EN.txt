Parliament condemned the torpedoing of South Korean ship Chenoan, and said the matter should be referred to the UN Security Council, in a resolution passed on Thursday. It nonetheless advocated maintaining humanitarian aid to North Korea.
In a resolution approved by a show of hands, Parliament condemned the sinking of the South Korean corvette Chenoan on 26 March this year, which led to the loss of 46 lives. MEPs see the attack as a provocative act against peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula.
Parliament notes the Joint Investigation Group report's conclusion that the sinking was caused by a North Korean torpedo. MEPs are disappointed that China and Russia "have still not taken a clear position on the conclusions of the report", and also call on China "to exert a positive influence on North Korea", to ensure that the conflict does not escalate further.
MEPs commend the restraint demonstrated by South Korea, deeply regret the tragic incident and express solidarity with the families of the deceased and the Korean people.
The resolution says the matter should be referred to the UN Security Council, and calls on both Koreas to step up their efforts to promote lasting peace and security in the Peninsula.
Finally, Parliament calls on the Commission to maintain existing humanitarian aid programmes and keep communication channels with North Korea open.
