Failure by their customers to pay their bills promptly can mean insolvency for many companies. Â©BELGA ALL BILLS TO BE PAID IN 30 DAYS 60 DAYS FOR HEALTHCARE OR IF BOTH PARTIES AGREE In the present economic crisis late payments for goods or services can mean the difference between staying in business and going bankrupt. Smaller businesses across Europe are particularly vulnerable to late payments from customers. Members of the cross party Internal Market Committee Tuesday (5 Wednesday) backed a 30 day limit for payments from the private and public sector. If payments are later then financial penalties must be paid. Payments up to 60 days can be made if both parties agree.
For providers of healthcare the limit will now be 60 days as social security costs can take time to be reimbursed. The penalties agreed are the base interest rate plus 8% and recovery costs of 40 euro.
Smaller businesses may benefit most
In their negotiations with the European Commission and the Council of ministers of European governments, MEPs pushed strongly for public authorities across the European Union to not be allowed to exceed 60 days for repayments. It was this that formed the basis of an agreement reached on 13 September and which has been endorsed by the Internal Market Committee.
Late payments are not just a nuisance. They can lead to closures for small businesses and the resulting job losses. The problem is being exacerbated at present because banks are less willing to provide bridging loans for small businesses waiting for late payments. For example a local newspaper may struggle to pay staff and printing costs if a customer does not pay their bills on time. MEPs are hoping the 30 day limit will help small and medium size businesses with their cash flow.
"A level playing field"
This proposed new regulation will have legally binding effect and if adopted by the full Parliament in October will be merged into national laws. It will have considerable effect as it will exert considerable pressure on public authorities across Europe to pay their bills on time.
Speaking after the September agreement German Socialist MEP Barbara Weiler, who guided the measures through Parliament, said that the " Parliament has secured a level playing field and clear-cut rules for all players, to the benefit of Europe's many small and medium-sized companies". She went on to say that "this deal means that small and medium size business will no longer be forced to serve as banks for public enterprises or big companies".
