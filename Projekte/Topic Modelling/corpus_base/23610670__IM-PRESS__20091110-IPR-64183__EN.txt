Call for joint EU action on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's

Plans to coordinate research across Europe on neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s received strong backing from the European Parliament in a resolution adopted on Thursday. The aim is to pool skills, knowledge and funding and thus maximise the benefits of work being done in the 27 EU countries.
Around 7.3 million people suffer from Alzheimer's disease and related disorders in Europe, a figure that is expected to double by 2020. No cures are available at the moment and knowledge about prevention and treatment is limited.
Today's resolution urges the EU Member States to develop a common research agenda in the field of neurodegenerative diseases while also improving epidemiological data on Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia.
Large-scale studies with better use of data and methods
Early diagnostic tests, research into risk factors (such as the environment) and criteria for early diagnosis are crucial in the fight against the disease. MEPs want to see transnational cooperation on large-scale epidemiological and clinical studies, as well as a multidisciplinary approach embracing diagnosis, treatment, prevention and social research
Research should also explore the links between the ageing process and dementia and between dementia and depression in the elderly, says the resolution. Research priorities should include prevention, early diagnosis and standard diagnostic tools and the creation of broad-based databases.
Better awareness and less red tape
MEPs urge the Commission to include the problems of dementia in all EU disease prevention measures, while the Member States are encouraged to promote ‘brain-healthy' lifestyles. A European Year of the Brain should be launched to raise awareness of brain-related diseases associated with ageing.
Parliament stresses that the pilot project should avoid creating new administrative structures. It should also collaborate where possible with industry to benefit from all available resources and experience.
New legal basis for future initiatives
Last but not least, MEPs believe that all future initiatives on joint research activities should be adopted under the EU's legal competency for research. This would give Parliament co-decision powers once the Lisbon Treaty enters into force.
