Is the European Parliament - what it does, how it functions, who works there - just a big mystery to you? Well it won't be to the group of 181 trainees who came to soak up the atmosphere in 2005.
The Parliament attracted over 4000 applications from 78 countries for paid internships this year, but was only able to offer places to a lucky few. "The number of trainees we can accept depends on the budget available and the capacity of the services to supervise the work and physically accommodate the trainees," according to the EP's Traineeships Office.
The EP receives about twice as many applications from women as from men. The interns, who must be university graduates, have the opportunity to work in Brussels, as well as Luxembourg and in EP information offices elsewhere, for 5 months and to get a real feel for "the parliament spirit", as Chiara Sassoli, a Belgian trainee commented. "It's very interesting to be among MEPs, some of them discussing the recent delegation to Afghanistan others talking about education," she said.
"Not only is it being where the political decisions are taken, it is also working with all the other trainees from all around Europe that makes this experience unforgettable," added Pietro Naj-Oleari from Milan.
The EP also awards unpaid traineeships to people with A-levels, or equivalent in higher or technical education. In 2005 it took on 130 unpaid trainees out of 2053 applicants from 57 countries.
The other EU institutions also offer internships with the Commission taking in around 10 times the number that the parliament can.
