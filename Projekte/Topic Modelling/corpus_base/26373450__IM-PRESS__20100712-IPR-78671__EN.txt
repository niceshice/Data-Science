The EU needs a strategy by 2011 to encourage the creation of green jobs, says a draft resolution by the Employment and Social Affairs Committee that was adopted on Wednesday. Training and education systems must be tailored to match these new types of work, add MEPs.
The post-crisis economy should be an opportunity for sustainable growth, argues the resolution, which was drafted by Elisabeth Schroedter (Greens/EFA, DE) and adopted by 43 votes to 1 with 3 abstentions.
EU strategy
At the heart of the resolution is a call to the Commission to propose by 2011 a strategy with legislative and non-legislative measures to encourage green jobs. The Commission is also urged to develop specific policies to ease the transition towards a green economy, especially through the re-skilling of workers and assistance for the greening of European industry.
The EU 2020 Strategy on growth and jobs has missed an opportunity to address the labour market potential of a sustainable economy, believes the Employment Committee.
EU funds
Member States should use the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to implement European objectives and to promote new skills, including new sustainable "green" high-quality jobs, say MEPs. Regions should also use the European Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund to create new sustainable jobs.
Training
National training and education systems must be adapted to retrain workers in sectors that will be affected by the transition towards a new sustainable economy, argues the resolution.
Incentives for companies
Lastly, incentives are needed to prompt companies to invest more in clean technologies, believe MEPs. They call for efficient funding systems and tax breaks to help small and medium-sized firms steer towards green employment policies and ensure green innovations and production.
