Opening of September II plenary session: Minute of silence for victim of ETA bombing / Funding of the No campaign in Ireland
EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering opened the September II plenary session referring to the recent car bombing in Northern Spain in which a 46 years old military officer, Luis Conde de la Cruz, lost his life.. This was the third car bomb which exploded within 24 hours in Spain. In these terrorist attacks several people were injured, one of them seriously. The President said that the European Parliament is deeply concerned and condemns these terrorist acts.
Questions over the funding of the No campaign in Ireland on the Lisbon Treaty referendum
Raising a point of order, Co-President Daniel Cohn Bendit (Greens/EFA , DE) said that the Irish press had recently revealed that there possibly exists a link between the financers of the no-campaign in Ireland and the Pentagon as well as the CIA. He asked President Pöttering to look into the matter so that transparency is achieved. In response, EP President Hans-Gert said that Parliament must continue to follow this affair very closely. The facts must be put on the table. We cannot, he said, allow Europe to be harmed by people who demand transparency but do not provide it themselves.
MEPs debate consequences of financial crisis - and how to improve the system
The financial market crisis which reached a new peak last week was the subject of a debate with the Council and Commission, with MEPs calling for action to improve the supervision of financial markets in the EU and around the world.
Ecumenical Patriarch of the Orthodox Church addresses Parliament
Addressing a formal sitting of the House as part of European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, the Ecumenical Patriarch of the Orthodox Church, Bartholomew I, spoke of the value of the European project in promoting peace and tolerance, the importance of accepting minorities and the need for the EU to accept Turkey as a member. He also underlined his church's efforts to encourage respect for the environment.
Resolution on the Commission's 2009 Work Programme rejected
Parliament rejected a proposed joint resolution (from the EPP-ED, ALDE and UEN groups) on the European Parliament priorities for the European Commission Work and Legislative Programme 2009 with 102 votes in favour, 306 against and 207 abstentions. All individual group resolutions were also rejected by the House.
MEPs call for a European license for online music sales
The European online music market needs a common legislative framework to take account of the specificity of digital services and safeguard European cultural diversity and small stakeholders. In a resolution approved on Thursday with 509 votes in favour, 24 against and 29 abstentions, Parliament also criticises the Commission for ignoring MEPs' suggestions in this field.

Telecoms package
Better services for consumers and a safer internet
The European Parliament adopted a legislative report by Malcolm Harbour (EPP-ED, UK) at first-reading aimed at providing wider access to telecoms services, more information for consumers and stronger data protection. All the major political groups in Parliament agreed a compromise before the plenary vote which does not alter the main goal of the draft legislation - to improve the position of telecom users - but they greatly clarify its aims, notably as regards protection of privacy and fundamental rights.
Fair competition and flexible spectrum allocation to boost new wireless services
In adopting Pilar del Castillo's (EPP-ED, ES) report, MEPs backed her suggestion to create a Body of European Regulators in Telecommunications (BERT). As an independent expert advisory body, BERT will help ensure fair competition and high-quality services across the EU by ensuring that national regulators use similar tools when faced with similar market situations. In their vote on the new framework directive for electronic communications networks and services, based on a report by Catherine Trautmann (PES, FR), MEPs set out a "co-regulation" system: national authorities have to consult the Commission and BERT before taking regulatory decisions. If BERT considers the measure inappropriate or ineffective, the Commission may require the national regulatory authority to amend it. The report was adopted with 597 votes in favour 55 against and 29 abstentions. In the own-initiative report, drafted by Patrizia Toia (ALDE, IT), on the use of the spectrum released by the switchover from analogue to digital broadcasting - the "digital dividend"- MEPs call on the Commission to propose measures to Parliament and Council for better coordinating the use of the digital dividend at EU level.

Written declaration on combating the trafficking of children adopted
The President of the European Parliament announced the adoption of the written declaration on combating the trafficking of children since more than half of all MEPs have signed the declaration (407 out of 785). The declaration calls on the Member States to recognise the fight against child trafficking as a priority objective in their national child protection policies. The declaration, together with the names of the signatories, are now forwarded to the Council and the Commission.
MEPs adopt written declaration on the proclamation of 23 August as European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism
European Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering announced the adoption of the written declaration on the proclamation of 23 August as European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism since it has been signed by more than half of all MEPs (409 out of 785 on 15 September)
EU-India Summit: MEPs back Free Trade Agreement by end of 2008
In adopting a joint resolution on the preparations for the EU-India Summit, (Marseille, 29 September 2008) MEPs underline their firm commitment to the establishment of a comprehensive, wide-ranging and ambitious Free Trade Agreement between the EU and India and urges both sides to work towards bringing negotiations to a successful conclusion by the end of 2008. The resolution was adopted with 392 votes in favour, 44 against and 29 abstentions.
Combating terrorism / protection of personal data - MEPs underline freedom of expression
The European Parliament voted to beef up the data protection provisions of a proposed Council framework decision on police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters in its third report on this proposal. MEPs feel that the text had been weakened by the political agreement in the Council, which needs unanimity. The report was adopted with 556 votes in favour 90 against and 19 abstentions.
Area of freedom, security and justice: MEPs call for priorities 2010-2014 to be set out
In adopting a resolution by 488 votes in favour, 88 against and 19 abstentions on the annual debate on the progress made in 2007 in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ), the House calls on the European Council, the Council and the Commission to initiate the process of determining priorities for the forthcoming AFSJ multiannual programme for the period 2010-2014, on the basis of an ambitious and coherent approach and join the European Parliament in its dialogue with the national parliaments on the priorities for the period 2010-2014.
Fight obesity earlier in life say MEPs
Overweight, obesity and diet-related disease are approaching epidemic proportions, notes the own-initiative report by Alessandro Foglietta (UEN, IT). Obesity already accounts directly for about 6% of health spending, but the indirect costs are much higher, says the report. Obesity is one of Europe's most serious public health problems, because it significantly increases the risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers.
MEPs call for new legislation to ensure financial stability
In a report drawn up by Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (PES, DK), the Parliament asks for a series of legislative measures on issues related to hedge funds and private equity, the report was adopted with 562 votes in favour 86 against and 25 abstentions. A related report, also adopted, drafted by Klaus-Heine Lehne (EPP-ED, DE), focuses in particular on transparency issues affecting these sectors.
Updating VAT rules on financial services
MEPs have backed an update of the rules regarding the VAT treatment of financial services and insurance, with a number of amendments. The aim is to ensure legal certainty in a sector which has changed dramatically since the current rules were drawn up over 30 years ago. The report was adopted by 493 votes in favour to 90 against and ten abstentions.
Energy prices: MEPs say the EU must take action to boost EU economy
The House expressed its concern at the increase in energy prices, notably because of its negative effect on the world economy and consumers, which is also hampering the attainment of the EU's Lisbon Strategy objectives. In adopting a joint resolution on getting a grip on energy prices, MEPs emphasise, that unless there is a global concerted shift in energy policy and consumption, the energy demand will continue to grow in the coming decades. MEPs underline the necessity to take measures that will enable the EU economy to maintain its competitiveness and to adapt to the new energy price environment.
2009 to be designated European Year of Creativity and Innovation
Parliament adopted a report backing a Commission proposal for 2009 to be designated 'European Year of Creativity and Innovation’. However, while the Commission chiefly wishes to emphasise lifelong learning, the European Parliament proposes a broader focus, highlighting a wider range of EU programmes. Each year the EU chooses a theme for a campaign aimed at raising public awareness of, and drawing national governments' attention to, a specific issue.
Mountain farming: MEPs call for special strategy
Farming in mountainous areas is practised in difficult conditions and plays a crucial role in preserving the environment and biodiversity. It, therefore, requires a special strategy, says an own-initiative report adopted by Parliament. Agriculture in upland areas, which are home to nearly 20% of Europe's population, currently faces high production costs as well as transport and communication problems. "There are as many different legal frameworks for Europe's mountain areas as there are Member States in the European Union itself", according to MEP Michl Ebner (EPP-ED, IT), whose report was adopted by 487 votes in favour and 73 against.
International Tropical Timber Agreement not enough to protect forests
The House welcomes the conclusion of the 2006 ITTA (International Tropical Timber Agreement) but considers that the outcome falls well short of what is required to address the loss of tropical forest. A report by Carole Lucas (Greens/EFA, UK) was adopted as well as a motion for a resolution. MEPs call on the Commission and Member States to increase the financial resources available for the conservation and ecologically responsible use of tropical forests and to promote economically viable alternatives to destructive logging, mining and agricultural practices.
Petitions Committee: listening to the EU's citizens
Parliament's Petitions Committee had another busy year, as is described in its annual activity report for 2007. The report by David Hammerstein (Greens/EFA, ES) was adopted, with amendments, by 603 votes in favour to 17 against with 25 abstentions. The number of petitions submitted by the public increased, as did the proportion lodged electronically through the EP website, while members of the committee undertook six fact-finding missions. Environmental issues and fundamental rights were the subjects most frequently raised by petitioners.
Member States to fulfil their ODA volumes, warn MEPs
Member States are asked to raise Official Development Aid (ODA) volumes to achieve their promised target of 0,56% of GNI in 2010. Otherwise the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will not be reached by 2015. MEPs say that the 2007 decreases in reported aid levels are due in some cases to the artificial inflation of figures in 2006 by debt relief, in a report adopted by the EP on the follow-up of the Monterrey Conference of 2002 on Financing for Development. In the adopted report ,drafted by Thijs Berman (PES, NL), MEPs express serious concern that a majority of the Member States (18 out of 27, especially Latvia, Italy, Portugal, Greece and the Czech Republic) were unable to raise their level of ODA between 2006 and 2007 and that there has even been a dramatic reduction of over 10% in a number of countries such as Belgium, France and the United Kingdom.
Maritime package: Parliament still at odds with Council
In a series of reports at second-reading on the third maritime package, the Parliament deplores the fact that over a year after its first reading vote in April 2007 on proposals to protect Europe against maritime accidents and pollution, Member State transport ministers are still blocking two areas namely on flag state obligations and civil liability and have not taken up most of Parliament's recommendations on the other issues. MEPs urge the French Presidency to find a solution as soon as possible so as to avoid a probable conciliation procedure.
MEPs defend media pluralism and call for discussion of blogs
Media pluralism must be safeguarded and all citizens should have access to free media, MEPs underline in a resolution adopted on Thursday. To prevent owners, shareholders or governments from interfering with editorial content, MEPs advocate creation of editorial charters. They also encourage an open discussion of the status of weblogs. The European Parliament adopted a resolution by 307 votes in favour to 262 against urging the Commission and the Member States to safeguard media pluralism and ensure that all EU citizens can access free and diversified media. 20080923BRI37872 Draft agenda for Brussels part-session (8-9 October) is now available Texts adopted 23-25 September 2008

Opening of September II plenary session: Minute of silence for victim of ETA bombing / Funding of the No campaign in Ireland
2008-09-25 - 17:43
EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering opened the September II plenary session and said: "Yesterday evening the terrorist organisation ETA committed murder again. A 46 years old military officer, Luis Conde de la Cruz, was the victim of a car bombing in Northern Spain. This was the third car bomb which exploded within 24 hours in Spain. In these terrorist attacks several people were injured, one of them seriously. " The question on financing the No campaign in Ireland was also raised. On the ETA bombing, President Pöttering said "The European Parliament strongly condemns these terrorist acts and wants to express its deep concern. On behalf of the European Parliament I wish to express my deepest condolences to the family and all the relatives of the officer Luis Conde de la Cruz, as well as our solidarity with Spain, its authorities and very especially the Spanish Security forces. I would also like to send a message of support and solidarity to the people injured in the bombings and their families.
Terrorism is a direct attack on freedom, human rights and democracy. We have to state it very clearly . I want to reiterate once again that nothing can justify terrorism. We must work together in combating terrorism under the force of the rule of Law and democracy.
The EU is a community built on solidarity. A terrorist attack in any part of the EU is a terrorist attack in the entire European Union, against each one of us.
Let us now observe a moment’s silence."
Questions over the funding of the No campaign in Ireland on the Lisbon Treaty referendum
Raising a point of order, Co-President Daniel Cohn Bendit (Greens/EFA , DE) said: " Last weekend, the Irish press revealed that there possibly exists a link between the financers of the no-campaign in Ireland and the Pentagon as well as the CIA. This was a very interesting story and the explanation given was that Europe should not become too strong. I would ask the President to please clarify this matter and suggest that we also ask the Council as well as the Commission to inform us next time, because if this story turns out to be true it would be an interesting fact indeed, confirming what lies behind the €1.2 million which was used to finance the no-campaign in Ireland. I therefore would like to ask the President to please look into the matter so that we receive information and achieve transparency."
In response, EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering said: " I have been following this whole matter very attentively for some time. We do indeed need absolute transparency on this (matter) because this is exactly what those who are attacking us demand. However, they must of course comply with these standards themselves, i.e. they must provide total transparency on what funds this organisation.
We have learned from the Irish media - and I am quoting what we read in Ireland during the past week - that in the past Mr Ganley claimed that the donations come from ordinary citizens, and that they are small donations. According to the reports, he now has admitted that he himself has donated €200 000 of his personal assets to his organisation, and it has also been confirmed in the meantime that Mr Ganley has signed contracts with the Pentagon over the execution of military orders amounting to about 200 million - I believe - dollars. Other estimates are much higher. We must continue to follow this affair very closely. The facts must be put on the table. We cannot allow Europe to be harmed by people who demand transparency but do not provide it themselves.
I would like to emphasise my high regard for the Irish Minister of European Affairs, Dick Roche , who has made it his personal cause to shed light on this issue and I explicitly support him in his uncompromising approach. Ladies and gentlemen, I deduce from your applause that we stand on the side of those who strive for absolute transparency in all of these questions in order to keep Europe from suffering harm.

MEPs debate consequences of financial crisis - and how to improve the system
2008-09-25 - 17:43
The financial market crisis which reached a new peak last week was the subject of a debate with the Council and Commission, with MEPs calling for action to improve the supervision of financial markets in the EU and around the world. Council
"We appear to be witnessing the end of an era", MEPs were told by French European Affairs Minister Jean-Pierre JOUYET , who opened the debate on behalf of the Council. "The financial system in coming years will be very different from the one we are familiar with".
"For some time, there have been voices calling for changes to the world financial system", whose recent problems linked to the rapid growth in complex financial systems were "basically caused by greed", he said.
"Europe has not seen a crisis like this since the 1930s", argued the minister, and the French presidency's view was that the response must be "a strong, united Europe". Fortunately, thanks to economic and monetary union, Europe with its central bank has "a system that can intervene firmly and efficiently". He paid tribute to the ECB for its action in the crisis.
After referring to the decision in most EU Member States and the USA to ban short-selling for a limited period, Mr Jouyet added "we are not considering initiatives of US kind for now, buying toxic assets held by investors. The financial system of EU is still stable and does not require this type of measure".
Urgent measures might be needed but these alone would not solve the problems. Europe must respond to the slowdown by promoting economic growth.
At a meeting in Nice on 13 September, EU finance ministers had decided to let automatic stabilisers work and to deploy up to €30 billion to support small and medium-sized firms, which might suffer if the cost of credit went up.
Reforms were needed to the financial system, according to Mr Jouyet, in the areas of transparency, prudential rules, valuation of assets and ratings agencies.
While welcoming the EP's contribution to the current discussions, for example through its debate earlier this week on hedge funds and private equity, the minister stressed the need for a first-reading agreement between EP and Council on the Commission's forthcoming draft legislation on reform of the capital requirements directive.
Stressing that "the laissez-faire attitudes of the past" were no longer appropriate, the Mr Jouyet said "we must look at the power of the regulators", "the strength of financial supervision" and the "supply of data to the ECB". "Better oversight and financial supervision" must be the order of the day.
The European Council in October would be an opportunity to set out "a clear line at European level". The minister believed that "Europe cannot act alone but it must be ready". He also hoped that at a G8 meeting towards the end of the year "new common rules on the international financial system" would be agreed. On this front, he argued, "European can take the lead".
European Commission
Joaquín ALMUNIA, Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs said:
"The series of events we have witnessed in financial markets during the last year, and in particular during the last few days, are of a magnitude that exceeds anything we have seen in our lifetime. Many believe, and I tend to agree, that this will trigger important changes in the functioning of the international financial system.
Since the outbreak of the crisis in August 2007, disclosed losses have totalled more than 500 billion dollars, a sum equivalent to the GDP of a country like Sweden. And unfortunately the final figure is considered to be larger still.
The US plan announced by Secretary Paulson last week is a good initiative. In short, the US Treasury Secretary proposes to set up a Federal fund to remove from the banks balance sheets the illiquid assets – those mortgage linked securities that are at the root of the problems we face. Removing these from the system would help to remove uncertainty and re-focus markets on fundamentals. However, the details of this proposal need to be properly defined – and quickly – if it is to succeed. The situation we face here in Europe is less acute and Member States do not at this point consider that a US style plan is needed.
First, in budgetary policy, we must preserve our commitment to fiscal discipline and the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact while letting the automatic stabilisers play their role. In this regard, the reform of the Pact in 2005 is being very helpful.
Second, a clear commitment to implement structural reforms, as defined in the framework of the Lisbon strategy and the National Reform Programs, would be crucial to boost consumer and investor confidence in the short term and improve the resilience and dynamism of our economies in the longer term. Measures to strengthen competition in retail and energy markets and improve the functioning of labour markets would be particularly valuable at this juncture.
Finally, delivering improvements in financial market regulation and meeting the goals of the Ecofin roadmap is, as I have already stressed, more urgent than ever before. An effective and rapid solution to the difficult challenges we are facing could go a long way to restore confidence quicker than expected and limit the damage to our economies."
Political group speakers
For the EPP-ED group, Alexander RADWAN (DE) said it was fine to talk of speedy action, but it was the market that had been speedy in recent times. Parliament had produced reports after the Parmalat affair and on credit rating agencies several years ago, but little had been done. The EU should not stick to the line of the US on market supervision: "We need to pursue our own European path. Let the Americans follow our example," he said. Regarding reform of the Capital Requirements Directive, he said a first reading agreement would be possible if the Council gave up its opposition to having a European supervisory system.
"Commissioner McCreevy tells us not to be hasty. Well, that is certainly not one of his failings. We need to have the right analysis from the Commission, but I wonder if it is Barroso who is the problem."
Socialist Group leader Martin SCHULZ (DE) said we were seeing the bankruptcy of an economic philosophy that said only unregulated markets were possible, only capitalism could generate growth. "We expect the Commission to take measures on credit rating agencies, and also to decouple City bonuses from short term speculative profits." Fund managers might be young and bright, he said, but they had brought entire companies to their knees and jobs had gone with them. Now in the US, large companies were being bailed out by small taxpayers. "Profits have been privatised, now the losses are nationalised - this has to end," he said.
Mr Schulz also condemned speculation based on surging food prices, which he said meant some investors had an interest in food shortages and hunger: "This is a perverse system which has consequences for the whole of humanity," he said. "The future involves supervising a market which has never respected anything."
Silvana KOCH-MEHRIN (DE) spoke for the ALDE group. She said that sometimes it looked as if just a few banks in crisis, but those who lose out are not securities operators, but families at bottom of system with pensions at risk, incomes damaged. We needed, she said, to act on the basis of facts. "The answer is not reigning in free markets - but we do need regulation of those markets. Rule should be set, and we need an arbiter of how they operate in practice. Those who have refused to be bound by the rules are to blame, not the market as such. We need rules for the whole world economy."
We must avoid panic - it leads to poor decisions", said Eoin RYAN (UEN, IE). Europe's markets are for the moment steadier than those of the US, but "we must implement structural reforms and be ready to act quickly to prevent runs on banks", he warned, stressing the need to promote local and global economic health, and to protect both investors and citizens.
"If EU leaders wanted to highlight the gulf between themselves and citizens, they would have acted just as they did on 14 September", said Francis WURTZ (FR) for the GUE/NGL group. Eurogroup President Jean-Claude Juncker had said that there must be no slow-down in the pace of structural reform, and more competition, "but who will pay?" asked Mr Wurtz. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet had said that banking supervisors "should not make excessive demands", but it is "ordinary wage earners who are being squeezed", added Mr Wurtz. Banks must be rigorously supervised, and international financial institutions restructured, to ensure that money is put to useful work in the public interest, said Mr Wurtz, calling for a "move away from the smug complacency of a small élite".
Hanne DAHL (IND/DEM, DK) had heard, on the way to the airport, that the world crisis had reached her own bank. Because capital moves so freely across borders, the US sub-prime crisis has become an international one, she said adding that such fluidity benefits speculators and tax evaders. Financial operators should be able to "take" supervision without moving across borders, and that banks must lend to each other to find a way out of the crisis, she said.
Chair of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee
Chair of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee Pervenche BERÈS (PES, FR) called for "a modern type of regulation". She said there was no risk of hasty legislation: it was over a year since Commissioner McCreevy had laid blame at the door of rating agencies, but there were still no concrete proposals. The EU, she added, did not have the authority in the Financial Stability Forum to implement what she called "the discredited ECOFIN roadmap." "I hope Mr McCreevy will be convinced we need further regulation of the markets," she concluded.
British and Irish speakers in the debate
John WHITTAKER (IND/DEM, UK) urged Members to consider a completely different reaction to the current economic difficulties. They are, he said, a signal that we cannot continue as we are and that, thanks to borrowing that has been too cheap, and imports that have been too cheap, "we have all been living above our means and we cannot go on consuming at the same rate. Adjustment will be painful but it is necessary, he said. The EU cannot , he said, continue with its massive legislative programmes in the name of health and safety, consumer protection, social equality for instance. "For the overriding effect of all these schemes is to add costs and to crush the productive activity on which our very prosperity depends. In these hard times the one message that should be heard is that European countries can no longer afford the European Union, its institutions and its immense outpourings of legislation."
John PURVIS (EPP-ED, UK) said that the most vital thing, which we must bring about immediately, is the restoration of confidence. He urged that the leaders of the world’s most important economies of America, Europe, the Middle and Far East, meet together within days and assure the world unequivocally that whatever is necessary to douse the flames will be provided unequivocally wherever those flames may erupt. Only when the flames and embers are extinguished, he said, can we turn to post-mortems as to how this happened and what is needed to avoid it happening again. Concluding, he said that it is now up to the political leaders of the highest level – a summit indeed – of the free market economies to come together – no excuses, no holding back, no arguments – to take full responsibility for restoring confidence.
Proinsias DE ROSSA (PES, IE) said that if Commissioner McCreevy is not prepared to regulate all financial institutions, then he should be forced to step aside. The Commission, he said, has a responsibility to ensure that these institutions are not allowed to pick the pockets of pension funds, of savings and of jobs. They have to be stopped and the only way to do it is to bring transparency and regulation into this area. "The so-called 'invisible hand' of the market is in fact a pickpocket and the more invisible it is the more pockets it picks" he concluded.
Council response to the debate
Replying to the debate, Mr Jouyet first turned to the matter of regulation. He described the current system of financial regulation as "archaic". "We need a more modern type of regulation", he continued but was at pains to stress that "regulation is not the enemy of the market". "The stability of the system, the protection of savers, jobs and growth" - these were what was at stake.
Mr Jouyet then stressed that Europe must operate through some form of "enhanced international cooperation", otherwise it would be "on the receiving end of American financial regulation". It was time for Europe to come together, to coordinate its action, so that it had "a clear voice at international level" on regulatory governance.
Turning to "remuneration and reward packages" for those working in the financial sector, he agreed with Gordon Brown's view that "some in-depth thinking" was needed on this. There had been a "crisis of ethics, of accountability". In Mr Jouyet's view, "Finance must remain at the service of the economy. The economy must not be the victim of finance".
The roadmap drawn up EU finance ministers with the Commission represented the way forward. "We must keep on track with the timetable", ensuring that proposals were on the table in time for the Council meeting of 15 October. Speedy action, using the full gamut of measures, was the answer, concluded the minister.
Commission response to the deb ate
In his response to the debate, Commissioner Almunia said that it was necessary to react to "the very big transformation" that had taken place in the market, and we needed to learn from the errors of the past. The EU institutions needed to work together as did the EU with its global partner to develop a "high degree of consensus." Key proposals would come forward next week on the capital requirements directive, and in a few weeks on the ratings agencies, it was important also to reach a deal on the Solvency II legislation, the Commissioner said.
The Commissioner also stressed the need to work more closely with the US authorities including the European Parliament with the US Congress. Finally, the Commission agreed that the issue of remuneration of top executives and "those whose decisions can affect the market such as CEOs" would need to be examined and he hoped that the Member States would support him on this.

"We are all brothers and sisters", Ecumenical Patriarch tells MEPs
2008-09-25 - 17:43
Addressing a formal sitting of the House as part of European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, the Ecumenical Patriarch of the Orthodox Church, Bartholomew I, spoke of the value of the European project in promoting peace and tolerance, the importance of accepting minorities and the need for the EU to accept Turkey as a member. He also underlined his church's efforts to encourage respect for the environment. Introducing the Ecumenical Patriarch, EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering stressed that "The European Union is a community based on values, the most fundamental of which is human dignity. In this respect religious freedom is central to human dignity". He linked this to the separation of church and state, as anchored in the Lisbon Treaty. Mr Pöttering described the Patriarch as "a beacon to your followers in the Orthodox world" and pointed out that recent EU enlargements had brought in the Orthodox countries of Cyprus, Bulgaria and Romania. He added "The late Pope John Paul II used the metaphor of Europe breathing again with its two lungs after the downfall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe. We could also use this metaphor to refer to the richness in the enlarged EU brought through the different perspectives of Western and Eastern Christianity". Dialogue is "at the very root of what it means to be a human being" In the opening part of his speech, the Patriarch told MEPs "our Ecumenical Patriarchate embraces a truly global apostolate that strives to raise and broaden the consciousness of the human family – to bring understanding that we are all dwelling in the same house." For twenty centuries the Patriarchate "has continued as a lighthouse for the human family and the Christian Church. It is from the depths of our experience upon these deep waters of history that we offer to the contemporary world a timeless message of perennial human value." His core idea was that "Dialogue is necessary first and foremost because it is inherent in the nature of the human person". In other words, "intercultural dialogue is at the very root of what it means to be a human being, for no one culture of the human family encompasses every human person. Without such dialogue, the differences in the human family are reduced to objectifications of the “other” and lead to abuse, conflict, persecution – a grand scale human suicide, for we are all ultimately one humanity. But where the differences between us move us to encounter one another and where that encounter is based in dialogue, there is reciprocal understanding and appreciation – even love." Importance of the European project The Patriarch then stressed that "the significance of the 'European project' cannot be underestimated. It is one of the hallmarks of the European Union that it has succeeded in promoting mutual, peaceful and productive co-existence between nation states that less than seventy years ago were drenched in a bloody conflict that could have destroyed the legacy of Europe for the ages." Only one ecosphere There must be a more profound understanding of the interdependence of every single human person with every other single human person, continued the Patriarch, explaining "there is a way of understanding the universe in which we live as being shared by all", namely an "ecosphere that contains us all". For this reason, the Ecumenical Patriarchate has long championed environmental causes. For example, it has "sponsored seven scientific symposia that bring together a host of disciplines". In 1995 it launched an ambitious program of "integrating current scientific knowledge about the oceans with the spiritual approach of the world's religions to water, particularly the world's oceans". The project has visited the Danube, the Adriatic, the Baltic, the Amazon, the Arctic, and is preparing to sail the Nile and the Mississippi next year. Acceptance of minorities Ecology could be seen not only as an important practical issue but as a metaphor for social issues, went on the Patriarch. "As an institution, the Ecumenical Patriarchate has lived as a relatively small ecosystem within a much larger culture for centuries. Out of this long experience, allow us to suggest the most important practical characteristic that enables the work of intercultural dialogue to succeed", namely "above all, there must be respect for the rights of the minority within every majority. When and where the rights of the minority are observed, the society will for the most part be just and tolerant". Indeed "only when we embrace the fullness of shared presence within the ecosphere of human existence, are we then able to face the “otherness” of those around us". This led him to the subject of Turkey. Turkey: tolerance and understanding needed on both sides To applause from the House, he explained "This is why Europe needs to bring Turkey into its project and why Turkey needs to foster intercultural dialogue and tolerance to be accepted into the European project. Europe should not see any religion that is tolerant of others as alien to itself. The great religions, like the European project, can be a force for transcending nationalism and can even transcend nihilism and fundamentalism by focusing their faithful on what unites us as human beings, and by fostering a dialogue about what divides us." He pointed out that "From our country, Turkey, we perceive both a welcome to a new economic and trading partner, but we also feel the hesitation that comes from embracing, as an equal, a country that is predominantly Muslim. And yet Europe is filled with millions of Muslims who have come here from all sorts of backgrounds and causations; just as Europe would still be filled with Jews, had it not been for the horrors of the Second World War." Istanbul was looking forward to being European Capital of Culture in 2010, he added. Peace and prosperity: Patriarchate ready to contribute Lastly, Bartholomew I assured Parliament that "the Ecumenical Patriarchate stands ready to make vital contributions to the peace and prosperity of the European Union". By way of conclusion, he said: "We are all brothers and sisters with one heavenly Father and on this beautiful planet, which we are all responsible for, there is room for everyone."

MEPs call for a European license for on-line music sales
2008-09-25 - 17:43
The European on-line music market needs a common legislative framework to take account of the specificity of digital services and safeguard European cultural diversity and small stakeholders. In a resolution approved on Thursday with 509 votes in favour, 24 against and 29 abstentions, Parliament also criticises the Commission for ignoring MEPs' suggestions in this field. By approving the resolution by Giuseppe Gargani (EPP-ED, IT), MEPs call on the Commission to put forward a legislative initiative to regulate the cross border online music market. MEPs stress that the lack of EU rules creates a situation of legal uncertainty for all stakeholders: the right-holders (authors and composers) and for broadcasters and private users. According to the approved text, a solution may be a pan European license for online music sales. According to MEPs, a legislative act regulating the sector would guarantee the principle of equal treatment among all stakeholders, thus protecting European cultural diversity and local repertoires. The European Parliament also criticises the Commission's refusal to legislate in this field, as asked by the Chamber already in resolutions in 2005 (4) and 2007 (5), and calls on the Executive to be fully involved in any future initiative in this field. Text, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 25 September)

Telecoms: better services for consumers and a safer internet
2008-09-25 - 17:43
The European Parliament adopted a legislative report at first-reading aimed at providing wider access to telecoms services, more information for consumers and stronger data protection. All the major political groups in Parliament agreed a compromise before the plenary vote which does not alter the main goal of the draft legislation - to improve the position of telecom users - but they greatly clarify its aims, notably as regards protection of privacy and fundamental rights. Right to universal service In a report by Malcolm Harbour (EPP-ED, UK) on the directive on universal service requirements for telecoms operators, Parliament's amendments beef up the obligations for operators to provide a minimum service of specific quality at an affordable price for everyone. Under current EU law, this "universal service" includes public phone services, free emergency numbers (the European number 112 and national numbers), an information service and phone directory, and sufficient geographical coverage with public payphones and other telecom access points. The EP wants the Commission by autumn 2008 to submit plans to include mobile phone and broadband in the scope of universal service rules. The report was adopted with 548 votes in favour, 88 against and 14 abstentions. Better information and protection for users Parliament goes further than the Commission on consumer rights to information on prices, tariffs and contract conditions. MEPs say that contracts must give full, clear and up-to-date details of access to emergency services, restrictions on content or equipment use (e.g. blocking of VOIP services on mobiles supposed to provide internet access), client and after-sales services, payment methods and charges for number portability or for terminating a contract. Emergency numbers, disabled rights The European emergency number 112 needs to be better known, say MEPs, and emergency phone services must be more widely available in the EU, including in network breakdowns during a disaster. Member States must ensure access to the European emergency number 116 for when a child disappears. In addition, users must be able to call all EU numbers, including emergency numbers, whether using landline, mobile or VOIP. Disabled people must have the same access rights to telecom services as other users and more equipment needs to be provided that is suited to their needs. Number portability and duration of contracts MEPs back the Commission proposal that number transfers to a new provider should be completed in one day but they add a provision for sanctions on operators who fail to comply. However, they would also allow the national regulator to extend this period to prevent subscribers being switched without their knowledge to a new operator from one day to the next ("slamming"). MEPs also want to harmonise the maximum length of contracts at 24 months but allow subscribers to cancel the contract after 12 months. Technological neutrality The EU legislation says that Member States should not impose any mandatory technical requirements on telecom devices, if this would act as a restraint on trade in such equipment within the internal market. However, some technical constraints may be justified, e.g. an operator could legally block some functions of a SIM card to limit the client's access to rival networks if the user had agreed to use only that operator's network in exchange for cheap equipment. The client must be informed of this before signing up. Data protection Turning to the legislation on personal data privacy in the telecoms sector, the existing directive already harmonises some national rules on the protection of fundamental rights in this area. MEPs want it to clearly cover the right to privacy and confidentiality as well as to security of information technology systems. Data protection rules must cover private and not just public networks, so data stored on social networking sites such as Facebook and Myspace will be covered by the rules. Network security and spam Access providers must take steps to combat violations of security but MEPs go further. A security violation such as the theft of a client list must be notified to the regulator by the operator. Users must be warned of any infringement of their personal data if the case is serious enough to warrant it, and the perpetrator could be prosecuted by the Member State. Other amendments by Parliament would boost protection against spam, cookies, viruses, trojans and spyware. Information as a preventive measure All subscribers must be given information by operators on unlawful activities such as the distribution of content that infringes copyright. Consumers must also be given information on ways of protecting their personal data. Parliament says that national authorities should be able to produce and have disseminated, with the aid of providers, public interest information related to the use of communications services (public interest warnings regarding copyright infringement, other unlawful uses and dissemination of harmful content, advice and means of protection against risks to personal security, etc.). Regulators should also encourage cooperation between operators and anyone with an interest in promoting legal content. Community law does not define what content is lawful or harmful, nor any penalties, since this is up to each Member State. However, all consumers must be informed of national rules on this.

Telecoms: fair competition and flexible spectrum allocation to boost new wireless services
2008-09-25 - 17:43
In a series of votes on the economic regulatory framework for telecommunications, MEPs decided that a body bringing together national regulators should ensure rules are implemented in a consistent manner across the EU. They also want to ensure that frequencies freed by the switchover from analogue to digital TV could be used for new wireless services such as broadband internet or mobile TV, and that such services are interoperable across the EU. Parliament amended two draft legislative texts on electronic communications networks and services, and on the setting up a new regulatory body at EU level as part of its vote on the telecoms package. It also adopted an own-initiative report on getting the most from the "digital dividend".
BERT to ensure fair competition across the EU (report Pilar del Castillo)
In adopting Pilar del Castillo's (EPP-ED, ES) report, MEPs backed her suggestion to create a Body of European Regulators in Telecommunications (BERT). As an independent expert advisory body, BERT will help ensure fair competition and high-quality services across the EU by ensuring that national regulators use similar tools when faced with similar market situations.
The original proposal from the Commission had been to set up a European Electronic Communications Market Authority (EECMA) to achieve these goals. BERT will be a leaner structure, based on the existing Board of Regulators composed of the 27 national regulatory authorities.
BERT should be funded jointly by the EU and national regulatory authorities say MEPs, but they chose not to specify the respective proportions of funding at this stage.
MEPs also voted against the Commission's proposal for the new body to take over tasks related to network and information security. The report was adopted with 490 votes in favour 105 against and 14 abstentions.
Consistent application of regulatory measures in all Member States (report by Catherine Trautmann)
In their vote on the new framework directive for electronic communications networks and services, based on a report by Catherine Trautmann (PES, FR), MEPs set out a "co-regulation" system: national authorities have to consult the Commission and BERT before taking regulatory decisions. If BERT considers the measure inappropriate or ineffective, the Commission may require the national regulatory authority to amend it. The report was adopted with 597 votes in favour 55 against and 29 abstentions.
Separating network access products from other services seen as "an exceptional measure" to stimulate competition
MEPs clarify that a national regulator may impose functional separation on telecom operators - i.e. require them to create a separate business unit for network services which operates independently from the content services the operator offers - only as "an exceptional measure" to ensure that all undertakings can have access to network services on equal terms. Parliament stresses that the national regulator can only take this remedy if both the Commission and BERT confirm that any other measure has failed to achieve effective competition and that there is little prospect of future infrastructure-based competition.
More frequencies for new wireless services while safeguarding media pluralism
Radio spectrum owned by Member States is the backbone of modern wireless services, from broadcasting and mobile TV through mobile communications and broadband internet to satellite navigation systems, air traffic control, and weather forecasting. In view of the transition to digital technology which uses fewer frequencies than analogue technologies, the revised framework directive will allow the switching of bands now used for broadcasting to provide wireless broadband services in the future.
MEPs stress that broadcasters' right to use the part of the radio frequencies they need to fulfil the general interest objective of delivering broadcasting services remains unchanged. Yet, "the part of their radio frequencies which becomes unnecessary for the fulfilment of that objective shall be subject to the new assignment procedure".
Parliament supports the introduction of service and technology neutrality as binding principles, i.e. any frequency band may be used for any application. MEPs stipulate that spectrum allocation must nevertheless comply with national frequency allocation plans and with the International Telecommunication Union's Radio Regulations in order to ensure that wireless services are EU-wide interoperable.
Make wireless services EU-wide interoperable
The electronic communications framework directive, as revised by Parliament requires Member States to co-operate with each other and the Commission in the strategic planning, co-ordination and harmonisation of radio spectrum use. MEPs call on the Commission to table a legislative proposal for a radio spectrum action programme.
No time to waste for re-allocation of frequencies released by switchover to digital TV (report by Patrizia Toia)
In the own-initiative report, drafted by Patrizia Toia (ALDE, IT), on the use of the spectrum released by the switchover from analogue to digital broadcasting - the "digital dividend"- MEPs call on the Commission to propose measures to Parliament and Council for better coordinating the use of the digital dividend at EU level.
Member States, together with the Commission, should identify common spectrum sub-bands of the digital dividend for different application clusters that could be harmonised on a technology-neutral basis. Parliament supports the idea of dividing the Ultra High Frequency (UHF) spectrum into clusters for uni-directional services such as fixed or mobile broadcasting and other mobile multimedia services and for bi-directional services such as wireless broadband.
Parliament adopted an amendment calling on Member States to reallocate part of the spectrum currently used for military purposes under analogue technology after the switchover to new civilian applications.
The report was adopted by 551 votes in favour to 24 against and 38 abstentions.

Directives 2002/19/EC to 2002/21/EC]) Creation of the European Electronic Communications Market Authority ("Telecoms Package") Reaping the full benefits of the digital dividend in Europe: a common approach to the use of the spectrum released by the digital switchover Texts, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 24 September) audio - Press conference 24/09/2008 - Rapporteurs Trautmann, Del Castillo, Harbour and Alvaro - EN

Written declaration on combating the trafficking of children adopted
2008-09-25 - 17:43
The President of the European Parliament announced the adoption of the written declaration on combating the trafficking of children since more than half of all MEPs have signed the declaration (407 out of 785). The declaration calls on the Member States to recognise the fight against child trafficking as a priority objective in their national child protection policies. The declaration, together with the names of the signatories, are now forwarded to the Council and the Commission. The adopted text calls on the European Parliament and the Council to provide the necessary resources in the framework of the Commission’s strategy on promoting and safeguarding children’s rights. The written declaration was originally put forward by Marusya Ivanova Lyubcheva, Zita Gurmai, Diana Wallis, Eva-Britt Svensson and Anna Záborská. MEPs also call on the Member States to continue actively cooperating and exchanging knowledge and experience with the relevant EU authorities and NGOs, in order to prevent and combat child trafficking, and provide adequate treatment for victims of such trafficking. The written declaration points out that child trafficking is still a persistent problem, with more than two million children annually trafficked for forced labour and sexual exploitation. MEPs say that the development of new communication technologies increases the trafficking in children, making the managing of this phenomenon more difficult, Finally, the House points out that national authorities and NGOs in the Member States are still not acting efficiently against child trafficking, due to insufficient cross-border cooperation, lack of specialised training or inadequate implementation of existing legal standards. The declaration will appear in the minutes of the session of 21 October.

MEPs adopt written declaration on the proclamation of 23 August as European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism
2008-09-25 - 17:43
European Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering announced the adoption of the written declaration on the proclamation of 23 August as European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism since it has been signed by more than half of all MEPs (409 out of 785 on 15 September). The written declaration, put forward by Marianne MIKKO (PES, EE), Christopher BEAZLEY (EPP-ED, UK), Inese VAIDERE (UEN, LV), Zita GURMAI (PES, HU) and Alexander ALVARO (ALDE, DE), proposed that 23 August be proclaimed European Day of Remembrance for Victims of the Crimes of Stalinism and Nazism, in order to preserve the memory of the victims of mass deportations and exterminations while, at the same time, rooting democracy more firmly and reinforcing peace and stability in our continent. The written declaration points out that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 23 August 1939 between the Soviet Union and Germany divided Europe into two spheres of interest by means of secret additional protocols. The mass deportations, murders and enslavements committed in the context of the acts of aggression by Stalinism and Nazism fall into the category of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Under international law, statutory limitations do not apply to war crimes and crimes against humanity, Finally MEPs say that the influence and significance of the Soviet order and occupation on/for citizens of the post-Communist States are little known in Europe.

EU-India Summit: MEPs back Free Trade Agreement by end of 2008
2008-09-25 - 17:43
In adopting a joint resolution on the preparations for the EU-India Summit, (Marseille, 29 September 2008) MEPs underline their firm commitment to the establishment of a comprehensive, wide-ranging and ambitious Free Trade Agreement between the EU and India and urges both sides to work towards bringing negotiations to a successful conclusion by the end of 2008. The resolution was adopted with 392 votes in favour, 44 against and 29 abstentions. The House calls for the conclusion of a comprehensive FTA which will improve market access for goods and services, covering substantially all trade, and contain provisions on regulatory transparency in areas relevant to mutual trade and investment, including standards and conformity assessment, SPS, IPR, enforcement, trade facilitation and customs, public procurement, and trade and competition, as well as trade and development and human rights clauses as an essential element of the FTA. Aviation and maritime agreements MEPs also call on the EU and India to make good progress on concluding maritime and aviation agreements which would further boost bilateral trade and investment; states that the Summit will also provide an opportunity for signing the Financing Agreement on the new civil aviation cooperation programme. Christian minorities The House recognises that India provides a model for handling cultural and religious pluralism, despite intermittent and local difficulties among religions, including those between Hindus and Christians. MEPs express, however, deep concern at the current situation of Christian minorities, and regret the impact that the anti-conversion laws that have spread among several Indian states may have on freedom of religion. Parliament calls for a progress report to be drawn up on the human rights policy implemented with India, recalling that the EU-India human rights dialogue is presented as a model in the field. The House is surprised, in this context, that India is not on the list of countries eligible for EIDHR funding for civil society microprojects. Death penalty MEPs u rge the Indian Government immediately to abolish the death penalty by imposing a moratorium on executions and encourage the Indian Government to sign and ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women; urges India to sign up to the International Criminal Court. Terrorism MEPs call on the EU and India to make clear their joint commitment to dealing with the scourge of terrorism, which is one of the main threats to international peace and security; urges enhanced cooperation on intelligence-sharing, and requests that serious consideration be given to India having privileged status within Europol. The House stresses that India’s food security remains an area of concern; calls on the Indian Government to bridge the demand-supply gap by accelerating the pace of domestic production of food grains and ensuring public and private investment, the introduction of new technologies and crop diversification. Millennium Development Goals The House welcomes progress achieved by India towards poverty eradication (MDG 1) but notes, however, the slow progress towards the MDGs on education, health, gender equality and empowerment of women; reiterates its concerns that child mortality and maternal health (MDGs 4 and 5) are the areas showing least progress and are unlikely to be achieved by 2015. MEPs call on the Council, the Commission and the Government of India to prioritise actions on gender equality, reduction of child mortality and improvement of maternal health. Resolution, as adopted by Parliament, will be available here (click on 24 September)

Combating terrorism / protection of personal data - MEPs underline freedom of expression
2008-09-25 - 17:43
In adopting a report on combating terrorism, the EP voted to beef up the data protection provisions of a proposed framework decision on police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. In a second report on protection of personal data relating to a proposal to include three new offences in European law: public incitement to commit terrorist offences, recruitment for terrorism, and terrorist training, MEPs say the fight against terrorism must not constrain freedom of expression. Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters: MEPs seek stronger personal data protection The European Parliament voted to beef up the data protection provisions of a proposed Council framework decision on police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters in its third report on this proposal. MEPs feel that the text had been weakened by the political agreement in the Council, which needs unanimity. The report was adopted with 556 votes in favour 90 against and 19 abstentions. "A lowest common denominator deal" in Council The European Parliament had already been consulted on this issue, but when a November 2007 agreement in Council diverged substantially from the Commission's original proposal, MEPs were invited to comment on the new text. The rapporteur regretted that "the Council had emptied the Commission's initial proposal of its content and arrived at an agreement on the lowest common denominator". For example, the text drafted in Council would apply only to exchanges of data among Member States, and not to the processing of data within them, as originally planned. MEPs consider on the contrary that the text should also apply to data processed at national level and that particular attention should be paid to the purposes to which personal data may be utilised. Article 7, on the processing of a special category of personal data to do inter alia with race or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs, is strengthened: the processing of these data is prohibited save in exceptional, clearly-defined, circumstances. MEPs also reinsert the idea, proposed by the Commission but not taken up by the Council, of a working party on the protection of people with regard to the processing of personal data, which would deliver opinions and recommendations to the institutions. Private operators, transfers to third countries or international organisations MEPs stipulate that Member States' competent authorities must have access to data held by private operators case by case, subject to judicial control. Private operators entrusted with public service tasks should be subject to requirements at least equivalent to those imposed on the authorities. MEPs also stipulate that the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations must be better governed, by doing it case by case, and that Member States must meet tougher conditions in order to avail themselves of an exemption from the requirement to ensure adequate protection for data transferred to third countries. The assessment of whether the level of protection offered by a third country is adequate should moreover be done by an independent authority. Terrorism: MEPs favour making incitement a crime, but with safeguards for fundamental rights The fight against terrorism must not constrain freedom of expression, says the European Parliament in a report it on a Commission proposal to include three new offences in European law: public incitement to commit terrorist offences, recruitment for terrorism, and terrorist training. Aiming to produce a balanced text that can best serve those seeking to prevent radicalisation and the emergence of potential terrorists whilst affording maximum protection to fundamental rights, MEPs adopted a consultation report by Roselyne Lefrançois (PES, FR) with 600 votes in favour 21against and 39 abstentions. Tighter definition of public incitement MEPs first seek to clarify the definition of "public provocation". This initially used term was replaced by "public incitement", as being clearer and more widely used in legal language. Furthermore, where the proposal would have made it a criminal offence to make available to the public any message intended to incite the commission of a terrorist act, MEPs specify that this conduct would be an offence only if it created a "genuine" danger and not just a "hypothetical" one. Explicit safeguard clauses MEPs propose inserting safeguards, throughout the text, for fundamental freedoms and in particular freedom of expression. These provisions took up the safeguard clause already present in the Council of Europe Convention, which the Commission had left out of its proposal. The approved report also reiterates the need to abide by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. Finally, it stresses that the framework decision must not prevent the airing of radical, polemic or controversial views, even on terrorism and that the contents of private communications such as e-mail must be protected. Combating terrorism: prevention, public provocation to commit terrorist offences, recruitment and training for terrorism (amend.

Justice and home affairs
Area of freedom, security and justice: MEPs call for priorities 2010-2014 to be set out
2008-09-25 - 17:43
In adopting a resolution on the annual debate on the progress made in 2007 in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ), the House calls on the European Council, the Council and the Commission to initiate the process of determining priorities for the forthcoming AFSJ multiannual programme for the period 2010-2014, on the basis of an ambitious and coherent approach and join the European Parliament in its dialogue with the national parliaments on the priorities for the period 2010-2014. MEPs calls on the other EU institutions to agree with Parliament a list of texts/proposals that could or should be adopted as a matter of priority before the Treaty’s entry into force and, at any rate, before the end of the present term. MEPs stress that the new Treaty, once ratified, will recognise Parliament’s role in the conclusion of international agreements concerning AFSJ policies. Parliament asks, in this context: – to be consulted in good time on all agreements with third countries that will not have been concluded by 31 December 2008, – to receive regular updates on the negotiations under way, MEPs welcome the proposal for the completion of the anti-discrimination package and urges Council to act in the spirit of the Lisbon Treaty and incorporate Parliament's recommendations; The House considers that, from now on, the national parliaments and civil society should be involved in a structured manner in drafting these legislative measures and in evaluating these policies in the Member States. MEPs ask the Commission and the Council, with this aim in mind, to re-examine with Parliament the networks, agencies and instruments that would assess the impact of AFSJ policies and to aid closer interaction with European civil society. The House deleted a paragraph in the original resolution that said that a proposal concerning the right of long-term residents to vote at European and local elections, a right which could help the social, cultural and political integration of migrants should be established. MEPs voted 268 votes in favour, 243 against and 9 abstentions to delete this paragraph. The resolution was adopted with 488 votes in favour, 88 against and 19 abstentions.

Public health
Fight obesity earlier in life say MEPs
2008-09-25 - 17:43
Europe has almost 22 million overweight children, and a further 1.3 million will be overweight or obese by 2010, says the European Parliament in a report adopted with 536 votes in favour and 37 against, that calls for an earlier start to measures to prevent obesity. Remedies include clearer food labelling, better food in schools and kindergartens, restrictions on advertising unhealthy food to children, and VAT reductions for fruit and vegetables. Overweight, obesity and diet-related disease are approaching epidemic proportions, notes the own-initiative report by Alessandro Foglietta (UEN, IT). Obesity already accounts directly for about 6% of health spending, but the indirect costs are much higher, says the report. Obesity is one of Europe's most serious public health problems, because it significantly increases the risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers. MEPs advocate a multi-level, comprehensive approach to fighting obesity, and points out that there are many European research, health, education and life-long learning programmes that can help to tackle this scourge. Fight the fat early in life Since childhood obesity correlates closely with obesity in adults, the Commission and other stakeholders should make fighting it their priority, says the report. School curricula should be designed to ensure that physical exercise and a balanced diet become part of every child's behaviour. MEPs also want the quality and nutritional standards of school and kindergarten meals to be improved, inter alia by providing fresh fruit and vegetables in school vending machines. They encourage the move away from selling children in schools foods and drinks that are high in salt, sugar or fat (HSSF) and of poor nutritional value, sand say that sponsorship and advertising for HSSF products should be restricted and monitored. Food labelling - MEPs call for mandatory front-of-pack labelling The House sees comprehensive information on labels as the key to enabling consumers to choose between good, better and less good nutrition. They welcome the Commission's new proposal to revise the directive on nutrition labelling of foodstuffs, and urge that the label be made visible, clear and easily understandable to the consumer. Curb advertising of unhealthy food to children MEPs also ask for protected times and for restrictions on unhealthy food commercials that specifically target children, adding that such restrictions should also apply to new media such as online games, pop-ups and text messaging. Parliament views as "a step in the right direction" the voluntary approach that the TV without frontiers Directive takes to the advertising of food of poor nutritional value to children. If 2010 review of the Directive finds that this voluntary approach has failed, then stricter measures should be brought forward, they add. MEPs also encourage media service providers to develop codes of conduct on inappropriate audiovisual commercial communication relating to food and beverage products. Industry self-regulation good, but not good enough MEPs stress that the food industry should do much more to tackle the problem of obesity, e.g. by offering a broader range of smaller portion options. MEPs acknowledge the role of recent industry initiatives on advertising self-regulation in fighting obesity, but note that regulation is sometimes necessary to deliver substantial and meaningful change in the industry, particular with respect to children. EU- wide ban on artificial trans-fatty acids The House calls for an EU-wide ban on artificial trans-fatty acids, stressing that the present state of scientific knowledge shows that excessive consumption of trans-fatty acids (over 2% of total energy intake) is linked to significantly higher cardiovascular risks. Lower VAT rates for fruit and vegetables MEPs call on Member States which have not yet done so to reduce VAT on fruit and vegetables, recalling that Community law authorises them to do so. Furthermore they want the Community texts in force to be amended to allow fruit and vegetables to benefit from a very low rate of VAT. The House i s convinced of the need for full regulation of the qualification of medical professionals as ‘clinical dieticians’ as well as 'nutritionists'. In the November plenary session (17-20) MEPs will vote on a Commission proposal to allocate €90 million for a school fruit scheme. The Agriculture Committee will examine this proposal on 7 October.

Economic and monetary affairs
MEPs call for new legislation to ensure financial stability
2008-09-25 - 17:43
MEPs are making a formal request to the Commission to propose new legislation to improve regulation of financial markets, in particular regarding hedge funds and private equity investors. They also want measures to deal with some of the causes of the credit crunch. In a report drawn up by Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (PES, DK), the Parliament asks for a series of legislative measures on issues related to hedge funds and private equity, the report was adopted with 562 votes in favour 86 against and 25 abstentions. A related report, also adopted, drafted by Klaus-Heine Lehne (EPP-ED, DE), focuses in particular on transparency issues affecting these sectors.
Financial stability and capital requirements
Regarding financial stability, capital and regulatory coverage, the Rasmussen report says, among other points, that capital requirements should apply to investment firms on the basis of risk rather than the particular type of entity. The interests of investors and loan originators should be aligned, either by obliging originators to retain a portion of securitised loans on their own books or by measures with equivalent effect.
Valuation of illiquid financial instruments, access to venture capital
MEPs want to see principles based legislation on the valuation of illiquid financial instruments and better transparency requirements on prime brokers. They say there should be a harmonised EU-wide framework for venture capital and private equity, especially to ensure cross-border access to capital for SMEs.
Takeovers: information for employees, no “asset stripping”
Employees of companies which are taken over should always have the same rights to information and consultation under EU law, including when private equity investors or hedge funds are involved. The Parliament says measures should be introduced where needed to avoid unreasonable asset stripping of companies taken over by private investors. Capital rules should ensure the level of leverage is sustainable for both the private equity firms and the target company and there should be no unfair discrimination between different types of fund using similar strategies. Similar points are made in the Lehne report, which asks for rules forbidding the “plunder” of companies by investors, and also asks whether and how banks might be held responsible, in some circumstances, for the use made by investors of the money they lend. MEPs also want a review of the relevant parts of the Transfers of Undertakings Directive.
Conflicts of interest and market concentration
Measures are also needed to tackle conflicts of interest within financial institutions of all kinds. Credit rating agencies should separate their rating business form any other services they offer, such as advising on structuring transactions – and there should be a mechanism for EU-review of these agencies.
The effects of market concentration in the financial services industry should be given a general review by the Commission’s Competition Directorate General, and assess among other things, whether there is legislation favouring incumbents which needs to be removed.
Wide-ranging review to find gaps in legislation
Finally Parliament asks the Commission to review all existing financial market legislation to identify any gaps regarding hedge funds and private equity and put forward any legislation needed for better regulation of these or other actors.
Transparency requirements
Regarding transparency, in adopting the Rasmussen report, MEPs call for a European Private Placement Regime, which would allow for the cross border distribution of investment products, including alternative investment vehicles (such as hedge funds), to eligible groups of sophisticated investors. This would involve disclosure of their general investment strategy, leverage, risk-management and portfolio valuation methods, the source and amount of funds raised, rules for transparency on top executives remuneration and registration of shareholders beyond a certain proportion.
In the Lehne report, Parliament expands on this, calling for contract terms for alternative investments to provide “unambiguous disclosure and management of risk” and “full transparency of managers’ remuneration systems through formal approval by the general meeting of the company’s shareholders.”
Mr Lehne said: "There is a need for harmonisation in the banking sector to reduce risks in the financial markets", referring to current financial crisis.
The European Parliament also wants the Commission should consider whether hedge funds and private equity investors should be required to register and identify shareholders beyond a certain proportion.
Securities lending and voting on borrowed shares
Parliament wants more transparency on voting by hedge funds in general meetings, calling for exploration of whether intermediaries should be obliged to enable original shareholders to participate actively in voting. It wants to see a code of practice on how to rebalance corporate governance structures to reinforce a long-term orientation. MEPs ask for an investigation of securities lending and voting on borrowed shares. It also asks whether reporting requirements should apply to cooperation agreements between several shareholders.
The two reports are presented under Rule 39 of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, whereby Parliament can use its right formally to request that the Commission draw up legislation on a particular subject (Article 192 of the Treaty). To be adopted by the plenary, an absolute majority of MEPs must support the measures (i.e. at least 393 votes in favour).

Economic and monetary affairs
Updating VAT rules on financial services
2008-09-25 - 17:43
MEPs have backed an update of the rules regarding the VAT treatment of financial services and insurance, with a number of amendments. The aim is to ensure legal certainty in a sector which has changed dramatically since the current rules were drawn up over 30 years ago. The report was adopted by 493 votes in favour to 90 against and ten abstentions. Most financial services are exempt from VAT, but the legislation setting out how this exemption works in detail dates from 1977 and is out of date. The increasing level of cross-border supply of such services within Europe’s single market and the greater use of outsourcing of services to third countries have led to situations not provided for in the original legislation, which means there is unhelpful legal uncertainty. Clarifying the scope of the exemption While looking set to approve the update in general, MEPs adopted – in a report drawn up by Joseph MUSCAT (PES, MT) – a number of amendments which would clarify the scope of the VAT exemption – for example by explicitly including all derivatives. They also adopted a number of amendments aimed at ensuring a level playing field between different Member States and different types of financial institution. Option to apply tax Another aspect of the proposal from the Commission would give financial services companies everywhere in the EU the option of taxation on their services, which would enable them to claim back VAT they pay on their expenses in providing those services (which is not possible if the ultimate supply is exempt). MEPs want to ensure that the Council adopts uniform rules for applying this possibility across the EU and that its operation is subsequently reviewed by the Commission. Cost-sharing groups The Commission’s other proposed innovation is to allow for cost-sharing group so economic operators to pool investments and re-distribute the costs for these investments exempt from VAT. MEPs want to broaden the scope of this arrangement. As usual with taxation matters, Parliament’s position is not binding, and the final decision requires unanimity among the 27 Member States in the Council. Value added tax VAT: common system, treatment of insurance and financial services (amend. Directive 2006/112/EC) Text, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 25 September)

Energy
Energy prices: MEPs say the EU must take action to boost EU economy
2008-09-25 - 17:43
In adopting a joint resolution on getting a grip on energy prices, MEPs emphasise, that unless there is a global concerted shift in energy policy and consumption, the energy demand will continue to grow in the coming decades. MEPs underline the necessity to take measures that will enable the EU economy to maintain its competitiveness and to adapt to the new energy price environment. The House expresses its concern at the increase in energy prices, notably because of its negative effect on the world economy and consumers, which is also hampering the attainment of the EU's Lisbon Strategy objectives. The House calls for strong political commitment to take concrete measures towards cutting energy demand, to promote renewables and energy efficiency, and to pursue diversification of energy supply and reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels. The House considers this shift to be the most appropriate response to higher energy prices, to increase stability in the energy markets, to deliver long-term cost benefits to consumers and to meet the objectives of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and its related Kyoto Protocol. Consumer Energy Charter MEPs call on the Commission to ensure that the proposed Consumer Charter for Energy clearly sets out consumers' rights. MEPs call on the national regulatory authorities to use the powers at their disposal to help consumers. Oil and gas prices Parliament calls on the Commission to investigate the linkage between oil and gas prices in long-term gas contracts and to come up with an adequate policy response. MEPs underline the importance of adequate fiscal policies, as a means of reducing dependence on fossil fuels, addressing climate change and creating incentives for investments in energy-efficiency, renewable energy and environmentally friendly products. Speak with one voice MEPs stress that the EU should speak with one voice as regards energy policy. Parliament reiterates the importance of an EU common energy policy and commitment to the European Neighbourhood Policy. MEPs believe in this respect that the EU should take the lead in the energy dialogue with key oil and gas supply countries. MEPs welcome the idea of a high-level summit between oil and gas consuming and producing countries, aimed at greater stability of prices, more predictability in supplies and payment for sales in euros. Parliament encourages EU companies to be more proactive, by making further investments, and to take the lead in new technology know-how and engineering skills in order to remain key partners with the main oil producing countries. The House notes that investments are particularly needed to develop the refining and exploration capabilities in order to cope with increasing demand.

2009 to be designated European Year of Creativity and Innovation
2008-09-25 - 17:43
Parliament adopted a report backing a Commission proposal for 2009 to be designated 'European Year of Creativity and Innovation’. However, while the Commission chiefly wishes to emphasise lifelong learning, the European Parliament proposes a broader focus, highlighting a wider range of EU programmes. Each year the EU chooses a theme for a campaign aimed at raising public awareness of, and drawing national governments' attention to, a specific issue. Rapporteur Katerina Batzeli (PES, EL) backs this tradition, calling it a means of "heightening public awareness, disseminating information concerning good practices, stimulating political debate and exchanges, and activating the public." Previous years saw 2006 designated as European Year of Workers' Mobility, 2007 as European Year of Equal Opportunities and 2008 as European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. For 2009 the Commission suggests highlighting the role that creativity and innovation play in fostering economic and social prosperity through benefits to the individual and society. It argues that more needs to be done on this front across the European Union, particularly in the field of education where the approach should be based on 'lifelong learning.' The rapporteur "shares the Commission's view regarding the need for Europe to highlight its creative and innovative capacities for both social and economic reasons and to step up Europe's potential to rise to the challenges and opportunities of globalisation." The House suggests only a few alterations to the proposal but, while the Commission highlights the Lifelong Learning Programme, the European Parliament stresses the importance of all EU programmes that promote creativity and innovation. As for previous European Years, measures will include promotion campaigns, events and initiatives at European, national, regional and local levels. The Commission is not seeking special funding for the year in question. This will be provided under existing Community programmes and administrative budgets.

Agriculture
Mountain farming: MEPs call for special strategy
2008-09-25 - 17:43
Farming in mountainous areas is practised in difficult conditions and plays a crucial role in preserving the environment and biodiversity. It, therefore, requires a special strategy, says an own-initiative report adopted by Parliament. Agriculture in upland areas, which are home to nearly 20% of Europe's population, currently faces high production costs as well as transport and communication problems. Dairy farming in particular is in a critical situation. However, these areas also have features and potential advantages that need to be protected, such as high quality traditional food produce, sustainable forest management and attractiveness to tourists. "There are as many different legal frameworks for Europe's mountain areas as there are Member States in the European Union itself", according to MEP Michl Ebner (EPP-ED, IT), whose report was adopted by 487 votes in favour and 73 against. "What is required is a sensible framework that combines regulations and assistance in the best possible way to assist Europe's mountain regions in their efforts to achieve sustainable and forward-looking competitiveness", he believes. The EP report urges the Commission to devise within six months an integrated EU strategy for the sustainable development and use of resources in mountain areas, with national action programmes involving regional authorities and civil society. The importance of demarcating mountain areas as a first step is emphasised. The report also suggests that rural development and structural assistance be combined. Parliament's proposals Among its detailed proposals, Parliament calls for: - greater account to be taken of the multifunctionality of hill farming in future CAP reforms, for example by compensating hill farmers for the environmental benefits they generate; - compensatory payments for mountain areas to be guaranteed in the long term; - greater support for producer associations, farming cooperatives and other intersectoral partnerships, such as Leader-groups; - special financial assistance for the dairy sector (dairy farmers and processors) and special payments to reduce any negative impact of the disappearance of quotas; - the introduction of additional per-hectare payments for organic farming and extensive grazing, and continuation of grass premiums; - measures to protect and promote high-quality regional and traditional products or their manufacturing procedures and their certification; - a fund for disadvantaged areas (making use of unutilised second-pillar funding); - special targeted financial assistance for mountain areas via the "Article 69 mechanism" (now Article 68 under the CAP health check), - extra support for young farmers, - the establishment of repositories of indigenous genetic material from animal and plant species, particularly farm animals and mountain flora, to preserve biodiversity.

International Tropical Timber Agreement not enough to protect forests
2008-09-25 - 17:43
The House welcomes the conclusion of the 2006 ITTA (International Tropical Timber Agreement) but considers that the outcome falls well short of what is required to address the loss of tropical forest. MEPs therefore call on the Commission and Member States to increase the financial resources available for the conservation and ecologically responsible use of tropical forests and to promote economically viable alternatives to destructive logging, mining and agricultural practices. Public procurement policies should require timber and timber products to be derived from legal and sustainable sources so as to encourage public authorities’ practical commitment to good governance in forestry and to combat corruption, says the resolution. Labelling initiatives enabling consumers to be confident that the timber they are buying is not merely legal but originates from sustainably-managed forests as potentially usefully supplements to international agreements could be useful. MEPs regard the proposed trade agreement with the countries of south-east Asia to be of particular importance. They consider that any agreement must contain a meaningful sustainable development chapter which addresses the issues of forest preservation and the fight against illegal and unsustainable logging. Assent of Parliament MEPs consider that the agreement requires the assent of Parliament under Article 300(3), second subparagraph, of the EC Treaty.

Petitions
Petitions Committee: listening to the EU's citizens
2008-09-25 - 17:43
Parliament's Petitions Committee had another busy year, as is described in its annual activity report for 2007. The number of petitions submitted by the public increased, as did the proportion lodged electronically through the EP website, while members of the committee undertook six fact-finding missions. Environmental issues and fundamental rights were the subjects most frequently raised by petitioners. The report by David HAMMERSTEIN (Greens/EFA, ES) was adopted, with amendments, by 603 votes in favour to 17 against with 25 abstentions.
The Petitions Committee deals with petitions from EU citizens on any matter falling within the Community's sphere of competence. Members of the public often encounter shortcomings in the application of EU policies and programmes, and the petitions process is important in giving them an opportunity to draw such matters to the attention of the European Parliament. The EP can then, for example, press the European Commission to take action.
In 2007 the membership of the committee was expanded from 25 to 40, 1,506 petitions were registered (representing a 50% increase compared to 2006), of which 1,089 were declared admissible and a total of 159 petitioners took part in meetings of the committee. In addition, fact-finding visits were organised to Germany, Spain, Ireland, Poland, France and Cyprus.
The top-ten general topics covered by the petitions received in 2007 were as follows:
Environmental issues, water, etc
288
Fundamental rights
226
Urbanisation
131
Social Affairs & Discrimination
207
Internal Market & Consumers
192
Health
105
Justice
99
Transport issues & Infrastructure
88
Property & Restitution
72
Education & cultural issues
103
More specifically, petitioners expressed concern about the weakness of Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, the Water Framework Directive, the Drinking Water Directive, the Waste Directives, the Habitats Directive, the Birds Directive, the Money Laundering Directive and other general matters, including pollution and climate change, individual and private property rights, financial services, free movement and rights of workers including pension rights and other social provisions, recognition of professional qualifications, freedom of establishment and allegations of discrimination on grounds of nationality, gender or membership of a minority.
Recommendations in this year's report
The European Parliament believes it could do its work even better if it had "its own investigatory facilities" but this would require an increase in staff. It calls for an urgent review of the "Citizens Portal" on Parliament's website with the objective of enhancing its visibility as regards the right of petition. And it makes other recommendations for enhancing working procedures.
MEPs believe more needs to be done to ensure Community law is properly implemented and they press for "more stringent timescales" for concluding inquiries into alleged infringements of EU legislation. The Commission is urged, when dealing with petitions and complaints related to environmental policy – which is the predominant concern of petitioners in the EU – to be more ready to act to prevent breaches of EU law, rather than waiting for the law to be infringed.
A single seat for EP in Brussels? Parliament should state its view
The report records that the petitions considered by the Committee on Petitions in 2007 included "the so-called "One Seat" petition, which was supported by 1.25 million EU citizens and which called for a single seat for the European Parliament, to be located in Brussels". It adds that "in October 2007 the President referred the petition back to the committee, which subsequently called for Parliament to give its opinion on this question, bearing in mind that the seat of the institution is governed by the provisions of the Treaty and that the Member States have the responsibility for taking a decision on this matter".
Ireland: drinking water in Galway, Tara heritage site and problems in Limerick
The report "expresses its ongoing concern about the lack of implementation of the provisions of the Drinking Water Directive in Ireland", "the absence of any assessment in advance of a 2007 decision to remove a national monument situated at Lismullin in the path of the M3 motorway project near Tara in County Meath", the "problems faced by local communities in Limerick", and other issues raised in the report of the committee's fact-finding visit to Ireland.
Britain: property confiscated by Customs
The report also "records that, in 2007, many British petitioners who had their property confiscated by the British Customs & Excise authorities were still without redress" and "urges the British authorities to come up with an equitable solution including the payment of ex gratia payments to petitioners who suffered serious financial loss before the authorities reviewed their practice and, according to the Commission, began to act in conformity with the relevant directives".

Member States to fulfil their ODA volumes, warn MEPs
2008-09-25 - 17:43
Member States are asked to raise Official Development Aid (ODA) volumes to achieve their promised target of 0,56% of GNI in 2010. Otherwise the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will not be reached by 2015. MEPs say that the 2007 decreases in reported aid levels are due in some cases to the artificial inflation of figures in 2006 by debt relief, in a report adopted by the EP on the follow-up of the Monterrey Conference of 2002 on Financing for Development. In a report drafted by Thijs Berman (PES, NL) and adopted by Parliament, MEPs express serious concern that a majority of the Member States (18 out of 27, especially Latvia, Italy, Portugal, Greece and the Czech Republic) were unable to raise their level of ODA between 2006 and 2007 and that there has even been a dramatic reduction of over 10% in a number of countries such as Belgium, France and the United Kingdom .
MEPs call on Member States to fulfil the ODA volumes to which they are committed; notes with satisfaction that some Member States (Denmark, Ireland , Luxembourg, Spain, Sweden and the Netherlands) are certain to reach their ODA targets for 2010, and is confident that these Member States will maintain their high levels of ODA.
The House welcomes the fact that the EU met its binding ODA target of the EU average of 0.39% of GNI by 2006, but notes the alarming decrease in EU aid in 2007 from EUR 47.7 billion in 2006 (0.41% of EU collective GNI) to EUR 46.1 billion in 2007 (0.38% of EU collective GNI) and calls upon Member States to raise ODA volumes to achieve their promised target of 0.56% of GNI in 2010.
MEPs insist that reductions in Member States' reported ODA should not take place again; points out that the EU will have given EUR 75 billion less than was promised for the period 2005-2010 if the current trend continues.
Reform of the World Bank
Parliament calls on Member States to undertake a rapid and ambitious reform of the World Bank so that those most directly concerned by its programmes are better represented.

Maritime package: Parliament still at odds with Council
2008-09-25 - 17:43
In a series of reports at second-reading on the third maritime package, the Parliament deplores the fact that over a year after its first reading vote in April 2007 on proposals to protect Europe against maritime accidents and pollution, Member State transport ministers are still blocking two areas namely on flag state obligations and civil liability and have not taken up most of Parliament's recommendations on the other issues. MEPs urge the French Presidency to find a solution as soon as possible so as to avoid a probable conciliation procedure. Maritime safety always a priority of the Parliament Maritime safety has traditionally been a European Parliament priority. Under the previous two maritime safety packages (known as Erika I and Erika II), adopted in the wake of the Erika and Prestige oil-spill accidents, the EU adopted substantive maritime safety and security legislation. This provided for ship inspections in port, banned the use of single-hull vessels to transport oil, and created the European Maritime Safety Agency EMSA. What the third package includes The third package includes provisions on flag states' obligations, the inspection regime in EU ports, places of refuge for ships in distress, passenger protection standards, insurance obligations, classification societies and civil liability issues. It aims to create healthy and sustainable competitive conditions for those operators which comply with international rules. All key amendments from first reading reinserted and adopted In the debate, Members stressed that they did not want Council to water down important suggestions on port state control, on a Community vessel traffic monitoring system, accident investigation, ship inspections and survey organisations and, finally, on the liability of boat passenger carriers in the event of accidents. Therefore, they had reinserted all key amendments from first reading, approving them almost unanimously. Two "missing files" MEPs had also inserted key amendments from the two "missing files" on flag state obligations and civil liability into the reports on port state control, the vessel traffic monitoring system and ship inspections and survey organisations. By adopting these amendments with an overwhelming majority as well, they gave a clear political signal to the Council that these two files should not be forgotten. The French Presidency of the Council should take up work on these dossiers which was stopped under the work of its predecessor, MEPs said. Flag state obligations The two proposals have met strong opposition in Council, mainly because of the touch upon the sensitive issue of national competence. The Commission had proposed that the various International Maritime Organisation conventions on flag state obligations should be turned into binding EU legislation and that the Member States must be required to monitor compliance with international standards by ships that fly their flags. Council strongly opposes this directive, believing that the Community is not competent to take action in this field and arguing that these matters should be left into international law. Civil liability At present, for most damages by ships to third parties, civil liability regimes for ship-owners in Europe are not harmonised and no compulsory insurance scheme exists. Parliament is strongly in favour of the Commission proposal which seeks to put in place "core" rules, common to all Member States, governing civil liability, insurance for ship-owners and the liability of any person responsible for operating a ship. This should be done by incorporating the IMO convention on the Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims (LLMC) into EU law. This morning's vote A Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system (Rapporteur: Dirk Sterckx, ALDE, BE) Parliament amendments reinserted on the designation of an independent competent authority for the accommodation of vessels in distress were adopted. Successive disasters and near-disasters had shown that much time is often wasted because it was not clear who was responsible for what. The House is in favour of setting up a competent authority with the independent expertise to decide, should an accident occur, on the best course of action to avoid a disaster. In the event of an accident, masters and crews should get a fair treatment and not to be criminalised. Members also pointed out that absence of evidence must not be a factor in assessing and deciding whether to accommodate a ship in distress, and accommodation in a place of refuge should not be restricted to insured vessels. Investigation of accidents (Rapporteur: Jaromir Kohlicek (GUE/NGL, CZ) The House also adopted all amendments re-tabled in order to re-establish Parliament's position in first reading. Most importantly, Members want that safety investigations of serious accidents - and not only of "very serious" accidents as Council is proposing - remain mandatory. Finally, it is essential that Member States apply a common methodology in investigating accidents. Port state control (Rapporteur: Dominique Vlasto (EPP-ED, FR) Parliament amendments reveal disagreement with the Council on the frequency of inspection of vessels in various risk categories, the inspection rate target which national authorities would be required to meet and the fact that the Council wants to exclude vessels calling at offshore anchorages from inspection requirements, whereas Parliament wants them included. Finally, when ministers want a ban on substandard vessels using EU ports to be temporary, the House wants it to be permanent. Liability of carriers of passengers by boat in the event of accidents (Rapporteur: Paolo Costa (ALDE, IT) Amendments reflecting first reading were adopted on the Regulation on the liability of boat carriers in the event of accidents, which transposes the Athens Convention. They extend the scope of the Regulation to all domestic carriages by sea, where the Council wants to remain the scope only to bigger A-class ships, and guarantee the application of EUR 21 000 advance payment to permanent invalidity and severe injuries, what the Council rejected. Ship inspection and survey organisations (Rapporteur: Luis de Grandes Pascual (EPP-ED, ES) Classification societies are private sector organisations to which flag states delegate some inspection functions. Here, the main disputes with Council with the Council are over the name of the new body or system for assessing and certifying these societies and the liability of recognised organisations when carrying out work on behalf of a Member State. Amendments to restore the key elements of the missing proposal on flag state control were also adopted. What happens next? Since the House adopted the third package on maritime safety with a large majority and including elements of the two missing files, the House indicated that the two missing files on flag state obligations and civil liability should no longer blocked by Council if an agreement on the whole package can be concluded. It is now up to the Transport Ministers to act. Parliament wants a clear formal signal that substantial progress on the whole package should be made and therefore expressed its willingness to resume negotiations in an informal trilogue. This means that a conciliation procedure could start on 7 October. Text, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 24 September)

MEPs defend media pluralism and call for discussion of blogs
2008-09-25 - 17:43
Media pluralism must be safeguarded and all citizens should have access to free media, MEPs underline in a resolution adopted on Thursday. To prevent owners, shareholders or governments from interfering with editorial content, MEPs advocate creation of editorial charters. They also encourage an open discussion of the status of weblogs. The European Parliament adopted a resolution by 307 votes in favour to 262 against urging the Commission and the Member states to safeguard media pluralism and ensure that all EU citizens can access free and diversified media. The resolution, drafted by the PES, the ALDE and the Greens/EFA group is a revised version of a report drafted by Marianne MIKKO (PES, ET) and the Committee on Culture and Education.
Ensure journalistic independence
In the resolution, MEPs stress the need to ensure journalistic and editorial independence and suggest editorial charters to prevent owners, shareholders or outside bodies such as governments from interfering with news content. To shed light over the aims and background of the broadcasters and publishers, the resolution also encourages the disclosure of ownership of all media outlets. MEPs also voice concern over the media's ability to carry out the role of a watchdog of democracy, when private media enterprises are motivated by financial profit, and warn that this could lead to loss of diversity. The resolution considers that competition law and media law should be interlinked to avoid conflicts between media ownership concentration and political power
Status of bloggers should be discussed
Weblogs represent an important new contribution to freedom of expression and are often used by both media professionals and private persons. Therefore MEPs encourage an open discussion on all issues relating to the status of weblogs. On this point the resolution is slightly different from the proposal from the Committee on Culture and Education, that suggested a 'clarification' of the status of weblogs and sites based on user-generated content, assimilating them for legal purposes with any other form of public expression.
During the presentation of the report Monday evening, Mrs Mikko responded to the concerns of many bloggers: "My entrance into cyberspace has created rapid reaction among a lot of bloggers. I shall make it clear now that nobody is interested in regulating the internet," she said.
MEPs also underline the importance of the protection of copyrights online, insisting that third parties have to mention the source when taking over declarations, call for greater transparency with respect to personal data kept on users by search engines, email providers and social networking sites.
