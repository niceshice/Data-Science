Briefing - 1-2 April 2009 - Brussels plenary session
2009-03-30 - 09:16
Selected highlights of the Brussels plenary:
Combating multiple discrimination
Discrimination occurs, not only in employment but also in access to goods and services such as banking, education, transport and health. A directive aiming to guarantee equal treatment in these areas is backed by the EP Civil Liberties Committee, which particularly highlights the need to tackle multiple discrimination. The directive put forward by the European Commission is intended to reduce discrimination on grounds of religion or belief, age, gender or sexual orientation, whether direct or indirect, and whether based on real or presumed criteria. It comes on top of three other directives: one on discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin, both within and outside the labour market, one on discrimination on the labour market and one on equal treatment between men and women. All these goals are reaffirmed by members of the Civil Liberties Committee in the consultation report by Kathalijne Buitenweg (Greens/EFA, NL).
MEPs to vote on resolution on European conscience and heroes of the fight against totalitarianism
Following the debate which took place in Strasbourg plenary on 25 March 2009, Parliament will vote on a resolution on European conscience and totalitarianism. The debate was based on an oral question to the Council.
Union citizenship and freedom of movement: MEPs slam Member States
Practical application of the right to freedom of movement and residence of citizens and members of their families in the territory of the Member States is disappointing, say members of the Civil Liberties Committee in an own-initiative report by Adina -Ioana Vălean (ALDE, RO). In fact, no Member State has fully enacted the whole directive in its national law. Member States have erected many obstacles to the free movement of EU citizens, according to the Committee. The public still has little awareness of its rights, including the right to vote in local and European elections in the country where they live.
Regional development funding for energy efficiency investment in housing
Rules proposed by the Regional Development Committee would mean European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) money could co-fund national, regional or local authority schemes to install e.g. double glazing, wall insulation or solar panels in housing, or to replace old boilers with more energy efficiency ones, in all Member States. The ERDF currently funds such schemes only in the new (EU-12) Member States, and only in common parts of a building (or the entire building, if it's social housing), in deprived urban areas.
European Regional Development Fund, European Social Fund, Cohesion Fund - updating the financial rules
Parliament's assent is requested to a series of amendments to structural fund rules (i.e. the "General Regulation"), on the one hand to accelerate funding and boost liquidity for projects, and on the other to simplify rules, so as to enable faster project implementation. Iratxe GARCÍA PÉREZ (PSE, ES) for the Regional Development Committee recommends Parliament give its assent.
Step up eco-labelling
A first reading agreement has been reached aiming at the voluntary EU Ecolabel ("EU flower") system for environment-friendly products to become less costly and bureaucratic to use. The label has so far been awarded to over 3,000 products such as detergents, paper and shoes.
MEPs call for increased participation in EU's Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS)
A first reading agreement has been reached aiming at simplifying the EU's voluntary Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS - which helps organisations to identify, monitor, measure and report on their environmental impacts) in order to attract new participants. The new regulation aims at further attract organisations to register EMAS without harming its environmental integrity. The Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, in a report drafted by Linda McAVAN (PES, UK), recommends approving the majority of the Commission's proposals concerning the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme, which helps organisation to identify, monitor, measure and report on their environmental impacts.
International Treaty for the protection of the Arctic
MEPs will debate a possible international treaty for the protection of the Arctic after hearing statements from the Council and Commission. The European Parliament will also vote on a resolution on Thursday 2 April. On 9 October 2008, MEPs suggested that the Commission should be prepared to pursue the opening of international negotiations designed to lead to the adoption of an international treaty for the protection of the Arctic. However, they believe that, as a minimum starting-point, such a treaty could at least cover the unpopulated and unclaimed area at the centre of the Arctic Ocean.
EU-Russia cooperation agreement: MEPs’ recommendations
The renewal of the EU’s cooperation agreement with Russia should be used as an opportunity to raise the human rights situation in the country, improve the security of gas supplies from Russia and seek assurances that Moscow will no longer use force against its neighbours, argues the EP Foreign Affairs Committee.The committee is putting forward recommendations for the negotiations on the agreement, following the resumption of talks between the EU and Russia on 2 December 2008.
MEPs to vote on resolution on EU-Belarus relations
Following the debate in Strasbourg plenary on 25 March, Parliament will vote on a resolution on the bi-annual evaluation of the EU-Belarus dialogue.
Avoiding potential risks of electromagnetic fields
Antennas, mobile phone masts and other electromagnetic emitting devices should be set within a specific distance from schools and health institutions, according to a report to be voted on next week by the European Parliament. The Commission should make more reliable information available about the effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields to citizens who feel that they are not well informed. The report acknowledges the wide use of wireless technologies and other electromagnetic emitting technologies and their benefits to society, but also raises concerns over their "continuing uncertainties about possible health risks." In particular, there are concerns about the exposure of children and young people to electromagnetic fields.
The establishment of residue limits of pharmacologically active substances in foodstuffs of animal origin
Avril Doyle (EPP-ED, IE) for the Environment Committee will be recommending the Parliament approve the common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down Community procedures for the establishment of residue limits of pharmacologically active substances in foodstuffs of animal origin.
Migration and mobility: challenges and opportunities for European education systems
Migration can be greatly beneficial to schools as it can enrich them both culturally and educationally, but at the same time it can present significant problems if cultural differences hamper understanding between pupils or between pupils and teachers. The report, drafted by Hannu Takkula (ALDE, FI) wants to encourage a more effective means of incorporating migrant children in national education systems, as he believes that workers within the Union will be less likely to move abroad "if there is a risk that their children will suffer educationally."
European cooperation for better schools
The disparities between education systems in Member States and their possible knock-on consequences in economic and social disparities are of particular concern. The Council has adopted three targets for 2010 relating to school education which focus on "early school leavers, reading literacy, and the completion of upper secondary education." These goals are vital for reaching the aims of the Lisbon agenda, but more importantly they will help to ensure higher educational attainment amongst young people, which will improve their future employment prospects.
Union citizenship: problems and prospects
This report highlights the problems and the future prospects of Union citizenship. MEPs in the Civil Liberties Committee point out that enlargement has led to a considerable rise in the number of EU citizens resident outside their Member State of origin but that very few are aware of their rights. The committee is disappointed at the low number of EU citizens resident in a Member State other than their own who make use of their right to vote in European or local elections.
MEPs call for a moving towards a clear and transparent visa policy
The question of visas was made a European issue by the creation of the Schengen Area, brought into effect by the Amsterdam Treaty. The aim was to create a common set of rules across the EU for visa applications. The Community Code on Visas will integrate into a single text, all of the legal instruments governing the procedures and conditions of short term visas (less than three months). It aims to guarantee equal treatment for people applying for visas, and will simplify and harmonise the rules regarding visa applications, and will create a more transparent system.
A briefing on the main topics of media interest next week at the European Parliament will be held on Monday 30 March at 11am. 20090318BRI52118 Final draft agenda EuroparlTV EP Live

Combating multiple discrimination
2009-03-30 - 09:16
Discrimination occurs, not only in employment but also in access to goods and services such as banking, education, transport and health. A directive aiming to guarantee equal treatment in these areas is backed by the EP Civil Liberties Committee, which particularly highlights the need to tackle multiple discrimination. The directive put forward by the European Commission is intended to reduce discrimination on grounds of religion or belief, age, gender or sexual orientation, whether direct or indirect, and whether based on real or presumed criteria. It comes on top of three other directives: one on discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin, both within and outside the labour market, one on discrimination on the labour market and one on equal treatment between men and women. All these goals are reaffirmed by members of the Civil Liberties Committee in a consultation report by Kathalijne Buitenweg (Greens/EFA, NL).
The directive will apply to social protection and health care, social benefits, education and access to goods and services, including housing. MEPs in the committee would like it to apply to access to transport as well. However, they say transactions between private individuals outside professional and commercial activities should be excluded.
The committee also believes that the directive should cover multiple discrimination, based on two or more grounds, as well as discrimination by association. However, special arrangements should apply to small firms, for which the rules could be a burden.
No impact on matrimonial law or the secular state
MEPs in the committee stress that the directive does not impinge on the separation of powers between the European Union and its Member States nor does it affect national law on marriage, the family and health. Member States retain responsibility for the organisation and content of education. National laws on the secular nature of the state are not affected, nor are differences of treatment based on nationality. Member States are not precluded from taking steps to prevent or compensate for disadvantages (such as positive action or quotas) or from allowing such measures to be taken by the public, private or voluntary sectors.
Harassment is discrimination
Under the directive, harassment - where unwanted conduct takes place with the effect of violating the dignity of a person and of creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment - must be deemed a form of discrimination. MEPs in the committee stress that the concept of harassment must be defined in accordance with national law and the practices of Member States.
Improving arrangements for the disabled
The directive bans discrimination on grounds of disability - as understood in the definition by the United Nations - in access to social protection, social benefits, health care, education and goods and services. MEPs in the committee want it also to cover transport, telecommunications, information, financial services, culture and leisure. Efforts at "reasonable accommodation" of the needs of people with disabilities (for example wheelchair access to buildings) must be made or alternative solutions found where appropriate. However, such measures must not impose a "disproportionate burden" nor require a fundamental change in the nature of the goods and services in question.
Some differences of treatment must be tolerated
Member States may allow some differences of treatment, such as in access to education provided by religious bodies, as long as these differences are necessary and proportionate and do not in themselves result in a denial of the right to education.
Risk factors related to disability and age used in the insurance and banking industries should not be regarded as discrimination if they are shown to be directly determining factors for the assessment of risk. However, MEPs in the committee call for service providers to demonstrate the risks precisely.
In addition, say MEPs in the committee, differences of treatment on grounds of age may be accepted if legitimate, for example in the sale of alcohol, weapons or the granting of driving licences. But young people with disabilities must also have access to favourable terms and conditions such as free or reduced tariffs for the use of public transport, museums or sport facilities.

MEPs to vote on resolution on European conscience and heroes of the fight against totalitarianism
2009-03-30 - 09:16
Parliament will vote on a resolution on European conscience and heroes of the fight against totalitarianism following the debate that took place in Strasbourg on 25 March 2009. The debate was based on an oral question to the Council:
What action does the Council propose to take in response to Written Declaration 0044/2008 - P6_TA(2008)0439 adopted by the Parliament on 9 September 2008, which proclaims 23 August as the European Day of Remembrance for the victims of Stalinism and Nazism? What response does the Council have to the Prague Declaration, adopted at the Prague Conference, ‘European Conscience and Communism’, on 3 June 2008?
Does the Council support the Prague Declaration's proposal that an Institute of European Memory and Conscience be established, as a European research institute for the studies of totalitarianism and as a pan-European museum/memorial for all the victims of totalitarian regimes, demonstrating the comparison of crimes committed against humanity by totalitarian Communist and Nazi regimes?
In addition, does the Council support the initiative taken by the UEN group to proclaim 25 May as the International Day of the Heroes of the Fight Against Totalitarianism?
25 May is the anniversary of the execution of Rotamaster Witold Pilecki, the only person who voluntarily went to a concentration camp during World War II in order to organise the resistance movement there and collect information about mass murders, and who after his escape from Auschwitz fought first the Nazi, and then the Communist regimes.
Establishing the International Day of the Heroes of the Fight Against Totalitarianism would be a great way of keeping a living memory of the past and the people like Czech Karel Stransky or German Otto Küsel and many others who, similarly to Witold Pilecki, should be written into the awareness of Europeans as the heroes of the totalitarian age, because of their dedication, faithfulness to ideals, humanism, honour and courage.
President Vaclav Klaus of the Czech Republic, the country holding the Presidency of the EU, has already voiced his support for this initiative.
What is the Council’s position towards the group’s proposal? Would the Council agree to support proclaiming 25 May as the International Day of the Heroes of the Fight Against Totalitarianism? Motion for resolution on European conscience and totalitarianism

Union citizenship and freedom of movement: MEPs slam Member States
2009-03-30 - 09:16
Since 2006 over eight million Europeans have exercised their right to reside in another EU Member State. However, the Member States have erected many obstacles to the free movement of the EU's citizens, according to the EP Civil Liberties Committee. The public still has little awareness of its rights, including the right to vote in local and European elections in the country where they live, say MEPs. Practical application of the right to freedom of movement and residence of citizens and members of their families in the territory of the Member States is disappointing, say members of the Civil Liberties Committee in an own-initiative report by Adina-Ioana Vălean (ALDE, RO). In fact, no Member State has fully enacted the whole directive in its national law.
Major infringements of fundamental rights have therefore been identified, including some relating to the right of entry and residence for family members from non-EU countries and the obligation for EU citizens, when applying for a residence permit, to submit additional documents such as work permits or satisfactory proof of accommodation, something not required under the directive.
MEPs in the committee therefore call on the Commission to take action against Member States whose national laws are incompatible with the directive. National administrative practices very often constitute serious obstacles to the exercise of their rights by citizens, says the committee.
The report points out that the Commission has received over 1,800 complaints, 40 parliamentary questions and 33 petitions on these matters. Five infringement proceedings have been launched. Committee MEPs believe the situation shows the Commission's inability to ensure that Member States comply with the directive in consistent and timely fashion and to manage the sizeable number of complaints lodged by the public regarding the implementation of the directive.
Key concepts of the directive on free movement are misinterpreted
In particular, some Member States place vague interpretations on the idea of "sufficient resources" (the condition for a stay of over three months), say MEPs in the committee. The concepts of "family member" and "partner", in particular with regard to same-sex partners, are also misinterpreted. On these points, committee MEPs urge Member States to recognise not only spouses of different sexes but also same-sex couples, on the basis of mutual recognition. They point out to Member States that the recognition of free movement for same-sex couples does not necessarily entail recognition of same-sex marriage.
MEPs in the committee also call on Member States not to introduce legislation that imposes disproportionate or discriminatory sanctions on Union citizens, such as an aggravating circumstance in relation to a criminal offence committed by a Union citizen if that citizen had been illegally staying in another Member State.
The committee draws attention to some particular problems, for example in Belgium, where a delegation from the Committee on Civil Liberties found Union citizens being detained in detention centres for illegal immigrants.
Transitional arrangements for free movement tantamount to discrimination
MEPs in the committee also call for the scrapping, or at least a review, of the "discrimination" entailed by the transitional arrangements restricting free movement of nationals of Member States that joined the EU on 1 May 2004 and on 1 January 2007. They point out that four Member States of the EU-15 have not opened their labour markets to Member States of the EU-8, and that eleven Member States have decided to keep restrictions on their labour markets against Romanian and Bulgarian nationals.

Regional policy
Regional development funding for energy efficiency investment in housing
2009-03-30 - 09:16
All EU Member States and regions would be able to get EU regional development funding for energy-efficiency and renewable energy investments in housing, under rule changes proposed by the Regional Development Committee. The rule changes would mean European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) money could co-fund national, regional or local authority schemes to install e.g. double glazing, wall insulation or solar panels in housing, or to replace old boilers with more energy efficiency ones, in all Member States. Under the current Regulation, the ERDF already supports interventions in the housing sector, including energy efficiency, but only for the new Member States (EU-12) and under several conditions. In practical terms, the ERDF could only be used for common parts of a building (or the entire building in the case of social housing) in deprived urban areas.
All Member States eligible
Broadening eligibility to the "old" Member States was the key aim of a May 2007 European Parliament resolution on housing and regional policy, but it took the "impetus" of the financial crisis to get it introduced throughout the EU. It is expected to help create jobs in the building trade, and by reducing energy consumption, help to slow the rate of climate change. The changes do not increase funding or affect the Community budget, but they do enable Member States to shift their priorities in order to finance measures in this field.
The key legislative change needed - an amendment to ERDF Regulation 1080/2006 Article 7 ("Eligibility of Expenditure") is backed in a co-decision report by Emmanouil Angelakas , (EPP-ED, Greece).
The 4% ceiling
In each Member State, spending on energy efficiency improvements and the on the use of renewable energy in housing would be eligible for ERDF support, up to a ceiling of 4% of the Member State's total ERDF allocation.
New (EU-12) Member States will still be able to fund other types of housing expenditure under the existing ERDF rules (up to a maximum of 3% of the ERDF allocation to the relevant operational programmes or 2% of the total national ERDF allocation). Total spending on housing in the new Member States, under various rules, could reach 6% of their total ERDF allocation.
From "low income households" to "social cohesion"
However, the categories of housing eligible under national rules would be decided by each Member State, "in order to support social cohesion". (The measure was first intended to apply only to "low-income households", but this caused problems because "low income" definitions differ from one Member State to the next). The decision as to whether or not to support energy investments in buildings, in accordance with national rules, remains an exclusive competence of Member States.
New costs covered
Another amendment makes three new types of costs eligible for ERDF grants: indirect costs (up to 20% of the direct costs of an operation), lump sums (up to €50,000) and flat-rate costs, calculated using standard national scales. This change is meant to simplify the declaration of expenditure, and enable public authorities to prepare projects and measures faster and more efficiently. To ensure certainty as to the law, these new types of costs would be deemed eligible for ERDF funding with effect from 1 August 2006, when Regulation 1080/2006 entered into force.
Climate change
Buildings account for about 40% of final energy demand, and an estimated 40% of greenhouse gas emissions, in the EU. The Commission estimates that cost-effective energy savings in the building sector could reach 28% by 2020 (in turn reducing the EU's total final energy consumption by about 11% - COM (2006) 545 (19.10.2006).

Regional policy
European Regional Development Fund, European Social Fund, Cohesion Fund - updating the financial rules
2009-03-30 - 09:16
Parliament's assent is requested to a series of amendments to structural fund rules (i.e. the "General Regulation"), on the one hand to accelerate funding and boost liquidity for projects, and on the other to simplify rules, so as to enable faster project implementation. Iratxe GARCÍA PÉREZ (PSE, ES) for the Regional Development Committee recommends Parliament give its assent. Key points - four main areas of intervention
1. Boost support from EIB and EIF (articles 44 and 46) - change will enable contracts for financial engineering operations to be granted directly to these institutions, which will also be empowered to provide more financial support for technical activities related to project preparation and implementation.
2. Simplifying spending eligibility (Article 56) - one amendment allows project overheads to be paid as a lump sum and makes in-kind contributions (such as volunteering) eligible spending - which makes it easier to for Member States to match EU funds. Will apply retroactively from 1 August 2006, to ensure rules apply uniformly to all projects in 2006-2013.
3. More money up front for ERDF and ESF (Article 82) - the 2009 pre-financing instalment for EU-12 is increased by 2%, and EU-15 get a new instalment of 2.5%, also for 2009. European Territorial Objective (cross-border co-operation) programmes including at least one Member State that joined on or after 1 May 2004 get an additional 2% advance for 2009. Additional advances under this measure total € 6.25 billion.
4. Accelerating spending on major projects (Article 78) - to speed up payments; this change would allow for payments of costs incurred to be submitted before the Commission approves the project. Furthermore, the current 35% state aid ceiling on advance payments (Treaty article 87) is removed, thus allowing advances of up to 100% for state aid beneficiaries.
Flexibility to distribute EU and national funding shares over the entire programming period will give national economies immediate cash flow to help cope with budget restrictions.
Rapid entry into force of the proposed changes is essential to meet Member States' need for liquidity and help beneficiaries to spend more, faster.
Simplifying rules and procedures - current changes are just one example. Further simplification is needed to facilitate beneficiaries' access to and use of structural funds. Parliament welcomes Council decision to set up an informal expert group on simplification.

Step up eco-labelling
2009-03-30 - 09:16
A first reading agreement has been reached aiming at the voluntary EU Ecolabel ("EU flower") system for environment-friendly products to become less costly and bureaucratic to use. The label has so far been awarded to over 3,000 products such as detergents, paper and shoes. The overall objective of the proposed regulation is to promote products with a reduced environmental impact through the use of a voluntary scheme, the Ecolabel scheme.
The proposed regulation sets general requirements for the development of the Ecolabel criteria for any goods or services which are supplied for distribution, consumption or use on the Community market. The criteria themselves will not be determined by the regulation, but by subsequent decisions, for each product group (laundry detergents, soaps and shampoos, tissue paper, camp site service, etc.)
Ecolabel for processed food - consider if only for organic products
As demanded by MEPs, before criteria for food and feed products are developed, the Commission shall first conduct a study to see whether it is possible to set reliable environmental criteria for such products. It shall also be considered whether only products certified organic would be eligible for receiving the Ecolabel award, to avoid confusion for consumers.
No Ecolabel for toxic products
To meet high expectations of quality and chemical safety, the Ecolabel should not in principle be awarded to goods containing substances of very high concern (e.g. toxic, hazardous to the environment, carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction), as demanded by MEPs.
Considering reduced animal testing
Specific Ecolabel criteria for each product group are set by the Commission. To obtain the Ecolabel, products and services must meet stringent environmental criteria which are agreed at European level following wide consultation with experts from industry, environmental and consumer organisations and trade unions.
As demanded by MEPs want the Commission to ensure that reducing animal testing shall be taken into account in the development and revision of the award criteria for Ecolabel product groups, in addition to the environmental performance criteria proposed by the Commission (such as impact on climate change, energy and resource consumption and waste generation) Rapporteur Salvatore TATARELLA UEN IT A6-0105/2009 Community Ecolabel scheme Procedure : Codecision (1st reading)

MEPs call for increased participation in EU's Eco-Management and Audit Scheme
2009-03-30 - 09:16
A first reading agreement has been reached aiming at simplifying the EU's voluntary Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS - which helps organisations to identify, monitor, measure and report on their environmental impacts) in order to attract new participants. The new regulation aims at further attract organisations to register EMAS without harming its environmental integrity. On EMAS
EMAS, the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme, is a voluntary scheme which is designed to recognise and reward proactive organisations that go beyond what environmental laws expect of them and that are constantly improving the way they interact with the environment.
Once an organisation has proved that it is improving its environmental performance according to set objectives, as verified by an independent body, it can begin using the EMAS logo. The logo is not only proof that the organisation has set up a strict programme of environmental performance improvements, but also that it respects existing environmental legislation and that its employees play a key role in the process.
EMAS came into force in 1995. In the beginning it was limited to companies in the industrial sector but the scheme's scope was widened its scope in 2001 to include public and private service providers as well as public sector organisations.
Compromise reached:
The measures to improve EMAS include (as proposed by the Commission):
Greater promotion and support for EMAS by Member States and EU institutions to increase awareness of its benefits among organisations and citizens. This includes: financial support; fiscal measures; registration subsidies or tax breaks for registered organisations; longer permit validity and less frequent inspections by environmental enforcement agencies of EMAS-registered companies
A harmonised system throughout the European Union with a single set of rules
Extending EMAS to the rest of the world so that companies can use EMAS in their contacts with non-EU organisations
Making use of the EMAS logo easier and allowing it to be more widely used
Simplifying the legislation to make it easier to understand how the scheme works and what the obligations of EMAS participation are.

International Treaty for the protection of the Arctic
2009-03-30 - 09:16
MEPs will debate a possible international treaty for the protection of the Arctic after hearing statements from the Council and Commission. The European Parliament will also vote on a resolution on Thursday 2 April. On 9 October 2008, MEPs suggested that the Commission should be prepared to pursue the opening of international negotiations designed to lead to the adoption of an international treaty for the protection of the Arctic, having as its inspiration the Antarctic Treaty, as supplemented by the Madrid Protocol signed in 1991, but respecting the fundamental difference represented by the populated nature of the Arctic and the consequent rights and needs of the peoples and nations of the Arctic region.
MEPs believe, however, that as a minimum starting-point such a treaty could at least cover the unpopulated and unclaimed area at the centre of the Arctic Ocean. Council and Commission statements - International treary for the protection of the Arctic

EU-Russia cooperation agreement: MEPs’ recommendations
2009-03-30 - 09:16
The renewal of the EU’s cooperation agreement with Russia should be used as an opportunity to raise the human rights situation in the country, improve the security of gas supplies from Russia and seek assurances that Moscow will no longer use force against its neighbours, argues the EP Foreign Affairs Committee. The committee is putting forward recommendations for the negotiations on the agreement, following the resumption of talks between the EU and Russia on 2 December 2008.
The report, drafted by Janusz Onyszkiewicz (ALDE, PL), calls on Moscow in particular to respect freedom of expression and association by introducing legislation that complies with its European and international commitments as a member of the Council of Europe and the OSCE.
Intimidation and harassment of human rights activists must stop, say MEPs. The regular six-monthly human rights consultation between the European Union and Russia, which has failed to produce any tangible results since its establishment in 2005, must be reformed, they add.
Russia’s role in external affairs
The current negotiations on a new cooperation agreement between the EU and Russia must not be seen as legitimising the status quo in Georgia, argues the committee. Russia should be asked, under the new agreement, to provide assurances that it will not use force against its neighbours.
The talks on renewing the EU-Russia partnership agreement, which expired at the end of 2007, started on 4 July 2008 before being suspended following the war in Georgia. The resumption of talks was decided at the EU-Russia summit in Nice last November.
MEPs in the committee also call on Russia to contribute to finding sustainable political settlements for Kosovo, Transdniestria and Moldova.
Energy security
The principles of the Energy Charter (signed but not ratified by Moscow) and the charter’s protocol on transit (not signed by Russia) should be incorporated into the new cooperation accord, say MEPs. The protocol bans the suspension or reduction of energy flows in the event of a dispute on transit modalities until dispute settlement procedures have been completed.
Membership of the WTO
MEPs in the committee, who support the Russia’s membership application to the WTO – it has been a candidate since June 1993 – call on the Russian authorities to scrap all discriminatory taxes such as those applied to rail freight and to abolish their export taxes on untreated timber. They also want Russia to eliminate gradually the charges its levies for overflying Siberia.
In addition, Russia is urged to guarantee the property rights of foreign investors and to revise the 2008 law on strategic sectors, which defines 42 sectors in which the taking of controlling shares by foreign investors must be submitted for prior approval.
The Russian authorities should bring their intellectual property rules into line with WTO rules and international agreements, in particular TRIPS (the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights), and should seek to ensure that they are fully implemented so as to combat counterfeiting and piracy.
A more flexible visa regime needed
Lastly, members of the committee call on the Russian authorities to undertake to reduce administrative obstacles applied non-reciprocally to all travellers, especially the requirement for Europeans to have an invitation and to register upon arrival.

MEPs to vote on resolution on EU-Belarus relations
2009-03-30 - 09:16
Parliament will vote on a resolution on the situation in Belarus following the debate that took place in Strasbourg on 25 March. On 16 March, the Council said:
"1. The Council welcomes that certain positive steps have been taken by Belarus following the Council's decision on the temporary suspension of the travel restrictions imposed on certain officials of Belarus in October 2008. The Council also welcomes the increased high-level EU-Belarus dialogue, including bilateral contacts, and the intensified technical cooperation initiated by the Commission, as a way of building mutual understanding and providing an opportunity to address the parties' concerns and issues of common interest. The Council also welcomes and further encourages the continuation of Belarus' cooperation with OSCE/ODIHR on electoral legislation.
2. Nevertheless, the Council continues to be concerned about the human rights situation in Belarus and the recent cases of violation in this area. The Council stresses the importance for Belarus to address the concerns raised in this regard and to continue moving forward, through progressive substantial steps, in the areas identified in the Council Conclusions of 13 October 2008. In this context, the Council looks forward to the launching of a Human Rights Dialogue with Belarus in the near future. Motion for resolution - Bi-annual evaluation of the EU Belarus dialogue

Avoiding potential risks of electromagnetic fields
2009-03-30 - 09:16
Antennas, mobile phone masts and other electromagnetic emitting devices should be set within a specific distance from schools and health institutions, according to a report to be voted on next week by the European Parliament. The Commission should make more reliable information available about the effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields to citizens who feel that they are not well informed. The report acknowledges the wide use of wireless technologies and other electromagnetic emitting technologies and their benefits to society, but also raises concerns over their "continuing uncertainties about possible health risks." In particular, there are concerns about the exposure of children and young people to electromagnetic fields. Therefore, MEPs of the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee are calling for stricter regulation and protection for residents and consumers.
Better protection for EU citizens through "optimal placement of devices"
The report, drafted by Frédérique RIES (ALDE, BE), notes that industry stakeholders can already influence a number of safety factors, including the direction of the transmitting antenna in relation to living spaces, and the distance between the site and the transmitter. Industry actors are being encouraged to use this power to give better protection to people living nearby, and to prevent a "proliferation of poorly positioned masts and transmitters."
The placement of antennas, mobile phone masts and high-voltage power lines should be negotiated between industry actors, public authorities and residents' associations in order to minimise health risks and legal action cases. This will also ensure that EMF-transmitting devices are kept clear of schools, crèches, retirement homes and health care institutions. In addition to this, the committee recommends that mobile telephone operators should negotiate to share infrastructure in order to reduce "the exposure of the public to EMFs."
Increased access to reliable information
A recently published Eurobarometer study suggests that "the majority of citizens do not feel that the public authorities inform them adequately on measures to protect them from EMFs." In light of this, the report makes a number of suggestions to improve EU citizen's access to reliable information. These suggestions include making maps available on the internet, which show areas of exposure to EMF transmitting devices. In conjunction with this, the Commission should produce a yearly report on the "level of electromagnetic radiation in the EU" and its sources.
Committee MEPs also call for an improvement to consumer information, by amending the technical standards of the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation to impose labelling requirements, which would show the transmitting power of every wireless-operated device.
Review of EMF limits and Interphone findings
The Commission is urged to review "the scientific basis and adequacy of the EMF limits as laid down in Recommendation 1999/519/EC" and to then report back to Parliament. This is in light of the fact that many member states have voluntarily introduced much stricter regulations than are required by the EU.
The report also refers to the Interphone study, which began in 2000, and which is a wide ranging scientific project to look into the links between mobile phones and certain types of cancer, including brain, auditory and parotid gland tumours. The results have been expected since 2006, but have been repeatedly postponed. The Committee is particularly concerned by the "appeal for caution" from Elisabeth Cardis, the coordinator of the Interphone study, that "as far as children are concerned, mobile phones should not be used beyond reasonable limits."
The report therefore calls on the Commission, who has made significant financial contributions towards this study, to ask those who are in charge of the project "why no definitive findings have been published." Parliament and Member States should be informed without delay if a response is given.
Children and young people
Children and young people aged 10 to 20 are amongst the highest users of mobile phones, which is of concern to the Committee as there are uncertainties remaining about the possible health risks, "particularly to young people whose brains are still developing." The report suggests that in order to raise awareness of the dangers of mobile phones, and to encourage good mobile phone techniques, such as using hands-free kits, keeping calls short and switching off phones, that "the Community funding earmarked for studies on EMFs be partly switched to finance" an awareness raising campaign.
Aggressive marketing campaigns by telephone operators, including "the sale of mobile phones designed solely for children or free call time packages aimed at teenagers" are also condemned by the committee.

The establishment of residue limits of pharmacologically active substances in foodstuffs of animal origin
2009-03-30 - 09:16
Avril Doyle (EPP-ED, IE) for the Environment Committee will be recommending the Parliament approve the common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down Community procedures for the establishment of residue limits of pharmacologically active substances in foodstuffs of animal origin. The aim of the Commission proposal is to limit the exposure of consumers to pharmacologically active substances intended for use in veterinary medicinal products for food producing animals as well as residues thereof in foodstuffs of animal origin. This includes foodstuffs imported from third countries .The intention of new legislation was not to compromise but rather to enhance the availability of veterinary medicinal products in the EU which continues to be a problem for many veterinary practitioners. Finally, and in accordance with the principles of better regulation, the readability and clarity of the existing legislation should be improved.
The key points addressed in the new text are as follows:
- reference points for action : this is now defined as the level of a residue of a pharmacologically active substance, established for control reasons in the case of certain substances for which a maximum residue limit has not been laid down in accordance with this Regulation. In addition, Parliament introduced a new Article on implementing reference points for action. The reference points for action shall be reviewed in the light of any new data concerning the protection of human health and the food chain;
- European Food Safety Authority: the risk management recommendations should take into account any relevant scientific findings of the European Food Safety Authority, by way of letters of cooperation;
- scientific risk assessment: the principles of risk assessment pursuant to Articles 4 to 8 shall be applied in order to guarantee a high level of health protection;
- toxicological, as well as pharmacological or microbiological effects in human beings should be considered;
- equidae: a new clause states that veterinary medicinal products which do not have a maximum residue limit for equidae, which are not included in Annex IV of Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 or in Article 13(2) of this Regulation, and which are used "off-label", as defined in Article 1(16) of Directive 2001/82/EC, and "under the provisions of the cascade" and not administered intra-muscularly or subcutaneously, shall have a nominal withdrawal period of six months. Furthermore, the use of pharmaceuticals containing pharmacologically active ingredients not on "the essential" substances list or the "positive list" for equidae referred to in Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/82/EC and not administered intra-muscularly or subcutaneously, shall have a nominal withdrawal period of six months if deemed of clinical benefit.
- urgent authorisation: in specific cases where urgent authorisation is required to ensure the protection of human health and animal health and welfare, the Commission may, in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, establish a provisional maximum residue limit for a period not exceeding five years;
- requests for an opinion on maximum residue limits: the proposal had stated that the Commission or Member States may forward to the Agency requests for an opinion for substances not intended for use in veterinary medicinal products to be placed on the market in the Community and where no application for such substances has been made. Parliament introduced wording which states that the Commission, Member States or a third party pursuing legitimate interests may forward to the Agency requests for an opinion on MRLs for pharmacologically active substances in certain circumstances which are prescribed in the text;
- comitology: defining the methodology of the risk assessment and of risk management will be done in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny. Moreover, Parliament altered the time limits for the adoption of decisions;
- accelerated procedure for an Agency opinion: a new clause states that, in specific cases where a veterinary medicinal product or a biocidal product needs to be authorised as a matter of urgency for reasons relating to the protection of public health or of animal health or welfare, the Commission, any person who has requested an opinion, or a Member State may ask the Agency to carry out an accelerated procedure for the assessment of the maximum residue limit of a pharmacologically active substance contained in those products. The Agency shall ensure that the Committee is able to issue its opinion within 150 days following receipt of the application;
- placing on the market: a new Article states that if the maximum residue limits or reference quantities established under this Regulation are exceeded, the product shall not be placed on the market as a foodstuff, transformed into foodstuffs or mixed with foodstuffs.
Foodstuffs of animal origin containing pharmacologically active substances for which no maximum residue limits have been set may not be placed on the market;
- import: Member States shall prohibit the import and placing on the market of food of animal origin containing residues resulting from the illegal administration of pharmacologically active substances which are not subject to a classification in accordance with the text. Accordingly, imports from third countries of food containing residues resulting from the illegal administration of substances whose use is use is banned within the European Union shall be prohibited in the interests of public health;
- report: the Commission shall, not later than five years after the entry into force of the Regulation, submit a report which will, in particular, review the experience gained from the application of the Regulation, and, if appropriate, be accompanied by proposals.

Migration and mobility: challenges and opportunities for European education systems
2009-03-30 - 09:16
Migration has a significant impact on education, as children can struggle with linguistic and cultural barriers, according to a report from the Committee on Culture and Education. Therefore the committee supports the Commission in facing the challenges presented by internal migration and immigration from outside the Union, and calls for national and regional policies to be devised and implemented. Migration can be greatly beneficial to schools as it can enrich them both culturally and educationally, but at the same time it can present significant problems if cultural differences hamper understanding between pupils or between pupils and teachers. The report, drafted by Hannu Takkula (ALDE, FI) wants to encourage a more effective means of incorporating migrant children in national education systems, as he believes that workers within the Union will be less likely to move abroad "if there is a risk that their children will suffer educationally."
Improved teacher training
The committee believes that there is a need for special training for teachers which explicitly deals with the unique situation of children of migrants, and means of helping them to successfully integrate into mainstream schools. This kind of training is especially crucial in schools with a high proportion of immigrant children, and the report calls for these schools to receive the necessary staff and facilities to cope with the challenge of diverse classes.
Mobility for teachers is also emphasised, as giving teachers the opportunity to spend one or two semesters at a host university or school will allow them to develop their cultural knowledge and empathy with the situation of migrant children. Furthermore, the recruitment of immigrant teachers is encouraged, as it will facilitate contact with other cultures and will provide a role model for children who are struggling to adjust to a new country.
Host country languages, and lifelong learning
An important means of integration is a good knowledge of the language of the new host country, and as such, the committee believes that both parents and children should be involved in programmes for learning the official state languages. At the same time, the report also emphasises the importance of preserving links with their own cultures, and encourages children to maintain their own language, which can be helped by schools offering classes in the native languages of migrant children.
Promoting multilingualism should also be a key part of every school curriculum as it will promote the inclusion of migrant children, and will encourage inter-cultural understanding between different groups.
Integration not segregation
It is crucial that Member States avoid the creation of "ghetto-type schools or special classes for migrant children", and that instead, children are allocated to classes depending on their individual educational need. This should be supported by the development of educational programmes based on an awareness of human rights, which will help to prevent the spread of xenophobia and segregation.
Finally, the report calls for integration to be encourage through sports and other extra-curricular activities, as this can also help to combat social exclusion of those from less privileged backgrounds. The earlier and more successfully that migrant children are integrated into schools, the better they will perform through school, further education and eventually in the labour market.

Education
European cooperation for better schools
2009-03-30 - 09:16
Member States are responsible for "the organisation, content and reform of school education", but as increased globalisation means that countries are facing similar problems in education, the Committee on Culture and Education is calling for cooperation and sharing of best practices between states. The disparities between education systems in Member States and their possible knock-on consequences in economic and social disparities are also of particular concern. The Council has adopted three targets for 2010 relating to school education which focus on "early school leavers, reading literacy, and the completion of upper secondary education." These goals are vital for reaching the aims of the Lisbon agenda, but more importantly they will help to ensure higher educational attainment amongst young people, which will improve their future employment prospects.
Council targets, and the need for further investment
Pál Schmitt (EPP-ED, HU) for the committee is concerned about the current trend of decreasing literacy and numeracy skills amongst students; as Commission statistics show the numbers of low-achievers in literacy have actually increased from 21.3% in 2000 to 24.1% in 2006. Moreover, almost twice as many boys than girls have low literacy skills: 17.6% of 15 year old girls, compared 30.4% of 15 year old boys. The committee is calling for the Member States to take "all necessary measures to reverse" this worrying development.
The numbers of early school leavers also need to be reduced, and the report calls on Member States to identify "at risk" students as early as possible, and provide them with extra support with school work and with transition from one level of schooling to the next.
In order to tackle these trends as early as possible, the committee recommends that Member States and regional governments invest heavily in pre-primary education, and "to guarantee high-quality pre-primary and childcare institutions with adequately trained teachers and carers."
Inclusion and integration
The committee supports the recommendations of Hannu Takkula 's (ALDE, FI) report on "Educating the Children of Migrants", in terms of its calls for an end to the segregation of disadvantaged groups. In particular, the committee mentions the problems faced by Roma children and urges Member States to end the practice of separating Roma children into special classes or placing them into classes for people with disabilities.
Instead, a school system which reflects the diversity of modern societies is encouraged, and Member States are being called on to enhance the opportunities for education and employment for children from disadvantaged backgrounds.

Citizens' rights
Union citizenship: problems and prospects
2009-03-30 - 09:16
In a report drafted by Urszula Gacek (EPP-ED, PL) for the Civil Liberties Committee, highlights the problems and the future prospects of Union citizenship. MEPs in the committee point out that enlargement has led to a considerable rise in the number of EU citizens resident outside their Member State of origin but that very few are aware of their rights. The committee is disappointed at the low number of EU citizens resident in a Member State other than their own who make use of their right to vote in European or local elections.
Another key right of European citizenship, that of protection by the diplomatic authorities of any Member States when outside the EU, must be beefed up, say MEPs. The Union should also take steps to protect its citizens in non-EU countries, notably by seeking to prevent EU citizens from being subjected to the death penalty.
Lastly, the Civil Liberties Committee calls on the Commission to continue negotiating for visa-free travel to non-EU countries for all Member States. It criticises the "injustice" whereby citizens of some Member States must apply for visas whereas others do not, notably in connection with US "visa waiver program" which is not yet available to citizens of all EU Member States.

Visa policy
MEPs call for a moving towards a clear and transparent visa policy
2009-03-30 - 09:16
The creation of a community space, an area without borders, means that it is essential to put into place some common conditions to enter the area. However, the EU's current visa regulations are made up of a variety of rules. The Community Code on Visas, negotiated through co-decision by MEPs and the Council will consolidate and clarify the system. The question of visas was made a European issue by the creation of the Schengen Area, brought into effect by the Amsterdam Treaty. The aim was to create a common set of rules across the EU for visa applications. The Community Code on Visas will integrate into a single text, all of the legal instruments governing the procedures and conditions of short term visas (less than three months). It aims to guarantee equal treatment for people applying for visas, and will simplify and harmonise the rules regarding visa applications, and will create a more transparent system.
Improving service and the image of the EU
During negotiations with the Council, MEPs obtained an agreement that those states who do not have representation in a third country, "shall conclude arrangements on representation with other Member States that do have diplomatic missions or consular posts in that country." Currently, this presents significant practical problems for people who wish to apply for visas; for example, there is no Spanish representation in Murmansk, so people who wish to travel to Spain must first go to St. Petersburg which is a 24-hour train journey away.
Another means of improving the common external image of the Schengen Area and facilitating access to information, would be the creation of a common website. Committee MEPs are calling for one to be created as this would serve as a central point for the necessary information for visa applicants.
Extend the use of multiple-entry visas
MEPs have also obtained a guarantee that multiple entry visas should be granted to in order to reduce the high levels of administration for Member States and to facilitate travel for people whose "integrity and reliability have been recognised." In this case, the rapporteur, Henrik Lax (ADLE, FI), is calling for decisions on multiple-entry visas to be made based on a person's past visa record rather than relying on a series of pre-determined categories, such as businessmen, certain groups of students and close relations.
Reducing the cost of visa applications
The current proposal for visa applicants to pay a handling fee of €60, hurts the image of the EU, according to the committee, as this is seen a contradictory to friendly relations with third countries. Furthermore, due to travel costs and other incidental costs, the overall price of obtaining a visa is actually much higher than €60. Therefore, the committee is calling for lower rate of €35 to be introduced.
Certain groups of people are exempted from paying for the cost of a visa, including children under 6 months, school-children or students taking part in exchange programmes or people under 25 who are taking part in not-for-profit sporting, cultural or educational events.
The right to appeal
The committee wishes that people who have been refused a visa should be allowed a right to appeal, and should be given a detailed explanation of why their application has been refused. During discussions, the Council deemed that this would only be acceptable within the bounds of national law.
Application of the Community Code
The code will come into effect on the twentieth day after its publication to the official journal. The majority of its provisions will then apply six months after this date. Rapporteur Henrik LAX ALDE FI A6-0161/2008 Community Code on Visas Procedure : Codecision (1st reading)
