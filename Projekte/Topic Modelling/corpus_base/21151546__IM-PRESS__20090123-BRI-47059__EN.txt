President of Palestinian Authority to address MEPs
The President of the Palestinian National Authority, Mahmoud ABBAS , will address a formal sitting of the House on Wednesday 4 February, at a time when the world's eyes are on the events in Gaza. Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, was elected President of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) on 15 January 2005, having been named chairman of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) in November 2004 following the death of Yasser Arafat. A founder member of the Fatah movement, Mr Abbas was widely regarded as the architect of the Oslo peace process.
Crackdown on employers of illegal immigrants
The House will vote on a first reading agreement reached with the Council on the "sanctions directive", under which employers of illegal immigrants would be penalised while the immigrants themselves would be granted legal conditions of employment. MEPs are calling for criminal law sanctions in the most serious cases and want to make companies responsible for the actions of their subcontractors.
Energy security blueprint for the EU's future energy strategy
A joint debate on energy policy will take place on Monday, 2 February on a report drafted by Anne LAPERROUZE (ALDE, FR) on 2nd Strategic Energy Review and an Oral Question on the challenge of energy efficiency through information and communication technologies. Drawing on lessons from the recent gas supply crisis, the committee's own-initiative report sets out wide-ranging recommendations for the EU's future energy policy. It advocates emergency action plans, more grid interconnections among Member States and new climate targets to be achieved by 2050, including raising the share of renewables to 60% of total consumption.
Resettlement of Guantanamo prisoners
The Council and Commission will make statements on the resettlement of Guantanamo prisoners. The Council Presidency has warmly welcomed the decision of the President of the United States, Barack OBAMA to sign executive orders leading to the closure of the Guantanamo detention camp. During this legislative period, MEPs repeatedly called on the US Administration to close the Guantánamo Bay detention facility. The House will also vote on a resolution on this topic.
Situation in Kosovo
MEPs will debate the situation in Kosovo after hearing statements from the Council and Commission. A resolution to be voted on in Strasbourg and drafted by Joost Lagendijk (Greens/EFA, NL) welcomes the Serbian government's agreement to the deployment throughout the territory of Kosovo of the European Union Rule of Law (EULEX) mission in Kosovo, one of the largest civilian missions ever launched under the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP).
Climate Change Committee sets out future policy goals
MEPs will be debating and voting on Parliament's Temporary Committee on Climate Change final recommendations for the EU's future integrated policy on climate change. MEPs in the committee take as a basis the EU objective to keep the global average temperature increase below 2°C and call for a target of a 25-40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to be achieved by 2020. They recommend detailed measures to be taken in the key economic sectors. MEPs in the committee are concerned that "climate change is both more rapid and more serious in terms of its adverse effects than was previously thought".
The effects of the financial crisis on the automobile industry
On Wednesday afternoon, MEPs will debate the effects of the financial crisis on the automobile industry after hearing statements from the Council and Commission. Ministers have expressed deep concern about the serious situation that the sector is facing at present, putting at risk a very significant number of jobs. In 2008 there were about 8% fewer cars sold in the EU than in 2007.
MEPs want to strengthen Natura 2000 network
The Environment Committee calls the Commission to set wilderness conservation as a priority in its strategy to address climate change and defends an EU wilderness strategy, complementary to other existing instruments. In addition, MEPs underline the importance of strengthening the Natura 2000 network, stressing the need for more coherent policies among different sectors, such as agriculture and energy, in order not to undermine the conservation objectives of Natura 2000.
The use of PCB waste oils in an Irish food recycling plant
Late on Wednesday evening, Mairead McGUINNESS (EPP-ED, IE) will be asking the to the Commission questions on the use of PCB waste oils in an Irish food recycling plant.
Animal feed: MEPs to vote on deal with Council
"Animal feed has been the source of many food scandals, such as BSE and dioxin. We don't want to see that any more and have built up systems of prevention and control. The regulation for feed labelling is an important piece in the system to prevent feed and food scandals", according to Friedrich Wilhelm GRAEFE ZU BARINGDORF (Greens/EFA, DE), who drafted the Agriculture Committee's report on the matter. Parliament will be voting on a first-reading compromise reached with Council on plans to redraft existing EU rules on the authorising and labelling of animal feed. The aims are to preserve the customer's right to information while safeguarding the industry's intellectual property rights.
Member States to have more of a free hand to promote farm produce
Parliament will vote on proposals for Member States to be given greater flexibility to conduct promotion campaigns for European agricultural produce inside and outside the EU. However, the EP Agriculture Committee, which is tabling the report, wants to see greater involvement of trade associations, more opportunities to promote quality wines and an increase in Community funding for the promotion programmes.
Child pornography: stepping up the fight on the Internet
"Grooming" and paedophile chat rooms on the Internet should be criminalised and sex crimes be subject to extraterritorial legislation, says an own-initiative report by the Civil Liberties Committee which is on the Strasbourg plenary agenda. It adds that the EU should fund national programmes for dealing with this problem. The report, drafted by Roberta ANGELILLI (UEN, IT) calls for the criminalisation of "all types of sexual abuse of children" including "grooming" (the action of soliciting children for sexual purposes).
Alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners
The Council and Commission will make statements on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners. In February 2007, MEPs adopted a report saying that over one thousand CIA-operated flights used European airspace from 2001 to 2005 and temporary secret detention facilities "may have been located at US military bases" in Europe. MEPs will vote on a resolution on this topic during the 18-19 February plenary in Brussels .
Protection of traditional national, ethnic and immigrant minorities in Europe
Protecting traditional national and ethnic minorities, addressing inter-ethnic relations, and integrating immigrant minorities are crucially important challenges for the European Union, for its stability, security, prosperity, good neighbourhood relations, internal and external legitimacy and credibility. Various Members on behalf of the PES Group will be asking the Commission questions on the protection of traditional national, ethnic and immigrant minorities in Europe.
Consular protection of EU citizens in third countries
Article 20 of the EC Treaty entitles all Community nationals to diplomatic and consular protection from a Member State of which they are not nationals if their Member State of origin does not have a Representation in the third country in question. The European Commission wishes to improve the information available to citizens, examine the scope of diplomatic and consular protection, set up Member State "common offices", and develop links with third-country authorities. MEPs will debate consular protection of EU citizens in third countries after hearing statements from Council and Commission.
Value of informal and invisible work should be recognised says Committee on Women’s Rights
The Committee's own-initiative report, drafted by Anna Záborská (EPP-ED, SK), highlights the value of "intergenerational solidarity", a term which relates to childcare and taking responsibility for the elderly and dependent. According to the report, there is a generation of middle-aged women in the Europe who "often combine the role of mothers acting as daughters and hence responsible for elderly and dependent family members".
Transport Committee calls for proportionate regulation in general and business aviation
In answer to the Commission Communication on General and Business Aviation, the Transport Committee calls for proportionate regulation, increased airport and airspace capacity, and measures to further environmental sustainability for all civil aircraft operations which do not fall under the commercial air transport sector. The fastest growing sector in civil aviation in Europe, general and business aviation comprises high value activities, ranging from specialised aerial works (aerial cartography, agricultural flights, firefighting, air traffic surveillance) to aerial training and recreational flying.
Internationalisation of small and medium-sized businesses a priority of the European Parliament
SMEs account for 99% of the total number of businesses in the European Union, and create 75 million jobs, yet their international performance is "structurally weak". So says the International Trade Committee in a report which urges the Commission and Member States to enable EU SMEs to develop in a harmonious manner, gain access to new markets and to expand their export activities and internationalisation. SMEs are defined as enterprises with fewer than 250 employees and a have a turnover of less than €50 million.
Non-agricultural market access: MEPs to quiz Commission
At the Doha Development Round negotiations in Geneva in July 2008 a compromise was found in the area of non-agricultural goods and services. This result is said to be the starting point for any final conclusion of the Doha round. It is therefore essential to know about the possible effects on the European economy.
Security and safety of Internet transactions need to be strengthened, says International Trade Committee
The International Trade Committee, in a report drafted by Giorgos Papastamkos (EPP-ED, EL), believes that lack of trust in the security and safety of transactions and payments "constitutes the most important danger for the future of e-commerce". MEPs call on the Commission to investigate the causes and to redouble its efforts to "create mechanisms for strengthening businesses' and individuals' trust in international electronic payment systems, as well as establishing suitable means for resolving disputes related to illegal commercial practices".
Europe and China - More co-operation, not protectionism
The EU and China are becoming more interdependent, says the International Trade Committee, which means that EU-China relations require greater co-ordination among the Member States and with the Commission. Noting an imbalance in bilateral trade between the two partners - notably through China's inobservance of sustainable development, environmental limits and WTO rules - MEPs call on China to meet its obligations and on the EU to provide assistance and promote co-operation.
Economic partnership agreements: ensuring a real impact on development
Whether or not they sign economic partnership agreements (EPAs) with the EU, the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) should not be worse off than under the current system of preferences, says a report proposed by Parliament’s Development Committee. Flanking measures in the form of aid for trade should be used to help the ACP countries, for example to offset any loss of customs revenue.
Pre-commercial procurement an under-exploited driver of innovation
Pre-commercial procurement has significant potential to achieve high-quality and readily accessible public services, says Malcolm HARBOUR (EPP-ED, UK) on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, yet it constitutes an under-exploited driver of innovation-led growth for the EU. Pre-commercial procurement would benefit the healthcare and transport industries and would address "the social challenges of climate change, sustainable energy and an ageing population". Yet many public authorities are not aware of the potential of pre-commercial procurement and do not yet act as “intelligent customers”, the report says.
Human rights in the world
As usual the session ends with three debates and votes on human rights issues in the world, on this occasion the topics are: Sri Lanka, the situation of Burmese refugees in Thailand and the Philippines.

President of Palestinian Authority to address MEPs
2009-01-29 - 10:01
The President of the Palestinian National Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, will address a formal sitting of the House on Wednesday 4 February, at a time when the world's eyes are on the events in Gaza. President Abbas also addressed the European Parliament on 16 May 2006 (see link below) Mahmoud Abbas , also known as Abu Mazen, was elected President of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) on 15 January 2005, having been named chairman of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) in November 2004 following the death of Yasser Arafat. A founder member of the Fatah movement, Mr Abbas was widely regarded as the architect of the Oslo peace process.
His four-year term as President of the PNA was due to expire on 9 January 2009 but Mr Abbas has argued that, according to the constitution, presidential and parliamentary elections must be held simultaneously and so he must remain in office until the parliamentary elections scheduled for January 2010. This view is contested by Hamas.
Statements by the European Parliament
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on Gaza on 15 January in which it called for a ceasefire and the dispatch of "a multinational presence" to the territory "in order to restore security and secure respect for the ceasefire".
The same day EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering , referring to the reported shelling of the headquarters of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in Gaza, expressed "deep concern that even international relief organisations are no longer safer from attack in Gaza".

Resettlement of Guantanamo prisoners
2009-01-29 - 10:01
The Council and Commission will make statements on the resettlement of Guantanamo prisoners. The Council Presidency has welcomed the decision of the US President Barack Obama, to sign executive orders leading to the closure of Guantanamo. During this legislative period, MEPs repeatedly called on the US Administration to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. The question remains on which EU States will accept Guantanamo detainees. The House will also vote on a resolution on this topic. The Presidency warmly welcomes the decision of the President of the United States, Barack Obama, to sign executive orders leading to the closure of the Guantanamo detention camp within a year and an end to the harsh interrogation techniques previously used on terrorist suspects.
We believe that the decision has great symbolic and practical significance, and could facilitate strengthening transatlantic counter-terrorism and security cooperation, based on the respect of international law and human rights.
MEPS in January adopted a report welcoming the statement by the US President-Elect on closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility and bringing the inmates to trial and called on Member States to declare their readiness to jointly find solutions for remaining inmates.

MEPs encourage Serbia to continue to show this constructive attitude, which is consistent with its aspirations to join the EU.
While welcoming the improved security situation, the resolution underlines the need for a multi-ethnic police force in all areas of Kosovo. MEPs urge the Kosovo authorities to support the reintegration of the Serbian police officers who have yet to return. Council and Commission statements - Kosovo

Immigration
Crackdown on employers of illegal immigrants
2009-01-29 - 10:01
The House will vote on a first reading agreement reached with the Council on the "sanctions directive", under which employers of illegal immigrants would be penalised while the immigrants themselves would be granted legal conditions of employment. MEPs are calling for criminal law sanctions in the most serious cases and want to make companies responsible for the actions of their subcontractors.
The EP Civil Liberties Committee has already backed, by 46 votes to 6 with 1 abstention, the compromise reached with the Council by Claudio FAVA (PES, IT), the MEP guiding the legislation through Parliament.
Criminalising the employer, not the migrant
Between 4.5 and 8 million illegal immigrants work in the construction, farming, hotel and other sectors in the EU. One of the factors encouraging illegal immigration into the EU is the possibility of finding work. This legislation aims to reduce that pull factor by targeting the employment of third-country nationals who are illegally staying in the EU.
The Commission’s draft legislation is supposed to complement other measures, such as the “return directive” and the “blue card” directive, the overall aim being to combat illegal immigration more firmly while encouraging legal immigration. The “sanctions directive" would introduce minimum penalties at European level against employers of illegal immigrants. Employers could be fined, forced to pay wages in arrears at legal levels or even banned for up to five years from bidding for public sector contracts or from receiving state aid – whether national or European.
Criminal law penalties in the most serious cases
The directive would also lay down criminal law penalties against employers for repeat offences, where a large number of people in an irregular situation are employed, where the working conditions are exploitative, where the employee is a victim of human trafficking and this is known to the employer, or if the employee is a minor.
Automatic recovery of unpaid wages
An employer who is found guilty must also refund any state aid received the previous year and pay a graduated fine according to the number of illegal immigrants employed. In addition, he must pay a sum equal to the amount of taxes and other levies he would have paid if the worker had been employed legally and, where applicable, the cost of returning the migrant.
The employment relationship will be assumed to have lasted at least three months unless the employer or worker supplies proof to the contrary. MEPs demanded that the procedures necessary for the employee to recover the unpaid wages must be automatic, without any need for the employee to take action.
MEPs successfully argued that Member States should establish lower financial penalties for people using clandestine immigrants as domestic staff, provided the working conditions are not exploitative.
Grievance procedure
Parliament also wants Member States to set up mechanisms to enable illegal immigrants to lodge complaints. Third parties designated by Member States, such as voluntary bodies or trade unions, should be allowed to report a guilty employer without running the risk of being subsequently taken to court for assisting someone to stay in the country illegally. Irregular immigrants will, if they cooperate with the legal action against their employer, be able to get a temporary residence permit.
Firms that use subcontractors to be liable
If the guilty employer is a subcontractor, the contracting firm must also be held liable, and even fully liable if it turns out that the contracting employer knew the subcontractor was acting illegally. A list of employers who have infringed the directive may be made public – another successful demand by MEPs.
Effective and sufficient inspections
The Member States are asked to conduct effective inspections sufficiently frequently to check on the employment of non-EU nationals in an irregular situation. They must also require employers to check that their non-EU employees have a valid residence permit and inform a national authority of any new recruitment of non-EU nationals.
UK not opting-in
The UK government supports the general purpose of the draft directive as part of the wider fight against illegal immigration. Nevertheless, it has a number of concerns and has not opted-in to this directive. The UK government believes there is no legal basis or Community competence for criminal sanctions in this directive, nor would we support measures which could create a pull factor for illegal immigrants (e.g: back payments, facilitation of complaints procedures and any associated delays in returning illegal migrants).

Retention centres for immigrants notably in Mayotte and Lampedusa
2009-01-29 - 10:01
MEPs will debate the worrying situation in the retention centres for immigrants notably in the Mayotte islands and Lampedusa. The French Indian Ocean island Mayotte is an integrated part of the EU, and now sees a booming number of "boat people" arriving In January, hundreds of migrants and refugees have staged a peaceful demonstration against their treatment after temporarily breaking out of an overcrowded immigration camp on the Sicilian island of Lampedusa. An estimated 600 people forced open the gates at the facility and marched toward the island's centre. They joined a demonstration by residents, who were protesting government plans to open another shelter on Lampedusa.
The incident came one day after the UN criticised conditions in the camp. About 2,000 people are forced to live in premises designed for 850. New immigration rules in Italy force refugees to stay in the camp until they are deported or granted asylum. Lampedusa camp holds people picked up or rescued trying to cross the Mediterranean from North Africa. Debate: 3.2.2009

Climate Change Committee sets out future policy goals
2009-01-29 - 10:01
MEPs will be debating and voting on Parliament's Temporary Committee on Climate Change final recommendations for the EU's future integrated policy on climate change. MEPs in the committee take as a basis the EU objective to keep the global average temperature increase below 2°C and call for a target of a 25-40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to be achieved by 2020. They recommend detailed measures to be taken in the key economic sectors. MEPs in the committee are concerned that "climate change is both more rapid and more serious in terms of its adverse effects than was previously thought". Therefore the Commission should monitor, "whether the EU 2°C target would still achieve the aim of avoiding dangerous climate change". Furthermore the EU and the other industrialised countries should set as a group, a medium-term target of a 25-40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, as well as a long-term reduction target of at least 80% by 2050, compared to 1990.
A visionary desire to make a difference
According to the committee, we are at a turning point in energy and climate policy, reflected in a growing scarcity of raw materials but MEPs stress it is important "not to capitulate in face of the complexity of the problem but to show a visionary desire to make a difference". MEPs call for global warming and ensuing climate change issues be incorporated in all spheres and policies. Political and educational measures on the basis of a long term perspective are necessary and the citizens need to be engaged in the process of tackling climate change.
Detailed recommendations for tackling climate change
The report sets out in detail a broad range of measures, which, according to MEPs, should be taken in the following fields: energy, biofuels, energy efficiency, mobility, logistics, tourism, carbon capture and storage, agriculture, livestock rearing, forests, soil protection, water management, fisheries, waste and resource management, adaptation measures, health, promotion of technologies of the future, intelligent computer systems, education, training and awareness raising.
Measures proposed in the report include:
A binding goal of 20% improvement in energy efficiency by 2020 should be proposed by the Commission as well as specific interim reduction targets; minimum energy efficiency criteria should be included in a comprehensive public procurement policy for public buildings and services;
a flexible policy is needed which take account of the complex nature of biofuels production, including life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions and assessment of all relevant indirect effects;
the Commission should rethink the notion of quotas for biofuels and develop flexible policies taking into account the complex nature of biofuels;
the Commission should consider setting binding reduction targets for GHG emissions from the agricultural sector;
a European Climate Fund and/or corresponding funds in the Member States should be established;
an EU-wide "supergrid" accessible to all forms of electricity providers should be developed;
incentives should be made available for citizens to reduce emissions in an affordable way, e.g. by developing information on the carbon content of products and services.
Highest priority in EU spending should be climate change
MEPs think that in the next EU financial framework, the highest priority must be given to climate change and measures to combat it. They also see the need to increase funding to combat climate change in developing countries and want to incorporate emission reduction requirements and adaptation to climate change in development aid programmes.
The committee plans to publish a version of its report for the general public within three months after its adoption in plenary which is planned for the February 2009 plenary in Strasbourg.
Parliament set up its Temporary Committee on Climate Change on 25 April 2007. The proposed report represents the findings of the committee after completing its work Rapporteur Karl-Heinz FLORENZ EPP-ED DE Procedure : own-initiative

MEPs want to strengthen Natura 2000 network
2009-01-29 - 10:01
The Environment Committee calls the Commission to set wilderness conservation as a priority in its strategy to address climate change and defends an EU wilderness strategy, complementary to other existing instruments. In addition, MEPs underline the importance of strengthening the Natura 2000 network, stressing the need for more coherent policies among different sectors, such as agriculture and energy, in order not to undermine the conservation objectives of Natura 2000. MEPs in the committee call the Commission to define wilderness, addressing aspects such as ecosystem services, conservation value, climate change and sustainable use. The Commission shall undertake a study on the benefits of wilderness protection, regarding the social and economic consequences of the loss of biodiversity.
Impact of climate change on wilderness to be assessed
The Environment Committee wants the Commission to monitor and assess the impact of climate change on wilderness, and, at the same time, to set its conservation as a priority in the strategy to address climate change.
Wilderness strategy to be developed - special funding needed
The committee calls on the Commission to map Europe's last wilderness areas and to detect immediate threats to those areas. In order to develop an EU wilderness strategy, complementary to other existing instruments, special funding is needed for reducing fragmentation, management of re-wilding areas, development of compensation mechanism and programmes and raising awareness. Among the objectives is also the perception that biodiversity protection can be compatible with economic growth and jobs.
The strategy shall be carried out in cooperation with the local population and other stakeholders, regarding the acceptance of the Wild Europe Initiative, a partnership of several nature conservation organizations.
Natura 2000 and Rural Development Fund
The committee wants the reinforcement of the Natura 2000 network to ensure a coherent and functioning ecological network in which wilderness areas have a central place. The protection, management, monitoring and financing of wilderness areas under the Natura 2000 network shall take into account challenges such as climate change, illegal logging and increasing demand for goods.
MEPs in the committee stress the need for coherent policies in sectors such as common agricultural policy, transport, energy and budget to avoid undermining the objectives of Natura 2000 network. Concerning the reinforcement of the environmental protection into the EU agricultural sector, the committee points out that the Rural Development Fund is insufficient to finance biodiversity and wilderness conservation.
Only limited sustainable high-quality tourism in wilderness areas
MEPs stress the importance of ensuring that tourism in wilderness areas shall be "handled with extreme care". Wilderness areas shall be closed to access, having a limited part opened to "sustainable high-quality tourism based on the wilderness experience and economically benefiting local communities".
- Still some 46 % of the world’s land mass is wilderness.
- Forests today cover the 33% of the land area of the countries of the EEA region corresponding to 185 million hectares (ha). Only about 9 million hectares of forests (5% of the total forest area) is considered as "wild".
- The European network of Natura 2000 already covers the most valuable and bio-diverse areas of the European Union. This means that at least a big part of European wilderness is protected under the Natura 2000. What we need to do is respond to this challenge. 13% of the forest zone of the 27 EU Member States is designated as Natura 2000 sites, under the EU Birds and Habitats directive.

Energy security blueprint for the EU's future energy strategy
2009-01-29 - 10:01
Parliament will vote on a report by the Industry Committee on energy security and also look at ways of achieving energy efficiency through information and communication technologies. Drawing on lessons from the recent gas supply crisis, the committee's own-initiative report sets out wide-ranging recommendations for the EU's future energy policy. It advocates emergency action plans, more grid interconnections among Member States and new climate targets to be achieved by 2050, including raising the share of renewables to 60% of total consumption.
The report, drafted by Anne LAPERROUZE ( ALDE, FR) and adopted by a large majority in committee (38 votes to 5, with 4 abstentions), looks at the "Second Strategic Energy Review", which will be on the agenda for the 19-20 March European Council debate on the EU's future energy strategy.
Lessons learned: national and EU emergency action plans
In the aftermath of the recent gas supply crisis between Ukraine and Russia, which left many EU citizens without heating, the draft report calls on the Commission to propose revising the 2004 security of gas supply directive before the end of this year. The committee wants this revision to include "mandatory and effective national and EU emergency action plans" providing for:
- a common declaration of an emergency situation;
- the allocation of available supplies and infrastructure capacity among the affected countries;
- co-ordinated dispatching;
- the activation of emergency measures in unaffected or less affected states in order to increase the amount of gas available to the affected markets.
MEPs also stress that the EU should develop gas storage with fast-release capacity and that a single European gas grid should be established linking up all EU Member States. "Gas and electricity interconnections through Central and South-Eastern Europe along a north-south axis" should be developed and especially the Baltic Sea region needs to be integrated into the Western European network, says the report.
New partnership agreement needed with Russia
Even with the help of ambitious energy saving plans, the EU is likely to still be dependent on third countries for supplies of fossil energy in the medium term, say MEPs. The EU currently imports 50% of the energy it consumes - a proportion which could rise to 70% by 2030.
The committee supports negotiations for a wide-ranging new agreement replacing the 1997 Partnership and Co-operation Agreement with Russia, which supplies 42% of the EU's imported gas and over 30% of its imported crude oil.
More pipelines and liquefied natural gas terminals
The draft report also supports projects to diversify supply routes, such as the Nabucco, Turkey-Greece-Italy (TGI), and South Stream pipelines. "In the longer term, when political conditions permit, supplies from other countries in the Caspian region, such as Uzbekistan and Iran, should represent a further significant supply source for the EU", say MEPs.
They also stress that sufficient liquefied natural gas (LNG) capacity is needed - meaning that liquefaction facilities in the producing countries and LNG terminals and ship-based re-gasification in the EU should be available to all Member States.
2050 climate targets: 60-80% less greenhouse gases, 60% renewables, 35% energy efficiency
The draft report calls on the EU's heads of states to adopt new climate targets to be achieved by 2050: a 60-80% cut in greenhouse gas emissions, a 35% improvement in energy efficiency, and a 60% share of renewable energy in the EU's total energy consumption.
Saving energy is "the most effective and cost-efficient way of improving energy security", say MEPs, calling on the Commission and Member States to adopt immediately a legally binding energy efficiency improvement target of at least 20% by 2020. The two other "2020" targets - reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20% and increasing the share of renewable energy to 20% - are already fixed by the EU's climate change legislation, adopted in December 2008.
Nuclear power "at the highest technologically possible level of safety"
The committee considers it important to maintain nuclear energy in the EU's energy mix and calls on the Commission to draw up a "specific road map for nuclear investments".
MEPs stress that nuclear energy is to be used "at the highest technologically possible level of safety", adding that the EU's neighbouring countries, too, should adopt European nuclear safety standards every time a new nuclear plant is planned or an old one is upgraded.
Furthermore, MEPs in the committee say the Commission and Council should develop joint models and procedures together with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to prevent the peaceful use of nuclear energy from leading to the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Oral question
Achieving energy efficiency through information and communication technologies
An oral question on the challenge of energy efficiency through information and communication technologies is also part of the plenary debate on energy policy. The text of the oral question is as follows:
"The Commission has adopted an Action Plan aimed at achieving a 20% reduction in energy consumption as well as a 20% share of renewables in its total energy use by 2020.
How will the Commission aim to synergise future public policy support for ICTs’ enabling capacity with existing measures on the energy efficiency of ICT products? What incentives can the Commission identify that will help to ensure that measurable and replicable examples of ICT enablement of energy efficiency are made feasible in delivering the EU’s 2020 objectives?
Could the Commission say how it will ensure that ICT is included as a key indicator for implementing the EU sustainable development strategy?
Applicability and deployment of research projects are still to be driven. Could the Commission specify how to actually promote RTD in the ICT for energy efficiency sector? And how to better connect research with the development and deployment phase?
The transport sector has been recognised in the Commission Communication as one of the most promising areas for energy-saving potential. How will the Commission promote the take-up of ITS/ICT technology solutions for optimised traffic management by the road operators and traffic managers in the cities and regions of Europe? And how will the Commission ensure that the desired driver behaviour is sustainable?" Rapporteur Anne LAPERROUZE ALDE FR A6-0013/2009 Second Strategic Energy Review Procedure : own-initiative

Child pornography: stepping up the fight on the Internet
2009-01-29 - 10:01
"Grooming" and paedophile chat rooms on the Internet should be criminalised and sex crimes be subject to extraterritorial legislation, says an own-initiative report by the Civil Liberties Committee which is on the Strasbourg plenary agenda. It adds that the EU should fund national programmes for dealing with this problem. The report, drafted by Roberta ANGELILLI (UEN, IT) and adopted in committee with 45 votes in favour and 7 abstentions, calls for the criminalisation of "all types of sexual abuse of children" including "grooming" (the action of soliciting children for sexual purposes).
Internet providers of paedophile chat rooms and forums should also be criminalised, and national authorities should require Internet providers to block access to the websites concerned or to require the deletion of the registered domain names used. Credit card companies should also cooperate to block the Internet-based payment systems for websites involved in child pornography, says the report.
Those whose work involves regular contact with children should have an obligation to report situations where abuse is suspected, argue MEPs. Applicants for certain posts working with children should also undergo a criminal records check.
The EU should fund prevention programmes
In 2003 the EU adopted a framework decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. The Civil Liberties Committee wants the European Commission to revise the framework decision, so as to create national management systems for sex offenders including risk assessment and intervention programmes and therapies to minimise the risk of repeated offences. Such programmes could be funded from the EU's general budget, Members say.
They also call on the Member States to encourage victims of sexual exploitation to file criminal and civil claims in the national courts against sex offenders.
Advertisements encouraging sexual abuse towards children should be prohibited, and child sex tourism should be considered a crime in all Member States. Moreover, EU citizens who commit a sex crime outside the EU should be subject to standard extraterritorial criminal legislation.
The Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse ("the CoEConvention") signed by twenty EU Member States is the first international legal instrument to categorise the various forms of sexual abuse of children as criminal offences, including such abuse, perpetrated inter alia with the use of force, coercion or threats, even within the family,
The report states that seven Member States have still not signed the CoE Convention and eight Member States have still not ratified the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.

Alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners
2009-01-29 - 10:01
The Council and Commission will make statements on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners. In February 2007, MEPs adopted a report saying that over one thousand CIA-operated flights used European airspace from 2001 to 2005 and temporary secret detention facilities "may have been located at US military bases" in Europe. MEPs will vote on a resolution on this topic during the 18-19 February plenary in Brussels. The report deploring the passivity of some Member States in the face of illegal CIA operations, as well as the lack of co-operation from the EU Council of Ministers, was approved with 382 votes in favour, 256 against with 74 abstentions.

Protection of traditional national, ethnic and immigrant minorities in Europe
2009-01-29 - 10:01
Protecting traditional national and ethnic minorities, addressing inter-ethnic relations, and integrating immigrant minorities are crucially important challenges for the European Union, for its stability, security, prosperity, good neighbourhood relations, internal and external legitimacy and credibility. Csaba Sándor Tabajdi, Hannes Swoboda, Jan Marinus Wiersma, Véronique De Keyser, Katrin Saks and Claude Moraes, on behalf of the PES Group will be asking the Commission the following questions on the protection of traditional national, ethnic and immigrant minorities in Europe.
Are the Copenhagen criteria for respecting minority rights valid only for the new Member States and candidate countries or are they also binding on all Member States?
When and to which extent is a minority rights violation a domestic matter for the Member States?
Which demands made by national minorities are considered legitimate from the perspective of the political ‘norms’ of the European Union?
Should the EU elaborate a legally binding system of traditional national minority protection norms and control mechanisms on the basis of the Lisbon Treaty?
Does the Commission plan to elaborate a common set of standards regarding the integration of the new, migrant minorities in the framework of the common EU immigration policy currently under development?
Does the Commission agree that all Member States of the EU should ratify the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages?
Does the Commission consider multilingualism to include regional or minority languages?
Does the Commission agree that various forms of autonomy/self-governance on the basis of the principle of subsidiarity are the best solutions for the protection of minority communities?
Does the Commission agree that monitoring the level of protection of minorities in the Member States and accession countries should be given priority in the work of the Fundamental Rights Agency? Oral question to Commission

Consular protection of EU citizens in third countries
2009-01-29 - 10:01
Article 20 of the EC Treaty entitles all Community nationals to diplomatic and consular protection from a Member State of which they are not nationals if their Member State of origin does not have a Representation in the third country in question. The European Commission wishes to improve the information available to citizens, examine the scope of diplomatic and consular protection, set up Member State "common offices", and develop links with third-country authorities. MEPs will debate consular protection of EU citizens in third countries after hearing statements from Council and Commission.
Mumbai
In November 2008, the Council took stock of the attacks perpetrated in Mumbai/Bombay. European coordination measures were immediately launched, in Brussels, in Mumbai and at the initiative of the Presidency, in order to give effect to European solidarity. In this context, the Council stresses that EU citizens from countries without consular representation in Mumbai may use the consular services of any other EU Member State on the spot.
The diplomatic or consular representation providing protection must treat the EU citizen as if he or she were a national of the Member State it represents. The protection offered by embassies of other EU States may cover:
assistance in cases of death,
assistance in cases serious accident or illness,
assistance in cases arrest or detention,
assistance to victims of violent crime,
the relief and repatriation of distressed citizens of the Union.
This list is, however, not exhaustive. Council and Commission statements

The effects of the financial crisis on the automobile industry
2009-01-29 - 10:01
On Wednesday afternoon, MEPs will debate the effects of the financial crisis on the automobile industry after hearing statements from the Council and Commission. Ministers have expressed deep concern about the serious situation that the sector is facing at present, putting at risk a very significant number of jobs. In 2008 there were about 8% fewer cars sold in the EU than in 2007. The worsening trend over the last months suggests that things will get worse in 2009 with another 10%-20% fall in sales. The projected figures for heavy-duty vehicles are even worse with industry projecting decreases of about 30%. The whole automotive value chain is already affected by the crisis and the impact is likely to be particularly painful for automotive suppliers, especially smaller suppliers.
The automotive industry is a key industry in the European economy characterised by having few vehicle manufacturing firms and a substantial number of independent suppliers to which about 2/3 of the production is outsourced. The output includes cars, light trucks and vans, buses and coaches, medium and heavy trucks, motorcycles and agricultural and forestry tractors.
The automotive industry has for a long time seen mergers and acquisitions. Currently the main EU car industry is composed of DaimlerChrysler, Volkswagen (VW), BMW, Ford Europe, General Motors (GM) Europe, Renault, PSA (Peugeot-Citroën), Fiat and Porsche. In addition there are a number of small manufacturers. Some Japanese manufacturers also have significant production facilities in the EU.
The EU truck industry buses and coaches sector has seen a similar consolidation. Europe now sees Volvo, Scania, Iveco, DaimlerChrysler, MAN and Daf. Debate: 4.2.2009

The use of PCB waste oils in an Irish food recycling plant
2009-01-29 - 10:01
Late on Wednesday evening, Mairead MCGUINNESS (EPP-ED, IE) will be asking the to the Commission questions on the use of PCB waste oils in an Irish food recycling plant. Could the Commission inform the European Parliament about the current status of the national plans for the decontamination and/or disposal of PCBs (used as electronic transformer oils and banned in the EU since 1976), which Member States are obliged to communicate to the Commission according to Article 11 of Directive 96/59/EC [1] ?
What is the Commission view on the fact that national PCB disposal plans have not effectively protected the feed and food chain for the second time after the contamination of animal fats in Belgium in 1999 and now breadmeal in Ireland in 2008?
Can the Commission provide guarantees to feed and food business operators and consumers that all remaining PCB stocks will be safely disposed of in all 27 EU Member States at the latest by the end of 2010, as required by Article 3 of Directive 96/59/EC, and, if not, what will the Commission do to prevent the risk of remaining PCB stocks in the EU entering the feed and food chain?
Would the Commission be willing to present a report on the state of implementation of EU Feed Hygiene Regulation (EC) No 183/2005 [2] across the EU and in particular the classification of feed business operators in relation to the level of risk they present in the light of the ‘low risk status’ granted by the Irish authorities for the drying plant for breadmeal at the origin of the contamination?
Would the Commission agree that the uneven implementation of this Regulation according to Food and Veterinary Office mission reports in Member States may have led to inadequate risk classification of ‘surplus food processors’ carrying out processing activities, such as drying, which have led to a number of feed safety incidents in the past?

Animal feed: MEPs to vote on deal with Council
2009-01-29 - 10:01
Parliament will be asked to approve a first-reading compromise reached with Council on plans to redraft existing EU rules on the authorising and labelling of animal feed. The aims are to preserve the customer's right to information while safeguarding the industry's intellectual property rights. "Animal feed has been the source of many food scandals, such as BSE and dioxin. We don't want to see that any more and have built up systems of prevention and control. The regulation for feed labelling is an important piece in the system to prevent feed and food scandals", according to Friedrich Wilhelm GRAEFE ZU BARINGDORF (Greens/EFA, DE), who drafted the Agriculture Committee's report on the matter.
Following the BSE and dioxin crises, a rule was laid down in 2002 that all raw materials used in the manufacture of animal feed must be stated as a percentage of total weight . This "open declaration" system was one Parliament's key demands at the time. However, it allowed a tolerance figure of +/-15% on the label, with a right for users to be told the exact amount of each ingredient on request.
In a judgment on a complaint that this system infringes intellectual property rights, the EU Court of Justice has ruled that the principle of “open declaration” is valid but that providing "exact information on request" is disproportionate in relation to the stated objective of health protection.
Labelling and other information requirements clarified
In response, the Commission has proposed replacing the requirement to state all raw materials used as a percentage of total weight with a simple list of ingredients in decreasing order by weight , in line with rules for food for human consumption. Producers would also have to provide, at a consumers' request, quantitative data in a range within +/- 15% of the exact quantity, but have a right to refuse the request with reference to their intellectual property rights.
Key points of the compromise between MEPs and Council include the following:
- the right to refuse data to customers is replaced by a general clause stating that information should be provided "without prejudice to the provisions of the 2004 directive on intellectual property rights";
- the right of customers to demand additional information from the competent authorities (albeit only in the event of health and environmental emergencies);
- in addition to the new voluntary EU catalogue of feed materials, manufacturers must notify immediately, in an on-line register, the use of new feed materials not listed in the catalogue;
- if purchasers raise doubts as to the truthfulness of nutritional claims used in marketing, the national authorities must verify the "scientific substantiation" of the claim or ask the Commission to clarify matters (including, if necessary, by requesting an opinion from the European Food Safety Authority – EFSA);
- at MEPs' request, the new legislation will include a list of materials banned in animal feed (this list, compiled in 2004, includes household waste, waste water and packaging).
Under co-decision rules, a first reading agreement will be reached if this text is adopted unchanged by the full Parliament in Strasbourg this coming week and afterwards by the Council, meaning that it could enter into force in 2010.

Member States to have more of a free hand to promote farm produce
2009-01-29 - 10:01
Parliament will vote on proposals for Member States to be given greater flexibility to conduct promotion campaigns for European agricultural produce inside and outside the EU. However, the EP Agriculture Committee, which is tabling the report, wants to see greater involvement of trade associations, more opportunities to promote quality wines and an increase in Community funding for the promotion programmes. The draft consultative report, authored by Constantin DUMITRIU (EPP-ED, RO) and adopted in committee by a large majority, approves with amendments a Commission proposal to allow Member States to set up information programmes on the markets of non-EU countries where the relevant trade associations have not done so.
A similar possibility is already available for information campaigns on the internal market, under a regulation adopted in December 2007. The proposal would also give Member States the right to broaden the scope of the measures to be taken and to ask for help from international organisations to implement programmes, notably to promote olive oil and table olives.
MEPs are asking that the national authorities consult the trade associations or bodies concerned before drawing up their programmes, to ensure that the measures taken are properly targeted and of the right quality. They also want the sectors in which Member States can request assistance from international organisations to include wines with protected designation of origin and protected geographical indication.
Lastly, the Agriculture Committee wants the maximum Community financial contribution to be a 60% (rather than 50%) of the actual cost of EU-approved programmes, and 70% for campaigns to promote fruit and vegetables in schools.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Value of informal and invisible work should be recognised, says Committee on Women’s Rights
2009-01-29 - 10:01
Invisible and informal work, such as voluntary employment, domestic work and family duties, should be recognised on a legal, social and economic level in Member States, granting social security, professional status, earnings and equal opportunities for men and women, says the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality. The Committee's own-initiative report, drafted by Anna Záborská (EPP-ED, SK), highlights the value of "intergenerational solidarity", a term which relates to childcare and taking responsibility for the elderly and dependent. According to the report, there is a generation of middle-aged women in the Europe who "often combine the role of mothers acting as daughters and hence responsible for elderly and dependent family members".
Household management a valid skill
MEPs call for careful analysis to be brought to bear on the studies which suggest that the employment contract should be replaced by an activity contract.
They also urge the Commission to introduce initiatives which validate skills acquired in carrying out educational tasks, caring for dependent persons and household management so that "these skills are taken into consideration upon re-entry into the labour market".
Improving conditions for maternity and paternity leave
To promote a balance between family plans and professional ambitions, MEPs insist that all persons wishing to interrupt their formal careers or reduce the number of hours they work for the sake of intergenerational solidarity should be able to benefit from flexible working arrangements. To this end, small and medium-sized enterprises should "cooperate more willingly" and public authorities should "exhibit greater financial flexibility in their State aid budget forecasts".
The report calls on the Commission, in collaboration with the Member States and the social partners, to launch a review of work-life balance policies, particularly by "guaranteeing that the cost of maternity is not borne by the employer, but by the public purse", and by improving accessibility to care and assistance services for children, people with disabilities and the elderly.
Member States are also encouraged to both introduce one-year maternity leave in their national policies and to take steps to improve the treatment of paternity and parental leave.
Pensions and tax breaks
Finally, noting that that pension schemes in Member States still leave many women with only derived rights based on their husband’s employment record, MEPs call on Member States to address the structural factors contributing to inequality in pension schemes including the organisation of care and combining family and work life, inequalities in the labour market, the gender pay gap and direct discrimination in second-and third-pillar pensions.
Similarly, Member States are urged to promote a fiscal policy that "takes account of household financial obligations and particularly the costs of childcare and looking after elderly and dependent persons through a system of taxation or tax breaks".
Invisible work counts towards GDP
Finally, with a view to "making the invisible creation of national wealth visible", Member States' national statistical institutes are urged to assess the possibility of including invisible and informal work into their accounting systems, and, in turn, measure its value and contribution to GDP.

Transport Committee calls for proportionate regulation in general and business aviation
2009-01-29 - 10:01
In answer to the Commission Communication on General and Business Aviation, the Transport Committee calls for proportionate regulation, increased airport and airspace capacity, and measures to further environmental sustainability for all civil aircraft operations which do not fall under the commercial air transport sector. The fastest growing sector in civil aviation in Europe, general and business aviation comprises high value activities, ranging from specialised aerial works (aerial cartography, agricultural flights, firefighting, air traffic surveillance) to aerial training and recreational flying.
Proportionate regulation
The Transport Committee report by Luís Queiró (EPP-ED, PT) "broadly welcomes" the Commission's communication of 11 January 2007 entitled "Agenda for Sustainable Future in General and Business Aviation", but stresses that the Commission must ensure that proportionality and subsidiarity principles are applied "in the design and implementation of both existing and futures aviation legislation".
"General and Business Aviation in Europe comprises mainly privately owned aircraft and small and medium-sized enterprises having limited resources to keep up with the ongoing regulatory changes," the report argues.
Simplified security procedures for business aviation passengers
MEPs of the Transport Committee asks the Commission to examine the possibility of "laying down simplified security procedures and screening processes for business aviation passengers without in any way compromising their security and safety", and suggests that the Commission facilitate the exchange of best practice on security measures at small and medium-sized airports.
Increase and optimise airport capacity
Pointing out that it is "increasingly difficult" for General and Business Aviation to access major and regional airports, due to the growing demand from commercial air transport , MEPs urge the Commission and Member States to optimise the use of existing capacity through "better planning" and "the deployment of modern technologies", and to use helicopters as a "short-haul connecting tool".
They also encourage Member States and regional and local authorities to modernise and establish small and medium-sized airports and to invest in "specific infrastructure necessary for the operation and stationing of aircraft in the field of General and Business Aviation".
Environmental sustainability
The Transport Committee believes that the environmental performance of smaller aircraft can be "enhanced" by "using cleaner fuels and by promoting research, technological development and innovation". It stresses the importance of initiatives such as "Clean Sky" and the Cost Effective Small Aircraft (CESAR) project.
In terms of noise pollution, MEPs consider that "noise mapping is one of several tools providing for a balanced methodology to ensure airport development without causing significant noise pollution to local citizens".
Recreational and sport aviation essential
Finally, MEPs in the committee call on the Commission to take appropriate measures to facilitate access of the EU's General and Business Aviation manufacturing industry to world markets. They also consider the promotion of recreational and sport aviation, including of European aeroclubs, as "essential", because this sector constitutes "an important source of professional skills for the entire aviation sector".

Development and cooperation
Economic partnership agreements: ensuring a real impact on development
2009-01-29 - 10:01
Whether or not they sign economic partnership agreements (EPAs) with the EU, the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) should not be worse off than under the current system of preferences, says a report proposed by Parliament’s Development Committee. Flanking measures in the form of aid for trade should be used to help the ACP countries, for example to offset any loss of customs revenue. The report, drafted by Jürgen Schröder (EPP-ED, DE), urges the Council and Commission to accept any goods-only WTO-compatible proposals from ACP countries. The compatibility of the EPAs with WTO rules (GATT Article XXIV) pertains only to trade in goods and requires a “substantial part of the trade” to be liberalized “within a reasonable length of time”, says the report.
The Lomé accords between the European Community and the ACP countries included trade preferences for the ACP countries which were more favourable than those granted by the EU to other developing countries under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). This special regime, which has been challenged by the non-ACP developing countries, was temporarily extended by a derogation from the World Trade Organisation (WTO) which expired on 31 December 2007.
MEPs in the committee remind the Council and Commission that neither the conclusion nor the renunciation of an EPA should lead to a situation where an ACP country may find itself in a less favourable position than it was under the trade provisions of the Cotonou Agreement.
Aid for trade
Only strong accompanying measures will enable the ACP countries to benefit from the opportunities available under EPAs. Such measures must offset any net loss in customs revenue and be invested in order to diversify export production and produce more higher added-value export goods, says the Development Committee’s report.
Review clause and regional integration
EPA agreements should include a clause requiring a review within five years of the date they are signed. National parliaments, the European Parliament and civil society should be involved, according to the report. This five year period should allow an assessment of the impact of the EPAs on the economies of the ACP states and on the ability of these agreements to strengthen regional integration. A revision of the content of these agreements should be possible.
To prevent EPAs concluded with individual ACP countries or with groups of countries that do not cover an entire region from hindering the regional integration process, MEPs call on the Commission to redefine its approach and ensure that the conclusion of EPAs does not undermine this process.
Of the 15 countries of the Pacific region (including East Timor), where the 16th session of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly was held from 24 to 28 November 2008 (in Port Moresby, Papua-New Guinea), only Papua and Fiji have signed provisional agreements. The erosion of trade preferences - sugar for Fiji and tuna for Papua-New Guinea - prompted these countries to sign a provisional accord in November 2007.
Parliamentary scrutiny of the implementation of EPAs
The implementation of the EPAs should be monitored by a parliamentary body, says the report. In each case, this body should derive from the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly.
Parliament’s assent
The European Parliament will have to give formal approval (known as its “assent”), probably in spring 2009, to enable these agreements to enter into force. Since the accords have a significant trade component, this procedure will be the responsibility of the EP’s International Trade Committee.
The negotiations with ACP states were opened in 2002, following the adoption by the Council of the negotiating brief on 12 June 2002. The negotiations are being conducted with six regions (Caribbean, West Africa, Central Africa, Eastern and Southern Africa, Southern African Development Community, Pacific).

External/international trade
Internationalisation of small and medium-sized businesses a priority of the European Parliament
2009-01-29 - 10:01
SMEs account for 99% of the total number of businesses in the European Union, and create 75 million jobs, yet their international performance is "structurally weak". So says the International Trade Committee in a report which urges the Commission and Member States to enable EU SMEs to develop in a harmonious manner, gain access to new markets and to expand their export activities and internationalisation. SMEs are defined as enterprises with fewer than 250 employees and a have a turnover of less than €50 million. According to the report drafted by Cristiana Muscardini (UEN, IT), there are 23 million SMEs in the European Union, but only 8% export goods outside their national borders. The committee, therefore, stresses that the role of SMEs and their interests need to be taken into greater account in the WTO system.
MEPs in the committee call on the Commission and Member States to review their priorities at multilateral level by promoting the removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers and to foster international trade through appropriate measures to simplify and harmonise standards. The international trade system should also be made less onerous for SMEs, they say.
Reform of trade defence instruments would have failed
MEPs welcome the Commission's decision to withdraw the proposals for reform of the trade defence instruments. These reforms would not only have failed to enhance the external competitiveness of European industry but would have caused further serious damage to those Community industrial sectors jeopardised by foreign products illegally subsidised or unduly favoured by dumping practices.
The Trade Defence Instrument (TDI) system must continue to be a quasi-judicial procedure, based on objective and factual assessments, in order to provide for predictability and legal certainty, says the report.
MEPs in the committee consider that the internationalisation of SMEs is a primary objective of trade policy and should constitute a cornerstone of the European Small Business Act, and stress the need to improve access to finance, for SMEs, especially to micro-credit.
Preventing and combating counterfeiting
MEPs in the committee call on the Commission and Member States to commit themselves with renewed vigour to preventing and combating counterfeiting. SMEs should be encouraged to make use of instruments, such as patents, in order to secure their know-how and protect themselves against copying and counterfeiting.
The report points out that facilitating access to international markets for SMEs can contribute to creating new jobs, protecting and adding value to existing jobs, safeguarding and exchanging know how and specific features of EU and giving Member States a guarantee of solid and lasting economic growth.
Therefore, MEPs in the committee believe that the Commission should aim to conclude free-trade agreements or other trade agreements that are favourable to the European economy as a whole and to SMEs in particular.
With regard to public tenders, EU SMEs should have the same level of advantages and possibilities as those offered to SMEs in the main industrialised countries (including the United States, Canada and Japan), says the report, adding that "public procurement should be a key chapter in all bilateral and regional trade negotiations undertaken by the European Union, with a view to opening up public procurement markets on a balanced basis".
International register of geographical indications to be established
Finally, the committee supports the establishment of an international multilateral register of geographical indications enabling SMEs to protect their own geographical indications in a simple and economical manner. MEPs in the committee consider that the list of protected geographical indications should be supplemented and extended to all EU products which, by their nature or place or method of production, provide EU SMEs with a ‘comparative advantage’ over similar products from third countries.

Non-agricultural market access: MEPs to quiz Commission
2009-01-29 - 10:01
At the Doha Development Round negotiations in Geneva in July 2008 a compromise was found in the area of non-agricultural goods and services. This result is said to be the starting point for any final conclusion of the Doha round. It is therefore essential to know about the possible effects on the European economy. Daniel CASPARY (DE), Robert STURDY (UK), Corien WORTMANN-KOOL (NL)and Zbigniew ZALESKI (PL), on behalf of the EPP-ED Group, will be asking the Commission the following questions on the impact assessment of the compromises reached in the Doha negotiations on NAMA (non-agricultural market access) and services at the end of July 2008.
1. Has the Commission made any impact assessment of the above July 2008 package concerning its effect on the European industry and business sector, per sector and Member State?
2. Can the Commission give a detailed judgement on the estimated changes the trade balance in the sectors of industry, calculating the proposed flexibility for those sectors where our trade partners expect the most gains or where they can do most harm?
3. Can the Commission provide the European Parliament with information about the long-term effect on the comparative competitiveness of EU industry and the EU business sector and those of our trading partners especially from the emerging economies? Oral question to Commission

Production and employment in the textile and clothing sector in various EU Member States
2009-01-29 - 10:01
Helmuth MARKOV (GUE/NGL, DE), on behalf of the Committee on International Trade will be asking the Commission the following questions on the production and employment in the textile and clothing sector in various EU Member States: The European Union and China agreed to a joint surveillance system relating to exports of certain categories of textile and clothing products from China to EU Member States, but this system expired on 31 December 2008.
During the last two years, 350 000 jobs have been lost and the number of companies has fallen by 5%.
In view of the increasing number of enterprises that are ceasing or relocating production, leading to an increase in unemployment in several regions:
Has the Commission or any Member State proposed or requested an extension to the dual surveillance mechanism beyond 31 December 2008 or any other measures in this connection?
What measures does the Commission intend to adopt to protect production and employment in the textile and clothing sector?
Will the Commission continue to monitor real-time market developments (import statistics and customs monitoring) and keep the sector informed of the latest developments?
What is the current situation regarding the proposed regulation on 'made in' labels?
What measures have been taken by the Commission to address the proposals adopted by the European Parliament in its resolution of 13 December 2007 (P6_TA(2007)0628 - see link below)? Debate: 2.2.2009 European Parliament resolution of 13 December 2007 on the future of the textile sector after 2007

Security and safety of Internet transactions need to be strengthened, says International Trade Committee
2009-01-29 - 10:01
More than half of EU citizens and nearly 1.5 billion people worldwide have access to the Internet. Yet, despite the fact that one out of three EU citizens conducts online purchases, only 30 million carry out cross-border shopping in the EU. In view of this, MEPs are demanding increased Internet security, simplified rules and specific measures for SMEs. The International Trade Committee, in a report drafted by Giorgos Papastamkos (EPP-ED, EL), believes that lack of trust in the security and safety of transactions and payments "constitutes the most important danger for the future of e-commerce". MEPs call on the Commission to investigate the causes and to redouble its efforts to "create mechanisms for strengthening businesses' and individuals' trust in international electronic payment systems, as well as establishing suitable means for resolving disputes related to illegal commercial practices".
Combating counterfeiting, piracy and fraud
Illegal behaviour such as counterfeiting, piracy, fraud, breach of transaction security and violation of citizens' private space pre-existed in the "physical world", say MEPs, but these activities have been both "facilitated and exacerbated" by the abundant technological possibilities provided.
They stress the need to adopt and strengthen necessary and appropriate enforcement measures and for more effective and concerted coordination. This will permit the combating and elimination of existing illegal online commercial behaviour, without affecting the development of international e-commerce, MEPs say, especially with regard to cases liable to involve major public health risks, such as bogus medicines.
MEPs also believe that the regulatory deficiencies in the EU online market are hindering the development of a stable and strong European online industrial and commercial environment. This, they say, results in unsatisfactory levels of participation by European consumers in EU and international trade transactions and hinders creativity and innovation in commercial activity.
Improve regulatory provisions
MEPs deplore the regulatory provisions permitting or requiring geographic market partitioning, high Internet access charges, and any limits on the availability of delivery options in the EU.
The report calls on the Commission to improve the legal interoperability of Internet services through the development of model licences and other legal solutions compatible with jurisdictions. It also asks that existing European deliverables for legal interoperability be propagated in order to reduce both transaction costs and legal uncertainty for online providers.
The report points out that the inherently international character of electronic commerce calls for universal understanding and cooperation, and proposes that bilateral and regional trade agreements signed by the EU should contain explicit provisions covering broad and open use of the Internet for trade in goods and services. The fact that the Doha Development Agenda "does not mandate specific negotiations on e-commerce', is regrettable, it says.
Measures for SMEs
MEPs call on the Commission to develop a comprehensive strategy for removing the barriers to using e-commerce still affecting SMEs (access to ICT, costs of developing and maintaining e-business systems, lack of trust, lack of information, legal uncertainty over transnational disputes, etc.).
They ask the Commission to include policy recommendations, which offer incentives to SMEs to further participate in online trading products and services.
The report recommends the establishment of a database, designed to provide information support and management guidance to the new and inexperienced participants in online trading, and the conduct of a comparative economic analysis of the benefits of e-commerce and online advertising for SMEs, as well as case studies of successful EU SMEs trading online.
There is also a call for a detailed analysis of the influence of online trade upon conventional trading patterns and activities, in order to be aware of and consequently avoid potential adverse effects.
Increase investment for third-country Internet trade
Finally, MEPs believe that the participation of the least developed and other developing countries in international trade through the Internet has to be supported through increased investment primarily in basic infrastructure such as telecommunication networks and access devices. The report underlines the need for low cost and better quality provision of Internet services.

Europe and China - More co-operation, not protectionism
2009-01-29 - 10:01
The EU and China are becoming more interdependent, says the International Trade Committee, which means that EU-China relations require greater co-ordination among the Member States and with the Commission. Noting an imbalance in bilateral trade between the two partners - notably through China's inobservance of sustainable development, environmental limits and WTO rules - MEPs call on China to meet its obligations and on the EU to provide assistance and promote co-operation. In recent years, China has emerged as Europe's second largest trading partner. In 2007, Chinese exports to the EU - worth some €231bn - grew by 18.7%. The EU's trade deficit with China currently stands at €160bn and is continuing to rise.
Undervalued currency, counterfeiting and excessive bureaucracy
China's protectionist practices, excessive bureaucracy, the undervaluing of the Renminbi, subsidies in various forms, and the lack of a proper and agreed level of enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPRs) is hindering full market access for many EU companies, says the Committee in its own-initiative report drafted by Corien Wortmann-Kool (EPP-ED, NL). It is estimated that China’s non-tariff barriers towards the EU are annually worth more than €21bn in terms of lost business opportunities to EU companies.
MEPs call on the Commission to insist on the removal of all existing export restrictions in all bilateral negotiations with China. They also urge China to join the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) as committed in 2001 and to engage constructively in negotiations on opening its public procurement markets.
While MEPs welcome a certain rise in the value of the Renminbi that has taken place this year, they urge that the Renminbi continues to rise in value, so that its worth on international financial markets reflects China's true economic position. They also ask that the Chinese hold more of its foreign exchange reserves in Euros.
A policy of engagement and dialogue
Given the current economic climate, the Committee emphasises that Europe should not resort to protectionism in response to the growth in EU-China trade relations. Rather, the development of trade relations with China must go hand in hand with the development of a genuine, fruitful and effective political dialogue, it says.
Welcoming the trade-related technical assistance provided to China by the Commission, which MEPs say supports China in implementing its obligations and commitments in the WTO, the report calls on the Commission to continue the policy of engagement and dialogue with China.
MEPs therefore regret China's postponement of the EU-China summit which was to be held on 1 December in Lyon.
Up to the West to help tackle pollution and ensure workers' rights in China
The high levels of pollution caused by China's industry and its growing consumption of natural resources is of "serious concern". Noting that a high share of Chinese industrial production is owned by European firms or ordered by European firms and retailers for consumption in Europe, the report calls for enhanced cooperation between the EU and China to promote the transfer of low-carbon technology. "China cannot be expected to ask its population to carry the burden of limiting greenhouse gas emissions without action by the West", it says.
MEPs also call on European businesses operating in China to apply the highest international standards and best practices in corporate social responsibility with regard to workers and the environment, and to agree to mandatory monitoring by independent agencies.
Co-operation on all fronts
Another concern is the scale of production of counterfeit and pirated goods inside China, "which remains at an alarmingly high level", despite considerable progress made in China in terms of legislation on IPR. The Commission is called on to co-operate with the Chinese authorities at national and regional level in this regard and to continue the fight against counterfeiting.
Co-operation between the two partners is also needed on the regulation, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals (REACH), and on climate-friendly standards for cars, trucks, heavy vehicles, aviation and shipping.
Welcoming the continued development of EU-China cooperation on space science, applications and technology, MEPs believe increased cooperation between European and Chinese universities and increased mobility for scientists, researchers and students between the EU and China, would also be beneficial.

Pre-commercial procurement an under-exploited driver of innovation
2009-01-29 - 10:01
Pre-commercial procurement has significant potential to achieve high-quality and readily accessible public services, says Malcolm HARBOUR (EPP-ED, UK) on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, yet it constitutes an under-exploited driver of innovation-led growth for the EU.
Pre-commercial procurement would benefit the healthcare and transport industries and would address "the social challenges of climate change, sustainable energy and an ageing population". Yet many public authorities are not aware of the potential of pre-commercial procurement and do not yet act as “intelligent customers”, the report says.
"In spite of the numerous European research programmes, the results thereof have not yet been exploited by public authorities through public procurement," the report adds.
Gaps in the Commission communication
The Committee welcomes the Commission communication, which gives guidance on how EU rules can be used to stimulate public procurement innovation in Europe with the research and development (R&D) sector, but considers that there are some gaps regarding the manner of giving effect to the procedure proposed, especially at local and regional level.
It urges the Commission and Member States to work together to ensure that contracting authorities in local, regional, and other authorities removed from central administration develop the required expertise to implement innovative procurement.
It also urges Member States to screen national legislation to ensure that public authorities are not limited in pre-commercial procurement through inexistent, incorrect, or unnecessarily complex transposition of the relevant exemptions and unnecessarily elaborate national tendering requirements and procurement models.
Good practices and training to be funded
Contracting authorities should be supplied with training guidelines and tools showing how pre-commercial procurement might be used in research and development, says the report. MEPs therefore welcome the Commission initiative to fund exchange of good practices and training on pre-commercial procurement in the 2009 work programme of the Seventh Framework Programme.
Financial incentives
Financial incentives are extremely important in the uptake of pre-commercial procurement. MEPs note that such incentives already exist in certain Member States, where a substantial proportion of the costs of the first pre-commercial procurement can be matched by a central authority.
Therefore, financial incentives for public authorities across the EU to jointly undertake pre-commercial procurement of innovative technology in lead markets and other areas of common European interest should be considered, the report concludes.

Voting rights for non-citizens of Latvia in local elections
2009-01-29 - 10:01
David Hammerstein, on behalf of the Greens/EFA Group, Alexandra Dobolyi, on behalf of the PSE Group, Willy Meyer Pleite, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, Marian Harkin, on behalf of the ALDE Group will be asking the Commission questions on voting rights for non-citizens of Latvia in local elections. The authors of a large number of petitions before the Committee on Petitions seek voting rights for non-citizens of Latvia in local elections.
After restoration of independence, only citizens of the pre-1940 Latvia and their descendants had their Latvian citizenship restored. Others are entitled to obtain citizenship only through naturalisation; some persons are not entitled to be naturalised. Only 127 786 persons were naturalised in 1995-2007. As of 1 January 2008, there remained 372 421 non-citizens (16.36% of the total population).
Less than 1% of non-citizens are ethnic Latvians; non-citizens are almost totally persons belonging to ethnic minorities (ethnic Russians, Belarusians, Ukrainians, Poles, Lithuanians, Jews). Non-citizens, who are 26.1% of the population in Riga, 22.6% in Daugavpils, 24.8% in Liepāja, 21.6% in Jūrmala, 21.8% in Ventspils, cannot participate in local politics in the biggest municipalities. Moreover, their share is 39.8% in the town of Seda, 31.6% in the parish of Piedruja, 31% in the town of Olaine and the parish of Dobele. Given that the average turnout was 52.85% of eligible persons in the 2005 local elections, in some local governments the interests of less than 40% of the residents are represented.
The UN Human Rights Committee, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe, the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance and the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly have recommended making it possible for non-citizens to participate in local elections. In the resolution on the comprehensive monitoring report by the European Commission on the state of preparedness for EU membership of 11 March 2004 the European Parliament proposed that the Latvian authorities envisage the possibility of allowing non-citizens who are long-time inhabitants to take part in local self‑government elections.
– Does the Commission agree with the abovementioned recommendation of the European Parliament?
– How did the Commission address the issue in order to follow up the recommendation of the European Parliament?
– Does the Commission agree that the democratic deficit in Latvia may represent a clear risk of a serious breach of the principles of democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms? Debate: 3.2.2009
