The Conference of Committee Chairs , which coordinates the work of all Parliament's standing and temporary committees, has elected as its president German MEP Klaus-Heiner Lehne. Mr Lehne, who is a member of the European People's Party, himself chairs the Committee on Legal Affairs.
The Conference of Committee Chairs plays an important role in ensuring a smooth running of the work of the European Parliament's committees. One of its key tasks is to make recommendations to the Conference of Presidents (Parliament's President and political group leaders) on committee work and agendas for plenary sittings.
It can also advise the Conference of Presidents if there is a disagreement as to which committee should take the lead on a specific piece of legislation.
Finally, the European Parliament's Bureau (Parliament's President and 14 Vice-Presidents) and the Conference of Presidents may delegate certain tasks to the Conference of Committee Chairs.
