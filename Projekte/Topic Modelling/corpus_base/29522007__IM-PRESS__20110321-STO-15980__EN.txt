Green light for baby food manufacturer claims DHA is beneficial to health

Current EU rules forbid any health food claims for baby food intended for infants from 0-6 months
Â©www.flickr.com/21524179@N08 (nerissa's ring) The Environment Committee rejected a request by baby food manufacturers to claim that added DHA "contributes to the normal visual development of infants up to 12 months of age", but in plenary on 6 April a majority of MEPs overturned that decision and gave the go ahead for the health claim.
The Omega 3 fatty acid DHA ( docosahexaenoic) is found naturally in breast milk and researchers believe it contributes to the development of eyesight and brain development in infants. Many manufacturers already add the substance to their products.
Manufacturers applied for permission to make the health claim for DHA added to baby food (including follow-on formulae) for infants from 6-12 months.
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) gave a favourable opinion on the application and the European Commission proposed to add the health claim to the list of permitted claims.
However, MEPs on the Environment Committee noted that recent studies questioned the beneficial effects of DHA products as laboratory synthesised substances are not the same as those naturally present in human milk.
A group of MEPs from the Socialist and Democrat group - Glenis Willmott (UK), Daciana Sarbu (Romania), Nessa Childers (Ireland) and Karin Kadenbach (Austria) drew up a resolution arguing that there is no scientific consensus on the impact that DHA-fortified formulae has on infants.
They argued that more research is needed on the beneficial or harmful effects of added DHA and said the health claim could be misleading and might be misused as a marketing tool.
Vote and its consequences
The resolution opposing the plan did not achieve the necessary qualified majority of 368 votes, so it fell - 328 voted in favour, 323 against and there were 26 abstentions, leaving the way clear for baby food producers to claim on the packaging of their products that DHA "contributes to the normal visual development of infants up to 12 months of age".
