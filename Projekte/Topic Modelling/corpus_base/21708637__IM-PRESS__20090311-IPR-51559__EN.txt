Speaking in plenary, European Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering addressed the tragic killings at a school in Winnenden, Baden-Württemberg.
President Pöttering said: "It is with great sorrow that we have learnt of the dramatic events in Winnenden in Baden-Württemberg, where 15 people have lost their lives under the most tragic circumstances at the Albertville secondary school."
The 17-year old assassin, who used to be a student at the school, committed suicide after the killings. In addition, two policemen were injured in a shooting in a local supermarket when chasing the gunman.
"In the name of the EP I want to offer my condolences to and express my solidarity with the victims' families. The victims were innocent young students as well as three of the school's teachers.
All of us are horrified. We are speechless and in deep shock.
This tragedy comes only 6 months after a similarly horrifying gun rampage in a school in Kauhajoki, Finland. It is our duty as responsible politicians in the EU and in all Member States to do our utmost to identify and prevent such deeds in time.
We are also shocked about another tragic incident in Alabama in the US where an assassin killed at least ten people before shooting himself.
Once again, I would like to express my deep sympathy and solidarity with the victims' families." The House observed a minute of silence.
