The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality voted unanimously on Tuesday for EU measures to be introduced to raise awareness of the problem of violence against women.
Men's violence against women is an extensive and complex problem. The focus of the committee's report, drafted by Maria Carlshamre (ALDE, SE), is on men's violence against women in close relationships.
The report states that "large-scale prevalence studies in Sweden, Germany and Finland show that at least 30-35% of women between 16 and 67 have at one time been victims of physical or sexual violence" and "surveys show that 65-90 % of prostituted women had already been subjected to sexual abuse as children or later" .
The committee urges the Member States to "recognise marital sexual violence as a crime and make rape within marriage a criminal offence" , "not to accept any reference to cultural practice as an extenuating circumstance in cases of men's violence against women such as in crimes of honour and genital mutilation" and "to ensure victims' right to safe access to justice".
MEPs say that male violence against women should be regarded as a "violation of human rights reflecting unequal gender power relations" . "Unequal distribution of power lies at the root of all violence against women" according to the committee. They stress that there is a need for proactive and preventive strategies aimed at the perpetrators and those at risk of becoming perpetrators.
There is not enough data available on this problem and so the report calls for a harmonised methodology and the appointment of national rapporteurs to gather information on such violence. MEPs underlined that " men's violence against women affects the children and recommend that children who witness their mother being battered should be regarded as victims" .
The rapporteur emphasised that this form of violence affects women at all social levels, and in all Member States. During the debate on the report last week she said the biggest problem was that "we are silent" .
