Food rules: What's cooking in the Parliament

Keep up to date on new food rules Food legislation is on the menu in the EP. MEPs have votedon proposals about GMOs, food labelling and will vote on food quality. The main idea is to give consumers more information, choice and quality. It will be up to them to choose what they eat - but Parliament's decisions will allow them to make a more informed decision.
What's on the plate?
In July the Plenary approved a proposal to allow EU countries to ban or restrict the cultivation of GMOs (on environmental grounds). The new law will not change the current authorisation procedure by the European Commission, which is based on health concerns.
Also in July, the Plenary agreed that food labels should be simpler, clearer (with no fine print) and provide information not only on ingredients, but also about things like trans fats or allergens that may pose a risk to health.
New rules on food quality were presented to the Agriculture Committee in April proposing a quality system for agricultural products, geographical indication and guidelines. It will introduce the compulsory labelling of place of farming and will make it easier to promote traditional food. The first reading in the plenary is scheduled for September.
After the failure of the conciliation procedure on novel foods MEPs called on the European Commission to prepare a new proposal as soon as possible. The EP and the Council couldn't agree on cloned food - the EP wanted to ban food production from cloned animals and their offspring, the Council supported a ban only on "the first generation" food.
As the legislation moves through the EP over the coming months we will update the feature, so check back to find out the latest about votes in the committees and plenary.

Food labels: clearer information for consumers
Labels must give useful information in a clear format ©BELGA/ILOVEIMAGES Food shoppers will be able to make better informed, healthier choices as the result of new EU food labelling rules approved by MEPs on Wednesday. Labels will have to spell out a food's energy content as well as fat, saturated fat, carbohydrate, sugar, protein and salt levels, in a way that makes them easy for consumers to read.
MEP Renate Sommer (EPP, DE), who led Parliament's team in successful negotiations with the Council, said in the debate ahead of the vote: "Despite political and ideological differences in the EP, despite national ideological convictions, we have come up with a good compromise. The new rules are supposed to provide more and better information to consumers so they can make informed choices when buying. But is more than that: the food industry should benefit too. There should be more legal certainty, less bureaucracy and better legislation in general. (...) this is very important for SMEs (...) more than 80% of the European food sector is SMEs."
Nutrition values compulsory
Under the new rules, the energy content and amounts of fat, saturated fat, carbohydrates, sugars, protein and salt must all be stated in a legible tabular form on the packaging, together and in the same field of vision. All this information has to be expressed per 100g or per 100ml. It may also, in addition, be expressed per portion,
Allergens
Currently all ingredients - including allergenic substances - must be indicated on the labels of pre-packed foods. In future it will be easier for consumers to see if a product contains allergenic substances, as they will have to be highlighted in the ingredient list. Shoppers will thus be able to see information on allergens at a glance.
The new rules also state that information on allergens must be given for non-packaged foods, for example on food sold in restaurants or canteens. Member States may themselves decide how the information is to be made available to consumers.
Country of origin
Under existing EU rules, the origin of certain foods - such as beef, honey, olive oil and fresh fruit and vegetables - already has to be shown on the label. This also applies where the failure to do so would mislead the consumer. This rule will now be extended to fresh meat from pigs, sheep, goat and poultry, at Parliament's request. The Commission will have to introduce implementing rules for this purpose within two years of the regulation's entry into force.
Country of origin labelling could in future be extended to other categories of food (such as meat when used as an ingredient, milk or unprocessed foods) but the Commission must first do impact assessments to weigh up the feasibility and potential costs of doing this.
Shoppers must not be misled
The new rules will also ensure that consumers are not misled by the appearance, description or pictorial presentation of food packaging.
In addition, it will be easy to spot "imitation foods" - foods that look similar to other foods but are made of different ingredients, such as "cheese-like" foods made with vegetable products. Where an ingredient that would normally be expected has been replaced, this will have to be clearly stated on the front of the pack in a prominent font size and next to the brand name.
Meat consisting of combined meat parts must be labelled "formed meat". The same will apply to "formed fish".
When will the new rules apply?
Parliament approved the new food labelling rules by 606 votes to 46, with 26 abstentions. Once the legislation is published in the EU Official Journal, food companies will have three years to adapt to most of the rules, but five years for the rules on nutrition values.

GMOs: Parliament backs national right to cultivation bans
EuroparlTV
EU Member States should have the flexibility to ban or restrict the cultivation of genetically modified crops and should be able to cite environmental motives for doing so, according to MEPs voting on draft legislation on Tuesday.
The draft amendment to existing legislation - adopted with 548 votes in favour, 84 against and 31 abstentions - will now go to the Council for further discussion. Parliament’s rapporteur Corinne Lepage (ALDE, FR) commented: “I am pleased that the Parliament has reached an agreement on the difficult issue of GMOs, which has been an issue of public concern for years. If the Council manages to find a common position, this balanced agreement will allow countries and regions the right to not grow GMOs if they so choose.”
Grounds to ban
The Commission had proposed to grant EU Member States the right to ban crops on all but health or environmental grounds, which were to be solely assessed by the European Food Safety Authority. Committed to ensuring a firmer legal basis in the context of international trade rules, Parliament insisted that Member States should not be prevented from stating additional environmental grounds. These could include pesticide resistance, biodiversity preservation or a lack of data on potential negative consequences to the environment.
Parliament also considered that socioeconomic impacts could provide legitimate grounds for a ban, e.g. where contamination risks to conventional or organic agriculture cannot practicably be managed.
The cost of contamination
MEPs say all Member States must take measures to prevent contamination of conventional or organic farming by GM crops, and ensure those responsible for such incidents can be held financially liable.
Updating EU safety checks
An EU-level safety check and authorisation will continue to be a precondition to a green light for growing GMOs. While the proposal does not affect this process, MEPs reminded the Commission that the guidelines need updating.
Only one strain of GM maize and one modified potato are currently authorised for cultivation in the EU and most Member States do not currently grow either crop commercially. Austria, France, Greece, Hungary, Germany and Luxembourg have activated a "safeguard clause" in the current (2001) EU Directive to expressly prohibit cultivation of certain GMOs.

EU countries reject EP call for labelling of clone-derived food
EuroparlTV Meat from the offspring of cloned animals could find its way onto the EU market, with no-one being any the wiser, after member state representatives refused the Parliament's demand to label clone-derived products. The two sides met until late Monday night to discuss updating novel food rules, but were unable to reach agreement on clone-derived food and nanotechnology.
The first animal clone, Dolly the sheep, was created in 1996 and since then cows, pigs and goats have also been cloned, raising the question of whether or not we should use cloned animals for food. The EP had wanted bans on the sale of meat from cloned animals and their offspring and the use of cloning technology to produce food.
EP had proposed compromise to label food from clone offspring
The Council and Commission backed a ban on cloning for food production, but rejected a ban on food from offspring, leading MEPs to propose a compromise of labelling clone-derived meat.
Council agreed only to label fresh beef, which MEPs found insufficient given that a 2008 Eurobarometer study shows 63% of EU citizens are unlikely to buy food from cloned animals, while 61% find animal cloning morally wrong.
"It is deeply frustrating that the Council would not listen to public opinion," the Chair of the EP delegation to the Conciliation Committee talks, Gianni Pittella, and the EP rapporteur on novel foods, Kartika Liotard, said in a joint statement. "Measures regarding clone offspring are absolutely critical because clones are commercially viable only for breeding, not directly for food production. No farmer would spend €100,000 on a cloned bull, only to turn it into hamburgers."
1997 rules on novel foods remain in place
Currently, there are no EU rules specifically allowing or banning dairy products and meat from cloned animals. The European Commission and Council wanted to regulate the products under the novel foods rules, while MEPs wanted them to be dealt with separately.
The failure of conciliation talks between the EP and Council mean that the 1997 novel food rules remain in force. Foods are considered "novel" if they are derived from new technological processes or if they have no significant history of consumption in the EU. The rules require authorisation for the sale of food from cloned animals, but not its offspring or descendants . There have been no applications so far.
Nanotechnology
The use of nanotechnology in food production, for example as an anti-bacterial agent, or to alter flavour or colour is growing and the EP had called for further checks to be developed to adequately assess the safety of such foods. They also wanted food containing nano ingredients to be labelled. The failure to reach agreement on the new rules means "there will continue to be no special measures regarding nano materials in food," the EP statement said.
This is only the second time that the EP and Council have failed to settle their differences about legislation in the Conciliation Committee (the first time was over the working time directive).

What's cooking in the Parliament: Food Day
Food labelling, GMOs on July plenary agenda ©Belga/PHOTOPQR/J.Frey It was a real food day in Parliament 21 June: the Agriculture Committee approved a report on food quality, regional food was being promoted and MEPs discussed the forthcoming July plenary votes on food labelling and GMOs during a seminar. For the first time during a press event, MEPs fielded questions not just from journalists but also from our readers on Faceboook and Twitter.
What was on the plate during food day?
The Agriculture Committee voted to make quality labels easier for producers to register to help the EU compete with third countries. In an effort to streamline the process, the European Commission must respond to a request for registration within 6 months. In addition food producer groups will be better able to protect and promote proprietary products. The report should come to the plenary at the end of September.
Parliament promoted a number of regional products on Tuesday, including Di Bufala Campana mozzarella, Auvergne blue cheese and Ardennes ham, with chefs from the EP's canteen demonstrating how to prepare them.
Food labelling
During a seminar on food labelling, MEPs answered questions from our Facebook fans and Twitter followers. Our readers were mostly concerned about food safety and clear labelling .
Ania asked how an ideal label would look. "We will not be able to achieve it as the ideal label is different for each consumer," Swedish Green Carl Schlyter said, but it should help consumers make informed choices and avoid fake food, for example strawberry yogurt that contains no strawberries.
Dutch Liberal Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy agreed labels should be clear and should provide information about issues that impact health like fat and salt. However, British Conservative Struan Stevenson thinks some MEPs want too much information and he simply want them to be clear and straightforward.
In answer to a question from Izabela about learning to read labels, British Socialist Glenis Willmott said education has to start early, in school. German Christian Democrat Renate Sommer said we should also ensure the elderly are educated in how to read labels.
On the threat from imported food , for example from China or the US, Mr Schlyter noted that the EU has an early warning system. "When one country discovers something dangerous in imported food it has to inform others". Third countries must meet EU standards if they want to sell food here, Ms Sommer added.
