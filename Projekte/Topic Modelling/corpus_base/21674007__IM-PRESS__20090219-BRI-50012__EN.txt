Preparation of the European Council 19 and 20 March 2009
Better accident compensation for ship passengers under third maritime package
2008 Progress reports on Croatia, Turkey and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
Eurovignette: road tolls for lorries to reflect pollution and congestion

Preparation of the European Council 19 and 20 March 2009
MEPs will debate the preparation of the European Council 19 and 20 March 2009 after hearing statements from the Council and Commission. The European Council will focus on the economic and financial situation, energy and climate change, external relations and the European Council will receive an update from the Taoiseach on the Lisbon Treaty. EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering will address the European Council at the start. The Commission President José Manuel Barroso will also participate in this debate.
Economic rescue plans need EU-level coordination
National economic rescue plans may harm Europe's global competitiveness if they are not well coordinated at EU level, says the Economics Committee in a report presented to the plenary. Stimulating the EU economy and its competitiveness and making financial markets function again are essential to avoid mass unemployment and create new jobs, according to the report drawn up by Elisa Ferreira (PES, PT) on the Commission's European economic recovery plan.
Regional development: faster funding for economic recovery
Faster, more flexible funding for regional policy projects will help EU economic recovery, but faster funding must not mean looser rules, says the Regional Development Committee. Proposed changes to make EU structural fund grant payments more flexible, to meet the needs of "extraordinary economic circumstances" should "boost the economy and provide support, especially to people hit by the crisis".
Guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States (2008-2010)
Employment growth had weakened in several Member States by mid-2008. The economic downturn is expected to continue throughout the first half of 2009 and to have a profound impact on labour markets developments with EU development falling by 3.5 million jobs. The unemployment rate in the EU (7.0% in 2008) is expected to increase to 8.7% in the EU in 2009 (from 7.5% to 9.2% in the euro area) with a further increase in 2010, states the report of Jan Andersson (PES, SV).
Cut industrial emissions further, but more flexibly, say MEPs
Pollutant emissions from thousands of industrial installations throughout the EU must be further reduced, but more flexibly, say Environment Committee MEPs. The committee backed a Commission proposal to update and strengthen existing rules, but inserted new provisions for introducing EU-wide emission limits, greater flexibility in granting permits, excluding small plants, and better informing the public.
Better accident compensation for ship passengers under third maritime package
Compensation for passengers in the event of shipping accidents and an EU blacklist of substandard ships are among highlights of the third maritime package, a long-awaited raft of legislation that will be submitted to Parliament for final approval in Strasbourg. The seven pieces of legislation in the package - also known as "Erika III" after the 1999 Erika oil spill - will improve both the safety of ships and the action taken in the event of an accident. The package covers not just compensation for passengers but also ship inspections, port state control, shipping accident investigations and the choice of the authority that decides where a ship in distress should go. All the legislation is expected to be approved by Parliament following a deal reached with Council in conciliation negotiations.
Eurovignette: road tolls for lorries to reflect pollution and congestion
Parliament will vote at first reading on a proposal to revise the Eurovignette road toll for lorries, to take account of pollution and congestion generated by these vehicles, to include lorries of 3.5 tonnes and above, and to apply the rules to more roads than at present. The Transport Committee's report, drafted by Saïd El Khadraoui (PES, BE), backs the broad thrust of the Commission proposal to revise the 1999 "Eurovignette" directive, endorsing its view that charges on heavy-goods vehicles should be based in part on the air and noise pollution and the road congestion they cause.
Greening of transport: a proper strategy needed
The Transport Committee is submitting to plenary a report criticising the Commission for the lack of an overall strategy on "the greening of transport" and the absence of a usable model for assessing "external costs" such as the environmental impact of transport. The Commission's "Greening Transport" package, unveiled in July 2008, is intended to contribute to the EU's climate and energy goals. Consisting of a number of communications, it aims to promote sustainable transport and ensure that the real costs of transport are reflected in their effective price.
2008 Progress reports on Croatia, Turkey and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
Parliament will debate the accession negotiations with Croatia, Turkey and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in 2008 after hearing statements from the Council and Commission.
Video games: a red button for parents
Parents should have a "red button" to disable a game they feel is inappropriate for their child, says the EP Internal Market Committee. The aim is not to demonise games, which have a broadly beneficial effect on the mental development of children, but to help parents choose suitable content for their offspring. Video games do not only have a recreational value but can also be used for educational and medical purposes, stresses a report by Toine Manders (ALDE, NL).
On-line gambling: It's up to Member States to stop match-fixing and fraud
On-line gambling, which is easier to access than traditional gambling, increases the risk of fraud, crime, gambling addiction, dangers to children and threats to the integrity of sports events. However, under the subsidiarity principle, the EU internal market should not be taken as the basis for regulating this industry, says an own-initiative report adopted by the EP Internal Market Committee. Four hundred amendments were tabled to the report by Christel Schaldemose (PES, DK) but the final compromise was approved by 32 votes to 10 with one abstention.
New rules for cleaner, quieter, safer cars
The EU will soon have a simpler, standardised system for the type-approval of motor vehicles, following a proposal by Parliament's Internal Market Committee. Members of the committee propose to beef up plans to introduce new rules on the registration, sale and use of cars, with the aim of improving road safety and protecting the environment better. Ordinary tyres, all-weather tyres and snow tyres, the design and manufacture of cars in general and the use of modern technology on cars - all these things influence the safety and environmental impact of motor vehicles. A single regulation, directly applicable in all the Member States, will soon synthesise all the rules on these matters, replacing around fifty existing directives.
2010 Budget must address financial, environmental and energy problems, says Budget Committee
Citizens of the European Union live in apprehension and insecurity. The key objective of the 2010 Budget is to put European citizens first and give them more safety, says the Committee on Budgets in a report which highlights the economic crisis, energy uncertainty, climate change, illegal immigration, crime and terrorism as key priorities for the preliminary draft budget. The Committee is calling on the Commission to take these problems into account when deciding the preliminary draft budget. It says it 'expects the Commission to present solid and useful proposals to allow a meaningful budgetary discussion within the budgetary authority".
2010 Budget: EP priorities
The Budgets Committee will be presenting a report which sets out its priorities for the 2010 budget in a report by Vladimír MAŇKA (PES, SK) MEPs say that multilingualism and translation services are a high priority and call for more cost-effective working methods in the Parliament.
Competition Policy 2006 and 2007
Jonathan EVANS (EPP-ED, UK) for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will be putting forward an own-initiative report by welcoming the publication of the Commission's Competition Policy Reports for 2006 and 2007. MEPs in the committee congratulate the Commission on its effective challenging of the operation of unlawful hardcore cartels and the record fines imposed on offenders. They support the use of the revised leniency notice and procedure to encourage the provision of information about the operation of unlawful hardcore cartels.
Statute for a European private company: creating a uniform company throughout Europe
The Committee on Legal Affairs welcomes the proposal on the Statute for a European private company, but proposes amendments that are "essentially aimed at responding to the debates that are to be anticipated within the Council and to counteract blockages within the Council". The report proposes a start-up capital of at least €1, provided that the articles of association require that the management body sign a solvency certificate. If not, the capital must be at least €8000.
Commission asked to submit proposal to facilitate cross-border transfers of companies
The Committee on Legal Affairs is asking the Commission to submit a legislative proposal for a directive aimed at facilitating cross-border transfers of registered offices within the European Union. The proposed directive will lay down measures for coordinating Member States’ national legislation in order to give companies freedom of establishment within the internal market. Under current circumstances, undertakings can only transfer their seat either by dissolution and establishing a new legal entity in the Member State of destination, or by establishing a new legal entity in the Member State of destination and then merging both undertakings.
ICTY: two year extension of the mandate asked by MEPs
The Foreign Affairs committee calls on the Council to examine a possible two-year extension of the mandate of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), in a report presented to plenary. MEPs in the committee also urge the Council to expedite efforts to capture the two remaining indictees, Ratko Mladić and Goran Hadžić, allowing the Tribunal to fulfil its mandate. The goal of the ICTY is to complete all proceedings (trials and appeals) by 2011. The ICTY - a United Nations court of law set up in 1993 - investigates violations of international humanitarian law committed in the former Yugoslavia since 1991 and to prosecute those responsible.
Brazil: a key player for the EU in Latin America
From political dialogue to climate change, Brazil has become an increasingly significant regional and global player and has emerged as a key interlocutor for the EU. Against this background, Parliament will be asked to approve a draft recommendation on the European Union-Brazil Strategic Partnership established in 2007, which calls for closer and deeper ties between the two sides.
EU Strategic Partnership with Mexico should include annual summits
The Foreign Affairs Committee is calling for an annual EU-Mexico summit to give a fresh impetus to relations between the two sides as part of the Strategic Partnership currently under negotiation. It also believes Mexico should have a higher profile within the G-20. The transformation of the EU's relations with Mexico into a Strategic Partnership, a format already used with the USA, Russia, China and Brazil, is welcomed in the committee's own-initiative report.
50th anniversary of the Tibetan uprising and dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese Government
Marco Cappato, Marco Pannella and Janusz Onyszkiewicz, on behalf of the ALDE Group, Monica Frassoni and Eva Lichtenberger, on behalf of the Greens/EFA Group will be asking the Commission questions on the 50th anniversary of the Tibetan uprising and dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese Government. MEPs will also vote on a resolution on this topic. The 10 March this year is the 50th anniversary of the Tibetan national uprising against the Chinese administration.
Childcare facilities - Barcelona objectives
The Commission will make a statement on Childcare facilities - Barcelona objectives. What are the so-called 'Barcelona targets'? Ensuring suitable childcare provision is an essential step towards equal opportunities in employment between women and men.
In 2002, at the Barcelona Summit, the European Council set the targets of providing childcare by 2010.
Children of migrants: MEPs to quiz the Commission
The situation of children of EU migrants that are left on their own in the Member State of origin while their parents migrate for work to another Member State has raised considerable concern in some Member States in the last two years. While policies do exist with the aim of improving the living conditions and education of migrant children who moved with their parents working abroad, the phenomenon of children left at home on their own has received little attention.
Citizens to have the right to ask the Commission to submit a legislative proposal
Once the Treaty of Lisbon is on force, one million European citizens will have the right to ask the Commission to submit a legislative proposal on European Union matters that they believe require a legal act. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs is calling for the regulation on Citizens' Initiative, as it is known, to be "clear, simple and user-friendly" and for it to be clearly distinguishable from the right to petition.
Performing arts: Women still discriminated against
Claire Gibault (ALDE, FR)for the Women's Rights and Gender Equality Committee will be tabling an own-initiative report on equality of treatment and access for men and women in the performing arts. The report underlines the scale and persistence of the inequalities between men and women in the performing arts and the impact that the unequal way in which the sector is organised can have on society as a whole, given the particular nature of its activities.
Risk of closing down the company QIMONDA in Germany and Portugal
MEPs will debate the risk of closure of the company QIMONDA in Germany and Portugal and the loss of thousands of jobs in Europe.
Improving EU labour market access for the Roma
Educating young people should be a priority in combating poverty and social exclusion of the Roma, says the EP Employment and Social Committee MEPs in an own-initiative report calling for an overall strategy to integrate the Roma community into the European Union. The Roma are the European Union's largest minority. They suffer many forms of discrimination, a higher rate of poverty and a lower standard of living than the EU average, stresses the report by Magda Kósáne Kovács (PES, HU) on "the social situation of the Roma and improving their access to the labour market in the EU".
Make the Small Business Act legally binding, says the Industry Committee
Small and medium-sized businesses consistently underperform compared to their American counterparts and larger companies when it comes to productivity, growth and innovation. So says the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy in a report which calls on the Council and Commission to join Parliament in making the Small Business Act legally binding.
Parliament to consider the future of the European Common Asylum System
Legislative instruments relating to the first phase of the establishment of the common European asylum system have allowed the introduction of common minimum standards but not of equal conditions of access to protection throughout the EU, says to the Civil Liberties Committee. It claims the Dublin system results in "a disproportionate burden being imposed on some Member States, in particular on those representing the external EU border".
Access to documents: MEPs to demand more transparency
Members of the Civil Liberties Committee propose a report, drafted by Michael CASHMAN (PES, UK). The European Parliament is working in co-decision with the Council of Ministers to revise the 2001 regulation on access to documents, which has been followed by a number of rulings by the Court of Justice. The revised regulation will incorporate these rulings into a single framework for all the institutions, but MEPs want to go further.
More in-depth discussion needed on new measures for border management
The Committee for Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs is tabling an own-initiative report offering its opinion on a new block of measures envisaged by the Commission, which, although still in the policy development stage, is likely to "bring substantial changes in the way border management is conceived and can have a huge impact in terms of data protection", the committee says.
Human rights in the world
As usual the session ends with three debates and votes on human rights issues in the world, on this occasion the topics are: Guinea-Bissau, Philippines and support to the Special Court for Sierra Leone.
European Parliament Prize for Journalism
For the second time, the European Parliament Prize for Journalism will be awarded in 2009. It will be awarded to journalists who have covered major European issues or promoted a better understanding of the EU institutions and/or EU policies. The prize will be awarded in four different categories: written press, radio, TV and internet. The winner in each category will receive € 5 000.

European Council
Economic rescue plans need EU-level coordination
2009-03-05 - 11:40
National economic rescue plans may harm Europe's global competitiveness if they are not well coordinated at EU level, says the Economics Committee in a report presented to the plenary. Stimulating the EU economy and its competitiveness and making financial markets function again are essential to avoid mass unemployment and create new jobs, according to the report drawn up by Elisa Ferreira (PES, PT) on the Commission's European economic recovery plan.
The committee is concerned that differences between national measures in response to the economic and financial crisis could hamper the functioning of the common market and thus weaken EU's role as a global actor.
Urgent steps to release EU funds, a better financial supervision system and a new global financial regulatory framework also figure among the reports recommendations.
Tackling the effects on real economy
Guaranteeing minimum living standards for all EU citizens is one of the priority targets for action at EU level, according to MEPs. The committee calls for the adoption of adequate and urgent measures to support an active labour market and social inclusion.
A real European Pact for Employment should also be agreed to safeguard jobs, according to the committee. Members support the Commission's initiative to bring forward European Social Fund spending and to facilitate access to the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
Access to credit for individuals and firms, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, has to be guaranteed, says the committee, and this justifies exceptional public expenditure. MEPs suggest EU governments should set incentives and sanctions to achieve this goal.
More effective supervisory system
The European Central Bank's role should be enhanced, says the committee, enabling it to monitor the financial stability of the Euro area and involve it in supervision of the EU banking sector.
Rescue plans for banks should not be unconditional, according to the committee, which suggests requirements on monetary incentives, provision of credit, restructuring of the sector and protection of social policy terms in return for the help the banks receive.
Member States should consult and coordinate on economic policies
To ensure better coordination, the Economics Committee calls for the establishment of binding rules for national governments to consult each other and the Commission before taking major economic policy decisions.
MEPs in the committee are concerned that the European Economic Recovery Plan amounts only to €30 billion (0.2% of European GDP), while the remaining €170 billion is supposed to come from Member States' own initiatives. They therefore call for a new strong initiative at EU level to avoid risks of conflicts between the different national actions. At the same time, the committee stresses the responsibility of each Member State to ensure fiscal discipline and to continue investment and structural reforms.
A new global financial regulatory framework?
The EU should lead negotiations in international bodies - such as the G20, the International Monetary Fund and the Financial Stability Forum - to implement new rules on international financial markets, say MEPs. The aims should be to strengthen the international supervisory system.
Stability and Growth Pact: flexibility and prudence
The flexibility provided by the revised Stability and Growth Pact allows national governments to adopt policies to address the recession, say MEPs in the committee. Nevertheless, they point out that Member States' decisions have to be compatible with medium term budgetary targets and long term Lisbon Strategy goals for a more competitive economy.
Parliament's role in the recovery plan
Ms Ferreira's report, once adopted by the full Parliament, will be MEPs' main political reaction to the Commission's recovery plan. Some of the proposed spending plans require a legislative framework which will need to be adopted under the co-decision procedure. Changes to the EU budget for 2009 will also need backing from both the Parliament and the Council in order to be enacted.

European Council
Regional development: faster funding for economic recovery
2009-03-05 - 11:40
Faster, more flexible funding for regional policy projects will help EU economic recovery, but faster funding must not mean looser rules, says the Regional Development Committee. Proposed changes to make EU structural fund grant payments more flexible, to meet the needs of "extraordinary economic circumstances" should "boost the economy and provide support, especially to people hit by the crisis". However, flexible funding measures must not breach EU competition rules or social and environmental protection standards, says the committee in an own-initiative report by Evgeni Kirilov (PES, BG).
The changes aim to accelerate investment at national and regional level, by simplifying access to grants, supporting people hit by the crisis and increasing the availability of finance for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). Over 65% (€230 billion) of cohesion policy funding is earmarked for investment in the four priority areas of the EU growth and jobs strategy – people (jobs), business, infrastructure and energy, and research and innovation.
Faster, more flexible funding
Proposals permitting faster, more flexible payments, lump sum and flat rate payments should accelerate project implementation, particularly for infrastructure, energy and environment projects, says the report.
MEPs in the committee also welcome a Commission plan to increase advance payments, so as to get funding to projects earlier and reduce the need for bank loans. However, they also urge banks to "make full use of facilities granted to them to maintain lending to the economy and pass on key interest rate reductions to borrowers".
Playing by EU rules
The Commission and Member States must ensure that measures to make structural funding faster, simpler and more flexible "do not diminish their responsibility to control implementation", says the report, which also calls on Member States and regional and local authorities to "secure their contributions, as required by the co-financing rules, so that funds allocated by the EU structural funds can be fully exploited".
The Commission is also urged to monitor Member State measures, so as to "ensure that these do not violate free market competition, social standards and the implementation of Community environmental and climate protection requirements".
Backing business, creating jobs
The committee calls for "decisive action to support the demand side of the economy, as well as measures to assist SMEs, social economy enterprises, and local and regional authorities". It also calls on Member States to make "wide use of structural funds to secure job creation and to promote SMEs, entrepreneurship, and professional training".
Financial engineering
The report encourages Member States to "explore synergies" between cohesion funding and other EU sources of funding (such as the R&D framework programme) as well as the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. It also urges them to simplify SME access to EU financial engineering instruments such as JESSICA (cities), JASMINE (micro-credit) and JEREMIE (micro to medium enterprises).
Energy efficiency of housing
A proposal that investments in energy efficiency, energy interconnections and renewable energies in the housing sector should be eligible for European Regional Development Fund funding throughout the EU is welcomed by the committee, which urges Member States and regions to make comprehensive use of this forthcoming new possibility.

Guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States (2008-2010)
2009-03-05 - 11:40
Employment growth has weakened in several Member States by mid-2008. The economic downturn is expected to continue throughout the first half of 2009 and to have a profound impact on labour markets developments with EU development falling by 3.5 million jobs. The unemployment rate in the EU (7.0% in 2008) is expected to increase to 8.7% in the EU in 2009 (from 7.5% to 9.2% in the Euro area) with a further increase in 2010, states the report of Jan Andersson (PES, SV). A coordinated European approach and a rigorous implementation of the employment guidelines are needed to tackle the current economic crisis, MEPs in the Employment Committee say.
Maintaining the Employment guidelines
The Employment guidelines are part of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs. They are set for a three year period (2008-2010) and present common priorities to the Member States national employment policies. The rapporteur supports the Commission's approach to maintain the guidelines for 2009 as they present a "sound framework from policy guidance" and insists on a coordinated approach at the EU level to prevent job losses and on a key role of social partners.
A rigorous implementation and coordinated approach at the EU level
In addition to the report, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs tabled an oral question to the Commission on its plans to improve the policy coordination between the Member States and to limit the social impact of the crisis.
MEPs in the committee welcome the Commission's Communication on European Economic Recovery Plan.
They stress the urgency of a rigorous implementation of the employment guidelines, and based on the lessons learnt from the economic crisis, point out the need for a review and update of the economic and employment policy tools, such as the Integrated Guidelines and the Stability and Growth Pact.
They underline that short-term measures taken by Member States should contribute towards achieving common objectives.
They urge the Council to agree on short-tem measures to safeguard the employment rate.
They stress the importance of education, qualification and training as best employment policy measures with particular attention to vulnerable groups.
The Commission must be prepared to take exceptional measures including the widening of access to the European Globalisation Fund to support workers in a wider range of situations and a temporary opening of the European Social Fund to support employment preservation measures.
It is important not to let the crisis put downward pressure on wages.
Coordinated investments across Member States in productive infrastructure, education and climate change are needed to raise employment levels. Rapporteur Jan ANDERSSON PES SE A6-0052/2009 Guidelines for the Member States' employment policies Procedure : Consultation

Cut industrial emissions further, but more flexibly, say MEPs
2009-03-05 - 11:40
Pollutant emissions from thousands of industrial installations throughout the EU must be further reduced, but more flexibly, say Environment Committee MEPs. The committee backed a Commission proposal to update and strengthen existing rules, but inserted new provisions for introducing EU-wide emission limits, greater flexibility in granting permits, excluding small plants, and better informing the public. To cut industrial pollution, the integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC) Directive requires operators of about 52,000 industrial installations across the EU to obtain permits from Member State authorities. Permits may be granted only if environment protection requirements are met.
The proposed overhaul aims to reduce the administrative burden on industry and public authorities, by simplifying and clarifying the current rules. This entails recasting and merging seven EU directives, including IPPC, into one. The MEP guiding this proposal through Parliament is Holger Krahmer (ALDE, DE).
New emission limit values
The committee agreed in principle to more stringent emission limit values proposed by the Commission for specific categories of combustion plants and for pollutants such as SO2, NOx, dust and CO. However, to improve flexibility, the committee advocates changing the procedure for setting these limits.
MEPs in the committee say that to reduce widespread recourse to exemptions, which lead to market distortions, some minimum emission limit values, which cannot be exceeded in any way, must be set by the Commission, using the comitology procedure.
At the same time, to give flexibility to the authorities that grant permits, MEPs say that emission limits laid down for individual installations must be based on best available techniques, but adaptable to take account of local circumstances.
Including medium-sized combustion plants, excluding those least used
The recast legislation (IPPC directive plus six more specific ones) will cover combustion plants, waste incineration plants, waste co-incineration plants and installations producing titanium dioxide. MEPs in the committee broadly agree with a Commission proposal to bring medium-sized combustion plants (between 20 and 50 MW), within the rules, but want to exclude installations (below 50 MW) which operate for no more than 500 hours /year.
MEPs in the committee also changed the annexes, which set specific permit conditions for types of industrial activity. Amendments seeking to insert more or less stringent values were not adopted, but several amendments that were adopted make changes affecting specific industries to which emission limits apply.
Reducing the administrative burden and better informing the public
Other amendments inserted by the committee aim to reduce administrative burdens, relax rules on reporting and inspections, and improve the information to the public.
Inadmissible amendments on CO2 Emission Limit Value
In the committee vote, over 100 amendments were deemed non-admissible under the EP rules of procedure (rule 80 a, paragraph III). This decision concerned inter alia amendments, put forward by several MEPs, to introduce a carbon dioxide emission limit value for large combustion installations.

Better accident compensation for ship passengers under third maritime package
2009-03-05 - 11:40
Compensation for passengers in the event of shipping accidents and an EU blacklist of substandard ships are among highlights of the third maritime package, a long-awaited raft of legislation that will be submitted to Parliament for final approval in Strasbourg. The seven pieces of legislation in the package - also known as "Erika III" after the 1999 Erika oil spill - will improve both the safety of ships and the action taken in the event of an accident. The package covers not just compensation for passengers but also ship inspections, port state control, shipping accident investigations and the choice of the authority that decides where a ship in distress should go. All the legislation is expected to be approved by Parliament following a deal reached with Council in conciliation negotiations.
Ship operators liable for damages suffered by their passengers (Costa report)
The aim of the first piece of legislation is to standardise at European level the accident liability of ship passenger carriers and the mandatory insurance they must have. Until now liability has been set at different, and in some cases rather low, levels in Member States according to their national legislation or their international commitments. The regulation will eliminate these differences by incorporating into EU law the Athens Convention on the Carriage of Passengers and their Luggage by Sea, which provides for higher levels of financial liability.
Carriers will have to pay compensation of up to €2,587 for lost or damaged cabin luggage and up to €460,000 in the case of physical harm or death caused by fault or neglect. Advance payments will have to be made in the event of serious injury, permanent invalidity or death.
During the conciliation talks, MEPs led by rapporteur Paolo Costa (ALDE, IT) managed to extend the scope of the regulation to national maritime transport rather than just international traffic. They also ensured it will apply not just to the largest category of ships (class A) but also to smaller (class B) vessels, which are the most widely used passenger ships in the EU, for example in the Greek islands.
The rules will apply to class A ships by 2016 at the latest and to class B ships by 2018. By mid-2013 the Commission must table a proposal on including smaller ships (class C and D) in the rules.
Port state control: permanent blacklist for substandard ships (Vlasto report)
"Port state control" means the inspection of foreign ships in national ports in order to check that the qualifications of the captain and crew as well as the condition of the ship and its equipment comply with rules laid down by international conventions (such as SOLAS and MARPOL) and that the vessel is manned and operated in accordance with international law.
In negotiations on the latest version of the EU port state control directive, which is being recast following several previous revisions, Parliament insisted that substandard ships repeatedly found to be in breach of the rules may be put on an EU-wide blacklist permanently. The Council had wanted only a temporary ban.
The EP delegation also ensured that the directive's inspection requirements will apply to vessels calling at offshore anchorages, not only at ports, and that there will be more frequent inspections (every 6 months for high-risk ships). Dominique Vlasto (EPP-ED, FR) was responsible for the EP report on this topic.
Independent authority to decide where a ship in distress should go (Sterckx report)
At present valuable time is often wasted in deciding which port should accommodate a vessel in distress. In the negotiations on a revised directive on a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system, Parliament negotiators successfully demanded that Member States must designate an authority with the power to take independent decisions including a decision, in the event of a rescue operation, on the best course of action to prevent a disaster, including which port should receive a "ship in need of assistance". Dirk Sterckx (ALDE, BE) was the lead MEP on this topic.
A new system for ship inspections (de Grandes Pascual report)
To apply international conventions on the safety standards used in ship inspections, the flag state (where the ship is registered) must carry out the inspections required and issue licences and certificates. Frequently, however, the flag state delegates some or all of these tasks to bodies specialising in this work, known as "classification societies".
To ensure that Member States discharge their obligations as flag states fully, common rules and standards for classification societies in the EU will be laid down by two pieces of legislation (a directive and a regulation) designed to update the regulation of classification societies and introduce mutual recognition of classification certificates. Luis de Grandes Pascual (EPP-ED, ES) was the MEP responsible for this legislation.
Investigations into maritime accidents (Kohliček report)
Another directive on which the Parliament and Council agreed lays down the conditions for investigations into the causes of shipping accidents. Here, MEPs led by Jaromír Kohliček (GUE/NGL, CZ) managed to convince Member States that such investigations should not be restricted only to very serious accidents. In the case of accidents which are not disastrous but which are still deemed to be serious, a preliminary assessment will have to be made as to whether a full investigation is necessary. The directive also lays down that in principle each accident shall be investigated by only one Member State. Only in very exceptional cases could parallel investigations be conducted. Finally, MEPs obtained appropriate legal protection for witnesses.
Common position on two "missing files" on flag state obligations and civil liability
Until recently, two proposals that were part of the maritime package were blocked in Council. At second reading Parliament had introduced amendments from these two "missing files" into other maritime package reports. Following this, Council agreed on common positions on these two remaining pieces of legislation.
The first proposal, on flag state obligations (report by Emanuel Jardim Fernandes , PES, PT), lays down mandatory compliance with international safety standards for ships flying a Member State flag. The second, on civil liability (report by Gilles Savary , PES, FR), requires ship-owners to show proof of insurance when requested by a Member State, failing which the ship can be detained.
The overall outcome of the negotiations was highly positive for Parliament. Not only were the "missing two" files concluded in parallel but many improvements were also made to the texts agreed in conciliation, mainly due to the refusal of MEPs to allow any file to be concluded without an overall agreement.
Maritime safety a longstanding priority of the Parliament
Maritime safety has long been a priority of the European Parliament, which in 2002 set up a temporary committee on improving safety at sea following the Erika and Prestige oil-spills of 1999 and 2002 respectively. Under the previous two maritime safety packages (known as Erika I and Erika II), the EU adopted important maritime safety and security legislation which, among other things, provided for ship inspections in port, banned the use of single-hull vessels to transport oil and set up the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA).

Eurovignette: road tolls for lorries to reflect pollution and congestion
2009-03-05 - 11:40
Parliament will vote at first reading on a proposal to revise the Eurovignette road toll for lorries, to take account of pollution and congestion generated by these vehicles, to include lorries of 3.5 tonnes and above, and to apply the rules to more roads than at present.
The Transport Committee's report, drafted by Saïd El Khadraoui (PES, BE), backs the broad thrust of the Commission proposal to revise the 1999 "Eurovignette" directive, endorsing its view that charges on heavy-goods vehicles should be based in part on the air and noise pollution and the road congestion they cause.
The existing Eurovignette Directive 1999/68/EC, as amended by Directive 2006/38/EC, allows Member States to levy charges on heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) of above 12 tonnes to offset the cost of maintaining infrastructure on roads that are part of the Trans-European Network (TEN), a network of specifically designated international roads linking EU countries.
The Commission proposal to revise the existing directive would allow (but not oblige) Member States to introduce further charges for air pollution, noise pollution and congestion, subject to certain strict conditions, to levy them on lorries of between 3.5 and 12 tonnes and to apply the rules not just to TEN roads but also to roads "which customarily carry a significant volume of international goods transport". The new rules would apply from 2011 to trucks over 12 tonnes and to those over 3.5 tonnes from 2012.
Cities would retain their right to impose local charges on their roads (such as the London congestion charge).
The rules are not binding but seek to set a common EU standard for Member States who choose to apply the charges.
Air pollution, noise pollution and congestion
The Commission's proposal included air and noise pollution and congestion but stopped short of including CO2 emissions. Some members of the Transport Committee wanted to add CO2 to the list of chargeable costs, arguing that lorries, like aeroplanes, are partly responsible for climate change, but the committee finally voted to exclude CO2 emissions.
The proposal to include congestion charging met opposition from MEPs in the EPP-ED group, who argued that it would be too heavy a burden on the sector in this period of economic downturn and that such a charge would be discriminatory, as private cars are also responsible for congestion. The committee reached a compromise which allows Member States to apply a congestion charge on lorries provided they apply a similar charge to "all other road users". Member States would also have to submit a cost/benefit analysis and an action plan setting out their measures to reduce congestion before applying the charge.
"Intelligent" pricing system
The Eurovignette directive is accompanied by a calculation method designed to adapt toll prices according to the environmental standard of the vehicle (known as "Euro 0 to VI"), the type of road used and the time period. Electronic tolling systems would calculate the right price according to these criteria.
"Polluter pays more": average extra cost for road users would be small
The Eurovignette calculation method means that the overall extra cost for road users would only rise by approximately 3% if Member States choose to apply the charges, according to an impact study carried out by the Commission. Heavy polluters (Euro 0) would pay more, eco-friendly lorries (Euro VI and "clean energy" lorries) would pay little or no charges for air pollution. The same principle applies to the congestion charge: reduced rates would encourage drivers to travel during off-peak times.
"Earmarking" revenues to invest in greener transport
Bracing themselves for a probable future fight with EU finance ministers, MEPs from all political groups united in their support for "earmarking". Under this principle, Member States would be obliged to invest the revenue generated from Eurovignette charges into improving environmental standards of vehicles and developing alternative transport infrastructure.
On roads in mountainous regions and conurbations, a "mark-up" cost is introduced. The extra revenue from this mark-up would be invested into alternative parallel transport links (for instance, a mark-up introduced on the Alpine section of the Lyon-Genoa motorway would finance a parallel railway route).

Greening of transport: a proper strategy needed
2009-03-05 - 11:40
The Transport Committee is submitting to plenary a report criticising the Commission for the lack of an overall strategy on "the greening of transport" and the absence of a usable model for assessing "external costs" such as the environmental impact of transport. The Commission's "Greening Transport" package, unveiled in July 2008, is intended to contribute to the EU's climate and energy goals. Consisting of a number of communications, it aims to promote sustainable transport and ensure that the real costs of transport are reflected in their effective price.
The Transport Committee's own-initiative report, drafted by Georg Jarzembowski (EPP-ED, DE), points out that the Commission has not – by its own admission – devised and put forward a generally applicable, transparent, and comprehensible model for the assessment of external costs as a whole. It has not analysed the impact on every mode of transport and, in practical terms, has so far put forward legislation only for heavy goods road vehicles.
The committee therefore urges the Commission to take steps without delay, firstly to produce specific proposals for all modes of transport; secondly to submit a comprehensive plan for calculating and charging external costs and assessing their impact on the basis of a comprehensible model.
The report also looks at the problem of people living beside railway lines, who can suffer from the noise of trains braking. Although MEPs want the Commission to draft a directive to introduce noise-related track access charges, so as to prompt rail companies to upgrade their rolling stock with new brake blocks, they stress that any legislation must not affect the rail sector adversely in intermodal competition.

Accession negotiations with Croatia, Turkey and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
2009-03-05 - 11:40
Parliament will debate the accession negotiations with Croatia, Turkey and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in 2008 after hearing statements from the Council and Commission. Croatia
The Foreign Affairs Committee is confident that negotiations with Croatia can be concluded in 2009, in line with the indicative roadmap published by the Commission. The fight against organised crime and corruption is highlighted as a key sensitive issue in the resolution drafted by Hannes Swoboda (PES, AT) on the report on Croatia.
MEPs regret that accession negotiations have been blocked for a considerable time due to bilateral issues such as the dispute over the placing of land and sea borders with Slovenia. Slovenia blocked the opening of new chapters in the accession negotiations in December 2008.EU accession negotiations began with Croatia on 3 October 2005 and are progressing well.
21 out of 35 negotiation chapters have been opened so far. Out of these chapters, four have been provisionally closed.
Based on the overall good progress made by Croatia the Commission earlier this year held out the prospect of presenting an indicative timetable for the technical conclusion of negotiations in 2009, provided conditions are met. This conditional road map will now be presented in this year's Strategy paper.
Turkey
The "continuous slowdown of the reform process" in Turkey, for the third consecutive year, is noted with concern by the Foreign Affairs Committee, which calls on the Turkish government "to prove its political will to continue the reform process" which it committed itself to in 2005.
EU accession negotiations with Turkey began on 3 October 2005 and have moved forward over the reporting period.
8 out of 33 negotiation chapters have been opened so far. One chapter has been provisionally closed. In addition, opening benchmarks have been set as conditions for opening negotiations on 13 chapters.
Political criteria
Turkey continues to sufficiently fulfil the Copenhagen political criteria. However, progress on reforms was limited in 2008. The government achieved legislative progress in the areas of freedom of expression and in enhancing the property rights of non-Muslim religious communities. Furthermore, it pledged to increase spending on the South-East Anatolia Project, which is addressing the economic and social difficulties of the South East.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
MEPs in the Foreign Affairs Committee reaffirm their full support for the European perspective of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia but regret that three years after it was granted candidate status for EU membership of the EU, negotiations have not yet started. MEPs ask the Council to decide on a date for the beginning of accession negotiations, during the current year. They ask Skopje to seek to resolve outstanding issues with its neighbours, including a negotiated and mutually acceptable solution on the name issue.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia obtained the status of candidate country in December 2005.
Political criteria
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia made some progress in the course of the last year but does not yet meet the political criteria. Steps have been taken to address the key priorities of the Accession Partnership; further efforts are required.

Video games: a red button for parents
2009-03-05 - 11:40
Parents should have a "red button" to disable a game they feel is inappropriate for their child, says the EP Internal Market Committee. The aim is not to demonise games, which have a broadly beneficial effect on the mental development of children, but to help parents choose suitable content for their offspring. Video games do not only have a recreational value. They can also be used for educational and medical purposes, stresses a report by Toine Manders (ALDE, NL) adopted by the Internal Market Committee. However, not all games are suited to all age groups and the possibility of harmful effects on the minds of children cannot be ruled out. To help parents choose, MEPs would like to see more public awareness of the content of video games, parental control options and instruments such as the Pan-European Game Information (PEGI) age rating system.
Different approaches to strengthening control of video games should be explored, argues the committee, but it does not propose specific EU legislation. MEPs believe Member States should ensure their national rating systems do not lead to market fragmentation. Harmonisation of labelling rules would be of help. Member States should also agree on a common system based solely on PEGI.
Stricter controls on games
Members of the committee are particularly worried about on-line games, which are easy to download onto a PC or a mobile phone, making parental control harder. Until PEGI on-line is up and running, the report proposes fitting consoles, computers or other game devices with a "red button" to give parents the chance to disable a game or control access at certain times.
Video games and violence
The presence of violence in video games does not automatically lead to violent behaviour, according to the report, which draws on recent studies. However, prolonged exposure to scenes of violence can have an adverse effect on the player and even potentially lead to violent behaviour. An amendment tabled by the Civil Liberties Committee calls on the Member States to frame specific civil and criminal legislation on the retailing of violent TV, video and computer games and argues that special attention should be devoted to on-line games.
Internet cafés singled out
Controls on video games need to be tightened up so that children do not have access to inappropriate games. For this reason, and also to prevent the potentially harmful effects of games, especially the danger of addiction or violent behaviour, retailers and parents should take appropriate steps. MEPs in the committee back the idea of a code of conduct for retailers and producers of video games. But above all, internet café owners are singled out and reminded of their responsibilities. A Eurobarometer survey shows that 3.2% of children aged 6-17 access the internet without adult supervision in internet cafes.

On-line gambling: It is up to Member States to stop match-fixing and fraud
2009-03-05 - 11:40
Rules governing on-line gambling should not be laid down by the EU, as Member States are quite capable of regulating the industry themselves, a majority of MEPs decided in a vote at the Internal Market Committee. A minority of Members disagreed strongly and will submit an alternative report in plenary. On-line gambling, which is easier to access than traditional gambling, increases the risk of fraud, crime, gambling addiction, dangers to children and threats to the integrity of sports events. However, under the subsidiarity principle, the EU internal market should not be taken as the basis for regulating this industry, says an own-initiative report adopted by the EP Internal Market Committee. Four hundred amendments were tabled to the report by Christel Schaldemose (PES, DK) but the final compromise was approved by 32 votes to 10 with one abstention.
Regulation, cooperation and pre-paid cards
The report as adopted calls on the Council (which represents the Member States) to seek "a potential political solution" to the problems of online and traditional gambling and betting. Studies and proposals, submitted by the Commission at the request of the Council, could identify "common objectives" and a "common position" to enable action to be taken to solve the social and public order problems arising from cross-border online gambling such as gambling addiction and misuse of personal data or credit cards.
Joint measures could be envisaged to tackle risks relating to illegal betting behaviour and match-fixing, says the report. It also backs the development of standards for online gambling as regards age limits, a ban on credit and other measures or information to protect vulnerable gamblers such as children and gambling addicts.
Regarding advertising, MEPs believe self-regulation is not enough. Instead they stress the need for both regulation and cooperation between industry and the authorities.
Practical solutions should also be examined for limiting the danger of betting large sums of money. A maximum amount per month that a person can spend on gambling could be laid down or on-line gambling operators could be obliged to make use of pre-paid cards that would be sold in shops, says an amendment tabled by Toine Manders (ALDE, NL).
Gambling and the funding of sport
MEPs in the committee are concerned about the deregulation of gambling, which is by far the most important source of income for sports organisations in many Member States. They also note that bets taken by private operators are a form of commercial exploitation of sports events. They recommend that governments protect sporting competitions from any unauthorised commercial use and take steps to ensure fair financial returns to the benefit of all levels of professional and amateur sport.
Minority opinion
The coordinator of the EPP-ED group, Malcolm Harbour (UK), announced that a minority opinion would be tabled at the plenary vote - scheduled for the session of 9 to 12 March - because of divisions of a mainly national character, especially within his group. He himself had signed or co-signed the majority of amendments putting the emphasis on compliance with internal market rules and judgments of the Court of Justice, but these were rejected.
The minority in question argues that gambling is an economic activity to which internal market rules should apply, notably freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services, and that non-discriminatory access to national markets for operators who meet the requirements should be guaranteed by Member States under Articles 43 and 49 of the Treaty. It also believes that the dangers of on-line gambling, especially the consequences for consumers, such as addiction, are unproven.
According to these same MEPs, rulings of the Court of Justice and the ten infringement proceedings under way against Member States show that measures taken by some Member States do not comply with Community law and that a clarification of national and Community powers is needed.

New rules for cleaner, quieter, safer cars
2009-03-05 - 11:40
The EU will soon have a simpler, standardised system for the type-approval of motor vehicles, following a proposal by Parliament's Internal Market Committee. Members of the committee proposes to beef up plans to introduce new rules on the registration, sale and use of cars, with the aim of improving road safety and protecting the environment better. There is an agreement between Council and the European Parliament to adopt the legislation at first-reading. Ordinary tyres, all-weather tyres and snow tyres, the design and manufacture of cars in general and the use of modern technology on cars - all these things influence the safety and environmental impact of motor vehicles. A single regulation, directly applicable in all the Member States, will soon synthesise all the rules on these matters, replacing around fifty existing directives. Members of the Internal Market Committee approved the Commission's draft legislation with amendments when they adopted a first-reading co-decision report by Andreas Schwab (EPP-ED, DE) by 32 votes to 10 with 7 abstentions.
Following the vote, Mr Schwab was optimistic: "We are going to improve road safety in Europe by going further than the Commission. The new technologies must be pushed ahead faster, to set lower sound limits in future years and thus improve public health by reducing harmful road traffic noise".
Safer roads
The safety of road vehicles is steadily improving, the number of people killed on Europe's roads having fallen by 24% since 2001 thanks to better car design and manufacture. In this area the new regulation lays down a number of rules to be observed by manufacturers. But new safety technology, already available on top car models, can also help cut accident risks. The regulation will make such technology compulsory on ordinary cars too. An example is the electronic stability control system (ESC), which helps the driver keep control of his vehicle. Advanced emergency braking systems (AEBS) and lane departure warning systems (LDW) are to be made compulsory on lorries. MEPs changed the Commission's proposal to install such systems on other vehicles, because the systems were devised for lorries and are not suited to other vehicles such as private cars.
Greater environmental protection, lower energy consumption
Some of the rules on tyre standards have also been revised, as regards not just safety but also environmental impact. Rolling resistance and pressure affect the noise levels and CO2 emitted by vehicles. The new regulation lays down various standards on tyres which will cut CO2 emissions and fuel consumption. It also makes the installation of tyre pressure monitoring systems (TPMS) compulsory. This measure will apply to private cars. MEPs in the committee did not vote to extend this requirement to lorries but they beefed up the rules on the effectiveness and reliability of such systems, without giving preference to any particular technology. The committee also tightened up the definitions of tyres, for example limiting the possibility of installing off-road professional tyres on 4x4 cars marketed for private or leisure use.
Gradual entry into force
The new regulation will be easier to apply and easier for consumers and industry to understand. It replaces a number of directives, is directly applicable in the Member States and reflects car safety standards harmonised by the United Nations.
Once adopted by Parliament and Council, it should apply from 1 November 2011, say MEPs, a year earlier than the Commission proposed. But various transition periods are provided for, in some cases until 2018, to enable the car industry to adapt to the new measures.
"My main concern is to ensure that this European regulation does not impose extra costs on consumers and manufacturers. We want to see to it that drivers will save money by using less petrol in a healthier environment with lower CO2 emissions", commented the rapporteur.

Budget
2010 Budget must address financial, environmental and energy problems, says Budget Committee
2009-03-05 - 11:40
Citizens of the European Union live in apprehension and insecurity. The key objective of the 2010 Budget is to put European citizens first and give them more safety, says the Committee on Budgets in a report which highlights the economic crisis, energy uncertainty, climate change, illegal immigration, crime and terrorism as key priorities for the preliminary draft budget. The Committee is calling on the Commission to take these problems into account when deciding the preliminary draft budget. It says it expects the Commission to present solid and useful proposals to allow a meaningful budgetary discussion within the budgetary authority..
Current margin does not address economic crisis
MEPs of the Committee are concerned that the current margin under Heading 1a, estimated at EUR 111 599 000, does not allow the effects of the economic crisis to be appropriately addressed.
Moreover, the current European Globalisation Adjustment Fund will be unable to prevent the consequences of relocations, decreasing production and job losses, the report drafted by László SURJÁN (EPP-ED, HU) says.
Diversification will bring energy security
Turning to the recent energy crisis, the report underlines that there is an enormous need for projects which bring energy security to the Union through diversification of resources and interconnection of energy markets. MEPs therefore expect the Commission to propose strong actions in support of diversified gas transport routes such as the Nabucco gas pipeline project.
Measures to tackle climate change are unsatisfactory
The current context of economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to increase investments in green technologies, the report says, and this may require modifications to current financial programmes.
MEPs reiterate their conviction that measures to mitigate climate change are "still not satisfactorily included in the EU budget", since significant additional EU resources for energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies are needed and should be deployed to help to meet the EU's 2020 targets.
Internal security - a major concern for citizens
Funding for issues such as border protection, civil protection, the fight against terrorism must be maintained and should be reinforced in 2010, says the report, because "these policies directly address the fears of European citizens". And particular attention should be given to border protection so as to address the problem of illegal immigration, it adds.

Budget
2010 Budget: EP priorities
2009-03-05 - 11:40
The Budgets Committee will be presenting a report which sets out its priorities for the 2010 budget in a report by Vladimír MAŇKA (PES, SK) MEPs say that multilingualism and translation services are a high priority and call for more cost-effective working methods in the Parliament. Multilingualism in the EP
A fundamental priority for the 2010 budget will be the availability of high quality translation services for MEPs, which will allow them to work to the best interests of their constituents. The report emphasises the importance of treating all nationalities and languages equally, so that all MEPs have the option to carry out their work in their native language.
However, MEPs also recognise that there are a number of barriers which need to be overcome before this priority can be achieved. Restrictive deadlines in committee and group stages, complex negotiations between key actors and a lack of flexibility in translation working practices all present barriers to full multilingualism and need to be addressed.
The future ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon
During its discussions, the EP recognised that in the event of the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, new budgetary requirements would emerge and would need to be dealt with according to the budgetary procedures in force at the time. The rise of co-decision powers also puts further strain on Parliamentary services, and will require a more efficient support system to allow MEPs to perform their duties effectively.
Future enlargement of the Union
MEPs in the committee confirm the intention of the Parliament to make the necessary budget provisions for a possible future enlargement of the EU to include Croatia.
Methods of communication
The committee refers to the three main projects in the communications field; europarlTV, the Visitors' Centre and the new audiovisual centre in the Parliament, all of which demonstrate a visible improvement in the communication resources available. MEPs intend to closely monitor the development of these three projects, and the impact they have on public opinion.
Staffing and building policies
MEPs recognise the need to make optimal use of the current resources available; through cost-effective use of staff and improved working methods.
The Parliament also recognises the importance of its buildings policy in order to meet its current and future property needs. MEPs call for an improved property management scheme in order to avoid unnecessarily high renovation, maintenance and purchase costs. The medium to long-term building strategy paper is expected later this year.
Administrative costs
The report says that a significant margin should be kept in the budget estimates in order for Parliament to set its own periodicities in due course. The report points out that Parliament's 2010 budget should increase. The maximum increase being 4 per cent. However, the committee stresses, there are still uncertainties on the EU and EP budget given the GNI of the Member States.

Competition
Competition Policy 2006 and 2007
2009-03-05 - 11:40
Jonathan EVANS (EPP-ED, UK) for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will be putting forward an own-initiative report by welcoming the publication of the Commission's Competition Policy Reports for 2006 and 2007. Antitrust : MEPs in the committee congratulate the Commission on its effective challenging of the operation of unlawful hardcore cartels and the record fines imposed on offenders. They support the use of the revised leniency notice and procedure to encourage the provision of information about the operation of unlawful hardcore cartels.
The report also welcomes the publication of the White Paper on damages actions for breach of EC anti-trust rules but urges that reform be pursued in such a way as to ensure that the negative effects of the US system are not repeated in the European Union. MEPs in the committee also call on the Commission to clarify the role and involvement in competition cases of the Commission Consumer Liaison Officer.
Reiterating their concern to avoid the abuse of market power by major corporations, MEPs in the committee call on the Commission to: (i) undertake an analysis of the effects on competition of unequal relationships between suppliers, namely food producers, and retailers; (ii) consider reviewing the operation of abusive practices in the services sector, which may prevent small businesses from being able to tender for work; (iii) consider conducting a sector inquiry into on-line advertising; (iv) undertake an analysis of possible national differences in the application of public procurement rules.
Mergers : MEPs in the committee welcome the announcement of the launch of a review of the Merger Regulation. They consider that the current provisions are insufficient in view of increasingly integrated and complex European markets and that a review should be undertaken with a view to seeking a consistent approach in the evaluation of comparable merger operations.
State aid : the report welcomes the publication of the General Block Exemption Regulation to cover SMEs, research and development aid in favour of SMEs, aid for employment, training aid, and regional aid. It also welcomes the publication of the revised Community guidelines on State aid for environmental protection and calls call for clarification of the existing competition rules and their practical application in relation to services of general economic interest.
MEPs in the committee call on the Commission to undertake analyses of the effectiveness of State aid and urge that a revision of the scoreboard identify those Member States that have failed to pursue the recovery of illegal State aid adequately.
Sectoral dimension : the report supports the Commission in its endeavours to further develop the European gas and electricity markets. However, it expresses concern at the lack of transparency in the formation of fuel prices in European markets and asks the Commission to ensure proper vigilance over competitive behaviour in those markets. The Commission is also called upon to enforce behavioural constraints on financial institutions in receipt of State aid in order to ensure that such institutions do not engage in aggressive expansion against the background of the guarantee to the detriment of competitors.
Effective implementation : the Commission is called upon to ensure that its Directorate General for Competition has appropriate staff numbers to deal with its rising workload. The Commission should also review the structure of its participation in the International Competition Network and at the European Competition Day in order to ensure that the public is more widely and better informed about the key importance of competition policy.
Lastly, MEPs in the committee continue to support a more proactive role for Parliament in the development of competition policy through the introduction of the co-decision procedure. Rapporteur Jonathan EVANS EPP-ED UK A6-0011/2009 Report on Competition Policy 2006 and 2007 Debate :09.03.2009

Statute for a European private company: creating a uniform company throughout Europe
2009-03-05 - 11:40
The Committee on Legal Affairs welcomes the proposal on the Statute for a European private company, but proposes amendments that are "essentially aimed at responding to the debates that are to be anticipated within the Council and to counteract blockages within the Council". The report proposes a start-up capital of at least €1, provided that the articles of association require that the management body sign a solvency certificate. If not, the capital must be at least €8,000. The report by Klaus-Heiner LEHNE (EPP-ED, DE) says three of the four main points of the Commission's draft proposal could be blocked by the Council - minimum capital, employee participation and checks on registration. The fourth key point addressed in the Committee's amendments concerns national law.
Minimum start-up capital
The rapporteur states that while the proposed amendment on minimum capital is not crucial for the general acceptability of the European private company (SPE), a certain amount of start-up capital "may represent a threshold for solidity that will enhance the SPE's reputation".
Employee participation
SPEs are called on to provide uniform participation arrangements throughout the SPE in a process of negotiations with employees’ representatives. Standard rules would apply where management and employees are unable to agree on a uniform solution, the report says.
Checks on registration
To avoid a situation where an SPE becomes a haven for dubious business practices, the report calls for provision to be made for a minimum of preventative checks when the SPE is registered and where changes are made to the articles of association.
References to national law
To enhance legal certainty with regard to legal transactions within the EU internal market, the SPE regulation should therefore offer rules of its own on points that are crucial for the ‘daily life’ of the SPE, the report says, and references to national law should be avoided wherever possible.
Areas in which the rapporteur considers it appropriate to provide rules specific to the SPE are: the liability of executive directors, the consequences of defective resolutions and the consequences of ineffective clauses in the articles of association.

Commission asked to submit proposal to facilitate cross-border transfers of companies
2009-03-05 - 11:40
The Committee on Legal Affairs is asking the Commission to submit a legislative proposal for a directive aimed at facilitating cross-border transfers of registered offices within the European Union. The proposed directive will lay down measures for coordinating Member States’ national legislation in order to give companies freedom of establishment within the internal market. Under current circumstances, undertakings can only transfer their seat either by dissolution and establishing a new legal entity in the Member State of destination, or by establishing a new legal entity in the Member State of destination and then merging both undertakings, the report drafted by Klaus-Heiner LEHNE (EPP-ED, DE) says.
Transfer to be tax neutral
This procedure involves administrative obstacles, costs and social consequences and offers no legal certainty, the report notes; therefore the transfer of a company seat should be tax-neutral. In this regard, exchange of information and mutual assistance between tax authorities needs to be improved.
No "overkill" or excessive information in the proposed directive
MEPs in the Legal Affairs Committee also call for transparency in the application of the new directive in the Member States and propose a reporting requirement for Member States vis-à-vis the Commission whereby undertakings transferring their registered office under the directive must be entered in a European companies register. They point out that, in the interests of better law-making, excessive information (“overkill”) must be avoided when the reporting requirement is transposed into national law, provided that sufficient information is guaranteed.
Moreover, MEPs in the committee are of the view that a transfer of a company's seat must be preceded by the issuing of a transfer plan and a report explaining and justifying the legal and economic aspects and any consequences of the transfer for shareholders and employees.

ICTY: two year extension of the mandate asked by MEPs
2009-03-05 - 11:40
The Foreign Affairs committee calls on the Council to examine a possible two-year extension of the mandate of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), in a report presented to plenary. MEPs in the committee also urge the Council to expedite efforts to capture the two remaining indictees, Ratko Mladić and Goran Hadžić, allowing the Tribunal to fulfil its mandate The goal of the ICTY is to complete all proceedings (trials and appeals) by 2011. The ICTY - a United Nations court of law set up in 1993 - investigates violations of international humanitarian law committed in the former Yugoslavia since 1991 and to prosecute those responsible.
To complete its proceedings by 2011, the Tribunal is focussing on the most senior leaders suspected of being responsible for crimes. Cases brought against intermediate and low-level accusations have been transferred to competent national jurisdictions.
"The two remaining fugitives must be tried"
MEPs urge the Council to expedite efforts to capture the two remaining indictees, Ratko Mladić and Goran Hadžić, allowing the Tribunal to fulfil its mandate. "The two remaining fugitives must be tried by either the Tribunal or by the residual mechanisms, therefore avoiding any suggestion of impunity", stresses the report. Thus, if the trial of Ratko Mladić and Goran Hadžić is to proceed, that date cannot in any way constitute a deadline for the activities of the International Tribunal.
Annemie Neyts-Uyttebroeck (BE, ADLE), Parliament's rapporteur, stresses that the increased speed of proceedings should not be pursued at the expense of due process. "The legacy of the International Tribunal will be measured not only by whether it succeeds in judging those responsible for the most serious crimes falling under its jurisdiction but also by whether it does so in accordance with the strictest standards of fairness", she writes.
They also call on the Council to encourage the UN Security Council to commit itself to providing sufficient resources and support to the International Tribunal through the general budget of the UN until the end of its mandate.
Retention of documents
MEPs in the committee stress that the retention of highly qualified staff in the International Tribunal is a critical factor for the successful completion of trials and appeals. They call on the Council to raise with the Croatian authorities the apparent lack of co-operation in handing over key documents vital for the prosecution of General Ante Gotovina, Mladen Markac and Ivan Cermak. The Committee also reminds the recent calls made by ICTY Chief Prosecutor Serge Brammertz for relevant missing documentation to be located and be made available to ICTY.
MEPs in the committee remind the Council that the EU should take a particular interest in securing the legacy of the International Tribunal by ensuring that its archives are safely stored in a suitable location, possibly in the region of the Western Balkans, that they are as complete and as accessible as possible, and that documentation is accessible on Internet.
Evaluation
The report calls on the Council to set forth norms for evaluating the performance of the judiciary in the countries of the Western Balkans after the International Tribunal's term comes to an end.
MEPs in the committee call on the EU to increase its support for domestic war crime investigations and trials, for example through the provision of assistance to law enforcement, judicial and prosecutorial authorities, including funding for training and witness protection.
MEPs in the committee call on the Council to consider an increase in its support for the continuation strategy of the International Tribunal, and call for increased cooperation between the judicial and prosecutorial bodies in the Western Balkans, in particular in cases involving extradition and mutual legal assistance.

Brazil: a key player for the EU in Latin America
2009-03-05 - 11:40
From political dialogue to climate change, Brazil has become an increasingly significant regional and global player and has emerged as a key interlocutor for the EU. Against this background, Parliament will be asked to approve a draft recommendation on the European Union-Brazil Strategic Partnership established in 2007, which calls for closer and deeper ties between the two sides. Key points of the proposal for a recommendation, drafted by Véronique De Keyser (PES, BE), are as follows:
the EU-Brazil Strategic Partnership should form part of the bi-regional approach to and the global view of relations between the European Union, Latin-America and the Caribbean;
political dialogue should direct the Partnership as a whole, at all levels;
the Strategic Partnership should provide real added value in relation to current bilateral agreements between the EU, Brazil and Mercosur;
the central issues on which the Partnership's political agenda and dialogue should be the promotion of peace and security, democracy, climate change, energy security and sustainable development, and the fight against poverty and exclusion;
both Partners should seek to bring their positions closer together by means of closer cooperation with the United Nations, by encouraging multilateralism;
in terms of peace and security, the main issues to tackle are disarmament, non-proliferation and control of weapons, organised crime and specifically drug trafficking, money laundering, trafficking in small arms, light weapons and ammunition, trafficking in human beings, and terrorism;
the Partners need to make progress with the debate on social cohesion and migration, which must become a central point of cooperation;
dialogue should also tackle sectoral policies on transport, food security, science and technology, information society, employment and social issues, regional development, culture and education, etc;
the Partnership should also encourage the provision of regular information to the European Parliament and the Euro-Latin-American Parliamentary Assembly. Rapporteur Maria Eleni KOPPA PSE EL A6-0062/2009 EU-Brazil Strategic Partnership Procedure : own-initiative

EU Strategic Partnership with Mexico should include annual summits
2009-03-05 - 11:40
The Foreign Affairs Committee is calling for an annual EU-Mexico summit to give a fresh impetus to relations between the two sides as part of the Strategic Partnership currently under negotiation. It also believes Mexico should have a higher profile within the G-20. The transformation of the EU's relations with Mexico into a Strategic Partnership, a format already used with the USA, Russia, China and Brazil, is welcomed in the committee's own-initiative report, drafted by José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra (EPP-ED, ES).
Such a partnership would mark a qualitative leap in EU-Mexico relations at two different levels, says the report: multilaterally, in terms of mutual coordination on issues of world importance; and bilaterally, via the development of their relations and of particular initiatives.
It would boost cooperation between the parties in international forums, such as the World Bank, the IMF, the OECD, the G-20 and the G8+G5, and help seek solutions to the world financial crisis. In this connection, MEPs propose that Mexico - already a member of the G-20 - should become a permanent member of the G-20's new financial and economic architecture.
The committee also argues for more attention to be devoted to migration issues. It wants further progress in developing a comprehensive and structured dialogue on immigration, both legal and illegal, as well as on the links between migration and development.
In addition, the report calls for reaffirmation of the Millennium Development Goal commitments and for renewed awareness of the need for close cooperation on social cohesion, gender equality, climate change, sustainable development, the fight against international terrorism, drug trafficking and organised crime, food security and the fight against poverty.
Lastly, MEPs voice support for the Mexican government in its fight against drug trafficking, international terrorism and organised crime, especially in view of the increasing numbers of victims of drug trafficking and consumption.

50th anniversary of the Tibetan uprising and dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese Government
2009-03-05 - 11:40
Marco Cappato, Marco Pannella and Janusz Onyszkiewicz, on behalf of the ALDE Group, Monica Frassoni and Eva Lichtenberger, on behalf of the Greens/EFA Group will be asking the Commission questions on the 50th anniversary of the Tibetan uprising and dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese Government. MEPs will also vote on a resolution on this topic. Considering that 10 March this year is the 50th anniversary of the Tibetan national uprising against the Chinese administration;
considering the breakdown of the negotiations between the Chinese authorities and His Holiness the Dalai Lama;
having regard to the EP resolution (P6_TA(2008)0119) of 10 April 2008 on Tibet, in which the European Parliament:
called for an open and independent inquiry, under the auspices of the United Nations, into the recent riots and repression in Tibet (...);
called on the Council (...) closely to monitor developments, and to ensure that the EU adopts a consistent common position and that decisions taken on the basis thereof are duly implemented (...);
reiterated its call on the Council to appoint a special envoy for Tibetan issues in order to facilitate the dialogue between the parties (...);
(...) called for a constructive dialogue to be opened without preconditions, with a view to reaching a comprehensive political agreement, including a sustainable solution with regard to the cultural and political autonomy of Tibet and religious freedom and true minority rights for the Tibetan people in other neighbouring Chinese provinces;
What actions will the Commission take in order to resume negotiations between the Chinese Government and His Holiness the Dalai Lama?
In which ways did the Commission follow up on the resolution by the European Parliament?
What actions did the Commission take to ascertain responsibility for the breakdown of the negotiations? In particular does it consider that the Tibetan ‘Memorandum on Genuine Autonomy for the Tibetan People’ is a proposal for genuine autonomy (as asserted by the Tibetan Government in Exile) or for ‘disguised independence’ (as asserted by the Chinese Government)?

Childcare facilities - Barcelona objectives
2009-03-05 - 11:40
The Commission will make a statement on Childcare facilities - Barcelona objectives. What are the so-called 'Barcelona targets'? Ensuring suitable childcare provision is an essential step towards equal opportunities in employment between women and men. In 2002, at the Barcelona Summit, the European Council set the targets of providing childcare by 2010 to:
at least 90% of children between 3 years old and the mandatory school age and
at least 33% of children under 3 years of age.
How do we measure progress towards the Barcelona targets?
Provision is measured as children cared for (by formal arrangements other than by the family) as a proportion of all children in the same age group (children under three or between three years and the mandatory school age).
This indicator is broken down by the number of hours per week during which the children are cared for (up to 30 hours a week /30 hours or more a week). Data are collected through an EU harmonised survey, the EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC).
Formal arrangements are defined as the following services: pre-school or equivalent, compulsory education, centre-based services outside school hours, a collective crèche or another day-care centre, including family day-care, professional certified childminders. The care provided by family members, neighbours or non-certified childminders are therefore not included under this definition of “formal arrangements”.
How are the Member States performing?
Regarding the lower age-group (0 to 3 years), only five Member States (DK, NL, SE, BE, ES) have surpassed the 33% coverage rate, while five others (PT, UK , FR, LU, SI) are approaching this target. In most of the other countries, much still needs to be done to meet the demand for childcare facilities. While seven Member States (FI, IT, CY, EE, DE, IE, LV) have reached an intermediate level of coverage (between 16 and 26%), eight Member States (EL, HU, MT, SK, LT, AT, CZ, PL) show a coverage rate of 10% or less.
Nevertheless, these coverage rates relate to all children, irrespective of how many hours per week they attend a childcare facility. Attendance hours vary widely from one country to another, and in numerous countries a particularly high proportion of childcare facilities operate on a part-time basis only. The Netherlands and the United Kingdom are prime examples, with under-3s attending childcare centres almost exclusively on a part-time basis.
Regarding children between 3 years old and the mandatory school age, eight Member States (BE, DK, FR, DE, IE , SE, ES, IT) have surpassed the 90% coverage rate[2], while three others ( UK , NL, CY) are approaching this target. Seven Member States (EE, SI, HU, FI, PT, SK, AT) have a coverage rate that is substantial but nevertheless still some way short of the target, between 70% and 85%. Moreover, in many countries a high proportion of childcare facilities for children in this age-group operate on a part-time basis only. For example, the coverage rate for full-time attendance is below 50% in more than half of the Member States and not even 30% in a third of Member States.
Any interpretation of these figures must take into account, however, different countries' particular ways of organising nursery-school education and the availability or not of after-school childcare services. Debate : 10.03.2009 Childcare services in the EU

Children of migrants: MEPs to quiz the Commission
2009-03-05 - 11:40
The situation of children of EU migrants that are left on their own in the Member State of origin while their parents migrate for work to another Member State has raised considerable concern in some Member States in the last two years. While policies do exist with the aim of improving the living conditions and education of migrant children who moved with their parents working abroad, the phenomenon of children left at home on their own has received little attention. Jan ANDERSSON (PES, SE), on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs will be asking the Comimssion the following questions on children of migrants
According to the study made by Unicef and Social Alternatives in Romania, almost 350 000 children in 2008 had at least one parent who was working abroad, and nearly 126 000 had both parents working abroad.
The children left behind are at risk of losing care and parental attention.
They are at risk of general lack of care as regards physical and mental health, mental-health related effects such as depression, losing free time to play and develop, lack of school participation and general participation in education and training, malnutrition and child abuse.
Does the Commission plan a study to assess the extent of the situation?
Does the Commission believe that the subject of the children of migrant workers is not only a matter for the government in the sending country but also for the governments of the countries that benefit from the presence of the migrant workers on their labour market?
Does the Commission intend to carry out research into possible specialised information systems for migrant workers, as regards information for family members in the host country, on schooling and education, language learning and child care provisions? Would this feasible under the EURES scheme? Jan ANDERSSON PES SE Oral question to Commission

Citizens to have the right to ask the Commission to submit a legislative proposal
2009-03-05 - 11:40
Once the Treaty of Lisbon is on force, one million European citizens will have the right to ask the Commission to submit a legislative proposal on European Union matters that they believe require a legal act. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs is calling for the regulation on Citizens' Initiative, as it is known, to be "clear, simple and user-friendly" and for it to be clearly distinguishable from the right to petition. Although the outcome of a European Citizens' Initiative (ECI) or a petition may be similar– for example, both may lead, at the instigation of several persons, to the adoption of a European Union legislative act – they differ fundamentally in terms of their function and, accordingly, their addressees and the conditions governing their submission, the report drafted by Sylvia-Yvonne KAUFMANN (GUE/NGL, DE) says.
First and foremost, petitions give people, who have been indirectly or directly affected by the exercise of the EU's sovereign powers, the opportunity to address the European Parliament directly. They may inform Parliament of a given state of affairs and ask for the situation to be remedied. ECIs, on the other hand, allow EU citizens to "participate directly in the exercise of the European Union sovereign powers by giving them the possibility, like the Council and Parliament, to request the Commission to submit a legislative proposal."
Minimum number of Member States
The Committee report recommends that the Citizens' Initiative requires that citizens from a minimum of one quarter of the total number of Member States take part, and that one in 500 must support the initiative within each Member State for the initiative to be legitimate.
All EU citizens who have a right to vote in their country may participate in a citizens' initiative.
Procedure
The procedure for the citizens' initiative will comprise five stages:
registering the initiative, including specifying the organisers of the ECI,
collecting statements of support,
presenting the initiative,
a statement of its position by the Commission,
verifying that the requested legal act is consistent with the Treaties.
In the interest of transparency, the organisers of a successfully registered citizens' initiative will be required to present a report to the Commission on the funding and sources of funding after the procedure has concluded.

Employment policy
Improving EU labour market access for the Roma
2009-03-05 - 11:40
Educating young people should be a priority in combating poverty and social exclusion of the Roma, says the EP Employment and Social Committee MEPs in an own-initiative report calling for an overall strategy to integrate the Roma community into the European Union. The Roma are the European Union's largest minority. They suffer many forms of discrimination, a higher rate of poverty and a lower standard of living than the EU average, stresses the report by Magda Kósáne Kovács (PES, HU) on "the social situation of the Roma and improving their access to the labour market in the EU".
"Whereas the improvement of the social and economic situation of the Roma was a significant consideration in the enlargement process, progress has generally been limited", MEPs in the committee observe.
Education: a priority
Young Roma people tend to leave school relatively early, "which damages their personal education, integration on the labour market", and compromises their education, integration and opportunities on the labour market" and "although the proportion of Roma young people in secondary and higher education has increased in certain Member States, their level of qualifications still remains far below the European average", note MEPs in the committee.
Moreover, the unequal access to services and socio-economic disadvantages facing Roma children in practice put quality education out of their reach and so affect their chances on the labour market and their integration. The committee therefore stresses the need for targeted education policies which address Roma families and encourage active participation.
Furthermore, to help long-term unemployed people to return to work, MEPs in the committee call on the EU and Member States to put in place an integrated approach that addresses all aspects of their deprivation. Special attention should be paid to women, who are often actors in the hidden economy and have a very low employment rate.
Combating discrimination and stigmatisation
A majority of committee MEPs in the committee welcome a proposal for a comprehensive new directive to combat discrimination and considered that the Commission should draw up programmes to eliminate discrimination and stigmatisation of the Roma.
MEPs in the committee also ask the Commission to assess the impact of existing policy instruments on the Roma and to develop a coherent EU political strategy.
They recommend that Member States create an EU level expert group including Roma representatives to co-ordinate Member States' Roma strategy and the use of EU funds for its promotion.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Performing arts: Women still discriminated against
2009-03-05 - 11:40
Claire GIBAULT (ALDE, FR) for the Women's Rights and Gender Equality Committee will be tabling an own-initiative report on equality of treatment and access for men and women in the performing arts. The report underlines the scale and persistence of the inequalities between men and women in the performing arts and the impact that the unequal way in which the sector is organised can have on society as a whole, given the particular nature of its activities. Obstacles
The committee underlines the absolute need to promote and encourage access for women to all the artistic professions where they are still in the minority. The report emphasises the need to promote access for women to all the artistic professions and all jobs in the performing arts where they are in the minority and encourages the Member States to remove all obstacles to women accessing top positions in cultural institutions and in academies and universities.
Auditions and quotas
The report stresses the importance of ensuring whenever possible that applications are anonymous and emphasises the need to continue using screened-off auditions for recruiting orchestra musicians, which has helped women join orchestras.
The committee calls on the Commission and the Member States to consider immediately, as a first realistic step in the fight against inequality in the performing arts, ensuring that at least a third of the people in all branches in the sector are of the minority sex.
Statistics
The committee encourages the Member States to produce comparative analyses of the current situation in the performing arts in the various countries of the Union, to draw up statistics in order to facilitate the design and implementation of common policies and to ensure that the progress achieved can be compared and measured.
Social situation across the EU
Finally, the committee calls on the Member States to improve the social situation of persons active in the arts and culture sector and in so doing to take account of the various employment relations involved and to guarantee better social protection.

Industry
Make the Small Business Act legally binding, says the Industry Committee
2009-03-05 - 11:40
Small and medium-sized businesses consistently underperform compared to their American counterparts and larger companies when it comes to productivity, growth and innovation. So says the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy in a report which calls on the Council and Commission to join Parliament in making the Small Business Act legally binding. While the committee supports the Commission's Communication of 25 June 2008, which introduces ten guiding principles aimed at promoting the growth of small and medium-sized businesses, it stresses that implementing these principles at European, national and regional level is an "absolute necessity".
The committee report by Edit HERCZOG (PES, HU) also calls for mandatory, systematic and targeted impact assessments for SMEs, known as an ‘SME test’. The SME test should apply to all new proposals for EU legislation affecting business including simplification of existing legislation and withdrawals of pending proposals, the report says, and Member States are encouraged to introduce similar SME tests at national level.
Moreover, MEPs in the committee stress that common commencement dates for new Community legislation affecting SMEs should be introduced and that red tape must be cut by at least 25%.
Better conditions for transferring family businesses
Member States' taxation system can be a deterrent to the transfer of businesses, in particular family businesses, increasing the risk of liquidation or closure of the company, say MEPs in the committee. Therefore, they call on Member States to review their legal and fiscal framework "carefully" to improve the conditions for transfer of businesses, especially in cases of owner retirement or illness.
A harmonised time limit for payments
One in four cases of failure of SMEs is due to late payments, in most cases on the part of public administrations, the report says. MEPs in the committee are worried that the present credit crunch may disproportionally affect SMEs as larger customers put pressure on smaller suppliers to grant extended payment terms.
The committee therefore welcomes the Commission’s proposal to review the directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions, and calls on the Member States to improve the payment culture in their public administrations. It urges the creation at Community level of a harmonised time limit for payments, possibly shortened for payments to SMEs, and penalties for exceeding this limit.
Swift agreement on Community Patent
Small businesses need support to access intellectual property rights protection, uphold these rights and also use their IPR to attract finances, stress MEPs. They call for "a swift agreement (...) on a Community Patent ensuring low-cost, efficient, flexible and high-quality legal protection, adapted to the needs of SMEs", as well as on a harmonised European patent litigation system.
Further measures
Other measures proposed by the committee to promote small businesses in Europe include:
- setting up a “statistics holiday” for micro enterprises, granting them temporary exemptions from mandatory statistical surveys.
- work-based vocational and occupational (re)training and lifelong learning programmes specifically tailored to SMEs’ needs, co-financed by the European Social Fund.
- using e-procurement.
- advance payment as general practice for all public procurement contracts.
- including the promotion of self-employment, entrepreneurship culture and business awareness in national educational curricula. Rapporteur Edit HERCZOG PES HU A6-0074/2009 Small Business Act Procedure : own-initiative

Asylum policy
Parliament to consider the future of the European Common Asylum System
2009-03-05 - 11:40
Legislative instruments relating to the first phase of the establishment of the common European asylum system have allowed the introduction of common minimum standards but not of equal conditions of access to protection throughout the EU, says to the Civil Liberties Committee. It claims the Dublin system results in "a disproportionate burden being imposed on some Member States, in particular on those representing the external EU border". The number of refugees has grown to more than 12 million in the past year, says the Committee report drafted by Giusto CATANIA (GUE/NGL, IT), and there are huge discrepancies between Member States when it comes to the recognition rates of candidates to refugee status for certain third country nationals. These recognition rates can vary from approximately 0% up to 90%, it says.
MEPs in the Civil Liberties Committee regret that the concept of the institution of asylum, "an essential part of democracy and protection of human rights, has been severely eroded in recent years".
Revise Frontex mandate
They call on the Commission to table a proposal for a revision of Frontex's mandate in order to explicitly state that protection and human rights concerns are an integral part of the management of the EU external borders.
MEPs also welcome the provisions mentioned in the latest Commission proposals that Member States shall not hold a person in detention for the sole reason that he or she is an applicant for international protection. They consider that asylum seekers should, "as a matter of principle, not be placed in detention, in view of their particularly vulnerable position".
Call for a single application procedure
Moreover, the report asks that a single asylum application procedure and single standards for qualification as refugees or persons needing international protection be established, covering all requests for 'international protection' (refugee status, subsidiary protection and temporary protection).
Under the revised Dublin regulation asylum seekers should be granted the right to appeal against a transfer decision, the report says, adding that certain criteria relating to family, cultural and linguistic considerations should be given greater consideration in the decision as to which country is responsible for an asylum request.
Solidarity needed between Member States
MEPs in the committee consider that one of the objectives of the common European asylum system should be to set up effective solidarity mechanisms in order to improve the situation of countries with the greatest flows of asylum seekers.
They take the view that solidarity cannot be confined to the granting of financial resources and calls for the effective implementation of internal resettlement and relocation mechanisms on a voluntary basis as envisaged by the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum. They therefore call on the Commission to consider the possibility of setting up a European mechanism for transferring international protection, under the supervision of the future European Asylum Support Office, to allow the movement of refugees in Europe upon their request and thus ease the burden borne by some Member States
Co-operation with third countries
Finally, the report underlines that CEAS should be fully coherent with the objectives and activities in the area of refugee protection of EU instruments for cooperation with developing countries (such as the European Development Fund, the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI), the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights) and agreements and partnerships between the EU and developing countries (such as the Cotonou Agreement and the Africa-EU Strategic Partnership).

Access to documents: MEPs to demand more transparency
2009-03-05 - 11:40
Members of the Civil Liberties Committee propose a report, drafted by Michael Cashman (PES, UK). The European Parliament is working in co-decision with the Council of Ministers to revise the 2001 regulation on access to documents, which has been followed by a number of rulings by the Court of Justice. The revised regulation will incorporate these rulings into a single framework for all the institutions, but MEPs want to go further. The final vote will take place at a later plenary session. No legislative documents should be kept secret: this must be a basic principle of the reformed policy on access to documents, say members of the Civil Liberties Committee in a vote on a new EU rules on the issue.
A more transparent system of information for the public
A common interface for registers of documents
MEPs must have access to documents classed as secret
A register of lobbyists
In its report, the committee includes amendments clarifying the term "document", defining it as any data or content, whatever its medium, concerning a matter relating to the policies, activities and decisions falling within the institution's sphere of responsibility. MEPs also make a distinction between legislative and non-legislative documents: the former should always be available to the public and may not be kept secret on the grounds that this could undermine the decision-making process of the institutions.
Transparency in Member States too
Documents originating from a Member State and received by the EU institutions should also be disclosed. And Member States should ensure that their citizens enjoy at least the same degree of transparency as that provided at EU level, say MEPs.
A common EU website
The committee adds an article on legislative transparency, stating that these documents must be available on an interinstitutional website. Preparatory documents, impact studies, legal opinions and other documents must also be published.
"EU classified": a new category of documents
MEPs have also devised a scale for classifying documents, from "EU restricted" to "EU top secret", for documents whose unauthorised disclosure could harm the interests of the European Union or its Member States. Reasons must be given why access to a document is refused. And documents on legislative procedures must not be classified, say MEPs in the committee.
Exceptions shall only apply for the period during which protection is justified and may only apply for 30 years, unless the exception relates to the privacy or integrity of the individual.
International agreements
International accords on the sharing of confidential information concluded in the name of the EU (such as the agreement with the USA on passenger name records or "PNR"), must not give a non-EU country or an international organisation the right to prevent the European Parliament from accessing confidential information.
A register of lobbyists
An inter-institutional register of lobbyists should also be set up, and the names, titles and functions of the lobbyists should be made public, as should those of EU officials, unless this information would affect the privacy or integrity of the individual.
A special oversight committee made up of MEPs should be set up and should have access to classified documents. Each directorate-general of every institution should designate a person responsible for ensuring that the regulation is properly implemented.
Lastly, requests for paper copies of documents must be processed within 15 days, as compared to the 30 days suggested in the initial proposal.

More in-depth discussion needed on new measures for border management
2009-03-05 - 11:40
The Committee for Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs is tabling an own-initiative report offering its opinion on a new block of measures envisaged by the Commission, which, although still in the policy development stage, is likely to "bring substantial changes in the way border management is conceived and can have a huge impact in terms of data protection", the committee says. Every year, 160 million EU citizens, 60 million third country nationals (TCNs) who do not require a visa, and 80 million requiring a visa, cross the EU's external border. The Commission is looking at introducing a combination of an entry/exit system for all TCNs, a Registered Traveller Programme (RTP) and a framework for the development of ‘local’ Registered Traveller schemes and Automated Border Control
So-called 'overstayers' are central to the proposed entry/exit system and are supposed to represent the biggest category of illegal immigrants in the EU, the report drafted by Jeanine HENNIS-PLASSCHAERT (ALDE, NL) says. However, MEPs in the Civil Liberties Committee are requesting more information on the data collected by an external contractor estimating that 'there were up to 8 million illegal immigrants within the EU25 in 2006'.
Proposed entry/exit system will not stop illegal immigrants
The committee says it "does not believe that the proposed system will put an end to the 'overstay' phenomenon as such". It points out that, although the proposed system and alert information might help to deter TCNs from overstaying, as well as providing data and information on patterns, further contact with law enforcement agencies is still necessary for an individual who overstays his or her period of admission to be apprehended.
Pointing to "lessons learned in the USA", the report notes that "it is more challenging to implement exit capability than entry, and in particular with regard to sea and land exit". MEPs have considerable concerns about the cost-effectiveness of such a system and therefore call on the Commission to provide additional information on the actual investments generated by such a system.
The report points out that the correct functioning of the entry/exit system will depend both materially and operationally on the success of the VIS and SIS II, and yet these instruments are not yet fully operational, it says.
Registered traveller status for 'low risk' travellers
MEPs support in principle the concept of a Registered Travel Programme for TCNs, a concept which would allow 'bona fide' and 'low risk' travellers to gain registered traveller status after a reliable travel history. They say it would help speed up traveller flows and prevent congestion at entry and exit points.
However, MEPs criticise the use of the words 'low-risk' and 'bona fide' travellers because "it would imply that a huge number of travellers are considered a priori as 'high-risk' or 'mala fide'" and therefore recommend the term 'frequent travellers'.
Noting that several Member States have already set up or are preparing such an RTP for TCNs, the report highlights the risk of ending up with a patchwork of twenty-seven systems based on different criteria, including those on data-protection and fees.
The UK , for example, together with the Netherlands, Germany, and FRONTEX are seeking to promote the 'International Expedited Traveller Programme' as a possible blueprint for other Member States.
MEPs are therefore urging the Commission to speed up the process, on the basis of best practices in Member States, and to make sure that Member States continue to act in conformity with Community law.
Biometrics raise concerns
The Committee also questions whether the proposed Electronic System of Travel Authorisation (ESTA) is absolutely necessary, asking for a thorough explanation of the rationale for it.
Finally, MEPs point out that biometrics are not in all cases accurate and therefore insist on a standard protocol for the use and exchange of biometric information and interface control agreements to describe how the protocol will be used.
