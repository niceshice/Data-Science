Europe - online for the elections? More than 10,000 people responded to our online poll last week complaining that politicians and media aren't giving the June European elections the attention they deserve. Fortunately the internet offers plenty of resources to find information, to discuss topics and to make up your mind on the candidates and on the issues. Discover this rapidly growing ecosystem of websites via our new Delicious page.
Every day new sites spring up proposing different angles on the European elections. Large and small, serious and playful, they offer opportunities to voters to engage in the European political process and stimulate participation in the elections.
Often they are brought to our attention by those who run or use them. Though these are third party sites, and the European Parliament assumes no responsibility for their content, or the views they express, we thought it worthwhile to gather together links to sites which aim to provoke discussion of and participation in the elections and the European political process more widely - hence our new Delicious page, reflecting some of the wealth of the European elections online.
Have a look round. What do you think? Is the online community doing the elections justice? Let us know via the "comment" function below.
But don't forget the Parliament!
The Parliament is running an intense campaign on the web, talking about the elections and why it matters that people vote for the Europe they want. There is our special interactive website on the elections in 22 languages, but the Parliament is also present on Facebook, MySpace, Flickr and YouTube: stay in touch and make your choice: on 4-7 June itâ€™s your choice!
So let us know
Check out the links to Parliament sites below, but remember to check our Delicious page for an overview of what others are doing and saying about the elections, and give us you views.
Just one thing, on our Delicious page we cannot publish links to sites which campaign for or promote particular political parties or candidates in the election as this is incompatible with the institutional status of the European Parliament's website. Thank you for understanding this.
