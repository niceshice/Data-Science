Mr Pöttering and Danish PM Anders Fogh Rasmussen
Immediate action to mitigate the effects of climate change and Danish ratification of the Reform Treaty to allow the EU to face the challenges of globalisation: These were two themes Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering stressed in a two-day official visit to Denmark on Tuesday and Wednesday this week. During the visit he held talks with PM Anders Fogh Rasmussen, met leading Danish MPs and also delivered a speech on the danger of climate change to students at the University of Copenhagen.
In the speech on Tuesday afternoon he said that climate change "affects every aspect of our lives: our ecosystem, our health, our habits, our production methods, and indeed also our security". He praised Denmark for keeping energy consumption constant since 1972 which had broken "the link between growth and CO2 emissions". He also used the speech to urge Denmark to ratify the Reform Treaty so the Union could "respond to the challenges of globalisation".
The first day of the visit also saw Mr Pöttering have an audience with Queen Margrethe II. On Wednesday 2 April he will meet with Denmark's Economics Minister Bendt Bendtsen, attend a public meeting on EU issues and visit the European Environment Agency in Copenhagen.
Denmark joined the European Union in 1973; its 5.4 million people are currently represented by 14 MEPs in Strasbourg.
