2008-01-11 - 16:23
Have you made any new year's resolutions and are they still intact? We spoke to a few MEPs to see what kind of personal and political resolutions they had made for 2008. Normally MEPs vote on Parliamentary resolutions but in our survey we found a mixture of good intentions ranging from improving their health to becoming "an expert on the Lisbon treaty", ahead of a referendum in Ireland. Below are some resolutions MEPs are making for 2008.
Children, poverty and Lisbon Treaty
Italian UEN MEP Roberta Angelilli told us that "my first resolution is to keep on working for the rights of children, who are a very important part of Europe, 30% of the European population."
Fernando Fernández, a Spanish EPP-ED member and active on Parliament's Development Committee said that "this new year brings exactly the same old problems that have been occupying us for many years already. I wish to be successful in helping to reduce poverty in less developed countries and also for immigrants coming from there."
Irish Liberal member Marian Harkin said she wants "to become an expert on the Lisbon Treaty - I will need to be for the upcoming referendum in Ireland!"
More culture and sport
Austrian Green Johannes Voggenhuber told us, "I will try to escape more often from the spaceship called the European Parliament in order to participate more in the cultural life of Brussels."
Věra Flasarová, a Czech MEP for the GUE-NGL group, said, "this year I definitely decided to do something for my health, for better condition. No running, no riding on the bike or playing tennis and I am not going to climb up the Mount Everest at all. I just have to exercise for five minutes a day and from time to time to go for a walk in nature. Perhaps you will say that it is a modest resolution, but for me at this time it is a realistic one."
Less bureaucracy
Swedish Independence and Democracy (IND/DEM) Member Nils Lundgren said, "I promise myself to concentrate my political energy on fighting for a Europe of freedom and against a Europe of bureaucracy."
Not everybody makes resolutions. Miloš Koterec, a Slovak Socialist told us that "I do not make New Year resolutions but try to solve problems systematically or ad hoc, immediately when they occur."
