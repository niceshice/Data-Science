A Commission proposal to authorise the use of "meat glue" enzyme bovine/porcine thrombin, which can be used to stick scraps of meat together, was opposed by Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee MEPs on Tuesday. Parliament as a whole could veto the authorisation of this food additive, in a vote before the end of May.
Thrombin is an enzyme derived from animals, which can be used to glue together pieces of meat to create a single morsel. Ã…sa Westlund (S&D, SE), raised the objection to its authorisation, on the grounds this practice could mislead consumers. The Environment Committee backed her objection with 31 votes in favour, 21 against, and no abstentions.
Parliament as a whole is to vote on the objection in Strasbourg on 17-20 May. If a majority of MEPs (369+) back the Environment Committee, the authorisation will be vetoed under a "regulatory procedure with scrutiny". The deadline for Parliament to veto the proposal is 30 May. If there is no veto, MEPs will in effect give a green light for bovine and/or porcine thrombin to be listed in Annex IV of Directive 95/2/EC, which authorises "additives other than authorised colours and sweeteners".
