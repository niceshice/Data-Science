Hemicycle Chamber, Brussels
The European Parliament, meeting in Plenary session in Brussels, yesterday modified its agenda to discuss relations with Russia after the assassination of the campaigning Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya and to pay homage to her. She was shot in her Moscow apartment block by unknown assailants on 7 October. "I wish to pay tribute to this exceptional journalist, to her exceptional bravery and to her exceptional resolve," said Parliament's President Josep Borrell.
He went on to say that "I very much hope that the Russian authorities do their utmost as quickly as possible to get to the bottom of this heinous act. Finding out who the perpetrators were will be a test for the state of democracy, freedom of expression and freedom of opinion in Russia".
The assassination of Ms Politkovskaya is not an isolated incident of violence and intimidation towards journalists. At this moment in time, 120 journalists are imprisoned worldwide with 63 having been murdered in 2005 while carrying out their work gathering information.
Many MEPs also took the opportunity to pay homage to Ms Politkovskaya and to underline the fact that, in its dialogue with Russia, the European Union cannot omit the question of human rights and freedom of the press. This call comes at a timely moment as relations between the EU and Russian will be an important point in the informal EU summit at Lahti on 20 October. MEPs observed a minute's silence in honour of Anna Politkovskaya and other assassinated journalists.
