"We hope to encourage all potential voters to use their vote, whether for an Irish MEP or for an MEP from another Member State by providing them with information on how to vote and why their vote is important" said Francis Jacobs, Head of the European Parliament Office in Ireland, when he launched a series of information leaflets aimed at non-Irish voters living in Ireland.
During the event on Tuesday, 28 April, representatives from the Polish and French communities in Ireland spoke to those present and Pamela Prendiville from micandidate.eu gave a presentation of their easy-to-use source of information on candidates for the forthcoming European Elections. Please see the programme for the event for further information, or click on your preferred country on the map to access the relevant information leaflet.
Between 4-7 June, 375 million voters in the EU's 27 Member States will be eligible to vote. Tuesday's event was aimed in particular at non-Irish EU citizens, to inform them about their options - either voting in the European Elections in Ireland (Friday, 5 June) or voting in their own country. During the event, information leaflets were launched for each individual country (available at www.europeanelections.ie ). The key message was 'Use Your Vote' and the important role played by the EU in the lives of its citizens was emphasised - whether it's the food we eat, the water we drink, the cars we drive or the air we breathe, over the next 5 years, it was pointed out that the European Parliament will take decisions that will affect your life. The European Elections give EU citizens the opportunity to elect their representatives to the European Parliament (MEPs), thereby shaping Europe's future.
Francis Jacobs, Head of the EP Office in Ireland said that "given the large number of non-Irish EU citizens now resident in Ireland, it is especially important that eligible voters be aware of their rights to vote in Ireland or if they so choose, to vote for candidates at home. For that reason, the European Parliament is launching a series of information leaflets about the voting options for citizens from each of the EU's Member States."
The information leaflets, which can be viewed at www.europeanelections.ie answer the following questions:
As a non-Irish EU-citizen, can I participate in the European Elections in Ireland or in my country of origin?
Where do I have to register?
What are the deadlines for registration?
What is the voting procedure in my home country?
The programme included presentations by the Franchise Section of the Department of the Environment, by miCandidate.eu and by representatives from the Polish and French communities in Ireland.
