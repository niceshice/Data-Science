14 Jan: Czech PM Topolánek told MEPs he would focus on economics and energy The economy and energy security are two priorities of the incoming Czech Presidency of the Union according to Czech PM Mirek Topolánek who addressed the House Wednesday. Later MEPs debated the crisis in Gaza and the Russia-Ukraine gas stand-off.
Czech PM outlines 6-month programme
Mirek Topolánek began his six-month term of office by thanking the former French Presidency for its work: "it is not easy to take over the Presidency of the Council of the EU after France. I see only one way to rise to the occasion, with honour."
Topolánek's 3 E's
Outlining his goals for his Presidency, Topolánek made his priorities the economy, energy security and Europe's position in the world.
MEPs all agreed that the Presidency faced a tough inception due to the economic crisis.
Joseph Daul of the EPP-ED group said "the Czech presidency has become faced with difficulties and handling three crises. A united front is the only attitude we can adopt".
Socialist leader Martin Schulz told the House: "If the EU wants to continue its worldwide role, then Europe can't be fragmented into its individual elements. We need a strong unified block. We need a united voice."
Graham Watson of the Liberal ALDE group addressed the President directly saying: "Protect yourself not by fences, but by your friends. We are your friends. This is a union of friends, equals and partners. Stick to your objectives and we will stick by you".
The worsening crisis in Gaza
The afternoon session saw MEPs debate at length, the ever-troubling crisis in Gaza.
The overwhelming majority of voices across the House called for an immediate ceasefire in accordance with the recent UN resolution, with many recognising Israel’s right of self-defence but condemning the “disproportionate” scale of its intervention in Gaza.
Parliament will adopt a resolution on the Gaza conflict on Thursday, 15 January.
Europe intensifies pressure on Russia and the Ukraine over gas
With gas still not reaching many EU Members, European voices intensified in their call for a swift resolution. MEPs also rallied in the new need for a united common energy policy, creating long lasting stability for European energy.
Hanna Foltyn-Kubicka of the UEN group said that the gas crisis is a long-term one and that it is not just economic but political. "Behind Gazprom's demands is the political machinery of the Kremlin" she said.
István Szent-Iványi of ALDE also condemned the political dichotomy that was playing out: "There is still no gas, we cannot tolerate that Europe is being held hostage in a cynical game".
Other debates
The remainder of the session saw debates on the situation in the Horn of Africa. Europe's policy towards Belarus and whether to make 11 July a day of remembrance for the victims of the massacre in Srebrenica were also discussed by MEPs Wednesday.
