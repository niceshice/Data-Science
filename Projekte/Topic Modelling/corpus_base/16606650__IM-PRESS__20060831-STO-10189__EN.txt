Big decision: A Congolese observer with a ballot paper
The picture tells its own story. Congo's first elections in 40 years saw 26 million registered voters face a choice between 33 Presidential and 9,600 Parliamentary candidates. So numerous were the candidates that specially sized ballot papers had to be printed for the 30 July poll. After a decade of war and millions dead, this election offers hope for the people of Congo and the region. Twelve MEPs joined 300 EU election observers and 50,000 Congolese volunteers to monitor the poll.
A success but "major reconciliatory work lies ahead"
Jürgen Schröder, German Christian Democrat MEP and chair of the parliamentary delegation to Congo called the elections " a huge success and a good start", but warned that "major reconciliatory work lies ahead".
The team of MEPs reported the election was a significant success with polling day mostly peaceful, with some isolated violence after the poll and a few logistical and technical problems on election-day itself. With Congo being so geographically vast (larger than the previous 15 member EU) this was a major achievement. A decisive second round of elections is scheduled for 29 October.
The delegation also added that "the assistance of the international community made the elections possible", but "the extreme dedication of the polling stations staff made them workable." German Socialist Ulrich Stockmann and Danish Green Margrete Auken said they were pleasantly surprised by voters' enthusiasm and the high turnout - estimated at 70%.
Drawing parallels with elections in Ukraine, Fiona Hall a British Liberal noted that "In the orange-branded Commission Electorale Indépendante (CEI), the Congo has achieved its own orange revolution".
A country emerging from war
The Democratic Republic of Congo has, since 1996, been embroiled in Africa's bloodiest war. At its height it involved 9 African nations and 20 armed factions and destabilised the entire great lakes region of Africa. By the time of the ceasefire in 2002, an estimated 3.8 million people had died. Decades of neglect and warfare had destroyed the country's infrastructure. With 80% of Congolese living in poverty, the tasks for any new government are daunting.
The European Union has significantly helped in the election process, funding most of the election, training several thousand Congolese policemen and providing a military force to ensure security for four months during the election period. This "EUFOPR" force involves 3000 personnel divided between Kinshasa, a force in neighbouring Gabon and a reserve in Europe.
They support the existing 17,000 UN peacekeeping force in Congo. EU members have donated €250 million towards the cost of the election.
Continued support needed to establish "democratic culture"
The European Parliament intends to send another group of MEPs to monitor the second round of elections in October. Support for the new Congolese Parliament will come through Congo's membership of the ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly (Parliamentarians from Africa, the Caribbean, Pacific and the EU). This should encourage trade and aid to the country. Another form of help will be bilateral visits between the European and Congolese Parliaments.
Emphasising the need for continued engagement, Mr Stockmann said, "We have to support the Congolese Parliament in establishing a democratic culture".
Before leaving Kinshasa, delegation Chairman Jürgen Schröder summed up the mood when he said that "people are tired of wars and transitional governments". Despite initial success he warned the West not to be complacent and lose interest as to "stop supporting Congo's transition process...would be disastrous."
