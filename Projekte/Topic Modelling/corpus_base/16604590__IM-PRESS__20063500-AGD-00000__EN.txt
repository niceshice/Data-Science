Transitional Justice is becoming an important concept all over the world, as societies try to find strategies to deal with past human rights abuses and prevent future abuses as well as find their way to peace, democracy, the rule of law and respect for individual and collective rights. This hearing looks at the concept and the strategies applied in Africa, Latin America, the Arab World and Europe and aims to better understand what consequences massive human rights abuses have on different societies, and how they can be prevented. Another objective is to see how these experiences and the knowledge acquired can inspire the policy of the European Union. Various speakers will present the examples of Peru, the Arab world, Rwanda and Bosnia Herzegovina.
