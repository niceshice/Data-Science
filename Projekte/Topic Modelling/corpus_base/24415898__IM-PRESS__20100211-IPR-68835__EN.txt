EP Vice President Libor Rouƒçek told MEPs that Thursday was the twentieth anniversary of Nelson Mandela's release from prison, recalling his role in the dismantling of apartheid and that he was the first winner of Parliament's Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought. He then gave the floor to Michael Cashman, chair of the European Parliament delegation for relations with South Africa, who paid a tribute on behalf of Parliament to that country's former President.
"Twenty years ago, Nelson Mandela was released from prison after serving twenty seven years of political imprisonment. The world watched as he took the final stretch on his road to freedom. It was a day that changed South Africa and arguably changed the world", said Mr Cashman (S&D, UK), speaking just before Thursday's voting session in Parliament.
"He founded a modern new South Africa. And that he did it with no anger, resentment and bitterness, displays he is a statesman head and shoulders above so many others. He is, I believe, a living example in that we are either imprisoned by our own history or liberated by it. With his liberation, he liberated a country and sent apartheid to the dustbin of history and led South Africa to a multiracial democracy. We salute him".
