Have you organised or participated in a project which helped to promote an understanding between people throughout Europe? Are you aged between 16 and 30? The European Parliament and the Foundation of the International Charlemagne prize are looking for youth projects in the 27 EU Member States. The projects can focus on the organisation of youth events, youth exchanges or internet projects with a European dimension. The new deadline for application is 14 February 2010.
The European Charlemagne Youth Prize will go to a project which promotes a European and international understanding, fosters the development of a shared sense of European identity and integration, serves as a role model for young people living in Europe and offers practical examples of Europeans living together as one community.
The best project will be chosen by a jury in each of the 27 EU Member States and representatives from each winning project will be invited to attend the award ceremony in Aachen in Germany on 11 May 2010, when an overall winner will be chosen. The overall winners will receive funding of between €2,000 and €5,000 for projects that are underway.
Last year a Hungarian youth project "YOUrope Needs You" was the overall winner of the Charlemagne Youth Prize. Through a series of secondary school workshops run by university students, this project uses informal methods to convey to teenagers interesting facts about Europe. The second and third prize went to projects from the France and Germany respectively.
