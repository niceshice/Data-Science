Mohammad Mostafaei, lawyer of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, attended a meeting of the EP subcommittee on Human Rights in Brussels on Thursday 14 of October 2010 LAWYER OF STONING VICTIM IN PARLIAMENT STRONGLY CRITICAL OF TEHRAN MEPs on the human rights subcommittee debated the situation of human rights in Iran this Thursday with Mohammad Mostafaei, lawyer of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, who has become an international cause célèbre after she was sentenced to being stoned to death. Mostafaei described Iran as a country with a "generalised lack of freedom" where "even blogging is considered a crime which is punished with a death sentence". He asked for international cooperation to help the victims.
Green MEP and Chair of the subcommittee Heidi Hautala reminded those present that Ms Ashtiani was condemned to stoning and 99 lashes "after an unfair trial in a language which she could not understand" and asked Mohammad Mostafaei about the human rights situation in Iran.
"Iranian law undermines human rights"
Mohammad Mostafaei said that "Iranian law greatly undermines human rights", with stonings, arbitrary detentions, execution of minors and massive executions. He also said there was discrimination towards women and some minorities. "There is even a form of slavery with women and children" and "information on the internet or satellite broadcasts are filtered".
He asked those countries in which human rights are respected to "work together and coordinate to help the victims of human rights violations". "Defending human rights is one of the most important issues that needs to be addressed by the world". He went on to say that "human rights are more important than the nuclear issue".
Other speakers underlined that Iran is not the only country in the world where human rights are not respected, citing Saudi Arabia and China.
Iran: opposition at least present in elections
The vice-chair of the subcommittee Janusz Władysław Zemke (S&D) considered that even if Iran's situation is bad, it "cannot be compared with that of countries like North Korea, completely isolated from the world", and noted that the opposition was at least present in the last Iranian elections. He asked Mostafaei if the general human rights situation has improved since then.
Mr Mostafaei reminded people that "after the elections, thousands of people protested the results, but the Iranian government can suppress the protests by using the country’s resources for its own benefit".
On 6 September 2010 the EP condemned the death sentence for Iranian Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani in a resolution supported by all political groups. MEPs urged the Iranian authorities to set aside the sentences imposed on Mrs Mohammadi Ashtiani and review her case.
Ashtiani's death sentence by stoning was lifted 2 days after the EP plenary condemned it. EP President Jerzy Buzek "cautiously" welcomed the news, but said "we will remain vigilant and want to have an open and full dialogue with Iran about human rights".
The Chamber also asked Iran to reconsider the case of Iranian-Dutch national Zahra Bahrami and to, either, grant her access to a lawyer and consular assistance or release her.
