Ron KORVER BXL (+32) 2 28 44659 STR (+33) 3 881 74903 PORT (+32) 498 98 35 88 EMAIL budg-press@europarl.europa.eu On Monday, the Budgets Committee started its work on the next year's budget with a debate on the general guidelines for the Commission's 2013 budget, which covers EU spending in the Member States, and a vote on the EU institutions' administrative budgets.
The budget for 2013 must focus on growth and employment, investing in small firms, youth, education, innovation and workers' mobility to get the economy going again, MEPs said.
In the context of continued challenging economic circumstances, the EU institutions should freeze their administrative budgets, they add. MEPs emphasise, however, the need to respect legally binding obligations and possible subsequent increases.
The draft budget will be ready by the end of April.
You can watch the full debate under the link on the right.
