Kolding, south-west Denmark, 7 June Election officials wait patiently for ballot boxes to fill up The long list of candidates reflected the diversity of views on offer to voters Danes voted in greater numbers than at the last Euro-elections, 59.5% voted Polish art student Zofia Szostkiewicz is this month's guest photographer with her photos of people voting in Kolding in south-west Denmark during the European elections. Currently doing an Erasmus study year abroad, Zofia sent us her reportage taken on 7 June as Danes went to the polls in record numbers. She told us: "I signed for the euro-elections so I could vote here. It was a great experience for me and I would like to share with everyone."
Thanks to all of you who sent us your photos - Italian Gabriele Trapani caught our eye in particular and his and all the other photos can be seen on the flickr link below.
Monday 22 June marks the end of the guest photographer project with the overall favourite being chosen by us. The person selected will then be invited to the constituent session of the newly elected European Parliament in July to take photos of the new MEPs and the atmosphere as a new term starts in Strasbourg.
