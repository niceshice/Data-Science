Opening the session Hans-Gert Pöttering expressed his condolences to the Dutch people after the tragedy of Apeldoorn. The flu epidemic, the 5th anniversary of EU enlargement, maternity leave and animal welfare were all debated Monday in Strasbourg. In opening the session, Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering expressed his condolences to the Dutch people after the tragedy of Apeldoorn after the attack on the royal parade on a national holiday.
The President also called for Iran to release US-Iranian journalist Roxana Saberi and deplored the recent execution of another young woman, Delara Darabi.
Flu epidemic: seed stocks for new vaccine by 11 May
Europe's Health Commissioner Androula Vassiliou briefed the House on Europe's response and preparedness for the flu epidemic. She expressed her hope that "on 11 May we shall have the seed stocks to give to the industry in order for it to begin production of the new vaccine" and called on people not to panic.
MEPs voiced their concern about the disparities between vaccine stocks in different EU countries. The World Health Organisation has raised the alert over the flu epidemic to level five - indicating human-to-human transmission in at least two countries.
Maternity leave
Debating a report on maternity leave which varies enormous across the EU many MEPs called for it to be extended to 20 weeks with at least 6 weeks being paid. Some Members on the right however argued that it would discourage companies, especially smaller ones, from hiring women.
Animals in science
The rights of animals - especially primates - to protection during scientific research was discussed. Based on a report by British Conservative Neil Parish many MEPs want testing to be allowed on some primates but under strict ethical guidelines.
A vote on these two issues will take place from 1200 CET Tuesday.
