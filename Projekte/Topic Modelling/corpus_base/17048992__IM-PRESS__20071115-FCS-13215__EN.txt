France embraces Europe: President Sarkozy greets EP President Pöttering, Tuesday
Read a day-by-day account of the November Plenary session in Strasbourg. The week saw French President Nicolas Sarkozy reaffirm France's commitment to Europe in a speech to MEPs. Members also backed the opening of EU land and sea borders in 9 states in December and called for aviation to be included in the EU Emissions Trading System by 2011. Separately the House called for a 50% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
Relations with countries that border the EU was the source of much debate. A report on the Union's "Neighborhood Policy" called for Eastern countries (which might become EU candidate countries), to be dealt with differently than Southern Mediterranean states. A report on relations with Ukraine called for the EU to establish a free trade area with Kiev and a resolution on the EU -Russia summit raised human rights concerns.
The week also saw a debate on globalisation with MEPs anxious that the benefits be set against the potential social costs. The week also saw the Parliament adopt a report a proposed Europe-wide Directive on soil. The report calls for public inventories of contaminated sites and to promote the sustainable use of soil to prevent soil degradation due to climate change. European Commission President José Manuel Barroso told Parliament his priorities for 2008 include managing migration, job creation and the fight against climate change.
Finally, in its traditional closing debate on human rights around the world and a subsequent resolution, Parliament voiced serious concern over the persecution of Christians in Africa, Asia and the Middle East.

Monday in Plenary: Soil protection, Sport in Europe, Aircraft emissions
Erosion of soil can lead to floods, landslides The Plenary session opened with Parliament's President Hans Gert Pöttering sending condolences to the families of those killed in the Finnish school shooting last week. He also mentioned the 10th anniversary of the banning of landmines - for which the Nobel Prize was awarded in 1997. He reaffirmed the Parliament's commitment to a world without landmines. The protection of Europe's soil from contamination, the need for more sport in schools and aircraft emissions were also discussed on Monday.
Soil - guarding against contamination and floods Action to protect soil in Europe was the subject of two reports debated in Parliament on Monday. The risks of contamination, floods, landslides, desertification and climate change were all cited as the reasons such a strategy is needed. The report by Spanish MEP Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines (EPP-ED) concerned the setting up of a legal framework including a proposal to set up public inventories of contaminated sites within the EU. The second report by Italian Liberal Vittorio Prodi concerns a thematic strategy for soil protection. It cites erosion and resulting natural disasters as some of the reasons soil protection is needed. Amendments were proposed aiming to give more flexibility to individual countries on how they put the directive into practice. Both reports are voted on Tuesday. The role of sport in education An own-initiative report by Hungary's Pál Schmitt (EPP-ED) for the culture and education committee states that physical education should be compulsory in school and children should have at least three physical education lessons a week. Among the facts presented in the report are:
14 million overweight people in the EU
Across the entire EU27, almost 1 in 4 children is overweight
400,000 new overweight or obese children per year
The average time that primary schools allocate to physical education has fallen from 121 to 109 minutes per week since 2002
50% of children have physical activities at school (Schmitt) Mr Schmitt, a double Olympic fencing champion, called the lack of physical activity at school a lifestyle problem. "It is important to exercise regularly. Physical fitness should be enhanced by schools and is important for children also to develop mentally". The report urges EU governments to carry out information campaigns, aimed at children from a very early age and their parents, on the need to adopt a healthy lifestyle, and engage in regular physical activity and on the health risks linked to an unhealthy diet. Emissions Trading Scheme - should Aircraft be included MEPs debated how aviation should be included in the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme. Against a background of a booming low-cost airline industry and increased business travel, they considered a proposal for the Emissions Scheme to apply to all European air traffic by 2010, alongside steep cuts in emissions.

Tuesday: President Sarkozy, Barroso on 2008, Schengen, Emissions
President Sarkozy: EU integration a "common will" Tuesday saw two Presidents address MEPs in Strasbourg. First French President Nicolas Sarkozy reiterated France's commitment to the EU and said "Europe cannot be just a machine". Commission President José Manuel Barroso said that job creation would be among his priorities for 2008. MEPs debated the Schengen zone - a few weeks before border controls fall in 9 further states. They also backed the inclusion of aviation emissions in the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme.
Sarkozy: "Europe is not just a machine" French President Nicolas Sarkozy used his midday address to "reaffirm France's commitment to Europe". He said that the EU cannot be just an "administrative and legal machine" and said that European integration was a "common will" between people who share a "common civilisation". He welcomed the new Reform Treaty as a political victory, stressing that Europe had chosen democracy allowing anything to be discussed. He said that "Europe must ensure it is not perceived as a threat to identities but as a form of protection". He called for a strengthening of European defence and a committee of "wise men" to examine the possible future course of the European Union. In remarks welcoming the French leader, EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering paid tribute to President Sarkozy’s commitment to the Constitution and the Reform Treaty. He also noted the French contribution to European integration, notably through the 1950 Schuman Plan. Barroso outlines Commission's 2008 work programme Mr Barroso welcomed the conclusion of negotiations over the Reform Treaty and said that Ratification would be vital. He told MEPs "it was now time to show citizens what the EU can offer in the run-up to the European parliamentary elections of 2009". Commission priorities for 2008 include: Growth and jobs, Sustainable Europe, Managing migration (especially action to combat illegal trafficking), Putting citizens first, Strengthening the EU's role in the world. Mr Barroso identified areas of "particular interest" for the Parliament that the Commission would pursue: Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs, climate change with an emphasis on mitigation, "greening" of Europe's transport, A small business act for SMEs, Legislation on consumer protection, Better access for justice for citizens, Improved regulation in Europe. MEPs will vote on a resolution on the Commission's work programme in their December session. Debate on Schengen: MEPs welcome opening of borders In the afternoon the House debated the extension of the Schengen system to nine new countries, which will mean no more border controls for land and sea borders by 21 December and air borders by the end of March 2008. It will also allow people from non-EU countries to enter the EU and travel throughout the zone on a single visa. MEPs generally welcomed the agreement but expressed their concern about the possible increase of cross-border criminal activities. Parliament's rapporteur, Portuguese MEP Carlos Coelho (EPP-ED), said the agreement by EU ministers marked "one of the greatest successes in the history of EU integration." He said however that "work is not finished yet", as there are technical steps some states still have to take to implement Schengen. Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini thanked the EP for its support. He said the Commission will try to facilitate the improvement of police cooperation and security controls in the Schengen area to prevent criminals from enjoying free movement and better opportunities to act illegally. See the press service for more on this subject. In Brief - Votes on Tuesday Emissions Trading: MEPs backed a report that calls for the aviation industry to be included in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme - its flagship anti climate change policy. At current rates CO2 emissions from aviation could double by 2020 and the airline industry is currently excluded from emissions trading. Sport in schools: MEPs backed an own initiative report calling for sport to be compulsory in all schools across the EU and for all children to have physical exercise three times a week. Digital TV: MEPs adopted a report on the pan-European switch from analogue to digital TV. There are concerns about the cost and the 2012 deadline set by the Commission.

Wednesday: Globalisation, Russia and Bali climate conference
Climatic meltdown; MEPs discussed climate change The economic and social aspects of globalisation and how it will affect people in the European Union was debated Wednesday morning. The day also reports on the problem of soil erosion in Europe and relations with Russia adopted in separate votes. Ahead of the December Bali conference on climate change, MEPs questioned the Council and Commission and stressed the need to succeed in negotiating a post-2012 framework on climate change.
Need for "fair" Globalisation The challenges and possibilities that globalisation present was the subject of a debate between MEPs and representatives of the Council and Commission. It comes ahead of the Bali conference where international action to build a post Kyoto future will begin. Thursday will see MEPs vote on a resolution on the issue. The draft resolution says that the EU is already a global player and has benefited from open markets. It also notes that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is up and running to provide compensation and financial help for those who may have lost their jobs due to changes in the labour market. The Parliament has already approved the use of the fund for redundancies in the car industry in France last July. Commission President José Manuel Barroso said that "globalisation impinges on all our lives" but should also be seen as "an opportunity for the EU to assert its values". Reaction of MEPs Taking up the theme of all of us being affected Joseph Daul for the EPP-ED group said that "globalisation is not an abstract concept, but a fact of everyday life". He went on to say that "globalisation must be fair, smoothing out differences among countries and improving the welfare of the poorest", stressing that the exploitation of children cannot be tolerated. The need for a social Europe was stressed by Martin Schulz of the PSE Group. He said that "Commissioners must acknowledge that a common economic policy needs to be based on social policy, including the yardstick of equality of rights around the world". Graham Watson (Liberal, ALDE) told the House that "India, China and Brazil have caught the wave of opportunity", while "too much of Europe fears the wave crashing over it...it is not citizens we need to convince, it's Member States." Following on from Wednesday's debate, Parliament will vote on a resolution Thursday. EU-Russia summit resolution: MEPs call for free elections MEPs adopted a resolution on relations with Russia that notes concern about human rights, democracy and freedom of expression in the country. It came following the EU-Russia Summit in October. Other areas of concern voiced in the resolution include freedom of expression and the rights of civil society and individuals to challenge the authorities. MEPs also called on the country's leaders to ensure free and fair elections for the Duma and the Presidency. The resolution also welcomed Russia's bid to join the WTO and initiatives towards visa-free travel between the EU and Russia. It also called on Russia to cooperate on international issues such as Kosovo and Iran. Strategy for the Bali Conference on Climate Change Ahead of the Bali conference Italian MEP Guido Sacconi (as author of the oral question) opened the debate with the Council and Commission. He said that "our aim to limit global warming to 2 degrees compared to pre-industrial era" and that to do this "an international treaty" is needed. He told the House that as Europe was responsible for 14% of total emissions "we cannot solve the problem on our own". Parliament's rapporteur, Finnish MEP Satu Hassi, (Greens/EFA) told MEPs that "we have to get all industrialised countries including the US, on board". She went on say that "we also need to get China and India on board: they need to adopt binding emissions targets". She finished her remarks by telling the House that "negotiating a post-2012 framework on climate change is "the greatest challenge faced by international diplomacy". European Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas said that the EU must set the tone and play a pioneering role; it has already begun doing so by way of proposals for revision of the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), capping CO2 emissions from cars and using renewables". MEPs vote on a resolution on Thursday on the issue which has been drafted by Satu Hassi for the temporary committee on climate change. Soil protection to prevent erosion, contamination The Parliament gave its first reading approval to the first EU directive on soil protection. MEPs aim to promote the sustainable use of soil, to prevent soil degradation due to climate change - or to mitigate and remedy its consequences. The proposed directive should end the fragmentation of EU soil policy. Parliament's rapporteur was Cristina Gutierrez-Cortines (EPP-ED). On Tuesday the EP adopted a report by Vittorio Prodi (ALDE) on behalf of the Environment Committee calling for a thematic strategy on soil protection. ITS - the end Also on Wednesday Parliament's Vice-President Edward McMillan-Scott (EPP-ED) announced the end of the "Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty" Group in Parliament as it fell below the required number of MEPs (20) needed to form a political group. This is due to the fact that Romanian MEPs in ITS left over alleged remarks made by Alessandra Mussolini about Romanian people. This group was formed in January 2007, bringing together MEPs from seven countries. Members of the group have described it as "right wing" and "nationalist".

Thursday in plenary: stock take on social reality and human rights
78 million EU citizens continue to live in poverty MEPS debated ways to fight poverty and ensure that less people are socially excluded Thursday. The importance of work as a way to avoid poverty and the importance of care facilities for young and old were underlined. In a closing debate on human rights around the world MEPs voiced concern over the persecution of Christians in the Middle East and the situation in Uzbekistan and Somalia.
"78 million EU citizens continue to live in poverty"
One of the key messages was that having a job is one of the most important factors in ensuring that people do not fall into poverty - and that they do not become excluded from society. British Liberal Liz Lynne, who drafted the report on "social reality stocktaking" said that "in 2007 it is a fact that 78 million EU citizens continue to live in poverty, 8% are suffering from in-work poverty and one in six citizens is living below the poverty line." She noted that in some EU members the gap between rich and poor is increasing.
MEPs also considered the question of minimum income policies - Ms Lynne would like to see Parliament push EU members to "allow a minimum income for all". The link between poverty and crime, housing issues, school drop out rates and illiteracy were also discussed.
MEPs voice concern over beleaguered Christian communities
In their traditional debate on human rights at the end of each Plenary session, MEPs debated the plight of Christian communities around the world. MEPs voiced serious concern about the proliferation of intolerance and repression directed against Christian communities, particularly in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. A resolution lists many cases in detail, in countries and territories including Iraq, Pakistan, Gaza, Egypt, Turkey, the Philippines, Sudan, China and Vietnam.
MEP's agreed on the need for religious tolerance and respect for differences, but also underlined that this religious tolerance should be put into practice by every religion in the world. Parliament also debated the situation of human rights in Uzbekistan and Somalia.
