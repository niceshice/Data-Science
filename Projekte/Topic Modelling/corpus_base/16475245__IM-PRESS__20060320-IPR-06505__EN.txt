The opening ceremony
European Parliament President Josep Borrell and Commission President José Manuel Barroso were joined on Thursday at the European Parliament by the President of the Spanish Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, and the Portuguese Prime Minister, José Socrates, to open an exhibition entitled "Portugal and Spain, 20 years of European integration".
President Borrell said: " Spain and Portugal represent the symbol of the success of the European integration process. A process that allowed them to overcome their dictatorships, strengthen their democratic regimes and modernise their societies ." He added: " The EU is the most original supranational creation of human history and a clear example of reconciliation and compromise for the whole world ."
The Presidents of the two EU institutions and the two Heads of Government celebrated the 20 years since Spain and Portugal joined the EU as a history of democracy and peace. Mr Zapatero and Mr Sócrates stressed the great improvements achieved by the two Iberian countries since their accession and renewed their commitment to the European integration process.
Mr Zapatero said, " Europe is our home ." He recalled that the first choice of his country after the end of the dictatorship was for Community membership. Mr Sócrates stressed the need to commit further on the European project to promote solidarity and common values among all Europeans.
The speakers also raised the recent announcement by ETA of a permanent ceasefire. President Barroso said the Commission would be following developments closely.
The exhibition, jointly organised by the European Parliament offices and the Commission representations in Spain and Portugal, with the support of the Association of European Journalists, the news agencies EFE and Lusa, and the two countries' foreign ministries, will be on show in Brussels until 9 May. Made up of archive news material, documents and artefacts, including 160 photographs, the exhibition charts the 20 year story of Spain and Portugal's EU membership.
The opening ceremony also featured 20 Spanish citizens born on 1 January 1986, representing the different regions of Spain, and a group of Spanish and Portuguese journalists.
