Lithuanian MEP Laima liucija Andrikienė will be part of a Parliamentary delegation to the UNHCR MEPs will discuss the EU's priorities for the forthcoming UN Human Rights Council Wednesday afternoon (24 February). On the 1-26 March agenda in Geneva are children's rights and the Goldstone report on the Gaza conflict. The possible election of Iran to the Council may also provide controversy. Ahead of the debate we spoke to Lithuanian Conservative Laima liucija Andrikienė, who will head Parliament's delegation to Geneva with British Socialist Richard Howitt.
You will be in Geneva 14-16 March for the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC). What are the main topics on the agenda?
Government ministers and high-ranking officials will talk about a number of important issues, such as the impact of the global financial crisis on the human rights situation worldwide.
The rights of children will also be high on the agenda with a whole day devoted to it, since this year we mark the 20th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, in parallel with another important topic - human rights in education and training.
The session will see the renewal of discussion on the Goldstone report - the much-discussed report on the conflict in Gaza and Southern Israel in 2009. As usual, different countries will come under scrutiny, most likely Myanmar, Guinea and Congo.
What is the EP position on Iran joining the UNHRC?
Iran has not yet officially announced its candidacy. On the other hand, there are signals that it might wish to run for one of the four newly vacant places Asian countries hold. It would be highly regrettable if Iran was elected as we already have countries with problematic human rights records acting in the Human Rights Council.
The Council would then risk becoming as defunct and inefficient as the UN Commission on Human Rights became before the Human Rights Council was set up. In other words, the credibility of the Council is at stake and we should therefore do everything we can to maintain its authority.
Does the EP delegation have a real influence in the UNHRC? Will the EU have a common position?
The EU is one of the most important players on the international stage when it comes to the defence of human rights. Therefore the position of the EU is highly important and listened to by everyone. The European Parliament and its members are the only directly elected representatives of almost 500 million citizens of 27 EU countries. Therefore the voice of the EP is important.
