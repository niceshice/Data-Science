Monday in plenary: airport charges debated
By 2010, 6 of the EU's biggest airports will be at capacity MEPs began the new year by discussing plans to establish common rules on charges at Europe's airports. EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering opened the session by saying the environment and climate change along with safeguarding Europe's competitiveness and jobs would be key areas for the Parliament this year.
Mr Pöttering welcomed Malta and Cyprus into the eurozone and said the swift ratification of the Lisbon Treaty by all EU members is the "main priority" for 2008. The opening phase of proceedings also provided a reminder of the case of Chinese dissident and Sakharov Prize nominee, Hu Jia, arrested recently by the Chinese authorities for "inciting subversion" in a move strongly condemned by President Pöttering. Irish MEP Avril Doyle (EPP-ED) took the floor to urge the Chinese "not to ignore the commitment they have made to the international community to improve the human rights situation". Airport charges Monday focused on a legislative report on airport charges by German Socialist Ulrich Stockmann. It sets out common principles for levying airport charges at Community airports. The directive aims to prevent any abuse of a dominant position in the market by individual airports and airlines subject to different pricing levels. The Parliament's Transport Committee argues EU rules are needed because not all states have a functioning, non-discriminatory and comprehensible procedure for calculating charges. In a bid to focus the measures where they are really needed, the Transport Committee recommends that the Commission's proposed rules apply only to airports whose annual traffic number is over 5 million passengers, rather than the 1 million suggested by the Commission, restricting their effect to 67 EU airports. Since the development of new airport infrastructure is becoming a major challenge in the EU, the rapporteur proposes to include the costs of improved infrastructure projects in the calculation of the charges. Other Monday debates The House on Monday also discussed the future of the automobile industry. The report by German Liberal Jorgo Chatzimarkakis says that research funding needs to be increased to meet binding CO2 targets in the car industry. A report by Transport Committee chairman Paolo Costa (ALDE) concerning the abolition of discrimination in transport rates and conditions in order to reduce the administrative burdens on businesses was discussed.

Tuesday in Strasbourg: consumer credit, children's rights, intercultural dialogue
MEPs debated the rights of children on Tuesday New proposals for consumer credit and an action plan on children's rights were discussed by MEPs on Tuesday. The credit proposals aim to make it easier to get credit from another country although there were differences between MEPs over the details of the proposals. This is the year of intercultural dialogue and the Grand Mufti of Syria, Ahmad Badr Al-Din Hassoun, addressed MEPs at midday with a message of peace and tolerance between peoples of different faiths.
EU-wide consumer market under the spotlight New rules on obtaining credit were discussed ahead of a vote on Wednesday. The proposed legislation aims to create a Europe-wide market in credit - at present people primarily borrow from banks and credit companies based in their own countries. This leads to large differences in how much interest people pay. The new rules cover loans from €200 to €75,000, but do not cover mortgages. The proposals deal with the amount of information that lenders must make available as well as the amount people must pay in penalties if they pay off a loan early. In what is expected to be a close result MEPs will vote Wednesday at 1200 CET. In the debate MEPs stressed the need for trustworthy and clear information that is standardised across the Union. Parliament's rapporteur on the issue, Kurt Lechner said that "confidence of the consumer is vital in this area". Right of children to be protected The rights of children and what strategy the European Union should take to safeguard them was debated in Strasbourg on Tuesday. The rise of paedophiles using the internet to contact children and exchange child pornography was a particular cause for concern. Efforts to work with credit card companies to stop people buying child pornography and blocking access to certain sites were among the measures discussed in the report by Roberta Angelilli (UEN). In the debate Ms Angelilli stressed that the rights of children should be considered "in all aspects of child policy". Hungarian MEP Kinga Gál spoke of the need to prevent poverty and discrimination - both of which undermine children's rights. Swedish Socialist MEP Inger Segelström said all children should be covered by EU legislation and each EU country had a responsibility to prevent human trafficking. Estonian Liberal Siiri Oviir called the protection of children's rights "the basis of the society of tomorrow". Grand Mufti of Syria speaks to MEPs on intercultural dialogue Speaking to MEPs on intercultural dialogue, the Grand Mufti of Syria, Ahmad Badr Al-Din Hassoun, called for peace and tolerance between cultures and religions. He told the House that there is only one civilisation, that of mankind. He said "that religions - whether Christianity, Judaism or Islamism - have given culture its moral values, by placing the Supreme Being, holiness and human dignity at the centre of everything. He rejected the idea of a holy war, saying "peace is holy". Welcoming the Grand Mufti Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering said "tolerance is central to intercultural dialogue. But tolerance does not mean indifference. Tolerance means defending one's views, hearing out others and respecting their convictions". Other issues: Airports, CO2 emissions, Naples rubbish
MEPs voted for new guidelines on airport charges. Members voted to boost research on CO2 emissions from cars. MEPs heard a Commission statement about the rubbish collection crisis in Naples and the surrounding district A child's right not to be exploited online Angelilli´s draft report The European year of intercultural dialogue Consumer credit legislation heads for Parliamentary vote
Wednesday in Plenary: Slovenian Presidency, Kenya and Pakistan
Protests in Kenya: protestors lay down the law The fight against climate change and resolving the status of Kosovo are among the priorities that Slovenia's Prime Minister Janez Janša laid out to MEPs Wednesday for his country's Presidency of the EU. Ahead of a resolution on Thursday MEPs also debated the crisis in Kenya with condemnation of the violence and a call for fresh elections. Ahead of a visit by President Musharraf to the EP's foreign affairs committee next week the House debated the situation in Pakistan.
Mr Janša contrasted the position that people in Slovenia find themselves in now with that under Communism. In particular he spoke of the ability to travel freely around the European Union as the country has just joined the Schengen area. As well as energy, the fight against climate change and resolution of the Kosovo impasse he stressed the need for a "free flow of knowledge". He told MEPs that his idea would be to make this the "fifth freedom" of the EU after free movement of goods, services, people and capital. In this, the year of intercultural dialogue, he pledged to push forward this agenda. Kenya - MEPs call for elections but EU aid should continue says Commission Recent turmoil in Kenya following disputed Presidential elections was on the agenda Wednesday afternoon. There was a general call for fresh elections and for both presidential candidates to try and resolve the crisis. MEPs condemned the violence in which scores of people have been killed. Kenya is a recipient of large scale EU aid and in the debate the Commissioner for development and humanitarian aid Louis Michel said this should continue - otherwise the ordinary people of Kenya would suffer even more. Pakistan - condemnation for Bhutto murder, call for elections The instability in Pakistan following the murder of Benazir Bhutto was also debated by MEPs on Wednesday. Ahead of the visit of the country's President Musharraf to Parliament next week, members from across the House called for elections and stressed the importance of ensuring they are free and fair. Members also called for the EU to continue to support the people of Pakistan and stressed the importance of the country as an ally in the war on terrorism Slovenia takes over EU presidency: prime minister addresses European Parliament EU Election Observation Mission to Kenya Children’s rights Consumer credit
Thursday in Plenary: Women in Industry, Internet forum, Human Rights
Chinese dissident Hu Jia MEPs considered how to get more women working in industry on Thursday. With only 14% of Europe's industrial workforce being female, a report called for steps to make industry more accessible for women. The afternoon saw the House debate the arrest of a Chinese dissident, war crimes in the Democratic Republic of Congo and human rights in Egypt.
Improving women's role in Industry
The women in industry debate was based on a non-binding report by Portuguese MEP Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL). It calls for equality of wages and career opportunities and wants maternity and all that it involves for the workplace to be considered a social value. It calls for every encouragement to be given to women to work in industry and all barriers to advancement to be removed.
During the debate Ms Figueiredo said "women are over-represented in some sectors such as the textile and food industry and are under-represented in leading-edge technology sectors which leads to differentiation".
Europe's Consumer Protection Commissioner Meglena Kuneva, called for "combating stereotypes in education". The original report from the Women's Committee proposed that companies would follow the Norway model and have a 40% quota of women in management boards, but MEPs narrowly rejected this quota proposal.
British Conservative Den Dover called for better, more flexible and portable pensions for women in view of their relative inability in practice to commit to employers for long periods due to domestic and family duties throughout their working lives.
Rio internet governance forum
The House debated the results of the second Internet Governance Forum (IGF) from 12 to 15 November 2007 in Rio de Janeiro. The IGF discusses a wide range of issues related to Internet Governance on a global level and makes recommendations to the international community on topics like access, diversity, openness and security. A delegation of MEPs leaded by French Socialist Catherine Trautman (PES)
A resolution on the IGF was introduced by 11 MEPs on behalf of 6 biggest groups. It calls for:
•the need to secure an open and independent Internet in the future...as well as freedom of expression •making the Internet more accessible for more people •encourages the organisation of a 'European IGF' before mid-2009 to reinforce the European dimension of the whole IGF
Resolutions on China, DRC, human rights in Egypt
MEPs condemned the detention of human rights campaigner Hu Jia and demanded his prompt release. They also urged China to allow greater freedom of expression to journalists and writers and to put an end to the harassment of Chinese human rights defenders. Hu Jia was nominated for the Parliament's Sakharov prize in 2007.
In the wake of 32,353 reported rapes in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2007, rape as a war crime and the discrimination suffered by victims, MEPs called on the international community to take urgent measures to punish sexual crimes.
Polish MEP Tadeusz Zwiefka (EPP-ED) said: "Even if EU has limited potential to intervene, we have to look at reinforcing financing, to offer medical, social and legal aid to the victims". Former EP President Josep Borrell (PSE) said "we have to...put pressure on the government, because it is not only the rebel groups, but also the government forces who do this kind of atrocities."
MEPs also asked the Egyptian government to improve democracy and human rights: to end all forms of harassment, including detention of media professionals and human rights defenders and activists and to fully respect freedom of expression.
