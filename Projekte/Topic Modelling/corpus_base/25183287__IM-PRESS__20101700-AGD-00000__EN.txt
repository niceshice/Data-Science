Discharge 2008. MEPs will deabte whether to approve the EU institutions’ financial management in 2008, while making recommendations on how to improve the way EU funds are spent. The Budgetary Control Committee suggests granting discharge to all institutions and agencies apart from the Council and the European Police College (debate Wednesday, vote May I session).

Airport security charges. Parliament will debate and vote on EU rules on airport security. The Transport Committee wants to insist that if Member States impose more stringent procedures than those agreed jointly at EU level, the additional costs should be paid from government budgets, rather than passed on to consumers (debate Monday, vote May I session).
