Brussels plenary kicks off with special round of votes
2010-05-03 - 11:31
MEPs will hold a special voting session at the beginning of the coming Brussels plenary - with an early start at 1.30pm - to catch up on the votes that should have been held at the last Strasbourg plenary. These were postponed owing to the absence of many MEPs due to air travel disruption caused by the volcanic ash cloud that covered large parts of Europe for several days. Most MEPs did manage to reach Strasbourg (408 of the 736 MEPs were present at the start of the session) but, with travel from some parts of Europe practically impossible and the presence of MEPs therefore geographically unbalanced, it was not considered appropriate to go ahead with the votes. This Wednesday's special voting session will run from 1.30 to 3pm. Votes will also be held at 11am on Thursday as usual.

US Vice-President Joe Biden to address MEPs
2010-05-03 - 11:31
US Vice-President Joe Biden will deliver a speech at a formal sitting of Parliament on Thursday 6 May, during a trip to Europe which MEPs hope will help achieve progress on several issues in EU-US relations. Mr Biden's address to Parliament comes almost 25 years to the day after President Ronald Reagan addressed MEPs, on 8 May 1985, to mark the 40th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in Europe. During his visit to Brussels and Madrid from 5 to 8 May, Mr Biden plans mainly to discuss transatlantic security issues and ways to improve EU-US cooperation on counter-terrorism. In recent parliamentary debates, MEPs have expressed hope that the visit will also help settle other controversial issues, such as the agreements on the transfer of European air passenger and bank transaction data.

SWIFT and PNR: Parliament to set out ground rules on data sharing with USA
2010-05-03 - 11:31
Following debates on EU-USA data sharing issues with the Council and Commission, MEPs will vote on two resolutions, one restating their conditions for approving banking data transfers to the USA for anti-terrorism purposes via the SWIFT network and the other setting out a blueprint for a standard Passenger Name Record file model. Parliament's consent is needed to approve both agreements. During the debate held in Strasbourg, MEPs highlighted the key issues that must be resolved before Parliament can approve the next agreement. These are the transfer of "bulk data" and the question of redress where personal data is misused. On transfers of air passenger data to the US and Australia, EPP, S&D and ALDE members spoke in favour of postponing Parliament's vote until the Commission presents the newly-announced "PNR package".
Authors of resolutions: political groups, discussions ongoing.

Airport charges: Member States should bear extra security costs
2010-05-03 - 11:31
All commercial airports to be included in this law Clearer pricing: passengers to know how much they're paying for security Aviation security measures that go beyond basic EU requirements such as body scanners should be paid for by Member States, not passengers, says Parliament's Transport Committee in a binding amendment which would substantially change a draft law proposed by the Commission. MEPs want national governments to bear the cost of any measures that are "more stringent" than common, basic EU standards and methods. Member States would remain free to decide how to share the costs of the basic measures already covered by existing EU rules (metal and explosive detectors, sniffer dogs, hand searches, liquid screeners) but would be required to foot the bill if they chose to introduce body scanners, for instance, which are not yet listed as a common EU aviation security method. These proposals are contained in amendments to a Commission draft directive being tabled by the Transport Committee for a vote by the full Parliament next Wednesday.
The committee also wishes to include all commercial airports in this directive, against the wishes of many Member States, who would prefer to restrict its scope to airports serving more than 5 million passengers per year.
In addition, Members strongly support better pricing transparency. They insist that passengers should be able to know exactly what percentage of the fare will pay for airport security.
Many EU governments are opposed to a directive that would require public financing of security charges, since they are currently free to apply their own rules: in most cases the airport authorities now pass on the security costs to airlines, which then pass them on to passengers.

Parliament decides on 2008 budget discharge
2010-05-03 - 11:31
MEPs will vote on whether to approve the financial management of each EU institution and agency in 2008, under a procedure known as "granting discharge". The Budgetary Control Committee has made recommendations to the institutions and agencies on how they can improve their budgetary management and is proposing that the discharge be granted to all except the Council of Ministers and the European police college. Once a year, Parliament scrutinises how the different EU institutions spend their money. Since November last year, when the European Court of Auditors presented its report for the year 2008, members of the Budgetary Control Committee have studied documents, interviewed Commissioners and directors and discussed how the EU's money was spent. The committee not only voted on whether to give the institutions discharge but also adopted resolutions with recommendations on how to improve EU spending controls. The bulk of the EU's budget, including agriculture and regional funding, is managed by the European Commission.

Animal welfare: step up inspections and increase penalties
2010-05-03 - 11:31
More frequent inspections and tougher penalties are needed to help enforce the next EU Animal Welfare Action Plan, says a draft resolution to be put to the vote on Wednesday. The current 2006-10 plan has been satisfactorily implemented but there is room for improvement, argues the resolution. A high level of animal welfare, from breeding to slaughter, can improve product safety and quality as well as benefitting all EU consumers, MEPs believe.
Parliament will be voting on a resolution drafted by Marit Paulsen (ALDE, SE) that assesses the EU action plan on animal welfare for 2006-2010 and calls on the European Commission to propose without delay an action plan for 2011-2015.
The resolution also asks the Commission to submit, no later than 2014, a proposal for general animal welfare legislation to achieve "a common understanding of the concept of animal welfare and the fundamental conditions applicable". However, this should happen only after existing rules are properly enforced, say MEPs.

Cancer: call for EU to support better prevention and earlier detection
2010-05-03 - 11:31
With one third of cancers regarded as preventable, the Commission and Member States should step up efforts in the fight against this disease, says a draft resolution by the Environment Committee. It also calls for further action to promote a healthy lifestyle and reduce environmental and workplace risk factors, as well as demanding increased EU investment in information and screening campaigns. The full Parliament's vote on the draft resolution this Thursday follows a Commission initiative for a 'European Partnership for Action Against Cancer', which has a target of a 15% reduction in cancer cases by 2020.

Lisbon Treaty: EP votes on letting 18 new MEPs take up seats
2010-05-03 - 11:31
Eighteen additional Members of the European Parliament could take up their seats during the current parliamentary term if the EP accepts a treaty change proposed by the Council. The increase comes about because the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty is supposed to raise the number of MEPs from the current 736 to 751. MEPs will also decide if a Convention is needed to discuss the treaty change. During the Lisbon Treaty negotiations it was agreed that twelve countries would get a total of 18 new seats in Parliament, while Germany would lose three seats. As all current MEPs will continue until the end of the ongoing legislature, the number of MEPs would rise temporarily to 754. For this to be possible, a Lisbon Treaty change is needed. If Parliament accepts this modification, it still needs to be ratified by all Member States before the new MEPs can take their seats. Parliament has the option of inviting them first as observers but no decisions have been taken on this.
The countries due to get the extra seats are: Austria (2), Bulgaria (1), France (2), Italy (1), Latvia (1), Malta (1), the Netherlands (1), Poland (1), Slovenia (1), Spain (4), Sweden (2), United Kingdom (1).

Electric vehicles: standardisation the key
2010-05-03 - 11:31
Electric cars could play a key role in the fight against climate change but EU standards are needed to speed up their development, according to MEPs from several political groups. In a debate with Council and Commission they will ask whether the EU should have a global strategy to explore existing alternatives, such as hydrogen fuel cells and more efficient batteries, or if the focus should be on technologies that are more viable in the short-term, such as hybrid cars and biofuels.

Fast-track funding to boost economic recovery of regions
2010-05-03 - 11:31
Regional development projects in the Member States worst hit by the economic crisis will get faster and easier access to EU structural funding, provided an agreement between MEPs and Council is confirmed by a plenary vote on Wednesday. As part of the EU's "anti-crisis" measures, advance payments are to be increased for projects that help create jobs in countries most affected by the downturn.
To respond to the economic crisis, EU institutions have agreed to speed up the flow of funding to regional development projects and simplify the structural funds' implementing rules. Job training courses, youth apprenticeships, public works and other initiatives should thus be implemented faster, and projects that might otherwise have been axed for want of national funding may now be pursued. To decide which countries are eligible for the increased EU advances from the European Social Fund and Cohesion Fund, objective economic criteria will be used to measure the impact of the crisis on Member States.
Rules on the "de-commitment" of funds will also be eased (for funds committed in 2007), to give Member States more time to spend EU funds. Member States are currently obliged to pay back to the Commission any funds that they have not spent within two years of the approval of their request for funding. The new rules will buy more time for projects not approved or implemented within the deadlines.

Call for full partnership between EU and Latin America
2010-05-03 - 11:31
Closer cooperation over issues such as political stability, climate change and migration should be the focus of the EU-Latin America summit in Madrid on 18 May, where the EU High Representative should play an active role, says a draft resolution by the EP Foreign Affairs Committee which also calls for a "full bi-regional partnership" between the two regions.
The new possibilities offered by the Treaty of Lisbon should be used to strengthen the regional partnership launched in Rio de Janeiro in 1999, says the committee. The EU is Latin America's second largest trading partner and the EU is the biggest investor in the region. The resolution looks at challenges facing the two regions such as political stability, illiteracy, climate change and other topics that have moved up the political agenda lately, notably regular and irregular migration.

EU-Canada summit: an end to Czech and Romanian visa requirements?
2010-05-03 - 11:31
Canada's visa requirements for Czech and Romanian citizens will be among the priorities highlighted in an EP resolution drafted ahead of the EU-Canada summit set for 5 May 2010. Other key issues are the negotiations for an EU-Canada trade agreement and the reconstruction of Haiti.
The EU is currently negotiating with Canada for a new trade deal, known as a comprehensive economic trade agreement (CETA). Canada is one of the European Union's closest and longest-standing partners. The EU and Canada are also set to play a major role in the reconstruction of Haiti. Canada holds the chair of the G8 in 2010 and will be hosting the next G20 summit.

Irregularities in EU budget spending fell from €1.024 million in 2007 to €783.2 million in 2008 but the Commission and Member States still need to step up their efforts to monitor the way EU money is used, says a draft resolution by the Budgetary Control Committee. It calls for improvements in the areas of VAT collection, the working methods of the EU anti-fraud office OLAF and Member States' reporting to the Commission.

Europeana on-line library should be expanded but copyright respected
2010-05-03 - 11:31
The EU's on-line library, museum and archive - Europeana - needs content from more Member States and further EU funding, according to a draft resolution by the Culture Committee. A separate resolution tabled by the EPP, S&D, ALDE and Green groups argues that access to the portal's material without downloading should be free but copyright must be respected.
The Europeana project, which has been running since November 2008, now contains about 7 million digitised works, including books, maps, film clips and photographs. MEPs support the goal of having 10 million objects in Europeana by June this year and call for a target of at least 15 million by 2015. They urge governments and cultural institutions to speed up digitisation and provide more files, especially audiovisual material. MEPs also argue that a substantial part of the costs of digitisation should be covered by a separate budget line in the next EU long-term budget after 2013.
According to MEPs, Europeana should fully respect intellectual property rights without creating any new copyright or privatising access to digital content. The draft resolution by the EPP, S&D, ALDE and Greens/EFA says that "viewing documents without downloading must be free of charge for private individuals and public institutions" and if there are any charges for downloads and printouts of copyright materials these "should be socially acceptable". This resolution would also delete a proposal by the Culture Committee to create a separate online space on Europeana where users can create content.

EU response to atrocities in Nigeria
2010-05-03 - 11:31
The recent large-scale communal violence in Nigeria will come under the spotlight at Parliament on Thursday, when MEPs debate the massacre that took place near Jos and a number of Christian cities in March. This is believed to have been carried out in retaliation for the atrocities in mostly Muslim areas in January when at least 200 people were killed and others displaced. The debate will be followed by a resolution.
The EU Council of Ministers called on the Nigerian government in March "to ensure that the perpetrators of acts of violence are brought to justice and to support interethnic and interfaith dialogue". The city of Jos, lying between the Muslim north and the Christian south of the country, is divided into Christian (Berom community) and Muslim (Hausa Fulani community) areas.

To make EU legislation less technical and less complicated, the Lisbon Treaty introduced a new streamlined system for delegating to the European Commission the power to make minor changes to EU laws. On Wednesday MEPs will decide their position on precisely how the legislative bodies - Parliament and Council - should delegate these powers, under what conditions and limits, and how the Commission's use of such powers should be monitored.

New strategies to help EU adapt to climate change
2010-05-03 - 11:31
To help the EU adjust to climate change, we need to understand the issues better, to mainstream adjustment measures into EU policies and to increase funding for this area, according to a draft resolution by the Environment Committee that looks at the Commission White Paper "Adapting to climate change". A separate resolution drafted by the Agriculture Committee argues that EU farm policy can help slow down global warming but that it needs to adapt to the risks created by climate change.

MEPs review European Investment Bank's work in 2008
2010-05-03 - 11:31
Did the European Investment Bank make the right response to the 2008 financial crisis? This and other questions will be discussed in Parliament's annual debate on the EIB's work on Thursday. After the debate MEPs will vote on recommendations suggesting how the EIB could improve its work, for example in fighting corruption, lending to small companies and supporting projects in non-EU countries.
The European Investment Bank is the long-term lending bank of the European Union. It supports projects in current and future EU Member States as well as in EU partner countries. In 2008, the EIB signed loans worth €57.6 billion, an increase of 20.5% compared with 2007. Scrutiny of the EIB's financial activities is a joint responsibility of the EP's Budgetary Control Committee and Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee. This year, the Budgetary Control Committee, led by MEP Tamás Deutsch (EPP, HU), has organised the review.
