2008-02-18 - 16:45
For a piece of EU legislation passed under the co-decision procedure to formally become law, it must be signed by the President of the European Parliament and the President of the Council of Ministers. They represent agreement between EU governments, through their Ministers meeting in the Council, and MEPs in the European Parliament - on a piece of legislation.
On Tuesday in Strasbourg Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering and the current President of the Council, Slovenia's Prime Minister Janez Janša will sign legislation on the European Aviation Safety Agency and the third postal directive, which will bring about the complete liberalisation of Europe’s postal services.
The EU's co-decision procedure gives the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers equal "weight" in lawmaking over about two thirds of all EU laws including the internal market, transport, consumer protection and the environment.
