In today's debate on the E. coli outbreak in Germany, many MEPs demanded a thorough investigation of what went wrong at EU level and in Germany. They stressed the need to compensate farmers affected by the crisis and to restore consumer confidence. Parliament sent a message of solidarity to the victims.
During the debate, several MEPs criticised the German authorities for a lack of communication and coordination; others said the EU was not prepared for this kind of crisis. MEPs agreed that in this very serious health issue it was of the utmost importance to find the source of the contamination and that lessons must be learnt to avoid any similar crisis in the future.
