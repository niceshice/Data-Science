Climate meltdown? Watch MEPs discuss water and global warming

Increasing scarcity of water for drinking and agriculture and the effect of rising sea levels on islands and coastal areas are just two of the likely impacts of climate change in the coming years. This is according to a UN report released on World Environment day last year. On Tuesday afternoon, MEPs scientists and climate experts looked at these and other questions related to the impact of global warming on the world's water supplies. See the first link for a full round up of the hearing.
The hearing on climate change and water has been organised by Parliament's Climate Change committee, whose task is to explore all aspects of global warming and look for areas where action can be taken.
Are we heading for climate meltdown?
In Europe glaciers on mountains retreated 50% between 1850 and 2000. The UN reports that a further 3ºC rise in temperature could see the Alps lose 80% of their snow. The UN estimates that 40% of the world's population could be affected by the melting of snow and glaciers in Asia. It is not however just the glaciers that are melting, the collapse of the Larsen B shelf in 2002 was a graphic illustration of the melting of ice in Antartica.
Spanish MEP Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines (right of centre EPP-ED) said ahead of the meeting that oceans play a "fundamental role in regulating the climate" and melted water "is changing the equilibrium of the oceans". She added that the “melting of snow in high altitudes and the increase of water in the oceans changes the microclimate" of a given region.
In a document prepared for the meeting Professor John Dracup said that due to the early melting of snow "we will have more water earlier in the year during the flood season when we don’t need it, and less water during the summer months during the irrigation season, when we do need it". Professor Dracup will speak during the hearing.
Less rain, more droughts, forest fires?
One of the key issues to be addressed is the trend towards less rainfall and the environmental and economic effect this will have. The UN's Habitat Agency has predicted that by 2032 60% of the world's population will live in areas of water scarcity. One of the worst affected places could be Sub-Saharan Africa - where water shortages could devastate food supplies and any chance of economic progress. It could also lead to large flows of migrants away from areas that are becoming uninhabitable.
In Europe the picture is also bleak. A consultative Green Paper prepared for the European Commission has predicted that by 2080 rainfall in the Iberian Peninsula - Spain and Portugal - could be less than half of current levels.
The forest fires in the summer of 2007 in Greece that killed scores of people and caused huge economic damage could be a harbinger of the future if rainfall decreases and drought become more frequent.
Water scarcity will also have a political impact. "The Mediterranean, Middle East, and Central Asian countries risk becoming the most intensive areas for water conflicts," according to Professor Riccardo Petrella.
Ms Gutiérrez-Cortines called for policy to be "developed dynamically and open-endedly" and said "the role of science is extremely important" in formulating action. She said she "was against rigid plans but in favour of strategies". She went on to urge people to think about how they live their lives: "We must also be open to new ideas of changing our habits of production and consumption. We must be open to adapting our very way of life".
