The latest Eurobarometer survey conducted for the European Parliament on "Europeans and the crisis" shows that a majority of Europeans are worried about the effects of the crisis on their personal situation, and more and more Europeans believe that the crisis is going to last for many years. Almost 27,000 Europeans were interviewed.
A majority of those who have already heard about the credit rating agencies (CRA) are in favour of the creation of a European CRA. A majority of the respondents of the Euro zone who have already heard of Eurobonds are in favour of their creation.
