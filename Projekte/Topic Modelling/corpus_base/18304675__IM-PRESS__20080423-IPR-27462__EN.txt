The resolution was adopted with 546 votes in favour 7 against and 11 abstentions.
Parliament calls on the Commission and the Member States to show leadership and conviction by agreeing to and facilitating concrete measures for the protection of biodiversity, both domestically and internationally. The report was adopted
The European Parliament urges (inter-alia) the Commission and the Member States to:
– ensure that the COP 9 decisions are geared to implementing the CBD's Programme on Protected Areas and to strengthening the implementation with a view to the 2010 targets, with particular reference to the CBD's Programme of Work on Forest Biological Diversity,
– financially support the LifeWeb Initiative aimed at matching voluntary commitments by parties for the designation and management of protected areas with voluntary commitments from donors for dedicated (co-)financing,
– consider that achieving conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity should be amongst the top priorities for COP 9,
– ensure the recognition of effective management and financing of protected areas and their network as a vital necessity, and the adoption of innovative and permanent financial mechanisms, as they contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity,
– carry out an EU impact assessment on droughts and water scarcity caused by climate change and its effects on wildlife habitats, highlighting the zones where migratory birds nest, and promoting international cooperation to protect migratory birds and the seasonal wetlands which provide them with water and food,
– ensure that COP 9 invites parties to begin a discussion and agree on common principles and criteria of good forest governance, building on the progress already made in various regional FLEG/T processes and the Amazon Treaty,
– ensure that COP 9 agrees that parties begin discussions to agree a global mechanism to regulate timber harvesting and trade for the purpose of combating illegal logging and promoting sustainable use of forest resources, and that COP 9 invites parties to adopt national legislation which prevents the sale of illegal and destructive timber and timber products on the market,
– ensure that COP 9 recommends that parties further integrate forest biodiversity aspects of climate change impacts and response activities into national biodiversity strategies and action plans (NBSAPs) and into national forest programmes and other forest related strategies, as well as support research to better understand the impacts of climate change on forest biodiversity,
– ensure acceleration of the implementation of existing commitments for better conservation and sustainable management of marine biodiversity with the view to protect marine biodiversity from destructive practices,
– ensure that COP 9 adopts a final decision to ban all terminator technologies (GURTS) and agree a moratorium on the environmental release, including field trials, and commercial use of genetically modified trees,
– ensure that COP 9 makes available the recommendations on marine and coastal biodiversity of the Expert Workshop mentioned above to the UNGA Ad Hoc Open-Ended Informal Working Group,
– play a leading role in the Meeting of Parties to the Cartagena Protocol to ensure a legally binding liability regime with a broad scope,
– ensure that COP 9 urgently addresses the negative effects of the production of biomass for energy, especially of agrofuels production, on biodiversity and on indigenous and local communities ,
– encourage and support certification schemes for sustainable forestry and other crops including biofuels and the planting of trees in cattle rearing areas.
