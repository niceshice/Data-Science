Learning to cope with natural disasters

The natural disasters of 2005 made a deep impression on MEPs, who have responded with various proposals and appeals for more preventive measures. In the wake of the serious floods in Romania, two new reports were adopted in committee on 25 April, paving the way for a wide-ranging debate in plenary in mid-May.
When MEPs resumed work in September 2005 following the summer recess, they commemorated the victims of fires and floods in Europe and then - on 8 September - adopted a resolution which led to three own-initiative reports, adopted in committee last week and this week, on the agricultural, environmental and territorial aspects of natural disasters.
Parliament prepared for these reports by sending fact-finding delegations to Germany, Austria, Spain, Portugal, France and Italy. In addition, a public hearing was held on 20 March. Also in March MEPs adopted a report by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL, EL) on civil protection and in May they will adopt a report by Rolf Berend (EPP-ED, DE) on the new Solidarity Fund.
For the agricultural and territorial aspects of natural disasters, see our press releases on the reports by Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos (PES, PT) and Gerardo Galeote Quecedo (EPP-ED, ES).
For its part, the Environment Committee adopted on 25 April a report by Edite Estrela (PES, PT) by 42 votes to 2 with 1 abstention. This report highlights the role of climate change in aggravating natural disasters but refuses to accept that nothing can be done. Instead it suggests ways of managing the countryside better, in particular forests, as well as technical prevention measures.
MEPs believe there is often not enough coordination at European level of the measures taken in response to disasters. They want to see more sustainable water management as well as awareness campaigns which would be conducted and financed by the European Social Fund or by specific programmes such as Forest Focus.
They also call on the Commission to co-finance the building of infrastructure and the acquisition of technological equipment for fighting forest fires. Examples would be satellites and other leading technologies for preventing, detecting and helping to extinguish fires. To combat floods and desertification, monocultures should be restricted and reforestation encouraged. The areas of the Natura 2000 network affected by fires or floods should also be restored using Community funds.
As many fires are caused not by natural disasters but by vandalism, MEPs want to see tougher penalties imposed for such crimes.
