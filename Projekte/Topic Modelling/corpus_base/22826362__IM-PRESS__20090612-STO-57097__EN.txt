Online this week: a look at the negotiations over who will be the next EP President As the dust settles over the electoral landscape we will be looking at the positioning taking place over the post of Parliament's President and also look at MEPs and political groups as they form themselves into political groups. These can also be seen on EuroparlTV this week. The next few days online also features interviews with a couple of new MEPs as we get their initial thoughts as they prepare to talk up their new jobs.
This week we also take a look at the Parliament's Information Offices in cities across Europe through the eyes of people who work in them. We'll hear about their daily work as well as the particular challenges they face.
As EU leaders prepare to assemble in Brussels for the European Council on 18-19 June, EuroparlTV looks behind the scenes as Parliament's President Hans-Gert PÃ¶ttering prepares to attend what will be his last such meeting on behalf of the Parliament. The full results of the Council will also be available on Friday.
The week also sees the main photographer from our "guest photographer" project being named as well as information about how to apply for grants for communication related to the European Union.
