The plenary session of the European Parliament is going ahead with a modified agenda because of the air travel disruption: most debates will take place as planned but the votes are postponed to the next session on 5-6 May. Parliament will debate the wider issues surrounding the airspace closures and their impact with Commission President Barroso on Tuesday.
EP President Jerzy Buzek told the House that a number of changes would be made to the agenda given that many MEPs were simply unable physically to be present.
Speaking after the opening of the session, Mr Buzek said: "The European Parliament plenary session is going ahead in Strasbourg. We have decided that due to travel restrictions there will be no votes. MEPs are fully aware of the dramatic consequences of the ash cloud. Many thousands of Europeans have been badly affected. There are dramatic economic repercussions for airlines. Jobs are at risk across Europe. The European Parliament has decided to debate this tomorrow - Tuesday at the earliest opportunity as a priority."
Changes to the Agenda
All the votes are postponed to the next session in Brussels on 5-6 May.
Tuesday morning’s timetable is now as follows:
0900 Aviation traffic in Europe – statements by Commission and Council, followed by debate
1100 -1300
Legislative programme for Commission – statement by Commission President José Manuel Barroso, followed by
debate
Coordination of humanitarian aid and reconstruction in Haiti – Commission statement, followed by debate
The session will end, earlier than planned, at the end of the night session on Wednesday. There will be no plenary on Thursday.
Condolences for train crash victims, commemoration of Polish air crash
President Buzek offered Parliament’s sympathy to the victims of last week’s Italian rail crash, and also thanked MEPs and staff for taking part in the commemoration in the European Parliament last Wednesday of the victims of the crash of the Polish presidential plane near Smolensk.
