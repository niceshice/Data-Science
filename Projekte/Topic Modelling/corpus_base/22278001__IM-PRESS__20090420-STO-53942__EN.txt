-Paul Gauzès pictured outside the EP hemicycle in Strasbourg a few minutes before the start of the discussion of his report in the chamber, Wednesday, 22 April Credit rating agencies are companies that provide opinions on the future creditworthiness of companies, securities or obligations. However, they failed to detect the worsening of the financial market conditions and to adapt their ratings in time. According to Jean-Paul Gauzès, author of new legislation voted in Parliament Wednesday, they contributed, partially, to the current financial turmoil. We asked him about the new laws.
What is the biggest change brought about by your report?
The first important change is that now the rating agencies will be registered, monitored and supervised. Until now, it was an activity that had no control. The second important point is that the notes used in Europe in the financial field will be made by credit rating agencies registered in Europe. There is one exception - it is in the case noted entities or products that are outside the EU. So, for the first time we have put in place the beginnings of a European supervision, a single point of entry for the registration of agencies. The European Commission will have before a legislative initiative in July 2010 to establish a genuine European supervision.
Is this a major reform or a revolution? It is a major reform and a revolution if you like. It goes in the direction of greater regulation of the market system. The agencies have played an important role in financial crisis, since it was wrong data that contributed to the confusion in financial markets.
You yourself have worked in banking before becoming an MEP. From a banking point of view, is that these changes have come in time, or are we would have needed before? Parliament had already, several years ago highlighted the need for regulation. At that time Parliament was not heard by the Commission, so it may just be a little late, but it comes. Now we have a regulation in Europe will be exemplary in this area and should influence international regulation, which will gradually develop
