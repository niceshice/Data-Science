The President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Poettering, met the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, on Wednesday at the EP in Brussels.
Following the meeting, President Poettering said:
"I very much welcome that the UN Secretary-General, Mr Ban Ki-moon has come to visit the European Union and the European Parliament so early after taking office. This demonstrates the importance of the EU, and in particular the Parliament, to the UN.
I am convinced that the European Union needs to have a strong voice and presence in international affairs. The European Parliament especially has always been a forceful defender of human rights and the dignity of the human person - an objective that we share with the United Nations.
At the occasion of this first meeting with Secretary General Ban Ki-moon we discussed a wide range of questions including the role of the UN as a mediator in geographical areas of special relevance for the Parliament, the Middle East and the dialogue of cultures. In relation to the Middle East, there was agreement to aim at a comprehensive solution for a lasting peace in the region which guarantees the security of Israel and of a Palestinian state."
