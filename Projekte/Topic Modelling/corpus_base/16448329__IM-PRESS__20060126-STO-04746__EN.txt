Court of Justice backs air passenger rights
Have you had problems with flights? Have long delays and flight cancellations upset your plans? A recent ruling by the European Court of Justice concerning compensation for passengers bumped off flights or faced with long delays could bring significant improvements. The Court lined up behind rules agreed by the Parliament and ministers which aim to provide better protection to passengers.
Paolo Costa, the Chairman of the European Parliament's Transport Committee welcomed the Court's decision, noting that the legislation has introduced big improvements to air passenger rights in the EU in the event of flight cancellation, denied boarding or long delays.
The rules to provide compensation to passengers were introduced in February 2005, but were challenged in the British court by the European Low Fares Airline Association (ELFAA) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which claimed the legislation was discriminatory and limits consumer choice. They asserted that in addition to unduly discriminating against air carriers when compared with rails, ferries and buses, the law also contravenes the Montreal Convention, the international treaty regulating the liability of the airlines in case of delay. The British High Court asked the EU court to rule on whether the legislation does infringe EU rules.
The airline associations got cold comfort at the Court of Justice, which ruled that "passengers whose flights are cancelled or subject to a long delay are in an objectively different situation from that of the passengers on the other means of transport in the event of incidents of the same nature." Moreover, the regulation is not at odds with the Montreal Convention as the former deals with "immediate compensatory measures" while under the latter "passengers may bring actions for damages by way of redress on an individual basis" after a flight has been delayed, the Court said.
Mr Costa said he hoped this would be the end of the matter and that the application and respect of the regulation by EU nations would mean there is no need to bring this issue to the Court of Justice again "in a case-by-case basis."
The rules force air carriers to compensate and assist the passengers in cases of overbooking, cancellation or long flight delays. The provisions can include meals and refreshments, telephone calls and in some circumstances even a hotel. The amount of reimbursement can be up to â‚¬600 plus a refund of the ticket and a free flight home.
