Parliamentary sessions always throw up a lot of emotions and images and here we try to capture just a few of them. From respectful reflection for the victims of terrorism to a few light-hearted moments waiting for the session to begin, this photo slideshow is a glimpse into the first March Session of the European Parliament.
As well as the emotion it also captures voting and the moment when legislation is finally signed into law by representatives of the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.
