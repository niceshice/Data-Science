Regional policy
Plenary sittings

A call for better policy coordination between regions bordering the Atlantic Ocean is the main plank of a resolution on a European strategy for the Atlantic region adopted by Parliament on Wednesday. MEPs urge the Commission to put forward by June 2011 a strategy that takes account of both maritime policy and territorial cohesion.
By June this year the Commission is due to present an EU strategy for the Atlantic, based on the findings of a public consultation concluded in October 2010.
In a debate with Maritime Affairs Commissioner Maria Damanaki on Monday, MEPs called for an approach based on cooperation between the EU and the countries, regions and communities on the shores of the Atlantic to tackle issues that transcend frontiers.
The strategy should cover a range of areas such as marine energy, environment, pollution transport, safety, security, research, leisure and tourism, according to the resolution, which was adopted by 589 votes to 26 with 54 abstentions. It should also include services and training in maritime professions as well as fisheries and aquaculture.
MEPs want the strategy "to work following a bottom-up approach, starting from local authorities and involving all stakeholders". They stress the need for "better spending of EU money, not increasing expenditure".
