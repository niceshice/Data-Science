Plenary 13-16 February: employment, food aid and Syria
Institutions
2012-02-10 - 16:13
Someone looking at a large map of Europe MEPs will during the February plenary session debate how to boost employment, especially among the young, vote on a food aid scheme for European citizens in need, and discuss the situation in Syria. Other topics include EP priorities for the European Council on 1-2 March, the upcoming elections in Russia and political developments in Hungary. In addition there will be a debate with Italy's Prime Minister Mario Monti on Wednesday at 1500h CET.
One of the main issues during the plenary from 13-16 February will be how to tackle youth unemployment, which has reached an unprecedented level in Europe due to the economic crisis. On Monday MEPs will ask the Commission about its plan to use up to €82 billion in EU structural funds not yet allocated to specific projects to help small firms and combat youth unemployment. The Parliament will also vote on three resolutions on Wednesday calling for more efforts on growth, employment and poverty.

MEPs in plenary Homeless people out in the cold
As several hundred people, most homeless, have died in Europe's recent cold spell, MEPs will press the European Commission to act on their September 2011 request for a strategy for the homeless. There are three million homeless people in the EU.
Preparing for the European Council
On Wednesday, Parliament will debate and present its priorities for the 1-2 March European Council, which is to assess the first phase of the "European Semester" economic coordination tool and progress so far on measures to escape the crisis.
Italy's Prime Minister Mario Monti in plenary
MEPs will debate economic developments in Italy and across Europe with Italy's Prime Minister Mario Monti on Wednesday at 15.00h. After Mr Monti, political group leaders will take the floor.
Situation in Syria
On Wednesday afternoon, a representative of the Danish Presidency will address the house, on behalf of EU High Representative Catherine Ashton, on the situation in Syria. A resolution will be voted on Thursday.
Recent political developments in Hungary
On Thursday MEPs will vote a resolution on recent political developments in Hungary, after their heated debate with Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orbán on 18 January. The text is likely to focus on Hungary's controversial new constitution, the laws implementing it and other measures taken by the Orbán government.
Elections in Russia
MEPs will state their views on Russia's December 2011 legislative elections, recent demonstrations and March 2012 presidential elections, in a resolution to be voted on Thursday.
Saving the food aid scheme for deprived EU citizens
Parliament is set to save the food aid scheme for needy EU citizens. If on Wednesday MEPs endorse a compromise reached with the Council, the scheme will run until the end of 2013, with an annual budget ceiling of €500 million.
Budgets in order but more effort needed on growth and employment
To achieve deeper economic coordination, Member States will need to act decisively on reform recommendations, and be seen to do so, says Parliament's response to the Commission's annual growth survey and employment guidelines. The three resolutions to be voted on Wednesday also call for more effort on growth, employment and poverty.
Redirecting EU funds to help create jobs for young people
On Monday MEPs will quiz the Commission on its plan to use up to €82 billion in EU structural funds not yet allocated to specific projects to help small firms and combat youth unemployment.
What next for Eurobonds?
On Tuesday MEPs will quiz the Commission on the progress of its green paper on Eurobonds and replies so far. Eurobonds could become a source of stability for the Eurozone in the medium term, but other instruments are needed to meet its short-term needs, says the draft resolution to be voted on Wednesday.

Opening: Saudi journalist faces death penalty, discriminatory Dutch web site
MEPs gather in the EP Chamber in Strasburg for the opening of February Plenary Session The fact that Saudi journalist Hamza Kashgari faces the death penalty for posting "blasphemous" comments on Twitter, and the opening of a Dutch web site to collect complaints against central and east Europeans, were criticized as affronts to universal and EU values by President Martin Schulz at the opening of the Strasbourg plenary session.
Saudi journalist Hamza Kashgari faces the death penalty for posting allegedly blasphemous comments on Twitter, noted Mr Schulz, who promised "to do everything possible to stop this happening", and reiterated Parliament's commitment to the universal value of freedom of expression.
Discriminatory Dutch web site
Mr Schulz noted complaints from many MEPs that the Dutch Freedom Party (PVV) had opened a web site to collect anonymous complaints about migrant workers from central and eastern Europe living in the Netherlands. The site had also been criticized by Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding, he added.
Although he had not seen the site himself, he promised to investigate the matter further, and to raise it with the Dutch Prime Minister at their meeting early in March.

Parliament saves food programme for the EU's most deprived citizens
Man tucks into a meal The "Food for the needy" programme will continue to supply food to the EU's most deprived citizens for two more years, thanks to a rescue plan agreed with the Council and approved in plenary session on Wednesday. The programme, on which 18 million of the EU's poorest people in 20 Member States rely, will run until the end of 2013, with a budget of up to €500 million per year.
"The current economic crisis, together with difficult weather conditions, has had a severe impact on the poor. Nearly 18 million homeless, unemployed, elderly or handicapped people, but also large families and single parents, benefit from the programme today. It is good that the EU remembers them. But the most important task is to ensure that the programme will continue to provide food to poor and needy EU citizens also after 2014", said Parliament's rapporteur Czesław Adam Siekierski (EPP, PL). "Keeping the programme on track with proper funding until the end of 2013 is an important achievement", said Agriculture Committee chair, Paolo de Castro (S&D, IT), "but this is not the end of the story. We will keep up our political pressure to make sure that the EU continues to show solidarity to the weakest of our society also beyond 2013, especially so in the times of severe economic crisis". The new rules, approved by the Parliament without a vote, will apply retroactively from 1 January 2012, enabling the programme to continue until the end of 2013, with a budget ceiling of €500 million per year. Background The scheme for distributing free food to the EU's most deprived citizens, set up in 1987 under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), currently provides food aid for 18 million people living in poverty in 20 EU Member States. The free food originally came from CAP intervention stocks, but as these were reduced, the scheme came increasingly to rely on market purchases, just as the global economic crisis caused a sharp increase in the number of citizens in need. However, in April 2011 the EU Court of Justice ruled that the scheme could only use food from intervention stocks. If no action were taken, funding for the scheme would have to be reduced to €133 million in 2012, from €500 million in 2011. To avoid a sharp cutback in food aid at a time when the number of needy EU citizens is rising, Parliament called in a July 2011 resolution for a transitional solution to save the scheme. A proposed update of the regulation, which would make it possible for the scheme to purchase food on the market, had remained blocked in the Council until November 2011, when Germany agreed to back the scheme's continuation, with proper funding, until the end of 2013.

Eurobonds and shorter-term solutions needed for Eurozone stability
Greek euro coin ©Belga/DPA Eurobonds will be a source of stability for the Eurozone in the medium term, but only when its remaining design issues are resolved, said Parliament in a resolution voted on Wednesday. At the same time, other financial instruments must be put in place rapidly to meet the bloc's short-term needs, such as the redemption pact proposed by the German Council of Economic Advisers, it added.
On Tuesday the Commission was questioned in plenary on the responses received so far to the green paper on introducing "stability bonds". Questions still open on green paper The resolution welcomes the Commission's green paper but also notes that further work is required on some issues. These would include specific ways of addressing potential moral hazard, making the system attractive for AAA countries as well as heavily indebted ones, increasing competitiveness, and introducing enforceable debt reduction systems. Eurobonds for Eurozone longevity The resolution does not claim that Eurobonds are a quick fix for the current difficulties. It does however argue that they are an important component of medium-term solutions. The resolution also acknowledges that for the common issuance of bonds, stronger fiscal coordination, aimed both at better economic governance and growth, is needed. To tackle immediate difficulties, the resolution calls on the Commission rapidly to table proposals "to address decisively the current crisis, such as the European redemption pact proposed by the German Council of Economic Experts (...), the finalisation and ratification of a European Stability Mechanism treaty (...), eurobills as well as joint management of sovereign debt issuance". The resolution was passed with 515 votes in favour, 125 against and 52 abstentions. Next steps The Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee is now preparing an own-initiative resolution, under the stewardship of Sylvie Goulard (ALDE, FR), which will provide a more detailed reaction to the Commission's green paper.

Beyond the cuts: MEPs debate growth for Greece and wider EU
MEPs vote in the EP chamber in Strasbourg on The upcoming EU summit on 1-2 March must address growth, said MEPs debating with Council and Commission in Strasbourg this morning. Many MEPs across the political spectrum expressed scepticism and concern regarding the latest wave of austerity measures in Greece, initiated by a European Commission, ECB and IMF "Troika".
"The March summit will not be business as usual," said Danish Minister for European Affairs Nicolai Wammen. He said that the European semester and recently adopted 'six-pack' for economic governance should accelerate structural reforms and create "competitiveness, employment and a greener economy."
Representing the European Commission, Maroš Šefčovič warned, "Growth is at a standstill". He paid special attention to youth unemployment and said the Commission would visit the eight most affected countries to see how to make better use of EU funds.
Confidence is the foundation of both financial markets and the EU itself, said EPP Group Chairman Joseph Daul. Tax burdens on businesses should be relaxed in return for commitments to recruit more young people, he suggested. "We need better Euro governance and to avoid contradicting declarations", he said, referring to Commissioner Neelie Kroes' recent statement that the Euro would survive without Greece.
Challenged on the Commission's position, Mr Šefčovič said "The Commission is Greece's best ally" and underlined "We want Greece to remain a member of the Euro area".
"The Troika is aggravating the situation in Greece... and leaving no room for social dialogue", said S&D President Hannes Swoboda, who warned that cuts in the minimum wage will mean more recession and more poverty.
"The Greek government promised much but delivered little", said Alexander Graf Lambsdorff (ALDE, DE). He called for reforms to the tax system and for ports and the energy sector to be privatised because "the Greek state is just too big".
But Greens/EFA Co-President Daniel Cohn-Bendit rejected the suggestion that Greece had been inactive, given the previous waves of austerity measures. He compared the Troika to a "neoliberal Taliban" and criticised that it had insisted on cuts to pensions instead of to the defence budget, as proposed by the Greek government. The Commission's 2020 Strategy, in his view, is beginning to look like "a fairytale".
"EU summits are becoming a political ritual", said ECR President Martin Callanan, who believes that austerity is failing to win confidence of economists or markets. He said nobody believed the measures in Greece would work, even the members of parliament who had voted for them last Sunday. He argued that economic reform in the long term is essential but that in the short term only a default and devaluation would salvage something from the Greek economy.
Imposed cuts and financial speculation are worsening the situation, said GUE/NGL Group President Lothar Bisky. "We need sustainable growth", he said, and called on the ECB to allow countries to benefit from more favourable interest rates.
Greece is run through the Troika, not a democracy, said EFD President Nigel Farage. He pointed to the contracting Greek economy in a "death spiral" and said that far from addressing key problems such as youth unemployment, the Troika's policies were driving Greece towards a revolution. Greece should get the drachma back, he concluded. Video recording of debate (click on 15.02.2012)
Yes to budgetary control, but action is also needed on growth and employment
Employment office in Germany ©Belga/AFP Deeper economic policy coordination will require Member States to act on structural reform recommendations and also improve transparency, says Parliament's reaction to the Commission's annual growth survey and employment guidelines. The resolutions adopted on Wednesday also call for more effort on growth, employment and poverty.
Speaking ahead of the vote Jean-Paul Gauzès (EEP, FR), rapporteur on the Annual Growth Survey (AGS), said: "We want Member States to implement the structural reforms to which they have committed themselves. This reform policy should not become a dead letter". Marije Cornelissen (Greens, NL), rapporteur on the employment and social aspects of the AGS, said: "There is a friction between fiscal policy and employment policy but we have to ensure more coherence between the two. There is a way to address both, through better economic governance". Pervenche Berès (S&D, FR), rapporteur on the employment guidelines said, "The EP wants to strike a balance between the goals of the EU2020 strategy and the Stability and Growth Pact. Member States are currently placing too much emphasis on the Stability and Growth Pact, to the detriment of growth and investment". Budget cuts alone do not restore economies or confidence Budgetary, growth and employment measures need to be taken together, say all the resolutions. For example, the AGS resolution says that the Commission's roadmap "overlooks the need to take urgent action to support short-term activity and employment". The need to build confidence among investors, consumers and citizens is also stressed by the resolutions, which argue that the Commission's AGS document does too little to address it. The AGS resolution emphasises that democratic legitimacy and national ownership need to be substantially increased to step up the pace of economic reforms. It asks the Commission to shed more light on what Member States are doing and not doing as regards implementing the reform recommendations they receive. The resolution underlines that limited implementation of these reform recommendations will stall growth. The same resolution also says banks should be made to lend more to the real economy and calls for legislative proposals on bank crisis management before the summer. Employment and social aspects The resolution on the social and employment aspects of the AGS calls on the European Council to ensure that fiscal consolidation does not increase poverty or hamper efforts to tackle unemployment and in particular youth unemployment. MEPs propose introducing, in cooperation with the social partners, a Youth Guarantee scheme to secure the right of every young person to be offered a job, an apprenticeship or training after four months of unemployment. Furthermore, they call on the European Council to set up a tax on financial transaction. In the same resolution, MEPs also express their concerns about Member States' commitments as set out in national reform programmes, which they say are insufficient to achieve the Europe 2020 headline targets for employment, education and poverty reduction.

Hungary should respect the EU's basic values, say MEPs
The Hungarian parliament building in Budapest Parliament will draw up a report on whether EU laws and values are respected in Hungary, it decided on Thursday. Further to this report, it will then decide whether to activate EU Treaty Article 7, which is used to investigate a clear risk of a serious breach of EU common values. Its resolution also calls on the European Commission to monitor closely the changes to some of Hungary's laws and how it puts them into practice.
The Hungarian authorities should comply with the recommendations, objections and demands of the Commission, the Council of Europe and the Venice Commission and amend the laws concerned, respecting the EU's basic values and standards, says the resolution, tabled by the S&D, ALDE, Greens/EFA and GUE/NGL groups and approved with 315 votes in favour, 263 against and 49 abstentions. The European Parliament expresses its "serious concern" about Hungary with regard to the exercise of democracy, the rule of law, the protection of human and social rights, the system of checks and balances, and equality and non-discrimination. Parliament also instructs the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, in cooperation with the Commission, the Council of Europe and the Venice Commission, to follow up how Commission and Parliament's recommendations have been put into practice and to present its findings in a report. What needs monitoring? MEPs call on the Commission to monitor closely any amendments to and the enforcement of the Hungarian legislation, as well as its compliance with the letter and spirit of the EU treaties. The Commission should conduct a thorough study to ensure: - the full independence of the judiciary, - that the regulation of the Hungarian National Bank abides by EU legislation, - that the institutional independence of data protection and freedom of information is restored and guaranteed, - that the right of the Constitutional Court to review any legislation is fully restored, including the right to review budgetary and tax laws, - that media freedom and pluralism is guaranteed by the letter of the Hungarian Media Law and the way in which it is put into practice, - that the new electoral law meets European democratic standards and respects the principle of political alternation, - that the right to exercise political opposition in a democratic way is ensured both within and outside institutions, and - that the law on churches and religious denominations respects the basic principle of freedom of conscience and refrains from subjecting the registration of churches to the approval of a two-thirds majority in the Hungarian Parliament. Parliament also instructs the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, in cooperation with the Commission, the Council of Europe and the Venice Commission, to follow up how Commission and Parliament's recommendations have been put into practice and to present its findings in a report. Activating article 7? MEPs call on the Conference of Presidents (EP President and leaders of the political groups) to consider, on the basis of the Civil Liberties Committee report, to activate the necessary measures, including EU Treaty article 7.1, which is used in the event of a clear risk of a serious breach of EU common values. Background The new Hungarian constitution was approved by its Parliament on 18 April 2011 and entered into force on 1 January 2012. The resolution notes that the cardinal laws passed to implement it raised concerns with regard to the independence of the judiciary, the central bank and the data protection authority, fair conditions for political competition and political alternation, subjecting the income tax system to a two-thirds majority and giving the current majority exclusive rights to appoint officials for an unusually long term. On 17 January 2012 the European Commission started infringement procedures against Hungary with regard to the independence of the central bank, the lowering of the mandatory retirement age of judges from 70 to 62 years old, and the independence of the data protection authority. The Commission also asked the Hungarian authorities for further information on the independence of the judiciary. The Hungarian government was given one month to respond.

Credit transfers could soon become as easy as domestic payments
Finnish MEP Sari Essayah (Photo courtesy of the MEP) Making bank payments across the EU can often be bothersome and costly, however new rules to be discussed by MEPs today could soon change all that. If the report gets approved, eurozone banks would be required to treat credit transfers as nearly the same as domestic payments from 1 February 2014 on. This should make them cheaper, faster and safer . We spoke to Finnish MEP Sari Essayah, who is responsible for steering the legislation through Parliament.
Her report on upgrading the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), which will be voted on tomorrow, reflects the deal struck between the Parliament and member states in December, which promises to streamline cross-border payments and make them almost indistinguishable from domestic transfers. The Christian Democrat MEP said both consumers and companies would be able to enjoy the advantages. "If a person is working abroad, she or he does not need a new bank account in that country, but may receive her or his salary to the one bank account in his/her home country. Or having a villa in Spain and a direct debit for water and electricity, the payments could be made from a bank account in one's home country. Also companies benefit from not needing more than one bank account in the whole Europe for each payment purpose." She continued: "Easy payments make it also very easy to buy goods and services via Internet from all over EU and thus a citizen has real options to compare prices and get the best price. Buying a computer from the cheapest e-retailer may save hundreds of euros, and thus prices are forced down everywhere in the market. SEPA is in many ways essential for a well functioning internal market, since one has to make payments in every case." Opening up competition in the payments sector could boost the European economy by at least €123 billion over six years and this could climb to even €300 billion, according to the impact assessment published by the Commission. Mrs Essayah commented: "In the case of credit transfers or direct debits the payment costs are mainly included in the yearly payment for one's bank account. In the long run these payments should also become cheaper through competition. As these costs, however, cannot be openly seen by consumers, the effect of reducing these costs may also not be openly seen, although the savings could potentially be significant." SEPA covers 32 European countries. In addition to countries that have the euro as their currency, it also includes non-EU countries such as Switzerland, Norway, Monaco, Iceland and Liechtenstein. According to the report, banks in non-Eurozone countries member states will have until 31 October 2016 to comply The new payment system will rely on the sole use of the internationally recognised IBAN number to identify citizens' unique payment accounts in EU. The current need for bank customers to supply a bank-identifier "BIC" code will be phased out. In addition consumers may instruct their banks to limit direct debit collection to a certain amount or period.

MEPs call for Eurobonds to be used
Greek euro coin MEPs have called Eurobonds a source of stability for the Eurozone in the medium term in a resolution approved on Wednesday. The resolution also welcomes the European Commission's green paper on Eurobonds, which was published last year in response to several Eurozone countries having to pay high interest rates to borrow on the international markets. But what are these bonds actually all about?
A bond is a debt contract, under which an investor agrees to loan money to a company or a government in exchange for a predetermined interest rate. If the investor believes there is a risk that the borrower could have difficulties paying back the loan, they will charge a higher interest rate on the loan. Indebted euro zone countries with fragile economies have to pay considerably higher interest rates meaning it is more expensive to borrow money, which makes it harder to finance the state budget and repay debts. Last year the Commission presented a green paper looking at the possibility of introducing shared eurobonds or stability bonds from euro zone members. Commonly issued eurobonds would mean a pooling of sovereign issuance among member states and the sharing of associated revenue flows and debt servicing costs. The introduction of eurobonds is expected to: create new means through which struggling member states can finance debt, by offering safe investment opportunities for lenders and investors allow indebted members to benefit from stronger credit worthiness lower average borrowing costs lead to a significant deepening of Economic and Monetary Union and make the euro zone system more resilient as a whole by reinforcing financial stability strengthen the position of the euro as an international reserve currency However a group of top rated euro zone economies (Germany, the Netherlands and Finland) , which currently benefit from very low interest rates on state bonds due to their safe haven status, fear that the introduction of eurobonds would mean higher borrowing costs. They argue that the main structural problem to be tackled in the short term is to ensure balanced state budgets throughout the euro zone. MEPs: Stronger fiscal discipline a precondition for eurobonds The Economics Committee welcomes the plan to introduce eurobonds, but emphasises that the final proposal must make the system attractive for triple A-countries as well as heavily indebted ones and introduce enforceable debt reduction systems for euro zone members. It also says that stronger fiscal coordination and better economic governance is a "necessary precondition" for common issuance of eurobonds.

EU-Morocco agreement: boost to EU-Mediterranean relations or threat to family farming?
Lemon tree MEPs will be battling it out this afternoon over a controversial EU agreement with Morocco to liberalise trade in agriculture and fisheries. Supporters praise it as a chance to strengthen relations and stimulate the economy, but critics have dismissed it as a threat to small farmers. As MEPs prepare to debate it today and vote on it on Thursday, we gave two members on opposite sides of the issue the chance to explain why they feel so strongly about it.
The agreement already proved divisive when it was still being discussed by parliamentary committees. Although the International Trade Committee called for the agreement to be supported, French Green MEP José Bové, who is responsible for steering the legislation through Parliament, recommended turning it down to prevent it coming into force. Fellow committee member Cristiana Muscardini, an Italian Christian-Democrat, was one of those in favour. In addition two other committees were consulted on the issue: the committee for Agricultural and Rural Development was against, while the Fisheries one was in favour. The political groups backing the agreement (EPP, ALDE, S&D and ECR) have tabled a resolution, which takes on board some of the concerns of those who oppose it. We talked to Mr Bové and Ms Muscardini about the agreement Why do you think the Parliament should approve/reject this agreement? MEP Muscardini : This agreement represents a chance for Europe concretely to support the development of Euro-Mediterranean countries starting with Morocco, which has lately undertaken democratic reforms. It represents an open door towards the neighbouring countries which have been through the Arab Spring revolution. By approving this important agreement, the Union will start boosting the economic reforms necessary to create better, safer and fair trade areas in the Mediterranean. MEP Bové : The parliament should speak out against this new liberalisation agreement as it will have disastrous consequences for family farming in both Morocco, where they account for 20% of all employment, and in EU countries in the south, especially in Spain and France. This agreement will permanently reduce Morocco's capacity to increase its food autonomy. It will expose consumers in this country to speculation on the world markets for agricultural products. Who will benefit from the agreement between EU and Morocco? MEP Muscardini : This agreement would benefit both Morocco, by developing its agricultural sector through boosting exports and imports from Europe, and of course the EU, which will open its market to Mediterranean areas affected by the Arab revolutions, and which need investments and economic support to entrench democracy. European farmers would be able to trade and export their products into euro-med markets. Safeguard clauses will provide guarantees in the case of overloaded markets. MEP Bové: Instead of helping Moroccan farmers, the agreement will increase exports from the EU by 50% and from Morocco by 15%. Things are also very clear when you look at who will benefit. European companies that export cereals and powdered milk are waiting for this agreement to be signed. Large European companies involved in processed food will equally benefit from it. In Morocco some companies producing fruits and vegetables for exports will see their sales increase. So a handful of big companies on both sides of the Mediterranean will profit from it at the expense of family farming. What will be the effect of a possible approval/rejection of the agreement on EU-Morocco relations? MEP Muscardini : If the Parliament rejects the agreement, the Union will lose an opportunity to become a vital and key player in the Euro Mediterranean area. The agriculture agreement underlines our responsibility towards a country, our neighbour, which should be considered as an important door to Mediterranean markets. MEP Bové: Rejecting this agreement would make it possible to start up new negotiations on a new basis. But more generally speaking, I think this would be a strong signal to the Commission that it needs to change the way it involves the Parliament, especially during discussions earlier in the process. It should produce concrete and serious impact assessments on the economic, social, environmental and budget consequences of the agreements it is negotiating. It is no longer acceptable that the Parliament can only approve or turn down an agreement. The upcoming discussions for an agreement with MERCOSUR will be an early opportunity to see if the message got through.

EP endorses plan to free up frequencies for high-speed mobile internet
radio ©Wikimedia Mobile internet is set to hit dizzying speeds after MEPs approved today a proposal to free up radio frequencies for their use.
Under the plan member states will be required to open up more frequencies for high-speed mobile internet by 2013 to satisfy growing demand for wireless data.
Swedish Christian Democrat Gunnar Hökmark, who was responsible for steering the legislation through Parliament, commented: “We have ensured that sufficient amounts of spectrum both for coverage and capacity are made accessible in the EU to achieve the fastest mobile broadband worldwide." The MEP said the initiative could also prove to be a boon to European companies. “By this decision on radio spectrum policy we are taking the necessary steps in order to regain a European global leadership regarding mobile telecoms, with all the opportunities for European telecoms industry as well as for new services, new jobs and new growth.” Many devices in our daily lives make use of radio waves, such as mobile phones, remote controls and satellite navigation. They operate within a range of frequencies lying between 9 kHz and 300 GHz which is called radio spectrum. However, it is a scarce resource that can accommodate only a limited number of users. This limitation requires careful planning and management of radio spectrum to avoid interference. Today MEPs approved the first radio spectrum policy programme (RSPP) which will help to co-ordinate the use of spectrum for new services and technologies, such as “fourth generation” (4G) wireless networks (e.g., LTE and Wimax) that can reach up to 100 Mbps download speeds. According to the programme, member states will have to authorise the use of the 800 MHz band for wireless broadband by 1 January 2013 Currently, the 800 MHz band is used to broadcast analogue TV channels in most member states, but will be freed by the end of 2012 when all TV sets will be switched to digital. This so-called digital dividend will be assigned to superfast mobile internet, aiming to reduce data traffic pressure (due to growing number of smart-phones and desire for data-heavy services, such as high-quality video streaming) on currently used “third generation” networks, to contribute to bringing fast broadband connections to people in remote areas and to give a new impetus to wireless internet services across Europe. The 800 MHz spectrum band is more useful for 4G wireless services than frequencies above 1 GHz. This band is better at penetrating buildings and provides superior indoor reception and travels longer distances without losing strength. This is why it is cheaper to build a network around it using fewer masts. Although the management of radio frequencies remains a national responsibility, the EU has played an important role by coordinating policy and setting standards, especially in mobile communications. Radio spectrum coordination at EU level was essential in the success of the European GSM standard for mobile phones, which today is used by more than two billion people around the world.

Italian PM Mario Monti applauded in EP for his reform efforts
Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti addresses the EP chamber Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti received a standing ovation from MEPs when he spoke to them about the economic reforms in his country at the plenary meeting in Strasbourg. Most MEPs welcomed his speech and his work so far to put the Mediterranean country's economy back on tracks. Other speakers emphasised the need to promote growth alongside cuts and insisted on a European response to the crisis.
Mr Monti talked in his speech about the necessity of reforms and the need for Europe to play a role. "Italy is making important sacrifices, which are not imposed by EU, but because they are necessary for the future of this country, for our sons and daughters," he said. "Today's fiscal discipline has to be followed by a strengthened single market leading to a stronger economic union, which is the basis of the European project itself. Italy wants to get out of the crisis and to be, again, a key driving force in the EU project." French Christian Democrat Joseph Daul praised the Italian prime minister for the reforms in his country and his support for the European project. "I'm grateful to you for having done your utmost to oppose intergovernmentalism. You have the majority of this house in your debt. This Parliament would like to make another voice heard, that of a Europe based on solidarity, a responsible Europe, a Europe that is politically integrated. You can count on an ally in the European Parliament." Austrian Social Democrat Hannes Swoboda said fiscal discipline would be more palatable to citizens if there was growth and employment while tax evasion was being tackled effectively. "There are many declarations but actions are still missing. The EIB should be able to have more credit possibilities and the ECB should do its utmost to promote growth." Belgian Liberal Guy Verhofstadt also praised the Italian prime minister: "In a few weeks you did a great job and you put Italy back on track." But he continued: "Dear Mario, you need more than compliments. We need to reduce interest rates for European countries and for Italy, which is paying three times more than Germany." Green MEP Rebecca Harms , from Germany, questioned Mr Monti about the emphasis on cuts in Greece. "You talked a lot about budgetary discipline and discipline in general, do you think; as the person giving the task to clean things up in Italy, that it's intelligent budgetary discipline only to make cuts? Because what's happening in Greece right now is just cuts and cuts alone. And despite all of the cuts, the majority of citizens in the country, in particular poorer people, are finding things worse and worse. Is that the way out of the crisis for a country in crisis? Is that sustainable?" British Conservative Martin Callanan said : "Markets have responded positively to the proposed reform plans in Italy. Fiscal consolidation and economic reform could work in Italy, but not in Greece. There is no shortage of statements about growth but so far they have failed. Europe and the single market doesn't need more rules but liberalisation and competition." Far left French MEP Patrick Le Hyaric said he thought that the discipline we are talking about is only for the people and not for the financial actors. "What kind of democracy is a democracy where there's only austerity, security and control?" Italian eurosceptic Francesco Enrico Speroni criticised the prime minister for not having a democratic mandate for what he was doing. "You were appointed prime minister without having won democratic elections and you are excelling in the capacity as the enforcer for international finance, making people pay up." Maroš Šefčovič , who attended on behalf of the European Commission, said: "Italy entered the crisis in a vulnerable position. Monti's government has adopted a broad range of measures on taxation, pensions and public administration that have helped stabilise her position. The European Commission welcomes the decisive actions and stands ready to assist Italy, for example in combating youth unemployment."
Human rights debates: Parliament speaks out in defence of human dignity
MEP Barbara Lochbihler The European Parliament has a history of calling attention to flagrant violations of human rights across the world at each Strasbourg plenary session. This week for example it will discuss the situation in Belarus, Egypt and Japan. These debates have helped to raise awareness and incite the governments involved to change their act. We find out more about their importance from Barbara Lochbihler, the chair of the sub-committee on human rights.
The debates take place on Thursday afternoons at the end of the plenary and are followed by the adoption of resolutions. Ms Lochbihler, a Green MEP from Germany, said the impact of the resolutions varied depending on the country. "Sometimes we receive feedback from human rights activists there, or diplomats from the countries concerned respond. These resolutions are always an occasion to denounce violations of human rights. It is a good instrument. Ms Lochbihler said the Parliament has had some success with its human rights debates and resolutions. It has led to some governments reconsidering a death penalty sentence or a national parliament stopping the process on a particular law. "The debates on breaches of human rights also raise the awareness of our people on that issue and it helps of course to push and press the relevant government to improve." Topics for the debates, limited to a maximum of three, are decided between coordinators of the different political groups. "We choose a theme or situation where we think there is a window of opportunity to change it for the better," said Ms Lochbihler who was Amnesty International's secretary-general in Germany. However, the Parliament is not about to rest on its laurels. Ms Lochbihler said: "There is still more to be done: We need to mainstream human rights policies in our trade policy, in our economic supports, in our foreign relations policies. We can do more but still we have a good record internationally that the EU is concerned about human rights;" Debates Thursday 16 February from 3pm Death penalty in Belarus (the only country in Europe, which exercises the death penalty and still carries out executions), in particular the case of Dzmitry Kanavalau and Uladzislau Kavalyou Egypt: recent developments Death penalty in Japan The "urgency debates" is one of EP's instruments to defend human rights.
