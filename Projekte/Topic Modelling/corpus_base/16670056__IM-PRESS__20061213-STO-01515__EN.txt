Guido Sacconi signals victory for REACH
With the marathon approval session for the REACH chemicals package finally over. The man who guided it through Parliament, Italian Socialist MEP Guido Sacconi, declared himself "very satisfied" with the result of the vote. In total 529 of his colleagues supported him with 98 against and 24 abstentions. Mr Sacconi acted as the "rapporteur" of the text. He said that the approved text "struck a balance between health, the environment and the EU's chemical industry".
Speaking later, Mr Sacconi said that "with REACH, Europe confirms itself as the world leader in sustainable development".
Over the last almost few years intensive negotiations have been ongoing between the Council of Ministers, the European Commission and the Parliament. The aim has always been to balance the need to protect human health without overburdening the chemicals industry with laws and regulations.
Mr Sacconi said "the text is a great success for the general interest; it is a balanced regulation and there is a big margin for every actor to add a contribution", he said, even if he admitted that "it is obviously not perfect, but will be improved with time and experience".
Economic impact
Regarding the possible economic impact of REACH he added that "it is a new impulse for the European market".
Mauri Pekkarinen the Finnish Minister of Trade (representing the rotating Presidency of the EU), commented that "it is true that the initial costs for the industry will be higher, but in a long term it will be positive: safer products, more competition and a stronger European industry".
The President of the Environment Committee, Karl-Heinz Florenz of the European People's Party stressed that REACH would be a "success for Europe's exporting capacity... and only "the first step of a process in which all the actors can be involved, in order to make the regulation better".
Whatâ€™s next?
REACH will be adopted by the Council on Monday and signed on the same day by President Borrell and Mr Pekkarinen before the Plenary sitting. It should be published before the end of the year and will enter into force in June 2007.
So complicated has this process been that Guido Sacconi intends to write a book about his experiences!
