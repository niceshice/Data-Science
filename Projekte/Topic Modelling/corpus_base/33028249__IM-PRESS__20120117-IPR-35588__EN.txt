Hannes Swoboda (S&D, AT) replaces Mr Schulz as chair of the Socialists and Democrats Group today, following the election or re-election of the other group leaders.
The full line-up of the Conference of Presidents, which is responsible for organising parliamentary business and scheduling the passage of legislation, is now as follows:
Joseph DAUL (FR), Chair of the Group of the European People's Party (EPP)
Hannes SWOBODA (AT), Chair of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D)
Guy VERHOFSTADT (BE), Chair of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE)
Rebecca HARMS (DE) and Daniel COHN-BENDIT (FR), Co-Chairs of the Greens/European Free Alliance (Greens/EFA)
Martin CALLANAN (UK), Chair of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR)
Lothar BISKY (DE), Chair of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left
Francesco Enrico SPERONI (IT) and Nigel FARAGE (UK), Chairs of the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group (EFD).
The Conference of Presidents organises the work of Parliament and its bodies. It is consulted on all matters concerning relations with other EU institutions and bodies, as well as legislative planning. It usually meets twice a month. Its meetings are not public. It takes its decisions by consensus or by weighted vote, reflecting the number of Members in each political group.
