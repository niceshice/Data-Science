Someone checking a report MEPs to review December European Council and Polish Presidency
Parliament will review the 8-9 December European Council, dominated by what the EU and Member States must do to overcome the crisis, and Poland's six-month Polish Presidency of the Council, which runs until the end of 2011, in debates on Tuesday and Wednesday.
2011 Sakharov prize to be awarded to "Arab Spring" activists on Wednesday
The 2011 Sakharov prize for freedom of thought will be awarded by President Jerzy Buzek to five "Arab Spring" activists, for their contribution to historic changes in the Arab world, at a ceremony at noon on Wednesday, 14 December, in the plenary chamber.
EU-wide protection for crime victims
Crime victims who are granted protection from their aggressors in one EU Member State could get similar protection if they move to another, under new rules to be voted by Parliament on Tuesday. These rules, already agreed with national governments, would protect victims of, for instance, gender violence, harassment, abduction, stalking or attempted murder.
Common rights and single work and residence permit for non-EU workers
Third country migrants working legally within the EU should enjoy comparable rights to those of EU nationals as regards working conditions, social security and access to public services, under a new "single permit" law to be voted on Tuesday. The draft law, already informally agreed by Parliament and the Council, would also cut red tape, by enabling foreign workers to obtain work and residence permits via a single procedure.
A "letter of rights" to help ensure fair trials across the EU
Anyone suspected or accused of having committed a crime in the EU would have to be promptly informed of his or her procedural rights in easy-to-understand language, under a draft law to be voted on Tuesday. Any suspect who is then arrested or detained would also have to be given a written "letter of rights", adds the text, to which MEPs added the right to remain silent, the right to urgent medical care and the right to contact relatives.
President Buzek to take stock of his time in office
Jerzy Buzek will take stock of his two and a half year presidency of the European Parliament in a plenary address on Thursday. His term as President expires on 17 January 2012, when Parliament elects his successor.
Debate with Catherine Ashton on security policy and human rights
MEPs will discuss the impact of the financial crisis on the defence sector and human rights developments with EU foreign policy High Representative Catherine Ashton on Tuesday afternoon. The debate starts at 15.00h.
Thirteen new MEPs
On Monday President Jerzy Buzek will announce the arrival of 13 new MEPs, from Austria, Bulgaria, Italy, France, Malta, Spain, Sweden and UK, further to a June 2010 European Council decision allowing for an additional 18 MEPs. The other 5 will join once their national governments have notified their names to Parliament.
Clearer labelling rules for fruit juices
Proposed changes to EU labelling rules for fruit juices, "nectars" , juices made from concentrates, and those made from several fruits will be debated Tuesday and voted Wednesday. MEPs want the rules clarified, e.g. to enable consumers to identify whether sweeteners have been added. These changes were provisionally agreed with the Council in informal negotiations in October.
Cutting phosphates out of detergents
Washing powders throughout the EU will need to be almost phosphate-free in future, if legislation proposing tough limits wins the support of the European Parliament and Council. Voting on Wednesday, MEPs may follow an Environment Committee recommendation to demand that only minimal amounts of phosphates be allowed in dishwasher detergents, too.

Crime victims to get protection across EU
Conjugal violence ©BELGA_Illustra_C.Laurent Victims of crime who have been granted legal protection in one EU member state will get similar protection in other EU states under the European Protection Order. The legislation has been agreed with national governments and would include protection for any victim of gender violence, harassment, abduction, stalking or attempted murder. MEPs debated the EPO on Monday and voted on it Tuesday.
Measures to protect victims of crime already exist in all EU countries but they cease to apply if the victim moves to another country. The EPO will allow anyone protected in one EU state to apply for protection if they move to another EU country.
Protection for all crime victims
"The EPO directive is an important step in building a European area of justice," said Spanish Socialist Carmen Romero López , one of the people guiding the legislation through the EP. Women who are threatened will be protected, by safeguarding their physical, psychological and sexual integrity and their dignity as they move within Europe, she said.
MEPs on the Civil Liberties Committee insisted that not just victims of gender violence but all victims of crime should be protected .
Spanish Christian Democrat Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio , who drafted the report for the Women's Committee said, this will "provide real protection for victims across the EU. It is not just for victims of gender violence, but for all kinds of victims".
The rules will apply to victims or potential victims harassment, abduction, stalking and "other forms of indirect coercion".
Next steps
EU countries will have three years to transpose the legislation into national law. Ireland and Denmark will not participate. Draft report on EPO Press release after committee vote Council position
MEPs discuss impact of crisis on defence sector
Lisek during a committee meeting The economic crisis has led to cuts in defence budgets and "uncoordinated defence budget cuts could result in the complete loss of certain military capabilities in Europe", warns Polish Christian Democrat Krzysztof Lisek, who has drafted a report on the impact of the crisis on the defence sector. He sees the crisis as an opportunity for more integration, pooling and sharing of capabilities. Ahead of a discussion with High Representative Catherine Ashton Tuesday afternoon he told us more.
The financial crisis is hitting everything why do you want to draw attention to the impact on the defence sector?
Defence and security remain essential and you have to remember that the vast majority of activities in this area are strategic and executed over long periods - it is not possible to build a strong global player with a good strategy in a couple of years. We are highlighting many issues that need to be addressed as soon as possible but for which the outcome will be seen in the long term.
Your report suggests the crisis is an opportunity for the integration of EU defence policies. Where do you see opportunities for pooling and sharing?
I think that the crisis might be a wake up call for Europe so it can finally start using its potential and acting as a global player, speaking with one voice.
When talking about pooling and sharing I am thinking in particular of areas such as strategic and tactical transportation, logistical support, maintenance, space capabilities, cyber defence; also medical support, education and training. I would be happy to see more of the "pooling and sharing" initiatives related to transport helicopters, air-to-air refuelling, maritime surveillance, unmanned vehicles, protection against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear risks, satellite communication.... The list could be even longer - it shows how very many areas there are in which we can optimise resources.
Member states spend about €200 billion a year on defence (about a third of the US defence budget). How this money could be used more efficiently?
We would like to see more cooperation between the EU and NATO in terms of standardisation and interoperability. I believe that the European Defence Agency should play a more important role and I hope more importance will be given to standardisation of defence equipment and the establishment of a single European defence market.
I am a little bit disappointed by the outcome of the last Defence Ministers Council on 30 November. They did not support the creation of the European HQ that would enable Europe to act quickly in cases like the Libyan crisis and I cannot understand the reluctance to increase the EDA budget.

Strasbourg opening: eurozone, climate change, new MEPs
outside of the EP looking at a poster about Sakharov The outcomes of the Eurozone crisis summit and the Durban climate change conference were highlighted by Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek in his opening address at the 12-15 December plenary session in Strasbourg. Mr Buzek welcomed 17 new MEPs, and also noted the 60th anniversary of the Geneva Convention on refugees and the 30th anniversary of the imposition of martial law by Poland's communist regime.
Eurozone summit
Mr Buzek stressed the importance for Europe of the Eurozone crisis measures agreed at the 8-9 December European Council. He announced that its President Herman Van Rompuy would brief MEPs on the outcome on Tuesday morning, followed by a 3-hour priority debate
Climate change conference
The climate change conference deal reached in Durban (South Africa) on 11 December was not entirely satisfactory, inasmuch as it lacked detailed implementing arrangements, said Mr Buzek, adding that he was nonetheless pleased that the EU delegation there had "spoken with one voice".
Geneva convention on refugees
The Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, signed 60 years ago this year, was the foundation of all EU asylum legislation, and also defined the international law concept of "refugee", noted Mr Buzek.
He added that Parliament had taken part in negotiating the Common European Asylum System and called for it to be implemented in full by the end of 2012.
Mr Buzek also highlighted the plight of 3,800 Tunisian refugees in Libya, who are unable to return home. The USA had agreed to take 800, and the EU 150, he said.
Martial law in Poland
It was 30 years since the Polish authorities had imposed martial law, in an effort to suppress the Solidarity movement, noted Mr Buzek, pointing out that many people standing up for the right to free speech had paid with their lives.
The democracy and human rights that central and eastern Europe enjoy today could not have been achieved without the help of western Europe, and the EU should now be helping north Africa in the same way, he added.
17 new MEPs
Next, Mr Buzek welcomed 17 new MEPs, further to a June 2010 European Council decision allowing for an additional 18 MEPs. The remaining (Dutch) Member will be announced later.

Phosphate-free detergents to keep water clean
Washing powder ©BELGA/MAXPPP/Jean-Francois Frey Laundry and household dishwasher detergents in the EU will have to be virtually phosphate-free when new rules debated Tuesday and voted Wednesday come into force. The new rules would help improve water quality and aquatic life, which are damaged by phosphates discharged into waste water.
Phosphates are used in detergents to combat water hardness and facilitate cleaning but when discharged into lakes and rivers, they cause a proliferation of algae which in turn kill fish and other species by starving them of oxygen.
New rules from 2013
As of January 2013, phosphorous compounds in laundry detergents will be permitted only if they do not exceed 0.5 gram per standard washing machine load. The rules would apply to household dishwasher detergents from 2015.
"Compared to the market in laundry detergents, less progress has been made so far on formulating household dishwasher detergents that are both low-phosphorus and at the same time high-performance. Nonetheless, phosphate-free formulas are already available and manufacturers are innovating all the time," said British Liberal Bill Newton Dunn , who is guiding the legislation through Parliament.
Laundry detergents: a big phosphate contributor
Detergents are the third largest source of phosphate discharge into surface water, behind agriculture and sewage. Laundry is the largest contributor in the detergent sector. Alternative water-softening ingredients are available, although their effectiveness varies.
Some EU countries already have national restrictions, while others rely on the voluntary action of detergent manufacturers. This has led to poor water quality in some regions, like the Danube River and the Baltic Sea. EP report More details on the process
Criminal proceedings to be clarified for suspects
A police officer observes finger prints at a border police station in Aachen, Germany, 27 May 2011. ©BELGA_DPA Imagine you were on holiday in Spain and were accused of committing a crime - understanding the complex language used in criminal proceedings would be a challenge. Factor in the fact that each member state has its own legal rules and the challenge multiplies. MEPs want to help clear a way through this legal jungle.
MEPs are set to change the situation so that any suspect or person accused of breaking the law would be informed of their rights in easy-to-understand language, according to a draft law voted on Tuesday.
Under current legislation in some EU countries, it is only necessary for suspects to receive oral information about procedural rights, while in others, the information is written in technical language and only provided if requested. A "letter of rights" would help ensure trials are conducted fairly throughout the EU.
"Being aware of your rights is the first step towards having them respected. The letter of rights will inform people arrested about their rights in a language they understand, including the right to interpretation and translation and the right of access to a lawyer," according to German Socialist Birgit Sippel, who is guiding the legislation through the EP.
What's next?
The draft law also needs to be endorsed by the EU Council of Ministers. Once adopted, member states will have two years to transpose it into their national laws.
The UK and Ireland will participate, Denmark will not. Draft report Press release after committee vote
Saving the euro: MEPs debate latest European Council deal
Summit debate Limiting budget deficits not only in the euro area, but in a majority of EU member states is the gist of the fiscal compact agreed by EU leaders last week. MEPs Tuesday welcomed the agreement, but warned that in order to restore the trust of citizens the EU should also focus on growth. There was a lively exchange of views on the subject of the British veto that led the rest of the member states to opt for a new treaty.
European Council President Herman Van Rompuy noted that restoring confidence to the euro had been more difficult that anyone had expected. He regretted the intergovernmental nature of the new treaty on the fiscal compact and the fact that not all member states had supported the agreement, but reminded MEPs that this is not the first time some EU members have moved ahead with an intergovernmental agreement that later turned into EU law (for example the Schengen agreement).
European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso said the deal underlined the irreversibility of the common currency and was a firm commitment to the euro. But the fiscal compact is not enough, growth and employment are key to restoring the confidence of citizens and investors, he said. The new treaty on fiscal union will not replace, but build on EU institutions, he added, reiterating support for eurobonds to build a stronger, more liquid EU bond market.
Centre-right EPP leader Joseph Daul said, "26 out of 27 countries showed that shared sovereignty is better than sovereignty taken hostage by the markets." Unfortunately, "the result is not community based as we wanted but intergovernmental", he added, noting that the EP has a role as the guarantor of democratic legitimacy. Questioning the future of the UK budget rebate, Daul said, "if the UK's solidarity towards the other 26 is being abandoned, I do not see why the others should show solidarity to UK. Solidarity must work in both directions."
"The UK Prime Minister didn't want more regulation of financial markets, which is not acceptable, because the financial markets, the speculators in the City of London are those who have driven us into the crisis," according to Socialist leader Martin Schulz . He said that the EP should make alternative suggestions on how to ensure stability in Europe, including more growth and employment.
Liberal leader Guy Verhofstadt said the agreement by leaders puts an end to German and French ambitions to run the euro zone. "Discipline without solidarity is not the true expression of a union," he said, criticizing the focus solely on budget deficits.
For the Greens Rebecca Harms was also critical, saying the summit had no answers to the acute questions of the crisis; it was a denial of reality and of democracy.
"We can hardly call the summit a success. There were no immediate steps taken to calm the markets and no proposals for growth. We have seen a Europe more divided than before," ECR leader Jan Zahradil said. "Even the 17 euro zone countries are divided into two parts: those who will pay and those who will be paid." He defended British Prime Minister David Cameron as "only defending national interests".
There was no breakthrough at the summit, GUE/NGL leader Lothar Bisky said. "We should introduce a financial transaction tax and ban dangerous financial products," he added. Neoliberal policies such as privatisation and the redistribution of wealth upwards caused the crisis, austerity won't lead to growth, he said.
EFD leader Nigel Farage said, "something changed on Friday: Britain is going to make the great escape." He added, "Cameron has unleashed an unstoppable momentum for a referendum" on EU membership. Press release following the summit
Parliament endorses EU-wide protection for crime victims
Woman looking over her shoulder Crime victims who are granted protection from their aggressors in one EU Member State will be able to get similar protection if they move to another, under new rules adopted by Parliament on Tuesday. The European Protection Order aims to protect victims of, for instance, gender violence, harassment, abduction, stalking or attempted murder. Member States will have three years to transpose this directive into national law.
Measures to protect crime victims from aggressors already exist in all EU Member States but at present they cease to apply if the victim moves to another country. The European Protection Order (EPO) directive, already agreed with national governments, will enable anyone protected under criminal law in one EU state to apply for similar protection if they move to another.
"In a nutshell, we will facilitate the movement of victims and we will hamper the movement of their aggressors. Today we have taken an important step forward to protect those who most deserve it", said Women's Rights Committee rapporteur Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio (EPP, ES). "Protection will know no borders. There are thousands of victims who will now be able to live in peace", added Civil Liberties Committee rapporteur Carmen Romero López (S&D, ES).
MEPs sought from the outset to make it clearer that the rules should cover all victims of crime, not just victims of gender violence. Most protection measures are granted to female victims of gender violence but an EPO can cover victims of either sex and other crimes too.
The rules will apply to victims or possible victims who need protection "against a criminal act of another person which may, in any way, endanger his life, physical, psychological and sexual integrity […] as well as his dignity or personal liberty". Such acts could include harassment, abduction, stalking and "other forms of indirect coercion".
Keeping aggressors away
Once a person is granted protection in one Member State under domestic criminal law, s/he may request an EPO to extend this protection to another EU country to which s/he decides to move (or already moved). It will be up to the Member State of origin to issue the EPO and forward it to the other country.
An EPO may only be issued if the aggressor is banned by the initial country from places where the protected person resides or which s/he visits, or if restrictions are imposed on contact or approaches by the aggressor to the protected person.
Protecting victims' relatives
Thanks to MEPs, an EPO may also be requested to safeguard relatives of a beneficiary of a European Protection Order.
New legislation to cover civil matters
The EPO in criminal matters will be complemented by separate legislation for civil matters. To that end, the Commission proposed in May 2011 a regulation on mutual recognition of protection afforded by civil law, which will also be co-decided by Parliament and Council. The combination of the two instruments (the EPO directive and this regulation) should cover the broadest possible range of protection measures for victims issued in the Member States.
Background
The EPO directive was an initiative originally requested by 12 Member States and promoted by the EU's Spanish Presidency (first half of 2010).
The UK has opted-in, but Ireland and Denmark are not taking part.

Common rights and single work and residence permit for non-EU workers
Queue of immigrants and foreign workers in Caen, France. ©Belga/AFP Third country migrants working legally within the EU will enjoy common rights, similar to those of EU nationals, as regards working conditions, pensions, social security and access to public services, under a new "single permit" law passed by Parliament on Tuesday. The directive will also enable foreign workers to obtain work and residence permits via a single procedure. Member States will have two years to adapt their national laws to the new rules.
The "single permit" directive complements other measures on legal migration, such as the blue card, and is designed to facilitate such migration where it meets the needs of the EU labour market.
In a debate on Monday, rapporteur Véronique Mathieu (EPP, FR) commented: "The single permit directive will allow us to deal to a degree with the shortage of European labour. It will also facilitate the checks and balances involved in migratory flows. It is much better to have legal migration and remove any kind of incentive to illegal or clandestine measures. The new rules will simplify the permits for both residence and work and will allow third country nationals to enjoy the same rights as workers in the EU. Workers' rights are at the heart of this directive."
These rules do not affect EU countries' power to decide whether or not to admit non-EU workers or how many to admit, but they will have to decide within four months on whether to grant single permit applications.
The proposed directive will reduce red tape for third-country nationals, by enabling them to obtain both work and residence permits in a Member State via a single procedure. It will allow a single permit application to be filed by the third-country national or by his or her employer in the EU.
Who is covered?
The agreed rules will apply to non-EU nationals who wish to live and work in a Member State, or who already legally reside or work there.
The new law will not cover long-term residents, refugees and posted workers (who are already subject to other EU rules), seasonal workers or intra-company transferees (who will be covered by other EU directives). Au pairs and seafarers sailing under the flag of a Member State are also excluded.
A new set of rights
Single permit holders will enjoy a common set of rights comparable to those of EU workers, such as decent basic working conditions, recognition of qualifications, the right to join trade unions, tax benefits and access to pensions, social security, employment office services and public housing. However, EU countries will be able apply some specific restrictions to these rights.
Social security, public housing and pensions
As a general rule, non-EU workers will have access to social security on the same terms as EU nationals. However, Member States could apply restrictions to workers with contracts of less than 6 months' duration. For non-EU citizens admitted to follow a course of study, family benefits could also be further restricted. Member States will also be able to restrict access to public services, such as public housing, to those foreign workers who have jobs
At the request of MEPs, the directive ensures that non-EU workers will be able to receive their pensions when moving back to their home country under the same conditions and at the same rates as the nationals of the Member State concerned.
Vocational training and education
Also at the request of MEPs, vocational training and education will be provided for non-EU workers who have a job or are registered as unemployed. During the negotiations, MEPs rejected a proposal by Member States to limit these services to foreign workers in employment. With respect to access to university or vocational training not linked directly to employment, EU countries could set specific conditions, such as language proficiency.
Next steps
As the law passed by Parliament on Tuesday had already been approved by Member States, Parliament's vote is the end of the legislative procedure. Once the directive is published in the EU Official Journal, Member States will have two years to transpose it into their national laws.

A "letter of rights" to ensure fair trials across the EU
Birgit Sippel with other MEPs following the vote Anyone suspected or accused of having committed a crime in the EU must be promptly informed of his or her procedural rights in easy-to-understand language, says a new EU law adopted by Parliament on Tuesday. Any suspect who is then arrested or detained must also be given a written "letter of rights", adds the text, to which MEPs added the right to remain silent, the right to urgent medical care and the right to contact relatives.
The new directive, already agreed with member state governments, provides EU-wide minimum standards to ensure the right to information in criminal proceedings.
Today, citizens arrested and charged with a criminal offence cannot be certain that they will be properly informed of their rights everywhere in the EU. In some Member States, they receive only oral information about their procedural rights, whilst in others the information is given in writing, but is technical, complex and provided only on request.
"The new directive is an important cornerstone in ensuring that suspects and accused persons across the EU have a fair trial, thanks to the development of equal standards. The rights of our citizens are being strengthened. Individuals may exercise their rights to defence only if they know what these rights are. Parliament has been able to extend the list of rights on which it is important to give information, for example, medical care, contacts with family members, etc", said Civil Liberties Committee rapporteur, Birgit Sippel (S&D, DE).
Information required before first police interview
Any person suspected or accused of having committed a crime must be promptly provided with information on at least the following procedural rights:
the right of access to a lawyer;
any entitlement to legal advice free of charge and the conditions for obtaining it;
the right to be informed of the accusation;
the right to interpretation and translation;
the right to remain silent.
This information must be provided either orally or in writing and "at the latest" before the first official interview by the police.
Letter of rights required from the time of arrest
The authorities will be obliged to give anyone who is arrested or detained, or is the subject of a European Arrest Warrant, written information in the form of a "letter of rights". In addition to the rights mentioned above, the letter must give the arrested person information on:
the right to access to the materials of the case;
the right to have consular authorities and one person informed (for example, a family member or employer);
the right of access to urgent medical assistance;
for how many hours/days he may be deprived of liberty before being brought before a judicial authority.
The letter of rights must also give basic information about any possibility to challenge the lawfulness of the arrest, to obtain a review of the detention, or to ask for provisional release.
The directive provides for an indicative model of such a letter of rights. Member States may amend this model to align it with their national rules and add further useful information.
Once adopted, EU countries will have two years to transpose this directive into their national laws.
The resolution was passed with 663 votes in favour, 24 against and 17 abstentions.
Background
The UK and Ireland have notified their wish to take part in the adoption and application of this directive. Denmark is the only Member State not taking part.
There are over 8 million criminal proceedings in the EU every year. Together with the directive on the right to translation and interpretation, adopted last year, the draft directive on the right to information in criminal proceedings is one in a series of fair trial measures that aims to boost confidence in the EU’s single area of justice. A third proposal, to guarantee access to a lawyer, is currently under discussion in the Civil Liberties Committee.

Russian elections: MEPs call for new free and fair elections
Supporters of Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin take part in a rally in central Moscow ©AFP/ALEXANDER_NEMENOV Parliament calls for new free and fair elections and an immediate and full investigation of all reports of fraud and intimidation in the Russian elections held on 4 December, and welcomes demonstrations in Russia as an expression of the will of the people in a resolution passed on Wednesday.
MEPs stress that the running of the election showed that Russia does not meet election standards as defined by the OSCE, and express deep concern about reports of fraud and the preliminary findings of the OSCE/ODIHR report on procedural violations, lack of media impartiality, harassment of independent monitors and lack of separation between party and state.
The resolution underlines that the registration process led to the exclusion of several opposition parties and has seriously undermined freedom of association, political competition and pluralism from the beginning. Parliament calls for new free and fair elections to be held after registration of all opposition parties.
MEPs welcome the demonstrations in Russia as an expression of the will of the Russian people for more democracy and condemn the crackdown by the police on peaceful demonstrations. Parliament calls for an immediate and full investigation of all reports of fraud and intimidation, and penalties for those found responsible.
Parliament calls on the President of the European Council, the President of the Commission and the EU foreign policy High Representative to raise the issue of the elections at the EU-Russia summit to be held on 15 December.
MEPs reiterate their concern about the human rights situation in Russia and the lack of rule of law and an independent judiciary. The resolution calls on the EU and Russia to speed up negotiations for a new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. Parliament favours a legally-binding agreement that includes all areas related to democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights.
The resolution stresses the importance of stepping up the energy partnership with Russia, and reiterates that the supply of natural resources must not be used as a political tool.
Finally, the resolution stresses that international challenges, in particular with regard to Syria and Iran, cannot be solved without a coordinated approach which includes Russia.

No more mix-ups over mixed fruit juices
glass of orange juice surrounded by orange slices New consumer-friendly labelling rules for fruit juices and nectars were approved by the European Parliament on Wednesday. They aim to prevent potentially misleading names for mixed juices and "no added sugar" claims.
Parliament approved the update to existing legislation from 2001, with 585 votes in favour, 33 against and 1 abstention. Rapporteur Andrés Perelló Rodriguez (S&D, ES) said: "Our priority was to offer consumers accurate information so they would know what they are buying. Parliament played a key role in banning added sugar in products sold as juices and in clarifying the presence of sugars or sweeteners in similar drinks."
Mixed juices
A mix of two juices must in future have a product name that reflects the contents, say MEPs. For example, a mixture of 90% apple and 10% strawberry juice would need to be called "Apple and strawberry juice", whereas currently it may be labelled just "Strawberry juice". A generic name like "Mixed juice" could be used if there are three or more fruit sources.
Sugars and sweeteners
MEPs know that consumers – especially diabetics, parents and people on a diet – want clear indications on the difference between a 'juice' and 'nectar', and presence of any sweeteners.
In future, fruit juices will by definition not contain any sugars or sweeteners. 'Nectars', made from fruit purée with added water, may contain added sugar or sweeteners. "No added sugar" labels will not be allowed on nectars containing artificial sweeteners, such as saccharin, to avoid potential confusion.
Pure orange juice?
Many products sold as "orange juice" contain up to 10% mandarin juice, which contributes to colour and taste. This practice is common in Brazil and the US, which have a big share of the European market. To maintain a level playing field, all imported and EU orange juice will need to be pure to be sold as such, or will include mandarin in the product name.
Next steps
The rules had been provisionally agreed in informal talks between Parliament and Council and now need only a rubber stamp from the latter to enter into law. Any products placed on the market or labelled before then may still be sold up to 3 years later. Member States will have 18 months to update their national legislation accordingly.

Safeguarding prisoners' rights while in jail
A guard locking a prison cell ©BELGA_PRESSASSOCIATION Conditions in jails across the EU vary widely an on Wednesday MEPs asked members of the Council and Commission about differences in detention conditions, deteriorating conditions in EU prisons, abuses in pre-trial detention, overcrowding and the detention of non-EU nationals.
Free movement of people has led to an increasing number of EU citizens being detained in member states other than their own, where conditions could be very different.
A Green Paper published by the Commission in June, following numerous requests by the EP for EU-wide minimum standards for prison and detention conditions and a common set of prisoners' rights, highlights the discrepancies in standards across the EU.
It noted that detainees were often held in cramped, overcrowded cells, that some member states have no legal maximum length for pre-trial detention and that the , treatment of non-EU nationals and poor detention conditions often hamper the rehabilitation of prisoners upon release.
Detention conditions and prison management falls under the responsibility of Member States. But poor conditions may undermine the trust necessary to underpin judicial cooperation between EU countries.
Questions tabled by S&D, ALDE, GUE/NGL, EPP and the Greens raise issues including how the Commission intends to address the protection of fundamental rights for all prisoners enshrined in the EU Charter and what the Council will do to promote minimum detention and prison standards and a common set of prisoners' rights including appropriate compensation rules for persons unjustly detained or convicted.

Tusk: EU is at crossroads, we fight for its future, or we regret it in future
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk in the EP chamber for the end of the Polish presidency debate The Polish presidency concludes at the end of the year and Prime Minister Donald Tusk was in the EP Wednesday to review the past six months. Most MEPs praised the presidency but Tusk wasn't too optimistic. "Although we are happy with the work done, I cannot say that Europe is more united now."
"Today I can say that we are at crossroads. We have to answer the question of whether we walk the community road, or the road of national selfishness. Either we fight for the future of Europe now, or cry for Europe tomorrow," he said.
EPP group leader Joseph Daul said that many MEPs share the Polish vision for the EU and pointed to the success of the presidency in getting an agreement on the economic governance six-pack, which aims to improve economic governance and the supervision of financial markets.
This has been one of the best presidencies in recent years, Socialist leader Martin Schulz said, calling on the EU to adopt new instruments that are adequate for 21st century. Olle Schmidt for the Liberal group warned that "isolation is not the way forward".
While the Green group was happy in general with the Polish presidency, Bas Eickhout said they were disappointed with its work on the climate change.
Not everyone was complimentary, Tomasz Porępa of the ECR said, "it was a weak presidency that lacked ambition", while Nikolaos Salavrakos for the EFD said the presidency "seemed to be powerless vis-a-vis the markets" and for the GUE/NGL group Georgios Toussas said the presidency showed a "fear of governance of people".
Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso thanked Tusk for his "leadership and European commitment". Polish presidency site
Sakharov prize laureates grateful for Europe's support to Arab Spring
Sakharov Prize 2011 ceremony "By awarding the Sakharov Prize to the five Arab Spring activists, the European Parliament recognises the efforts of all those who struggle for dignity, basic freedoms and political change in the Arab world", said President Buzek at the Sakharov Prize award ceremony on Wednesday in Strasbourg.
Mr Buzek pointed out that: "The historical events also remind us of our responsibilities, including the need to support an emerging, young and vibrant civil society" and he underlined the "decisive role played by women during the Arab Spring".
The winners expressed their gratitude for the prize as an important symbol of Europe's vital support during the Arab Spring uprisings. They also pointed to the human rights challenges that their countries still face in their efforts to rebuild and set up genuinely democratic regimes that respect justice and human dignity.
Only two of the laureates were able to attend the award ceremony in person: Asmaa Mahfouz, a young blogger from Egypt, and Ahmed El-Senussi, Libya's longest-serving prisoner of conscience. Parliament observed a minute's silence in memory of Mohamed Bouazizi, whose self-immolation in protest at the Tunisian authorities' repression sparked widespread protests and who was awarded the prize posthumously, and of all those who lost their lives in the uprisings.
In her acceptance speech, Asmaa Mahfouz said: "This reward pays hommage to all those people in Egypt who have been much more courageous than me and actually sacrificed their lives on the streets. I would like to tell you how proud I am for all the martyrs of Arab revolution. We will not betray them, we will follow the road."
Ahmed El-Senussi pointed to the importance of reconciliation: "We need to rebuild our country, showing tolerance even towards those who committed crimes, who violated human dignity." He thanked Libya's European neighbours, the first to go to Libya's aid, for their "unambiguous diplomatic and military support".
The Syrian cartoonist, Ali Ferzat, who is exiled in Kuwait, send a video message in which he voiced his gratitude for the prize and also his grief and sorrow at the number of victims in his home country Syria which "increases with every minute".
Syrian human rights lawyer Razan Zaitouneh, who is in hiding, sent a letter saying: "I would like to thank the European Parliament and everyone who has empathized with the uprising of our people, and who has supported it in whatsoever way, for the sake of a tomorrow free of repression, prisons, and blood-spilling. For all brave people in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Bahrain and beyond. For those who got their freedom, and those who are still struggling for it."

Buzek farewell address: "I have never had doubts about a common Europe"
Jerzy Buzek in plenary Europe "was built on dreams and we have no right to throw those dreams away". In his final speech as European Parliament President in Strasbourg Thursday, Jerzy Buzek called on the Union to fight to overcome the crisis, because "to remain strong requires an everyday investment in our common Europe".
In his farewell address, he spoke of the great challenges the EU and EP faced during his two-and-a-half years at the helm, reminding everyone how unprepared the EU proved to be for the challenges it has been facing: "We have not prepared our Community for difficult and more challenging times. Arguments about self-interest began to erode our belief in the common good. And now, our Union has moved into a deep crisis whose causes are as much political and psychological, as economic". Responding to this tragedy, he said, became Parliament's highest priority.
An economy in crisis, a world evolving
The recent economic governance "six-pack" of budgetary surveillance measures was just one example of policies passed under his presidency, but that was just part of what the EP Parliament proposed and demanded, he said. "On your behalf, I have often stressed the need to complete the internal market and to boost growth and competitiveness." "Parliament called for more investment and for greater support for research, development, and green technologies", including a priority he himself worked hard for, the creation of "a genuine European Energy Community".
Turning to the international arena, Buzek mentioned Parliament's active part in what he termed the Union's role as a "lighthouse" of freedom and democracy. "When I spoke to protestors in Tahrir square in Cairo, and freedom fighters in Martyr Square in Tripoli, they told me, 'Thank you Europe'".
In Europe itself though, the changes are perhaps no less revolutionary. Turning to the citizens of Europe, President Buzek added a personal special plea: there is no contradiction between being a good citizen of one's own country and a good European citizen: "Europe allows you to discover the magic of the word 'and': being a good citizen of your town, region, country - and your continent", so "log in to our common European space, it is your Space".
Parliament itself has changed during this time with the introduction of the Lisbon Treaty that made it full co-legislator with the governments in the Council in virtually all matters. Of course "with power comes responsibility" and, as Buzek recalled, "we introduced our own Code of Conduct for Members which was applauded for its clarity and strength".
"The loss of a sense of meaning"
"Our real problem is the lack of mutual trust and the loss of a sense of meaning." At a time where no "country is an island", he said, he "who stays outside cannot expect to be a main player". He went on to express the hope that the frictions resulting from recent talk of an intergovernmental method of doing business ultimately "will lead to more, not less, use of the Lisbon Treaty and the Community method".
More than that, he called for "a new wave of political integration...a new wave of economic integration...a real economic and fiscal union" in a genuine spirit of cooperation, a true New Deal for Europe, in which "those who think of profit must also think of values. Those who gain wealth must be responsible. Those who are concerned about their prosperity must be concerned about equality, and those who believe in competition must come to believe in justice".
"As the President of the European Parliament I served you and Europe's citizens. The European Union is incredible value, one worth working for and living in. But it is a value that can be created and used only if we are united," he said. "It is this very Europe that I will always serve with energy and determination."

Things we learnt in the 12-15 December plenary
The final plenary session of 2011 marked a number of endings - Jerzy Buzek's term as EP president, Poland's six months at the head of the council of ministers, this year's Sakharov Prize with the award of the prize to representatives of the Arab uprising and phosphates in detergents. But it also marked a number of beginnings - a single permit for non-EU citizens, the EU protection order and fairer treatment for those arrested abroad.
The big debate concerned the outcome of last week's EU summit , including the UK's veto of changes to the EU treaties; click below to read our summary. So what else happened?
Ten years after 9/11, the EU should reassess its counter-terrorism policy in terms of cost, effectiveness, impact on civil liberties and democratic scrutiny, MEPs said Wednesday.
Also on Wednesday MEPs voted to reject an extension to the controversial EU-Morocco fisheries agreement, calling for a new more environmentally-friendly and economically beneficial deal.
MEPs gave eight candidates for the EU's Court of Auditors the green light on Tuesday and approved France's candidate Benoît Coeuré, for the European Central Bank's Executive Board on Wednesday.
The EP agreed to €1.3 billion in funding for nuclear fusion research over the next two years on Tuesday.
The EU should breathe new life into relations with its neighbours to the South and East but any engagement must be conditional on their progress towards democracy and respect for human rights, MEPs said Wednesday.
MEPs approved €24.5 million to help 3,582 workers made redundant by Renault and seven of its suppliers find new jobs under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund Thursday.
Last but not least, MEPs welcomed 17 new colleagues, of the 18 extra MEPs agreed under the Lisbon Treaty. The final member from the Netherlands will arrive once their name has been notified to the EP, bringing the total number of MEPs to 754. Plenary in photos Sakharov focus
