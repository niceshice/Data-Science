Europarl Today: Stockholm looks to Copenhagen as Sweden takes over the presidency As Sweden takes up the EU Presidency this week we spoke to European Affairs Minister Cecilia Malmström. As unemployment in Europe rises and the economic crisis gets deeper the Swedes will have to coordinate the EU's response. Added to this will be the need to find an international environmental agreement that replaces the Kyoto protocol before the December deadline. A former MEP turned Minister Ms Malmström laid out the key issues ahead.
Economic and climate dangers to dominate
Ms Malmström told us starkly that "we are experiencing the most serious financial crisis in modern times, and unemployment in EU is expected to rise in the autumn".
She went on to say that "at the same time we face the biggest challenge of our time - to avert the climate threat. These are issues that affect and will affect all of us. Here we see that need for functioning European cooperation has seldom been more important".
She said that "the Swedish presidency therefore hopes to be able to keep up the work to combat the negative influences of the economic crisis on growth and employment; at the same time we want the EU to continue pushing the climate agenda forward. The hope is a new international climate deal on the UN-summit in Copenhagen in December".
MEP to Minister?
Married with two children 41-year old Cecilia Malmström was a Liberal Member of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2006. She took up her post as EU-Minister after the 2006 Swedish elections when a centre-right coalition, "The Alliance for Sweden", unseated the Social Democratic Party which had dominated Swedish politics since the war.
She says she enjoys her current role but "of course I miss many of my friends and colleagues in the European Parliament, as well as the feeling one has as an MEP of always being in the centre of European debates".
Speaking about the difference between being an MEP and a Minister Ms Malmström says "in many ways my work now is about the same questions, but from slightly different angles. As an MEP you have, together with the legislative work, an important role as opinion maker. It is more difficult to have this role as a minister".
Are Swedes warming to the EU?
Sweden, which joined the European Union in 1995, has long been known as a reluctant member of the Union. Fears that its much admired social security and welfare protection would suffer allied to its traditional neutrality partly explain this trend.
However, at the last European elections voter turnout jumped 8% from 37.8% in 2004 to 45, 5%. We asked the Minister whether this signified a changing of attitudes to the Union: "Opinion polls show that more and more Swedes feel at ease with the EU and the Swedish membership" she said.
Schools and locals issues important
Ms Malmström went on to explain: "I believe the Swedish government's clear willingness for Sweden to be an active part of EU's core and my own work to consolidate the EU through visits to companies, schools, and meetings with local and regional politicians around the country has brought results."
She elaborated on this point saying that "consultation with civil society and holding lunch seminars for the public about current EU-issues has produced results. Needless to say this increased interest makes us stronger ahead of the Swedish presidency".
A Presidency under "special circumstances"
On 15 July the Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt (Moderate Party) will present the Presidency priorities to the European Parliament in Strasbourg.
Speaking in Brussels-seminar earlier this month he said: "our Presidency will take place under very special circumstances. A new European Parliament taking office, a new European Commission about to be appointed and uncertainty about the future of the Lisbon Treaty".
Backstory: EU Presidency - what it is?
Every six months, a different EU Member State assumes the so-called Presidency of the EU, meaning that it chairs the meetings of the Council of the European Union and is responsible for moving important EU issues forward. For 2010 Spain will hold it from January to June) and Belgium from July to December.
