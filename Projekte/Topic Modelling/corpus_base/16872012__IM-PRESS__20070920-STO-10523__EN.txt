Consumers will benefit from Microsoft antitrust ruling say MEPs

17 September was a bad day for Microsoft
The landmark anti-trust decision against US software giant Microsoft has been welcomed as a good deal for consumers by several MEPs. On Monday the EU's Court of First Instance upheld a 2004 ruling in the long running case brought by the European Commission. The crux of the ruling was that Microsoft had unfairly used its 90% share of the software industry. One MEP told us the decision strengthened "the right and freedom of consumers to choose the best and most innovative products".
The Court's decision means the Seattle-based company will have to pay a fine of €497 million on top of the €280 million they have already been fined for not respecting the 2004 decision. In practical terms the ruling means that Microsoft will have to make all its software compatible with its rivals. At present this is not the case. So in future if you buy "Windows" then the rest of your computer purchases (even if they are not made by Microsoft), must be able to operate with it.
Consumers "liberty of choice" respected
MEPs were especially pleased with the benefits this could have for European consumers. German MEP Helmuth Markov (GUE/NGL) who chairs the Parliament's Trade Committee said he "welcomed any court decision which goes against the creation of oligopolies. Consumers must not be constrained to buy products of one single company due to single software. Customers should have the possibility to choose between different products of different producers".
French Socialist Pervenche Berès has been following the case in her capacity as Chair of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee. She called the decision "historic" especially "considering the exceptional situation of market dominance by Microsoft". She went on to say that "the decision would guarantee the liberty of choice of consumers and ensure just competition between companies in the IT market".
Ruling "sends clear signal"
For the Greens/EFA group Alain Lipietz (who sits on the Legal Affairs Committee) stressed the boost this would give to Competition rules in the EU. "the fine of 497 million Euros against Microsoft for abuse of its dominant position is a great victory for the right of Competition. This conviction will make it understood to consumers that the European Union put their interests above those of monopolies".
British MEP Arlene McCarthy (PSE) noted that consumers "will now benefit from this ruling with fairer prices a wider choice". According to the Chair of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee this will allow them "to mix and match different products on their PCs, rather than too often being tied to one company".
The effect that the ruling could have on Microsoft's competitors and small and medium size businesses across Europe was taken up by Rainer Wieland (EPP-ED). The German MEP - who is vice-chair of the Legal Affairs Committee - said "the rights of small and medium sized enterprise in the IT sector have been fortified". He added that it had "clearly reaffirmed European competition policy and anti-trust rules".
"Abuse of a dominant position can never be tolerated"
German MEP Alexander Graf Lambsdorff (ALDE) commented that "the verdict is an important victory for the European consumer". The vice-chair of Parliament's Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee said "it strengthens competition in the software market and gives a clear signal to other companies that the EU applies competition law consistently".
British Member Malcolm Harbour (EPP-ED), who sits on the Internal Market Committee, said "the abuse of a dominant position can never be tolerated, therefore, I welcome this judgment because it supports our policy of free and open markets and maximum competition in this important area".
However, reaction from some quarters in the US has been less positive. Thomas Barnett, Head of the antitrust division at the Department of Justice said the ruling "may have the unfortunate effect of harming consumers by chilling innovation".
Commission action vindicated
In the short term the Commission will feel vindicated in launching the action against Microsoft. Given this success it is likely that it will feel emboldened to press more Competition cases. By ruling that dominant companies have a duty to ensure that rival products can function properly with their products, the implications may impact other companies.
Some voices in Europe have already pointed out that this argument could be used against Apple's "ipod" and "itunes" for example. Finally, in more good news for the Union - all of the money from the fine - should an appeal by Microsoft either fail or not take place - will go to EU coffers.
