There are wide disparities in the levels of fines - from €58 to €5,000 - and over what is considered a serious offence. Following a vote in the Transport Committee, the own initiative report by Austrian Christian Democrat Hella Ranner will be put to a vote on Tuesday by the whole House.
The proposed new rules relate to working time rest periods or working conditions. Across the 27 countries of the European Union the system of fines varies enormously.
Manipulation of the tachograph (measuring time and distance), for example, is penalised with a fine of up to €586 in Lithuania, but €2,460 in Poland, although in both cases the maximum fine is imposed. In other countries, the fine can be even higher: in Spain, the fine for such infringements is €4 601, in Italy up to €6,232, and in France up to €30,000 with the additional possibility of imprisonment of up to 1 year.
Ms Ranner told us, "the penalty systems in the EU Member States have evolved historically and therefore show wide disparities, with fines in extreme cases that can be as much as 10 times higher in one country than in another."
She added, "these differences can be explained by economic and geographical factors as well as the Member States' differing policy approaches to road safety."
The Transport Committee has called on EU governments to find "legislative and practical ways" of reducing the differences in the types and levels of penalties applied.
The Committee also want maximum and minimum penalties and for all offences to be categorised.
Ms Ranner said, "in order to achieve further approximation of the types of penalties and of the level of fines we need better coordination at European level".
