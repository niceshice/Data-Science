Forced prostitution stalks Europe's streets
Building on what they believe to be their success in raising the issue of forced prostitution prior to the 2006 World Cup, the Women's Rights Committee Wednesday launches a debate on the issue ahead of the European football championships. As MEPs gather for 2 days of debate they will table an oral question to the European Commission asking what steps are being taken. They fear that an influx of fans could tempt people traffickers to force women into prostitution.
The curse of people trafficking continues to affect over 2 million worldwide a year, according to the International Labour Organisation. Over 40% are believed to be exploited in the sex industry. Two years ago, to coincide with International Women's Day and ahead of the World Cup in Germany the Women's Rights Committee launched the "Red Card to forced prostitution" campaign.
Austria and Switzerland will jointly host Euro 2008. Austrian Socialist Christa Prets drafted a report on trafficking two years ago. "Trafficking in women is a Europe-wide crime and an extraordinarily cruel form of modern slavery," she said ahead of the plenary. "There has to be a distinction between prostitution and forced prostitution. The latter is a crime against humanity and has to be punished". Watch the plenary here live on parliament's website.
