Their freedom is vital to in any society which truly values freedom of thought. To defend the freedom of the press is to defend the highest values. No surprise then that past Sakharov winners include several who have stood up for journalists and their work in the most challenging circumstances.
Reporters without borders
The work of a journalist can be pretty dangerous, especially, if you operate in a non-democratic country or a war zone. One of the best known promoters of free media is the Paris based NGO Reporters without Borders. Their campaigns aim at raising awareness of the importance of press freedom and on the journalists who are victims of prosecution, imprisonment or censorship. Throughout a wide network of national and regional branches, the organisation is active on five continents.
In its fight against censorship, it also publishes articles which have been banned in their country of origin and offers practical support from grants to the family of imprisoned journalists to "press" flack jackets for those working in war zones. The organisation received the Sakharov Prize in 2005.
Oslobodjenje
Many journalists do not see their work as a job but as a mission. Who will bring the latest news if not us? This was the case for some 70 employees of the Balkan newspaper Oslobodjenje, which was awarded the 1993 Sakharov Prize for its efforts and perseverance in defending Bosnia-Herzegovina as a multi-ethnic state.
The prize was awarded to show appreciation to the brave employees of the newspaper, who risked their own lives to ensure that the newspaper appeared daily, even while under fire. The offices of the newspaper were destroyed and the employees forced to hide in a nuclear shelter in the basement of a building, from where they continued their work.
Belarusian Association of Journalists
The fight for a free media in Europe is not over yet. Censorship, harassment, expatriation and criminal prosecution are common practise for journalists in Belarus. Fortunately, they are not alone. The Belarusian Association of Journalists is known for its commitment and struggle for the freedom of speech and freedom of information on human rights. Their goals include building up and promoting independent and professional journalism in Belarus. The association was awarded the prize in 2004.
Salima Ghezali
Some people find the media is the best way to spread their message. The 1997 winner, Algerian Salima Ghezali, founded her own newspaper in order to promote freedom of media and the rights of women. In her articles, she spoke out against censorship and the bad treatment of journalists in Algeria and also about the need to find a solution to the crisis in Algeria, pointing out the large number of victims among citizens and journalists. Her work brought criticism from Algerian authorities, who closed the paper. Yet, she continues fighting for her goals and for a future democratic Algeria.
