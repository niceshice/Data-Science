The Berlin signatories and MEPs debate its significance on Wednesday
When MEPs meet in Brussels they will discuss the recent Berlin Declaration, reform of the EU's budget, safety at sea, the future of Kosovo, organic food and EU foreign policy. Prior to the debate on the Berlin Declaration German Chancellor Angela Merkel will present her views (as current President of the Council) on its contents. Also in the Hemicycle will be Javier Solana - the EU's High Representative for foreign affairs who will make a statement on international relations.
Wednesday:
Berlin to Brussels: The three Presidents who signed the Berlin Declaration - for the Parliament Hans-Gert Pöttering, for the Commission José Manuel Barroso and Angela Merkel as current President of the Council - will be reunited on Wednesday. They will be in Parliament to take part in a debate on the Summit and the contents of the Berlin Declaration.
Budget reform - report looks at CAP and UK rebate: The EU's financial resources - in particular the financing of the CAP and the UK's rebate are the subject of a report drafted by European People's Party MEP Alain Lamassoure to be debate Wednesday. Entitled "The Future of the EU's own resources" it considers ways that reform of the system of own resources in the budget could be improved to provide fairer distribution between countries.
Safety at sea: Prompted by the sinking of the "Erika" off Brittany in 1999 and the "Prestige" off Spain in 2002, maritime legislation is being passed by the EU to improve safety at sea. Two reports considered on Friday - one on the duties of "flag states" (where the ship is registered) and another on the civil liability of ship-owners are 2 of 7 such reports. The others will be debated by MEPs in April.
Future of Kosovo - report on UN plan: MEPs will discuss a report by the Foreign Affairs Committee on the plan by UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari for the future of Kosovo. His plan envisages all the trappings of statehood - a flag and a constitution for example - without a full declaration of independence just yet. Mr Ahtisaari has made it clear he wants the EU to play a full role in the final status of Kosovo. This report emphasises the future "European perspective" of both Kosovo and Serbia.
Labelling of organic food: This report aims to use better labelling to guarantee against the contamination of organic food by GMO foodstuffs and stricter standards for plant health and veterinary products.
Thursday:
EU foreign policy in 2007: The EU's foreign policy falls under the spotlight on Thursday as the Union's High Representative for foreign affairs Javier Solana will address the house. The diplomatic confrontation over Iran's nuclear programme and the decision to place US missile bases in the Czech Republic and Poland are just two areas he is expected to touch upon.
Future and security of Football in Europe: A report on the future of professional football in Europe by Ivo Belet of the European Peoples Party and one on security at football matches by Giusto Catania of the European United Left will be voted on by MEPs on Thursday.
You can watch all of these debates and votes live here online from 1500 CET on Wednesday.
