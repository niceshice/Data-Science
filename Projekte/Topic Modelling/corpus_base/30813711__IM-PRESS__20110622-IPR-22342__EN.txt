An EU air safety agreement with Canada was approved by a show of hands in Parliament on Thursday. This agreement, the farthest-reaching of its kind with a third country to date, was signed in May 2009, but needed Parliament's consent under the Lisbon Treaty.
The agreement provides for mutual recognition of technical aviation and aircraft standards, which would eliminate the need for duplicate checks or certification procedures. It foresees joint inspections, investigations, exchange of aviation safety data and increased regulatory cooperation.
This is expected to enhance aviation safety, reduce red tape and facilitate trade between the two parties. The agreement also enhances certainty as to the law in EU-Canada relations, by recognising the principles of the EU internal aviation market and the status of a "Community carrier".
