Thursday in plenary saw MEPs debate the Court of Auditors Report for 2007 Thursday morning MEPs debated a report from the European Court of Auditors on EU expenditure in 2007. Many Members expressed concern at the high rate of errors and lack of accountability from EU states - who manage 80% of the budget. Parliament's Budgetary Control Committee will now start an in-depth look at expenditure through the "discharge procedure".
Discussions over the budget were followed by a debate over improving the powers of OLAF, the European Anti Fraud Office. Later MEPs voted on environmental inspection criteria, the Blue Card scheme, the banning of cluster munitions and the crisis in DR Congo and human rights issues.
Scrutinising the 2007 budget
The President of the European Court of Auditors, Vítor Manuel da Silva Caldeira, presented his findings to MEPs. He noted that for the 14th year running, the Commission had not received a clean bill of health, but acknowledged the progress made.
The largest error rates came in the funds for economic and social cohesion, where 11% of the spending was not in line with the rules.
MEPs dissatisfied with errors
While welcoming the report and its thorough and professional execution, MEPs were very dissatisfied by the high rate of errors and the lack of accountability by nation states.
The main political groups criticised EU Members for their part in the co-management of the EU funds and expressed disappointment that representatives of the Council didn't take part in the discussion.
Around 80% of the EU budget is managed at the final beneficiary level by the Member States, leaving the Commission exclusively accountable for around 20% of spending.
Defending the Commission's position, Vice-president Siim Kallas responsible for administrative affairs and audit said the Commission gives the highest priority to reducing error rates.
The Parliament now begins the discharge procedure, through which it "signs off" on the budget.
MEPs back a more independent Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)
MEPs later discussed and voted on a report with 92 amendments to the Commission's proposal to change the regulation of OLAF. The parliament wants more independence and autonomy for OLAF.
German Christian Democrat Ingeborg Grässle who drafted the report said: "We are behind this office, we want it and we want it to do its job properly."
Debates over human rights
In the afternoon's debates over human rights MEPs discussed the case of a 13 year old girl who was stoned to death in Somalia. The House condemned this crime and voiced its support for the Somali government's attempt to bring that area of the country under its control.
MEPs also condemned the continued use of the death penalty in Nigeria where 720 men and 11 women are under sentence of death in Nigeria's prisons.
In a resolution on the case of the al-Kurd family who have been evicted from their home in East Jerusalem by the Israeli authorities, Parliament voiced concern at this and other operations and pointed to the possible consequences for the peace process.
Thursday's other key votes
MEPs backed the Blue Card scheme to allow highly skilled immigrants to take jobs in the EU.
They called for member states to sign, ratify and implement a universal ban on cluster bomb manufacture.
Following an oral question to Council on Thursday, MEPs backed a recommendation for minimum criteria for environmental inspections in EU countries.
