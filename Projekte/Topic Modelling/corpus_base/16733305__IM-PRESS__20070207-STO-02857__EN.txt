Immigration: a common approach needed
Immigration
2007-02-09 - 10:45
In the summer of 2006 thousands of immigrants arrived in boats on the shores of the EU. Hundreds more were feared drowned in the attempt. Mainly they came to Italy and Spain - the countries closest to the African continent - although merely getting into the European Union was their objective. They are just part of a constant tide of people trying to get into the EU. Whether the Union can adopt one policy to stop or manage immigration was recently discussed at a hearing in the Parliament.
Two reports - one by Lilli Gruber and the other by Javier Moreno SÃ¡nchez - both of the Socialist PSE Group - were the working documents of the meeting organised by the Civil Liberties committee on 30 January.
Immigration can boost Europe's economy
The Gruber report acknowledges public fears that immigrants may overload the social security system - although she advances four points that need considering:
An ageing European population needs new workers to pay tax and keep the social security system solvent.
Immigration can act as a boost to Europe's economy.
By opening legal channels the EU can tackle the appalling blight of people trafficking.
The Moreno report stresses the need for efficient border control and for the reinforcement of the EU's border agency "Frontex" - currently based in Poland. This would help stem illegal immigration although the report calls for the rights of asylum seekers to be protected. Improving Frontex is also a priority of the new German Presidency of the EU.
As the hearing heard, migration pressures differ around the European Union. For example there is a difference in migration from other EU members and non-EU countries. If you are citizen of one country in the Union you have the right to live and work in another EU member - although certain restrictions exist from country to country.
In addition, the 15 member "Schengen area" does not have any frontier controls - making movement from one country to another very easy. Schengen is in the process of being expanded.
It is for these and other reasons that both rapporteurs advocate a common European approach.
EU employment office in Mali
The latest proposals from the European Commission support tackling the original causes of immigration - economic and social deprivation in countries outside the EU. It also wants clear rules established. The EU has just taken the decision to set up an experimental employment office in Mali - one of the world's poorest countries - to recruit temporary workers.
However, a common legal migration policy in the EU is lacking as this issue can only be changed by unanimity in the Council of Ministers. The Parliament has called in the past for decision making in this area to be changed. However the codecision procedure whereby the Parliament has the same legislative weight as the Council of Ministers does apply to the fight against illegal immigration, border controls and visas.
The two reports mentioned in this story will be voted on by MEPs in the Plenary session in May.
