The House paid tribute to Fausto CORREIA who died on Monday night, 8 October. Mr Fausto CORREIA was a Portuguese Member of the European Parliament from 2004. The House also paid tribute to former French MEP Christian de La Malène who died on 26 September.
EP President Pöttering calls for the abolition of the death penalty in the presence of freed Bulgarian medics
On the World Day against the death penalty (10 October), EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering stated that the European Parliament opposed the death penalty. President Pöttering paid tribute to the freed Bulgarian medics who were present in the Parliamentary Chamber. Mr Pöttering recalled that the Bulgarian medics were held in custody in Libya for eight years and said that the European Parliament had, on several occasions, called for the freeing of the medics and had opposed the death penalty.
MEP debated forthcoming crucial Lisbon summit and new Reform Treaty
The European Parliament debated the forthcoming European summit of heads of state and government to be held in Lisbon on 18 and 19 October. There was much debate as to the merits of the new Reform Treaty and how it compared to the Constitutional Treaty. The first MEPs to speak were Parliament's three representatives for ministerial level meetings of the Intergovernmental Conference.
Composition of the European Parliament after European elections in June 2009
MEPs adopted a report on the new allocation of seats in the European Parliament after the next legislative elections, in 2009. MEPs call for a revision of the proposed distribution of seats for the 2014-2019 parliamentary term. The report was adopted by 378 votes in favour, 154 against and 109 abstentions. The debate preceding the vote took place on Wednesday, 10 October.
MEPs give green light to the EU-US Open Sky agreement
In a report adopted on 11 October by 513 votes in favour to 15 against, with 35 abstentions, the European Parliament gave its green light to the EC-USA air transport agreement which was signed at the EU-US summit of 30 April 2007 and which the Council endorsed and decided to apply provisionally as from 30 March 2008.
MEPs call for 'master plan' for enhanced airport capacity
Within the EU, air traffic is growing at a rate of 5.2 % per annum. Thus, by the year 2025, the demand for flights will be 2.5 times higher than that of 2003. More than 60 airports would then be unable to handle the typical busy hourly demand without generating delays or unaccommodated demand (3.7 million flights a year would then be unaccommodated).
EU action to tackle murders of women in Central America and Mexico
MEPs adopted an own-initiative report by 560 votes in favour to 4 against, with 6 abstentions, with amendments on the murders of women in Central America and Mexico. The report is part of a global strategy for the eradication and prevention of feminicide and proposes EU actions in the framework of partnerships agreements.
EP adopts written declaration on "dys"crimination and social exclusion affecting children with "dys"abilities
In adopting a written declaration on on "dys"crimination and social exclusion affecting children with "dys"abilities, MEPs ask the Commission and Council to draw up a charter for "dys" children, and to encourage the recognition of "dys"-type problems as a handicap.
MEPs express "deepest concern" about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza
In adopting a joint resolution on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, MEPs expressed their deepest concern about the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip and its possible grave consequences. Parliament stressed that human rights and international humanitarian law must be fully respected in the area. The European Parliament reiterated its call on all sides to renounce violence.
Cigarette smuggling (EC-Philip Morris agreement)
MEPs adopted a non-binding report on cigarette smuggling (EC-Philip Morris agreement). The European Parliament, supported by the Council and the European Court of Auditors, is recommending that, in order to prevent fraud, transit movements be computerised, the legal framework be revised and the Commission and the Member States improve physical checks based on common risk analysis
Identifying farm aid beneficiaries to strengthen public support for the CAP
European taxpayers view the management of EU farm aid as unfathomable and riddled with flaws, which undermines the legitimacy of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). So a European Commission proposal to improve the transparency and budgetary implementation of this aid is welcomed by the European Parliament, although its members would like to go even further.
Collection and management of data on the Common Fisheries Policy
The House adopted a report by 382 votes in favour to 11 against with 5 abstentions on the collection and management of data on the Common Fisheries Policy. The European Parliament approves a Commission proposal amending Regulation 1543/2000, which establishes a Community framework for the collection and management of the data needed to conduct the Common Fisheries Policy. In the light of new thinking on fisheries management and to prepare for a maritime policy for the EU, the Commission proposes that this regulation is repealed and replaced by a new more comprehensive data collection regulation.

MEP debated forthcoming crucial Lisbon summit and new Reform Treaty
2007-10-11 - 17:59
The European Parliament debated the forthcoming European summit of heads of state and government to be held in Lisbon on 18 and 19 October. There was much debate as to the merits of the new Reform Treaty and how it compared to the Constitutional Treaty. The first MEPs to speak were Parliament's three representatives for ministerial level meetings of the Intergovernmental Conference. Elmar BROK (EPP-ED, DE) said the progress made was an example of good operation between presidencies, in this case German and Portuguese. "We decided to support this mandate not because it is the one of our dreams, but because it was the best possible way in the circumstances to get more democracy and effectiveness for the EU in its enlarged state." There would, he said, be better decision making in Council, new responsibilities in energy and security, the end of the "third pillar" in justice and home affairs (JHA) and Parliament would have equal rights over JHA matters, agriculture and the budget. "The big democratic hole in the side of Europe has been closed," he said.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights would make the EU a "union of values", he said, since it would be legally binding in EU level joint decisions, notwithstanding some opt-outs for national level implementing measures.
Some problems remained: the issue of protection of personal data in external relations needed to be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and judicial oversight, he said, and the future "Foreign Minister who cannot be called a Foreign Minister" should not be appointed without the approval of the future Commission President and the approval of the whole Commission, of which he would be part, by Parliament.
Enrique BARÓN CRESPO (PES, ES) said all three EP representatives had been united in seeking more democracy and effectiveness for the EU - he regretted there was not more transparency, but that, he said, was the result of the IGC process. "The Charter of Fundamental Rights will no longer be a statement, it will be solemnly proclaimed by the Presidents of the three institutions and will be legally binding," he said, this being a sine qua non for Parliament's support for the Treaty.
He welcomed that citizenship of the EU had been reinstated in the Treaty, using the wording from Maastricht. Progress could still be made on data protection, and also on dialogue with social partners. Mr Baron said it was possible to "build confidence" via the Ionanina declaration, but more mechanisms giving an option for unanimity in areas where the Council should operate by a majority vote would be wrong: "It is like the atomic bomb - it is only useful as long as you don't use it - otherwise the whole thing is destroyed."
All should now work together to achieve ratification, he concluded: "If not will find ourselves in very difficult circumstances. All need to be loyal to the compromise reached here."
Andrew DUFF (ALDE, UK) said: I agree that a political agreement is probable at the IGC in Lisbon. But the thing that concerns us still of course is the quality of the agreement. I have to express concern at the present stage of the IGC that we are seeing the emergence of a self-service Europe propelled principally by the British demands for the opt-outs in the field of justice and interior affairs and fundamental rights."
"Clearly there has to be a British domestic debate about why British citizens ought to be excluded from the benefits of integration inside all these important fields, but the British should also explain themselves more fully to the IGC. What is it precisely that they are seeking to achieve with all these opt-outs?" Can we be truly satisfied that the arrangements that are negotiated for the management of this pick and choose approach will stand up in practice and ensure that common policies in the field of freedom, security and justice will still enjoy proper commonality and the full resources and instruments to carry them out? Surely the UK and Polish opt-out on the Charter risks subverting the decision to make it binding for everyone else. I hope that the IGC can be able to examine the question with sufficient care. Would the Presidency press the British to support the proposal from the Parliament for an escape clause from their unfortunate protocol on the Charter? The same applies to Ioaninna."
Political Group speakers
Joseph DAUL (FR) for the EPP-ED group said the period of reflection had reached an end. Are we ready to take action, he asked? "We are giving the EU the necessary tools for it to function effectively", he said. We believe in a united Europe, strong and efficient, which can take up its rile in global affairs which change so rapidly. We can not live with the rules based on the Treaty of Nice. We have called for more transparency and more democracy. "
The Reform Treaty, he said, is a means and not an end in itself. Its name does not mean much, only the substance and the progress it will bring to citizens. "We do not want a European state." We want super efficiency, democracy, transparency and the respect of subsidiarity. European citizens want a Europe which acts on the climate, on energy, on immigration, on innovation, on terrorism. I hope and I wish that this Treaty will let us do that and we support it".
Martin SCHULZ (PES, DE) stated that we can be optimistic regarding the Lisbon Summit because, but for a few exceptions, it's exactly the same as the mandate from the June Summit. Anything other than that would have been unacceptable for the Socialists. We'll now have to fight in all MS to make sure the process of integration can be taken forward. I hope all members of your group will fight for it, Mr Daul.
If this fails then it is the end of the EU as we know it. Europeans may think Europe is big: 500m people, 27 MS, a big market. But we're only 8% of the global population. India and China make up 33% of the world's population. If we want to defend our achievements in the social sphere and defend the basis of our welfare states, we have to be able to compete and we can only compete if we are united and that's why we need the reform treaty. If want peace in Europe, more jobs, growth, more justice and freedom, we must defend the reform treaty
If we want to renationsalise policies, we need to recall the words of President Mitterand in this House many years ago: nationalism is the opposite of European integration and nationalism means war. Europe was born from wartime wounds; European integration has to be the aim of all democratic forces.
Graham WATSON (ALDE, UK) compared Portuguese PM Socrates to Shakespeare's Henry V before the Battle of Agincourt. "Your PM must hold firm to Europe's red lines," he said: "Once more unto the breach dear friends once more." Failure would be a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions. Unanimity cannot work as it takes things to the lowest common denominator and this is not enough when we need to deal with issues such as climate change and terrorism.
One thing we cannot live without is a definition of European citizenship (as in Article 8) because it has real implications for all people. We can't have two classes of citizens and we are opposed to the idea of UK and Polish opt outs being preserved in perpetuity. We demand a clause of revocation without the need to call a new Inter-governmental Conference. And we suggest those that cannot accept this start thinking of an amicable divorce from the EU if they cannot accept this.
The interests of Europe must take precedence. To end on a Shakespearean note: Bend your sinews; bend up every spirit to its full height in defence of our common interest.
Konrad SZYMAŃSKI (UEN, PL) questioned whether it is a good time to gang up on Poland and the UK? It is said that the Charter of Fundamental Rights merely bolsters existing provisions? But what if the European Court of Justice interprets it further. I understand the concerns of Poland and the UK.
It is not Eurosceptics who came up with the notion of a lack of control. It is no less a personality than former German President Herzog who asked if Germany was still a democracy given that so much legislation is being adopted outside the German Parliament.
Monica FRASSONI (Greens/EFA, IT) -We are a few days away from the IGC and the usual horse-trading is going on leading to a downwards compromise. The text is user unfriendly and does not in any way involve citizens. Where is the clarity of law? It is a government plot to go behind their citizens' backs. Bureaucratic and legalistic rather than the democratic and open consultations of the Convention and the referendums - for good or ill. Transparency has not improved. This treaty is damage limitation not an improvement. What was the point of the Parliament's role in the IGC? We do not wish to be jointly responsible for this text. Why do some MEPs turn the possible loss of such a treaty into such a drama? The text is vile! No ordinary person will look at it. It is not what any ordinary person wants. If we are to be responsible and credible to our citizens we will support the Treaty but we cannot like it. Governments have torpedoed the process and made what we could have had an impossibility.
Francis WURTZ (GUE/NGL, FR) - Will not repeat our group's general evaluation. We are opposed to it not because we are nationalists but because none of our basic concerns have been addressed. This is an error which will be paid for . I want to refer to one article, article 24. We question this protection of citizens' rights via a vis the processing of personal data. The legal procedure will differ as to whether within the EU or in a third country. ECJ jurisdiction will not run beyond EU. Takes us straight back to the debate on Passenger data and the US and what happened despite the European Parliament's opposition. The situation is not acceptable. We should state this clearly to the Council. Reveals further problems: the Charter of Fundamental Rights really has very little impact as what the Treaty says violates article 8 of the Charter.
So much of the Treaty is incomprehensible except for the well initiated. The mystery of the IGC's workings was unacceptable in the production of a document which will affect the lives of millions. We have a two fold democratic plea: for a wide-ranging debate in all Member States and ratification by referenda.
Jens-Peter BONDE (IND/DEM, DK) - We have been told there will be a new treaty. This time it will get the green light. At the last Strasbourg session the President suggested all MEPs should receive the IGC documents. This has not happened. Three political groups have had a privileged position in relation to documents. This is not fair as five groups have not been in this privileged position. 105 new powers in the Treaty , 62 types of decisions have been changed - more than in the Constitution. We have a text which is impossible to read. What we have is Sarkozy's mini treaty and no referendum. No real legal basis. Different names. No referendum - hypocritical to say the least and regrettable.
Frank VANHECKE (ITS, BE) said that the Reform Treaty was being "forced down our throats" and totally undemocratic. He was opposed to the idea of decisions on immigration being taken at the European level. The EU, he said, was causing a "brain-drain from poor African countries".
Maciej Marian GIERTYCH (NI, PL) said that the substance of the Reform Treaty and the Constitutional Treaty were much the same. The "lower ranking" of the document was a way to avoid referenda.
British speakers
Jim ALLISTER (NI, UK) On past performance, I suspect that the Council will be an occasion when British red lines will become pink smudges, later to be rubbed out entirely by the federalising European Court of Justice. Opt-out, opt-in, shake it all about, the British Government will claim victory, others will publicly indulge them, knowing that any apparent concessions are really without any substance. All this is to con the British public into believing that the Reform Treaty is actually materially different from the rejected Constitution, when patently it is not.
Now that Mr Gordon Brown has bottled out of an election, the need for a British referendum is greater than ever. No election means Labour’s 2005 manifesto commitment of a referendum must stand. No referendum means no mandate for Mr Brown to proceed to ratification, and that is the bottom line upon which all democrats in the United Kingdom should unite.
Timothy KIRKHOPE (EPP-ED, UK) thanked the Council and Commission for their statements. The Lisbon informal summit is going to be a crucial event, having had the publication of the draft Reform Treaty which Heads of State and Government will focus on when they meet there. But the IGC process has been rushed too much. Indeed, the British Government says it has only had two days to consider the draft mandate. The proposals are of course, as has been said by other speakers, very much the same as those contained in the original constitutional text.
The British Prime Minister has a problem. It is called trust - trust in what he says. For the past few weeks he has encouraged his Ministers to talk up prospects of an election in the UK and then when the political going got rough, he backed down. I think his European colleagues, fellow European leaders, should be very careful that whatever he says in Lisbon, he is likely to mean something completely different. British Conservatives of course will continue to demand a referendum on the Treaty. The vast majority of British people want one, including most of the Government's own supporters. If the Prime Minister continues to resist that pressure, despite a clear election manifesto pledge, then the British people will have further confirmation that he cannot be trusted. The leader of my party said that this could well be a blatant breach of trust - one of the greatest and most blatant breaches of trust in modern politics.
Richard CORBETT (PES, UK) congratulated the Portuguese Presidency on the progress they have made towards securing consensus. But, of course, we have heard from many colleagues today that there is considerable disappointment in this Parliament. There are many who are disappointed at the loss of the idea of a constitution that would have replaced the current treaties and refounded our Union on a new legal base.
There are others who are disappointed at the numerous changes that have been secured and the special provisions and derogations for certain Member States.
Some of these changes are of course unfortunate. But they are the price that has to be paid to secure agreement of all 27 countries capable of being ratified by all 27 countries.
That is the situation that we are faced with. There is no way around the fact that this Treaty has to be acceptable to all Member States and ratified by all Member States.
Colleagues should not lose sight of the overall picture. This Treaty, even in this form, contains many vital reforms. We need those reforms. The Union needs those reforms. Anyone who wants a well-functioning and democratically accountable Union should support these reforms.
And the alternative to the reformed Treaty is more of the same. But, with years more wrangling on the institutions and the mechanics of the European Union.
I would rather secure the reformed Treaty and then move on with a greater capacity for the Union to address the real issues that citizens are interested in: climate change; the performance of our economy; overseas development aid; the environment. All those things for which we need the Union, because alone and separate, we are not effective, but together we can do more.
Let us move on and get these institutional issues settled once and for all. Draft Reform Treaty

Composition of the European Parliament after European elections in June 2009
2007-10-11 - 17:59
MEPs adopted a report on the new allocation of seats in the European Parliament after the next legislative elections, in 2009. MEPs call for a revision of the proposed distribution of seats for the 2014-2019 parliamentary term. The report was adopted by 378 votes in favour, 154 against and 109 abstentions. The allocation of seats approved follows the rules established by the June 2007 European Council, which invited the European Parliament to present a proposal by October this year. The Council stipulated that the EP is limited to a total of 750 seats and that no Member State should have more than 96 seats or less than six. Finally, it also says that the distribution should respect the "degressive proportionality" principle.
The European Parliament proposes that the "degressive proportionality" means that bigger Member States agree to accept fewer seats than they would receive if the total were divided according to population size, so as to allow for better representation of less-densely populated states. The two co-rapporteurs based their proposal on the EUROSTAT figures for the number of residents in each Member State, as approved by the Council.
On the following page you will see the allocation of seats in the European Parliament for the 2009-2014 parliamentary term, as proposed by the two co-rapporteurs, Alain Lamassoure (EPP-ED, FR) and Adrian Severin (PES, RO), and which was approved:

UK and Ireland
The Nice Treaty and the Accession Treaties for Romania and Bulgaria allocated 72 MEPs for the UK for the 2009 European elections. In the EP report, the UK has 73 MEPs. For Ireland, there is no change with both Nice and the EP report allocating 12 MEPs to Ireland for the 2009 European elections.
Call to revise distribution in time for the 2014-2019 elections
In approving the European Council's draft decision, the House asks that the proposed distribution be revised, well in advance of the beginning of the 2014-2019 legislative term, so as to set up an objective and fair system for allocating the seats in the EP, in order take account of demographic changes and "avoid the traditional political horse-trading between Member States".
MEPs also decided to examine the political and technical feasibility of replacing the number of residents, as established annually by the EU statistics office, with the number of European citizens.
The House decided not to consider future Member States, such as Croatia, when allocating seats, so as to avoid pre-judging future enlargements. It also proposed that future accessions may be accompanied by a temporary increase over and above the 750-seat ceiling, as was done for Bulgaria and Romania.
According to current rules, as laid down by the 2005 Accession Act of Bulgaria and Romania, the number of MEPs should be reduced to 736. The draft Reform Treaty lays down that the new composition of the EP will be decided by the European Council acting by unanimity, on the basis of Parliament's proposal and after obtaining its consent. In the approved report, MEPs in the committee call on the Member States to adopt this proposal immediately after the Reform Treaty enters into force.
Debate - Wednesday, 10 October 2007
The House debated its future composition on a basis of a report from Alain Lamassoure (EPP-ED, FR) and Adrian Severin (PES, RO). The allocation of seats follows the rules established by the June European Council, which invited the Parliament to present a proposal by October. The Council said that the EP is limited to a total of 750 seats. No Member State should have more than 96 seats or less than six. It also says that the distribution should respect the "degressive proportionality" principle.
The debate began with the two co-rapporteurs taking the floor.
Alain LAMASSOURE (EPP-ED, FR) said the future treaty would make the composition of Parliament a matter of secondary law to be decided unanimously by the Council on the basis of a proposal from - and with the assent of - Parliament itself. The Council had asked Parliament to apply this provision ahead of time and "deal with this hot potato". He welcomed the two third's majority for the report at committee stage, which suggested the EP could rise to the challenge.
The time of dividing Member States into groups of extra large, large, medium and small and giving members of each group the same votes in Council and number of seats in Parliament was over. Now the treaty would set a maximum size of Parliament at 750 members, with each Member State having no more than 96 and no fewer than 6 MEPs. Parliament had been asked to define and apply the principle of "degressive proportionality" to the dividing up of seats. This meant that MEPs from larger Member States should each represent more citizens than those from smaller ones.
By using the ceilings and floors in representation to the full, some current anomalies (like each Spanish MEP representing more citizens than each German one, despite Germany being more populous) could be eliminated. It would also be possible to have no Member State lose any seats compared to the Nice Treaty arrangements - something Mr Lamassoure saw as politically essential to get unanimity in Council.
"This is just an interim solution," he said. "It would have been better to come up with a mathematical solution which would have dealt almost automatically with future enlargements, but the short deadline made this impossible. Still we have come up with a good proposal." He urged MEPs to act in the European interest, and not defend narrow national positions. If the proposal was un-balanced in favour of smaller or larger states, it would not succeed in Council, he said.
Adrian SEVERIN (PES, RO) said that if adopted our proposals will mean no more artificial groupings. They are more representative of demographic realities, and will mean more solidarity between big and small, full legitimacy in relation to civic representation. We the European Parliament are representative of the citizens and of the States at the same time. We are the Bundestag and the Bundesrat. The concept of citizenship remains to be clarified. The report is not provisional but transitional. It is long-lasting but allows for progress to be made in the future. We include revision clauses for flexibility, adaptability and to allow future progress. No one is penalised. No one loses, no one wins. There is more legitimacy so everybody wins. Some argue for less degressivity and more proportionality. These are the bigger states who want more seats. The smaller countries argue the opposite. The report rejects both positions to promote an acceptable compromise. If we fail to adopt the report the message will go out that the European Parliament cannot decide for itself and that it always has to wait for the Executive to decide. This could be a prelude to the total failure of the IGC. He concluded by saying that "I appeal to your sense of European responsibility and European solidarity."
Political group speakers
Ingo FRIEDRICH (EPP-ED, DE) said that he was grateful for the report as it clarifies things. He said "We are moving towards proportionality as less degressivity equals more legitimacy. We need to have this debate. How degressive is degressive?" As a German, he continued I have certain problems. "We Germans are the only ones who get less than Nice. There is quite a debate in the German media on this issue currently. We put up with it because we believe the European interest is the more important. We should be working towards a logical system for the long-term and stop this endless debate", he stated. He said that no matter what happens with the result of the vote of "controversial" amendments 2 and 3, the group will vote in favour of the final resolution, as we do not want to give an excuse to Council to renegotiate. "We need to send a clear message to the Council. We have lived up to our responsibilities on this difficult issue."
Richard CORBETT (PES, UK) said that his group supports this report which was adopted with a 70% majority in committee. The rapporteurs, he said, have sensibly focused on correcting the main anomalies of current seat distribution rather than going for radical overhaul.
"Some colleagues are trying to win more seats for their own Member State, arguing that their countries are bigger than Eurostat says; others say that for reasons of national prestige they have to have more seats. I am surprised at the attitude of the Italian Government which has been arguing that they should have the same as France and UK in spite of the fact that they had accepted the principle of proportional degression in line with population. I have accepted that the UK should have one fewer than France; why should not Italy accept that they will have fewer seats than France for the same reason. I am surprised that a government with such strong European commitment should argue on the basis of national prestige even though its population is less."
Andrew DUFF (ALDE, UK) for the Liberal group also supported the proposal from the rapporteurs. "We need to send a strong clear message back to the European Council that we are able to take such a sophisticated and brave decision in tune with the Reform Treaty", he said.
"I too regret some national delegations seeking to improve their position on the league table but all such proposals are mutually contradictory. I understand the Italians raise an interesting point on the statistical basis, and we should apply the distinction between nationality, citizenship, residency and voters but it is extraordinarily complicated and it treads firmly on national sovereignty for electoral law and citizenship and we cannot solve it in the space of a week before the end of the IGC.
Meanwhile let us give solid support to the proposal and send a solution rather than a problem to the IGC."
Brian CROWLEY (UEN, IE) said that "ultimately Turkeys don’t vote for Christmas so why would any MEP look to see their seat taken away and there are legitimate reasons to seek their own national numbers maintained. If we look back to changes since 1979 there have been phenomenal demographic and population changes, not least because of so much free movement since the 2004 enlargement of the EU."
When we look at the Eurostat figures being used, out of 27 countries, 15 sets of figures from the national statistical offices are only provisional figures. Yet this vote can have a lasting impact; and we also need to look at future enlargement to include Croatia, so I urge caution."
The Greens/EFA group would not approve the report, because it "breaches elementary principles of fairness and perpetuates historical inequalities", said Johannes VOGGENHUBER (Greens/EFA, AT)
Parliament "represents voters, not the socio-economic capacity of states. If there is no demos, then there is no parliament", he continued, stressing that citizens' rights to representation do exist - they are enshrined, for example, in the existing treaties, the Charter, Court of Justice decisions and electoral law.
"We failed once, when we were not consulted on Nice", he continued, and "should have used the intervening seven years to define arrangements for parliamentary representation", he concluded.
Personally, Sylvia-Yvonne KAUFMANN (GUE/NGL, DE) felt that the report approached the issues in a truly European spirit, and that its proposals constitute a "balanced, easily-graspable system" that can accommodate future enlargement of the Union and takes account of each country's key concerns.
"Degressive proportionality will bolster cohesion" she affirmed, adding that that third-country nationals resident in EU countries should be entitled to vote.
"The usual thing in debates like this is to argue about how many seats each state should get - which shows that the 'European spirit' is a myth" said Bernard WOJCIECHOWSKI (IND/DEM, PL), citing "complaints" that Germany will lose seats, is the biggest net contributor to the EU, and should have its own seat on the UN Security Council.
"Only a Socialist from Yorkshire could accept that 2 + 2 = 5", he concluded.
Luca ROMAGNOLI (ITS, IT) said that the report "should be rejected with scorn as it ignored many facts". Italy, he said, had contributed greatly to the development of the EU. Why for example should Malta and Estonia have the same number of MEPs (6) even though Estonia's population is three times bigger?"
Irena BELOHORSKÁ (NI, SK)said the idea of proportional degressivity should be also applied to employment in the EU institutions which would large increase in the number of people from the "new" EU Member States working in these institutions.
Irish speaker in the debate
Proinsias DE ROSSA (PES, IE) stated that once we move away from strict proportionality in elections, we inevitably end up applying political compromise rather than pure mathematics. The democratic principle that all votes should have equal weight is something that cannot be applied until such time as the European Union becomes a fully federal system, he stated
Within the limits set by the Council, this political compromise by Mr Severin and Mr Lamassoure is a reasonable and well-balanced effort to achieve fair play and solidarity for all the people of the European Union. While Mr De Rossa supported it, he stated that he opposed the alternative systems that are being proposed as less fair and less balanced.
But, because, he said, some have approached this exercise as a national ego trip, it needs to be emphasised that we are dealing here with how citizens elect their representatives to this Parliament according to their political preferences, to act as a co-legislator with the Council. It is the Council that represents the state and not this House, he concluded. Text, as adopted by the EP on 11 October, will shortly be available here

EP President Pöttering calls for the abolition of the death penalty in the presence of freed Bulgarian medics
2007-10-11 - 17:59
On the World Day against the death penalty (10 October), EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering stated that the European Parliament opposed the death penalty. President Pöttering paid tribute to the freed Bulgarian medics who were present in the Parliamentary Chamber. Mr Pöttering recalled that the Bulgarian medics were held in custody in Libya for eight years and said that the European Parliament had, on several occasions, called for the freeing of the medics and had opposed the death penalty. "We thank all countries that have abolished the death penalty, in particular Rwanda. We also call on China to break its 'wall of silence' on the use of the death penalty. We appeal for support for the EU sponsored UN resolution and for all countries to support it in New York".
The European Parliament, has in fact, he recalled, adopted three resolutions on the abolition of the death penalty this year and "we pay tribute to all victims of the death penalty." MEPs observed a minute of silence in their memory. The Council of Europe declares the 10th of October European Day against the Death Penalty Press Release - 10 October 2007

MEPs give green light to the EU-US Open Sky agreement
2007-10-11 - 17:59
In a report adopted on 11 October by 513 votes in favour to 15 against, with 35 abstentions, the European Parliament gave its green light to the EC-USA air transport agreement which was signed at the EU-US summit of 30 April 2007 and which the Council endorsed and decided to apply provisionally as from 30 March 2008. The agreement deals with, inter alia
• The possibility to operate flights beyond the European Union and the United States towards third countries ('5th Freedom') and to operate all-cargo flights beyond the United States to a third country, without a requirement that the service starts in the EU (7th Freedom - All Cargo).
• A unilateral granting by the United States to the EU of the so-called '7th Freedom rights for Passengers' to a number of non-EU European countries, i.e. the right for Community airlines to operate flights between a city in the United States and a city in these European countries.
• The possibility for any "Community air carrier" to fly between any point in the EU to any point in the US, without any restrictions on pricing or capacity. This freedom does not exist for the moment.
• Rights in the area of ownership, investment and control of US airlines by EU investors.
• The possibility for the EU to restrict US investments in Community airlines.
• A number of access rights for Community airlines to the US 'Fly America' programme for the transport of passengers and cargo financed by the US Federal government. Such rights have never previously been granted by the United States to a third country.
Parliament has given its first appreciation of the draft agreement in form of a resolution on 14 March 2007. In this resolution Parliament underlined that the issues not resolved in this first-stage agreement should be dealt with in the second-stage agreement. These issues are cabotage, right of establishment and ownership.
Furthermore, the Parliament proposes the concept of 'one stop security' and emphasised the need to reduce the negative environmental impact of aviation on climate change. Parliament wishes to be fully informed and consulted before and throughout the second-stage negotiations by the Commission. The EP underlines the importance of regular meetings between its Members and the US Congress.
Background
Air services between the EU and US presently operate on the basis of bilateral agreements between individual Member States and the US. These bilateral agreements contain provisions that the European Court of Justice ruled in November 2002 to be incompatible with Community law. Therefore it was decided to create a new legal framework for EU-US aviation relations and negotiations on an Air Transport Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, on the one hand, and the United States of America, on the other hand, were conducted by the European Commission under a mandate received from the Council in June 2003. This mandate set the objective of establishing an Open Aviation Area (OAA) between the EU and US, creating a single market for air transport between the EU and US in which investment could flow freely and in which European and US airlines would be able to provide air services without any restriction, including in the domestic markets of both parties.

MEPs call for 'master plan' for enhanced airport capacity
2007-10-11 - 17:59
Within the EU, air traffic is growing at a rate of 5.2 % per annum. Thus, by the year 2025, the demand for flights will be 2.5 times higher than that of 2003. More than 60 airports would then be unable to handle the typical busy hourly demand without generating delays or unaccommodated demand (3.7 million flights a year would then be unaccommodated). The European Parliament therefore calls for a "master plan" for enhanced airport capacity in order to promote and better coordinate any national and cross-border initiative for building new airport capacities as well as making better use of existing capacities.
MEPs stress that adequate airport capacity and efficient ground handling and use of capacity are vital to the European economy and must be ensured. The shortage of capacity and the increase in demand for flights will probably lead to demand for new major airports (up to 10 according to a Eurocontrol study) and medium-sized airports (up to 15 according to Eurocontrol).
Although the planning of new infrastructure remains within the competence of the Member States, the House calls on the Commission to present before 2009 a master plan for enhanced airport capacity in Europe, in order to promote and better coordinate any national and cross-border initiative for building new airport capacities dedicated to international traffic and to make better use of existing capacities. Members took the view that only the cohabitation of various airport models according to national specificities (major hubs or regional airports through point-to point travels) will enable the EU to fulfil its need in this field.
Promoting environmentally-friendly growth
Despite progress as regards the environmental performance of aviation, MEPs argue that the growth in air traffic has resulted in a "sharp increase" in the total volume of greenhouse gas emissions produced by this sector (+100 % compared to 1990), and that airport congestion is contributing significantly to this. A more efficient use of airport capacity is therefore vital. Also, the growth of air transport will have to be accompanied by technical and regulatory schemes limiting the external costs of this mode, such as the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). However, Parliament points out that that the efficiency of measures designed to reduce the environmental impact of air transport also depends on the policies pursued by countries at global level and, that programmes with third countries are needed.

EU action to tackle murders of women in Central America and Mexico
2007-10-11 - 17:59
MEPs adopted an own-initiative report by 560 votes in favour to 4 against, with 6 abstentions, with amendments on the murders of women in Central America and Mexico. The report is part of a global strategy for the eradication and prevention of feminicide and proposes EU actions in the framework of partnerships agreements. The report drafted by Raül Romeva i Rueda (Greens/EFA, ES) is the outcome of a hearing held at the European Parliament in April 2006 on the subject of feminicide in Mexico and Central America, organised by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and the Subcommittee on Human Rights.
Feminicides : a global issue
According to the definition laid down in the report, the world "feminicide" should be understood as "any act or conduct, based on gender, which causes death or physical, sexual or psychological harm or sexual harm or suffering to women, whether in the public or the private sphere".
Central America and Mexico have witnessed a sharp increase in violent killings in recent years. The cases of two European women murdered in Mexico, Hester Van Nierop in 1998 and Brenda Susana Margaret Searle in 2001, have symbolic value.
However, violence against women has a global dimension and concerns all countries, Europe included, and this report, MEPs stress, should be considered as part of a global strategy for the eradication and prevention of violent deaths of women. The report urges the countries to take all necessary steps for the effective combating of violence towards women and to take measures to ensure full respect for human rights. However, the aim of the European Parliament's resolution is to "issue an invitation to take concrete steps to improve what it sees as unsatisfactory state of affairs in states" and does not constitute "any kind of accusation or charge sheet against states which are sovereign and considered as equal partners in the field of international politics".
Action at European level
In the report, MEPs ask the national governments in the framework of their bilateral relations with the countries of Latin America, and European Institutions within their strategic partnership, to support the prevention and protection policies relating to violence. They also insist that the European members of the EU-Mexico Joint Parliamentary Committee, as well as Parliament's delegation for relations with the countries of Central America, include systematically the issue of feminicide and impunity in the programmes for their visits to the region.
The report also stresses the need for the European Union to give priority to the restructuring and reinforcement of judicial and prison systems. Such actions should be conducted in partnership with the International Labour Organization and with the OECD's National Contact Point of Mexico in order to devise programmes aimed at ensuring safety, decent working conditions and equal pay for women.
The European Commission should, MEPs believe, coordinate the different European initiatives and submit such initiatives to Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. They also propose that EU representations and Member States' embassies organise a round table on feminicide and impunity and that a joint hearing be organised by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, the Subcommittee on Human Rights and the delegations concerned, before the EU/Latin America summit in Lima in May 2008, with a view to evaluating the measures in place.

EP adopts written declaration on "dys"crimination and social exclusion affecting children with "dys"abilities
2007-10-11 - 17:59
In adopting a written declaration on on "dys"crimination and social exclusion affecting children with "dys"abilities, MEPs ask the Commission and Council to draw up a charter for "dys" children, and to encourage the recognition of "dys"-type problems as a handicap. The written declaration was sponsored by Marie PANAYOTOPOULOS-CASSIOTOU (EPP-ED, EL) Richard HOWITT (PES, UK), Kathy SINNOTT (IND/DEM, IE), Roberta ANGELILLI (UEN, IT) and Anna ZÁBORSKÁ (EPP-ED, SK) and signed by over half of all MEPs (406 so far), the required number for it to become an official position of the European Parliament.
It is estimated annually that more than 10% of children are affected by one or other "dys"-type disability such as dysphasia, dyspraxia, dyslexia, dyscalculia or attention deficit disorder, etc., and whereas the statistics on these disorders need to be refined
MEP want to promote and encourage the creation of a European multidisciplinary network on specific learning difficulties, and by this means to collect and study information and promote the coordination of cross-border actions, as well as institutional dialogue.
The declaration calls for the sharing of best practice by:
– making information accessible,
– taking timely steps to spot, screen, systematically diagnose and treat these disorders at an early stage,
– designing effective pedagogical structures within both the ordinary and the specialist educational environment for young children, adolescents and young adults,
– adapting structures for integrating young people with these disabilities into the world of work.
The only way to prevent "dys"crimination, say MEP, against affected children is to give them special, early, intensive and multidisciplinary treatment in appropriate structures (either in the normal school environment with appropriate special care, or in a specialised establishment.

Humanitarian aid
MEPs express "deepest concern" about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza
2007-10-11 - 17:59
In adopting a joint resolution on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, MEPs expressed their deepest concern about the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip and its possible grave consequences. Parliament stressed that human rights and international humanitarian law must be fully respected in the area. The European Parliament reiterated its call on all sides to renounce violence. The House calls on Israel to fulfil its international obligations under the Geneva Conventions to guarantee the flow of humanitarian aid, humanitarian assistance and essential services, such as electricity and fuel, to the Gaza Strip.
International Peace Conference - secure and recognised borders
Parliament expresses its wish that the efforts to convene an international peace conference should contribute to achieving a just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians, based on the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, the right of the State of Israel to live within secure and recognised borders, and the right to a viable state for Palestinians.
The European Parliament calls for the lifting of the blockade of the Gaza Strip and calls on Israel to ensure the movement of people and goods at Rafah, in compliance with the Agreement on Movement and Access and the EU Border Assistance Mission, as well as the movement of goods at Karni.
MEPs call on the Council, the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Commission to face up to their full responsibility on the implementation of this Agreement.
Parliament calls on Israel to guarantee the flow of financial assets to the Gaza Strip, which has been suspended since 25 September 2007, and considers that the lack of access to any financial assets has a serious impact on the economic, social and daily life of the Palestinian people.
Parliament calls on the Palestinian Authority and Hamas to facilitate, despite the political deadlock, the functioning of the public institutions providing essential services and the operations of international humanitarian offices, agencies and organisations seeking to improve the living conditions of all Palestinians living in the area.
MEPs call on the Council and the Commission to continue to guarantee, together with the international community, essential humanitarian aid for the Palestinian population, with special regard to the specific needs of particularly vulnerable groups.
Finally, the House urges the Council and the Commission to ensure, in compliance with the Association Agreements with Israel and with the Palestinian National Authority, that international humanitarian law and human rights are fully respected in the area, including by non-state actors, in order to preserve the necessary humanitarian space.

Cigarette smuggling (EC-Philip Morris agreement)
2007-10-11 - 17:59
MEPs adopted a non-binding report on cigarette smuggling (EC-Philip Morris agreement). The European Parliament, supported by the Council and the European Court of Auditors, is recommending that, in order to prevent fraud, transit movements be computerised, the legal framework be revised and the Commission and the Member States improve physical checks based on common risk analysis UK affected
The report observes that the House of Lords considers that approximately 4% of the UK's potential VAT revenue is being lost each year due to carousel fraud; notes the House of Lords' findings that, although it appeared more lucrative to commit VAT fraud in intra-Community trade, it can also occur in trade involving trade with third countries. The committee is deeply concerned about the House of Lords' explanations that, in the latter cases, the abuse of the Community transit system forms part of the classical pattern of carousel fraud.
The European Parliament is grateful that the House of Lords addressed the vulnerability of the Community transit system to fraud, although the European Court of Auditors had not focused on the UK in particular. The House warmly welcomes the House of Lords' recommendation "that Government works with other Member States to ensure that the European Court of Auditors' proposed changes to the Community Transit system are prioritised in order to attack the supply chain for this variant of (...) fraud."
The report calls on the other Member States to cooperate with the UK Government in order finally to make the Community Transit System fraud proof.
The agreement with Philip Morris
The report recalls that the agreement with Philip Morris to end all litigation between parties, under which Philip Morris was committed to pay US$1.25bn over a period of 12 years, and which aimed at combating fraud and illicit cigarette trade, was a major step forward.
The European Parliament notes that, under the agreement, Philip Morris will enhance the tracing and tracking of its products so as to assist law enforcement authorities in combating illegal trade.
The report also notes that, under the agreement, Philip Morris has to pay compensation for loss of duties in case of seizures of cigarettes bearing the Philip Morris trademark. Finally, the European Parliament calls on the UK government to join the agreement, the UK being the only Member State which has not yet signed it. In view of its work on fraud in the EU, the committee invites the House of Lord to support this request. Text, as adopted by the EP on 11 October, will shortly be available here

Agriculture
Identifying farm aid beneficiaries to strengthen public support for the CAP
2007-10-11 - 17:59
European taxpayers view the management of EU farm aid as unfathomable and riddled with flaws, which undermines the legitimacy of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). So a European Commission proposal to improve the transparency and budgetary implementation of this aid is welcomed by the European Parliament, although its members would like to go even further. In 2006 the European Union decided to make public the identities of recipients of aid granted under CAP. Last March, the Commission proposed amending the regulation governing the financing of the CAP, with the aim of putting this initiative on transparency into effect throughout the EU and also defining its scope more precisely. The proposal also seeks to tighten up the rules on penalties for any shortcomings in the Member States' control systems.
In a consultation report by Jorgo CHATZIMARKAKIS (ALDE, DE), adopted with amendments, the MEPs stress that Parliament has been eagerly awaiting these measures. The report nevertheless makes some amendments to improve transparency even more, while still abiding by rules on data protection.
Measures to improve transparency
The European Parliament would like all national lists of recipients of EU direct farm aid to be published on the Internet and for links to be created from the Commission's website to websites of the paying agencies in the Member States. Currently thirteen Member States have set up on-line registers accessible to the public via the Europa website. In the case of company-run farms, MEPs call for the names of the directors and investors to be published.
The House also urges that data on payments under the Rural Development Fund (EAFRD) be broken down to enable the broad areas that receive funding to be identified. It also calls for other minimum criteria to be introduced in order to facilitate easier comparison of data published by different Member States. Member States should be free to publish even more detailed breakdowns of funds, in line with their priorities and national legislation but would only be "encouraged" to publish details of additional payments from national funds (top-ups).
Since transparency is a key factor in any improvement of budgetary control, MEPs believe the procedures regarding any failure to observe the rules on publishing information need to be clarified. They say that, in the event of "major errors", payments for the paying agency concerned should be reduced by a flat rate of 2%.
Data protection and other safeguards
At the same time, MEPs highlight the need to include provisions on data protection in the Council regulation itself, and not just in its implementing arrangements. For example, there should be advance warning to the individuals concerned before their data are published and people consulting or using the data should be required to register first.
Lastly, the House wants the regulation to spell out that publication of this information is justified as part of the deal by which Europe's farmers receive fair compensation for the services they provide to society. Text, as adopted by the EP on 11 October, will shortly be available here

Collection and management of data on the Common Fisheries Policy
2007-10-11 - 17:59
The House adopted a report by 382 votes in favour to 11 against with 5 abstentions on the collection and management of data on the Common Fisheries Policy. The European Parliament approves a Commission proposal amending Regulation 1543/2000, which establishes a Community framework for the collection and management of the data needed to conduct the Common Fisheries Policy. In the light of new thinking on fisheries management and to prepare for a maritime policy for the EU, the Commission proposes that this regulation is repealed and replaced by a new more comprehensive data collection regulation.
The new regulation should enter into force in 2008. However, in the interim, it is necessary to amend the existing Regulation 1543/2000 in order to prevent an overlap between the old and the new regulation and to avoid any unnecessary administrative burdens on the Member States and the Commission.
Specifically, this will obviate the present legal obligation on Member States to submit six-year national programmes for the collection and management of data from 2007 to 2012, according to rules that are soon to be replaced. Instead, transitional programmes covering the years 2007 and 2008 are to be drawn up.
The current Commission proposal makes these necessary changes and is consequently supported by the rapporteur, Paulo Casaca (PES, PT), without amendment. Text, as adopted by the EP on 11 October, will shortly be available here
