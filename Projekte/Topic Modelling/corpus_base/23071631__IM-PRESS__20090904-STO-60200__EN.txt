Barroso's future at stake This week European Commission President Jos√© Manuel Barroso will meet with MEPs as he tries to persuade Parliament's main political groups to back him for a second term. He needs the backing of a simple majority of MEPs if he is to retain the post. The European People's Party is backing him, but he is likely to encounter strong opposition from the Greens and the leftist GUE/NGL whilst the Socialists and Liberals remain undecided on whether to back him.
Monday: The opening round
Mr Barroso will meet with the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) at 1830. He can expect a bumpy ride as the group is generally sceptical about European integration.
Tuesday: Barroso meets backers and critics
This could be the high point of Mr Barroso's week at 1500 when he meets the European People's Party (EPP), the largest group in the Parliament and the one that has supported his re-appointment. As the group that did best in the June elections, they will press Mr Barroso to push ahead with several of their key policies.
Mr Barroso will then have to face the Europe and United Left/Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL) group at 1730, which has said that it is "strongly critical of the policies of Mr Barroso".
Wednesday: Key encounters with wavering MEPs
On Wednesday he will meet members of the Socialists and Democrats at 1000 and the Liberals at 1400. These will be crucial encounters as they are respectively the second and third largest groups in the European Parliament and both remain undecided on whether to back Mr Barroso.
At 1600 he will hold talks with the Green group, which campaigned at the last European election on a platform of "Stop Barroso".
Finally the Europe of Freedom and Democracy (ECR) group are meeting him on Wednesday at 1900.
Thursday: Will a vote to confirm Mr Barroso be tabled?
On Thursday, MEPs will decide whether to table a vote on Mr Barroso, which could take place during the next Parliamentary session on 16 September in Strasbourg.
EuroparlTV will be following all the meetings this week.
