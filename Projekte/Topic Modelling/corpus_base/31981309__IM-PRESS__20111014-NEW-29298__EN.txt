EU budget 2012
2011-10-20 - 14:27
Parliament debates and votes its stance on next year's EU budget on Wednesday. The outcome will be the starting point for Parliament's 2012 budget negotiations with the Council (EU finance ministers) during a 21-day conciliation period. In the Budgets Committee, MEPs sought to restore the funds as proposed by the Commission, after cuts by the finance ministers in July. The committee's budget position implies an increase in payments (money to be spent due to contractual obligations) of 5.23% compared to this year's budget and an increase in commitments (which include money necessary for following years) of 3.95%.
Key changes
Key changes proposed by the Budgets Committee include increased spending on Palestine and the peace process, external border patrols in the Mediterranean, managing refugee flows, growth stimulating programmes (the "EU2020" strategy), funding for vegetable producers and development aid for Asia and South America.
Investing in growth
Parliaement's rapporteur for the lion's share of EU spending, Francesca Balzani (S&D, IT), warned that the EU2020 growth strategy should not fall victim to the current austerity climate, as investments in smart, sustainable and inclusive growth are needed to help Europe out of the crisis. The committee followed her proposals to add approximately €30 million for this.
Modest increase EP budget
Rapporteur ,on administrative budgets José Manuel Fernandes (EPP, PT), proposes further cuts to Parliament's budget, as compared to Parliament's initial position. This would lead to a modest increase of 1.44%, and more would be done with the extra money, as the proposal now includes accommodating 18 extra MEPs as a result of the Lisbon Treaty.

New rules to crack down on child abusers and web pornography
2011-10-20 - 14:27
Child abusers and viewers of child sex images on the web would face tough penalties and porn web pages would have to be deleted across the EU, under new rules to be voted on Thursday. The draft directive agreed by Parliament and Council also aims to step up prevention and help for victims. The proposed directive on combating sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography would introduce EU-wide requirements on prevention, prosecution of offenders and protection for victims.
It would also oblige Member States promptly to remove web sites containing child pornography or, should this prove impossible, allow Member States to block access to them under certain conditions.
EU-wide penalties
The text sets out minimum penalties for about 20 criminal offences - far more than are usually provided for in EU legislation. MEPs fought for tougher penalties across the EU, especially in cases of abuse by persons in a position of trust, authority or influence over the child (e.g. family members, guardians or teachers).
For instance, coercing a child into sexual actions or forcing a child into prostitution would be punishable by at least ten years in prison. Child pornography producers would face at least three years, and viewers of child pornography on the web at least one year.
Convicted child sex offenders could also be temporarily or permanently prohibited from working with children anywhere in the EU.
On-line grooming
On-line "grooming" (befriending children via the web with the intention of sexually abusing them) would become a criminal offence across the EU, as would child sex tourism, where the offence is committed on a Member State's territory or by one of its nationals abroad.
Help for victims
The proposal also includes new requirements on assisting, supporting and protecting victims.
Once adopted, Member States will have two years to transpose the directive into national law.
Additional information
The UK and Ireland say they wish to adopt and apply this directive. Denmark is the only Member State not taking part.

Using the single market better to exit the crisis
2011-10-20 - 14:27
On Tuesday, MEPs will quiz Commissioners Barnier, Dalli and Kroes on the spring 2011 Single Market Act and how to reap the full benefits of the EU single market. Making full use of the single market could potentially produce growth of about 4% of EU GDP over the next 10 years and so help Member States to exit the current economic crisis. In April 2011, the European Commission answered a call from the European Parliament to table a Single Market Act, an ambitious action plan to give the single market a fresh boost on the eve of its 20th anniversary in 2012.
The Single Market Act sets out 12 levers to boost growth and strengthen consumer and industry confidence: Access to finance for SMEs, Mobility for citizens, Intellectual property rights, Consumer empowerment, Services, Networks, The digital single market, Social entrepreneurship, Taxation, Social cohesion, Business environment, Public procurement.
Procedure: Question time with the Commission
Debate: Tuesday 25 October The Single Market Act Press release on the Internal Market Committee's inputs to the Single Market Act (17.03.2011) EU single market policy needs a more holistic, citizen-friendly approach, say MEPs (29.04.2010)

Easier access to public procurement for small and medium-sized firms
2011-10-20 - 14:27
EU rules should be simplified to make it easier for small and medium-sized firms to bid for public contracts, say MEPs in a draft resolution to be voted on Tuesday. Small firms win a smaller share of public procurement contracts than their share of the economy suggests they should, because today's public procurement rules make tendering for contracts cumbersome and costly. To ease their access to public procurement contracts, the non-legislative resolution by Heide Rühle (Greens, DE) proposes setting up an EU-wide "electronic procurement passport" proving that the holder complies with EU rules on public procurement.
Broader criteria
MEPs also say the "lowest price" criterion should no longer be the determining factor in awarding contracts. It should be replaced by that of the "most advantageous tender in terms of economic, social and environmental benefits, taking into account the entire life-cycle costs of the good, service or work".
Broadening the criteria, and systematically admitting alternative bids (or variants) would enable bidders to propose innovative solutions and thus might also strengthen the position of the smaller companies, says the text.
The resolution is Parliament's reply to a Commission green paper of 27 January 2011. It outlines MEPs' position ahead of a legislative proposal, which the Commission is to table later this autumn, to revise EU rules on public procurement.
There will be a press conference on Tuesday, 25 October after the vote.

Blocking mafia access to public funds
2011-10-20 - 14:27
The EU needs stricter rules to prevent mafia-style organisations from getting access to public funds, says a draft resolution to be voted on Tuesday. MEPs also call for new laws to prevent firms linked to organised crime from bidding for public procurement contracts. Parliament should set up a special committee to investigate infiltration of the public sector and legal economy by criminal organisations, they add. Organised crime, especially mafia-style crime, takes advantage of globalisation, the abolition of the EU's internal borders and differences among EU Member States' laws to make substantial profits and go unpunished. This is possible because criminal organisations have created a support network in the political world and the legal economy, says the draft.
Fully traceable funding
To prevent misuse of EU funds by mafia-style organisations, MEPs call on the Commission to draw up rules to ensure that their use is fully traceable by public authorities, citizens and the media. New rules are also needed to prevent companies linked to organised crime and mafias from taking part in public procurement procedures, they add.
EP special committee
Members suggest setting up a special European Parliament committee to investigate the misuse of public funds by criminal organisations, their infiltration of the public sector and their "contamination of the legal economy and financial system".
No mafia MEPs
Finally, new rules should be drafted to prevent convicted members of criminal organisations from standing in European elections, it adds.

Asylum: levelling up the rights of people in need of protection in EU countries
2011-10-20 - 14:27
Third country nationals who are at risk of serious harm in their home countries, such as torture or execution, but who do not qualify as refugees, would nonetheless get the same rights as refugees to work, vocational training, education, health care and accommodation in the EU, under revised asylum rules to be voted on Thursday. EU countries have pledged to establish a Common European Asylum System by 2012. These rules are the first of six "asylum package" proposals to be agreed by Parliament and Council.
Refugee status and subsidiary protection
Any non-EU country national or stateless person who is located outside his/her country of origin and who is unable to return to it owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership of a particular social group would qualify as a refugee.
People who do not qualify for refugee status, but cannot return to their country of origin due to a real risk of suffering serious harm (torture or inhuman or degrading treatment, death penalty or execution, serious individual threat to the life or person as result of indiscriminate violence) would have the right to "subsidiary protection".

Opening up EU labour markets to Bulgarian and Romanian citizens
2011-10-20 - 14:27
A draft resolution calling on EU Member States to allow Bulgarians and Romanians onto the EU labour market by the end of 2011 will be put to a vote on Tuesday. Employment and Social Affairs Committee MEPs deplore recent legislative proposals in some Member States to reinstate labour market access restrictions on citizens from some other Member States.
Such restrictions would be counterproductive, and discriminate against EU citizens, says the resolution on measures to promote workers' mobility in the EU.

Ombudsman's work under the spotlight
2011-10-20 - 14:27
The EU Ombudsman plays a key role in making EU institutions more open and transparent, and should go on defending citizens' right of access to documents, says a draft resolution to be voted on Thursday. In 2010, the Ombudsman received 2,667 complaints from citizens, companies, associations, NGOs and regional offices, most about a lack of transparency.
The Ombudsman investigates cases of maladministration in the EU institutions and bodies, such as refusal to grant citizens access to documents, abuse of power, discrimination, administrative irregularities or failure to reply.
Nikiforos Diamandouros has been the Ombudsman since January 2003. In 15 years, his office has responded to over 36,000 complaints from all over Europe.

Global economic governance in need of an overhaul
2011-10-20 - 14:27
Gaping trading disparities, speeding and slowing economies, financial markets needing better global supervision, and a highly-interdependent banking system all highlight the need for a radical overhaul of worldwide economic coordination. A draft non-legislative resolution to be voted Tuesday calls for reform of International Monetary Fund structures, a halt to political meddling with exchange rates, and rules to separate speculative banking functions from traditional ones. The resolution will be debated on Monday afternoon and put to a vote on Tuesday.

EP set to approve Police College and Medicines Agency budget management for 2009
2011-10-20 - 14:27
The European Police College (CEPOL) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) are both likely to be granted a budget management discharge (approval) for financial 2009, following improvements in their procurement procedures and practices. Parliament votes on Wednesday. The Budgetary Control Committee has recommended that budget discharges for 2009 should be granted to the Director of the Police College (Bramshill, UK) and the Executive Director of the London-based European Medicines Agency.
Both the College and the Agency have improved their procurement procedures and practices since Parliament postponed its decision on their 2009 discharges in May 2011.
However, the Budgetary Control Committee recommended on 3 October that the Council of Ministers should not be granted a discharge for its budget management in financial 2009. All other EU bodies have already been granted discharges for their 2009 budgets.

Air passenger data transfers to Australia
2011-10-20 - 14:27
A new agreement on the transfer of EU air passengers' personal data to the Australian Customs Service will be put to a vote on Thursday. If Parliament approves the deal, the data would be used to prevent terrorist offences and transnational crime. The Australian authorities could retain the data for up to 5 and a half years. Passenger Name Record (PNR) data collected by air carriers includes names, addresses, passport numbers and credit card details. Under Australian law, air companies are obliged to send these personal data to the Australian Customs Service prior to passenger departure.
The new agreement aims to bring data transfers in line with EU data protection rules. If approved, it would be in force for seven years.
Before deciding on the agreement, MEPs will vote on a draft resolution tabled by the GUE/NGL group calling for a European Court of Justice opinion on the deal's compatibility with the EU treaties.
