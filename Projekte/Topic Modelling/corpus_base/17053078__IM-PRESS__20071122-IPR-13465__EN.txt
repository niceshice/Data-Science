Europe's satellite navigation system Galileo will be "a test of vitality" for the EU, Transport Commissioner Jacques Barrot told the Industry Committee on Wednesday when many MEPs voiced concerns that the amount of funds planned for the project would not be sufficient and that monopolies of certain companies could arise.
Industry Committee Chair Angelika Niebler (EPP-ED, DE) said the United States investment in the third generation of GPS was 50-60 billion dollars. "And we are quarrelling about €2.4 billion", she commented, while also calling for "a fair and balanced distribution of tasks". "If we don't play by certain rules of competition, we won't have enough money to make ends meet", stressed Norbert Glante (PES, DE). Asked by Vladimír Remek (GUE/NGL, CZ) about measures to prevent monopolies, Commissioner Barrot, who is responsible for the Galileo project, replied that "we have broken down Galileo into segments, and one company can only be responsible for up to two segments".
With a view to the €2.4 billion proposed for the deployment of the 30 satellites, Den Dover (EPP-ED, UK) said that "the figure is not big enough to regain the time loss… Without the private sector we won't get Galileo off the ground." "Which satellite system is financed by the private sector?", countered Mr Barrot arguing that all existing satellite navigation systems receive contributions from governments.
Etelka Barsi-Pataky (EPP-ED, HU), who has just completed her draft report on the further implementation of the European satellite radio-navigation programmes, suggested already publishing a "request for information as a first step to prevent a monopoly situation and to gain time".
The European Parliament has co-decision powers (along with the Council) over the regulation on the deployment and commercial phases of Galileo.
