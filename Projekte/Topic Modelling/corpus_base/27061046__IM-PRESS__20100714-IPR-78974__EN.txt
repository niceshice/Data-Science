Negotiations on a EU-wide financial supervision system between the Council and the European Parliament produced some progress on 14 July, but a complete deal was not clinched. MEPs acknowledged that the Council meeting of the day before had resulted in a new mandate for the Belgian presidency in the negotiations, which took on board more of the European Parliament wishes. However, the negotiating MEPs decided not to consider the negotiations closed but to continue them.
