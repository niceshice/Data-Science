"This week's Breast Cancer Day at the European Parliament was a great success", said MEP Karin Jöns on Wednesday. "It was an important event during International Breast Cancer Month (October) and showed that the European Union stands at the side of all women in Europe. We now finally have EU guidelines for multidisciplinary breast care units that set standards for breast cancer treatment all over Europe."
Key events at Parliament's Breast Cancer Day on Tuesday 18 October were an exhibition on Breast Cancer in the EU-25 and a press conference by Karin Jöns, of Parliament's Women's Rights Committee. The day closed with the illumination of one of Parliament's buildings in pink, the international colour of the fight against breast cancer, by EP President Josep Borrell, who said: "Saving the lives of mothers, daughters, wives, sisters, partners, colleagues and friends seems to me not only a political target but a human necessity!"
