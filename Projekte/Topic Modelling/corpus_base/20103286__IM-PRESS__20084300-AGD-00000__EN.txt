On Monday 20 October 2008, the European Parliament will hold hearings with the British Commissioner designate, Catherine Ashton – Baroness Ashton of Upholland. Over three hours, she will answer questions from MEPs about her political career, her views on the EU and her plans for the trade portfolio.
The hearing follows the resignation from the Commission of Peter Mandelson, who has been appointed to the British government. Baroness Ashton is proposed to take up the trade portfolio previously held by Mr Mandelson.
She will therefore take part in a hearing before the International Trade Committee, with participation from the Foreign Affairs and Development Committees.
The committee will adopt its evaluations in the form of a letter. These will be made public once they have been considered on Tuesday by the Conference of Presidents. The full Parliament is scheduled to vote on the appointment of Baroness Ashton to the Commission on Wednesday at 11.30.
Parliament has set up a website with full details of the procedures involved and the timetable for the appointment process - follow the link below. 18:00 21:00 Strasbourg, LOW N1.4 Hearing website Information for the press - hearing of Catherine Ashton 2008-10-21 Plenary session Plenary agenda
