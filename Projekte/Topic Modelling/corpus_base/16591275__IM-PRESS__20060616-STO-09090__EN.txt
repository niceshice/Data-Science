EP President Josep Borrell at the European Council
EP President Josep Borrell said in a speech to the EU Summit on Thursday evening that the period of reflection opened after the rejection of the EU Constitution in France and in the Netherlands in 2005 has to be extended because the Constitution has not yet been ratified by 20 countries and some of the Member States which have yet to ratify do not seem too eager to do so. "Parliament recognises that it is necessary to wait, but also knows that it is urgent to act."
Borrell also outlined the EP's position on the next steps for the period of reflection on the future of Europe, and insisted on the Treaty of Nice not being enough for Europe to move forward. "You cannot keep adding floors to a building without making sure it has solid foundations", he said. He also stressed that "the lack of a text cannot be used as a pretext not to act".
In a resolution adopted on 14 June the Parliament called on the European Council "to move from the period of reflection to a period of analysis extending to mid-2007, with a view to reaching a clear proposal as to how to proceed with the Constitutional Treaty no later than the second half of 2007".
Important to continue the ratification process
After one year of reflection and debate there is no consensus and no plan B. "It is clear that France and the Netherlands will not vote again on the same text either before or after their elections". In Mr Borrell's opinion it is important to continue the ratification process ("at some stage we have to declare the process closed, count the number of ratifications and proceed accordingly"), preserve the global agreement and institutional system of the Constitutional Treaty and, in the meantime, to do more and better with the instruments we have under the current Treaties.
Future enlargements
Concerning the successive enlargements of the European Union Mr Borrell said: "They have been the major strategic achievement of European integration". They also have been and will be a source of great diversity. But "it is legitimate to wonder just how much diversity is compatible with an effective Union".
Immigration is one of the fields where urgent action is much needed, but the unanimity rule is preventing decisions from being taken. To move towards a common immigration policy requires first of all political will and the instruments to apply it. The instruments are in the current Treaty, but because of a lack of will the Member States still don't accept their use.
One seat?
As established in the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Parliament travels 12 times a year to Strasbourg for plenary sessions. Asked about this during the press conference, Mr Borrell said that in relation to other problems the EU and the world is facing, the Strasbourg issue is not on top of the agenda for serious problems. To keep the Strasbourg seat is a decision of the Member States which reflects a "historical symbol", he said. Before the Summit, the Austrian Chancellor and acting president of the European Council, Wolfgang Sch√ºssel, made it clear that the Member States don't intend to modify this decision.
Mr Borrell concluded his speech recalling the words written by Paul-Henri Spaak in his memoirs: "Each time difficulties arose, we drew on our shared beliefs for the imagination needed to overcome them".
