MEPs then turn their attention to the issue of footwear imports from China. On the basis of oral questions to the Council and Commission, MEPs will have the opportunity to debate the merits of this week's Council decision to levy import duties on shoes from China and Vietnam.
Of particular interest is an own-initiative report on the protection and welfare of animals 2006-2010 . The Agriculture Committee believes that "consumers should be informed and prepared to pay higher prices for products originating from farms with higher animal welfare standards and that these products should be appropriately labelled". The Agriculture Committee also "calls upon the European Community to bring an end to dog, bull and cock fighting through national or community legislation as appropriate, and by ensuring that those involved receive no state or national subsidy relating to their activities. "
On Thursday 12 October 2006 , the session starts with a joint debate on the EU Fundamental Rights Agency . The Civil Liberties Committee is insisting that the remit of the future EU Agency for Fundamental Rights be extended to third pillar issues such as policing, justice, immigration and counter-terrorism. It also wants not only EU Member States and candidate countries but also those with association agreements to come within the agency's scope.
The European Parliament will also vote on a resolution on the future of EU patents following the debate held in Strasbourg on 28 September.
Six separate reports which simply codify existing EU legislation by Diana WALLIS (ALDE, UK), on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee, will be put to the vote.

Preparation for the Lahti informal European Council - energy, illegal immigration and innovation policy
2006-10-11 - 11:03
MEPs will debate the forthcoming Lahti informal meeting of Heads of State or Government on 20 October 2006. The meeting will focus on energy, illegal immigration and innovation policy. The Lahti informal meeting will start with a working lunch, at which the topic for discussion will be external energy policy. Towards the end of lunch, there will be time for a short discussion on certain other topics, such as illegal immigration.
At the afternoon session, the discussion will centre around the need to strengthen competitiveness, especially through innovation policy. The intention is to draw attention to issues and challenges that call for joint EU action to create an environment that stimulates innovation and promotes the effective use of it.
The Lahti informal meeting will be followed by a dinner discussion with the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, on the strategic partnership between the EU and Russia, inter alia in the energy sector.
Only the Heads of State or Government who attend European Council meetings will be invited to the Lahti meeting, without other Ministers. Council and Commission statements

Shoe imports from China and Vietnam
2006-10-11 - 11:03
On the basis of oral questions to the Council and Commission, MEPs will have the opportunity to debate the merits of this week's Council decision to levy import duties on shoes from China and Vietnam. The oral questions have been tabled on behalf of the International Trade Committee by Enrique Barón Crespo (PES, ES) on the subject of the Commission's anti-dumping inquiry into shoes from these two countries.
In the course of its inquiry, which began in 2005, the Commission discovered compelling evidence of large-scale subsidies by China and Vietnam to their shoemakers. This finding led it to propose anti-dumping tariffs on footwear from China (19.4%) and Vietnam (16.8%), which came into force in April this year. These levies were set to expire after six months, hence the need for a fresh decision this week.
The oral questions are designed to elicit more detail of the inquiry's conclusions. However, MEPs will also be keen to debate the entire issue following the Council's agreement this week to support Mr Mandelson's proposal for duties of 16.5% on Chinese shoes and 10% on Vietnamese shoes as of 7 October. Under the compromise reached in Council these tariffs will be reviewed after two years rather than the five years proposed by Mr Mandelson.
There has been a clash of interests over this issue within the EU, with shoe-producing countries such as Italy, Spain, Portugal and Poland favouring more protection from imports, while others - notably Sweden, Germany, Britain and Denmark - argue that the tariffs lead to a distortion of trade and force consumers to pay higher prices.

Anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard actions against the EU
2006-10-11 - 11:03
Cristiana MUSCARDINI (UEN, IT) will be putting forward an own-initiative report on the anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard actions against the EU for the International Trade Committee. The committee is concerned at the abnormal increase in the number of trade defence cases involving both 'traditional' users of trade defence instruments and other, more recently-developed WTO members. MEPs in the committee consider that, in many of these cases, the WTO's rules and case law have been partially or completely disregarded, thus causing unjustified damage to the Community's industry. Nevertheless, the committee welcomes the help provided by the Commission to Member States and European industry in trade defence cases brought by third countries. The report urges the Commission to constantly monitor the action taken by third countries to ensure that it is appropriate and fair.
The committee calls on the Commission to campaign at the WTO for a radical revision of the rules governing the imposition of safeguard measures to avoid the excessive and unjustified use of such measures. The report urges the Member States to maintain a 'communal' approach to these issues which would enable the measures in question to be applied more harmoniously in the Community context and reduce the number of actions taken against the Community by bringing sustained pressure to bear at political and technical level on WTO members which intend to apply trade defence measures, while constantly endeavouring to raise awareness of the issues involved. MEP in the committee say, however, that 'communal' action must not be used as an excuse to support unfair trading practices by individual Member States.
The committee recommends that the Community refrain from granting preferential treatment to trade partners which are not acting in accordance with WTO rules and case-law, if such action is damaging Community industry. MEPs in the committee also urge the Commission to take the principle of reciprocity into account when dealing with trade defence cases involving those trade partners.
Finally, the International Trade Committee stresses that, if the new rules on international trade are to win public support, they must be applied transparently and consistently, in compliance with the principle of the rule of law, both within and outside the Community.

Boosting ties between EU and Mercosur
2006-10-11 - 11:03
The International Trade Committee, in an own-initiative report by Daniel Varela (EPP-DE, ES) on economic and trade relations between the EU and Mercosur, looks at the plans for an interregional association agreement launched at the first summit of heads of state or government of the EU and Mercosur in Rio de Janeiro (June 1999). The committee believes both continents have an interest in seeing Mercosur open up to Asia, South Africa and the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council. MEPs also urge the Mercosur countries to create their own parliament, composed of representatives of different national parliaments. The International Trade Committee also want to create a Mercosur - European Parliament inter-parliamentary delegation to further boost ties.
The committee reaffirms the need for the EU to conclude, as soon as possible, a full, ambitious and balanced Association Agreement with Mercosur, based on three pillars: a political and institutional chapter reinforcing democratic dialogue and political cooperation, a cooperation chapter promoting sustainable economic and social development, and a trade chapter establishing an advanced free-trade area with a broad agenda including, as well as reciprocal liberalisation of trade in goods and services, investment, public procurement, the protection of intellectual property rights, cooperation regarding competition and trade protection instruments, trade facilitation, and a binding dispute settlement mechanism.
As to the Doha round, the committee regrets the fact that, despite Parliament's recommendations that negotiation of the agreement with Member State should be decoupled from the WTO's Doha Round, the delays in the negotiations with Mercosur have led to their temporary de facto subordination to the development and finalisation of the Doha Round. The committee believes that the two processes, rather than being mutually exclusive, are complementary.
The committee stresses the importance of core labour standards and decent jobs for the development of Mercosur; states therefore that the agreement must include a specific agenda on decent work tailor-made for Mercosur Member States and a commitment by the EU to offer all necessary assistance in achieving that agenda.
Finally, the International Trade Committee considers that in addition to the repressive aspect concerning the fight against drugs, the agreement should insist on delivering aid to farmers to help them start new alternative production.

Fundamental rights
Fundamental Rights Agency to cover police, justice and security?
2006-10-11 - 11:03
In a report by Kinga GÁL (EPP-ED, HU), the Civil Liberties Committee is insisting that the remit of the future EU Agency for Fundamental Rights be extended to third pillar issues such as policing, justice, immigration and counter-terrorism. It also wants not only EU Member States and candidate countries but also those with association agreements to come within the agency's scope.
The new agency is scheduled to take over the work of the existing European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia. Like the monitoring centre, the agency will be based in Vienna. The Finnish presidency wants to have the agency up and running by 1 January 2007.
The agency's remit is to provide the Community and its Member States, when implementing Community law, with information and expertise on fundamental rights. It will deal with fundamental rights not only in the Member States but also in candidate countries as well as states with which the EU has a stabilisation and association agreement.
The European Commission has proposed that the agency should deal not only with first pillar issues but also third pillar ones such as police, justice, immigration and counter-terrorism. Several Member States are opposed to this but MEPs voted at the committee stage to support the Commission, which has said it believes account should be taken of Parliament's view as this is a matter of great interest to the electorate.
The committee is keen that Parliament should be consulted on the five year framework for the agency and on the candidates for the post of Director. And MEPs want not only the Council but also Parliament and the Commission to be able to draw on the agency's technical expertise.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights is the basis for the agency's work. Its tasks will include gathering information, giving advice to the EU and its Member States and issuing annual reports. It will also engage in awareness raising (education and information campaigns). Its work will complement that of the Council of Europe. However, it should be noted that it will have no power to look at individual complaints.
Latest news: Kinga Gál is expected to ask in plenary for the final vote on her report to be postponed, which will automatically bring it back to committee. The reason is that no agreement was reached at the last informal trialogue on the key issue for EP, the extension of the agency's remit to the third pillar.

Justice and home affairs
Agreement with the United States on the continued use of passenger name record (PNR) data
2006-10-11 - 11:03
The plenary session will start with a one-hour debate on the agreement with the US on the continued use of passenger name records. Commissioner Franco Frattini will take part in the debate. On 6 October, the EU and the United States completed negotiations on an interim Agreement on the processing and transfer of passenger name record (PNR) data by air carriers to the US Administration. The interim Agreement, which will be submitted for approval by the EU Council as soon as possible, provides legal certainty by replacing the Agreement of May 2004 between the European Community and the US, following the Court of Justice of the European Communities judgment of 30 May 2006 (see below).
The EU welcomes the new Agreement which will help to prevent and combat terrorism and serious transnational crime, whilst ensuring an equivalent level of protection of passengers' personal data in line with European standards on fundamental rights and privacy. The interim agreement enables PNR data in the reservation systems of air carriers to continue to be transferred to the US in the same way as under the previous Agreement. The US Administration may access electronically PNR data from air carriers' reservation/departure control systems located within the territory of the EU Member States, in accordance with specific undertakings. This system will be replaced in due course by one under which airlines in the EU will send the required data to the US. Under the interim Agreement, the EU will ensure that air carriers operating passenger flights in foreign air transportation to or from the US process PNR data contained in their automated reservation systems as required by the US Administration. The US Administration will continue to process PNR data received and treat data subjects concerned by such processing in accordance with undertakings given in 2004.
The Agreement will apply provisionally as of the date of signature. It will expire upon the date of application of any superseding agreement and in any event, no later than 31 July 2007, unless extended by mutual written agreement.
Background
In its judgment of 30 May 2006, the Court of Justice annulled Council Decision 2004/496/EC of 17 May 2004 on the approval by the European Community of the previous Agreement (on the processing and transfer of PNR data by air carriers to the US Administration), as well as Commission Decision 2004/535/EC of 14 May 2004 (the so-called Adequacy Decision), which was closely linked to it. The Court annulled these Decisions on the grounds that they did not fall within the competence of the European Community; however, it did not rule that the Decisions infringed fundamental rights with regard to data protection. In annulling the Decisions, the Court preserved the effects of the two Decisions, but only until 30 September 2006. In consequence, the EU denounced the Agreement and negotiated the new one with the US, which falls within the competence of the European Union, and not the European Community. Debate: 11.10.2006

Agriculture
Strong support for higher animal welfare standards
2006-10-11 - 11:03
In an own-initiative report by Elizabeth Jeggle (EPP-ED, DE), the Agriculture Committee welcomes the proposed Community Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals 2006 - 2010. The committee argues that "the protection of animals is an expression of humanity in the 21st century and a challenge facing European civilisation and culture". It therefore supports the Commission's plans and points to the greater emphasis already placed on animal protection under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy.
Recalling the animal health problems of recent years, such as BSE, MEPs emphasise that "animal protection and animal health impact closely on each other." They therefore call on the Commission to "take greater account of animal protection aspects in the fight against animal diseases."
However, MEPs recognise that higher standards may come at a cost. They argue that, when introducing higher animal protection welfare standards, the situation of individual EU regions should be taken into account. And they are keen for "measures to improve animal welfare to be seen from the standpoint of their socio-economic effects", especially on farmers.
The Agriculture Committee also urges the Commission to push at international level, "notably at the WTO and the OIE" (the world organisation for animal health), for a single legislative standard for animal protection rules.
Labelling the key
Public opinion is a key issue. MEPs believe "consumers should be informed and prepared to pay higher prices for products originating from farms with higher animal welfare standards and that these products should be appropriately labelled".
They support the development of an "EU label" as well as voluntary private labels that would guarantee even higher standards of animal protection and which could spread animal welfare standards around the world. They even suggest "imposing levies on products which do not meet EU standards" of animal welfare, to avoid "animal protection dumping".
Lastly, the Agriculture Committee "calls upon the European Community to bring an end to dog, bull and cock fighting through national or community legislation as appropriate, and by ensuring that those involved receive no state or national subsidy relating to their activities.

Economic and monetary affairs
Call to remove unjustifiable barriers to competition in the professions
2006-10-11 - 11:03
Parliament will consider a report from the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which welcomes dialogue between the Commission, Member States and professional bodies aimed at dismantling unjustified or harmful barriers to competition in professional services. The report, drawn up by Jan Christian EHLER (EPP-ED, DE) in reaction to the Commission’s latest communication on the issue, says effective and transparent self-regulation can be appropriate, but that Member States should ensure it does not damage consumer interests. The committee supports the adoption of codes of conduct by professional service providers.
MEPs in the committee want restrictions on advertising by professionals to be largely dispensed with, limited only to duly justified exceptional cases.
The committee urges the Commission to examine more carefully the expected impact of the full removal of unnecessary obstacles to competition, including on sectors that have limited resources or that are restricted to certain regions.
Finally the report raises the issue of subdividing regulatory protection by category of consumer group, suggesting this may need further analysis. Rapporteur Jan Christian EHLER EPP-ED DE A6-0272/2006 Follow-up to the report on competition in professional services Procedure : own-initiative

Statements on South Ossetia and Transnistria
2006-10-11 - 11:03
MEPs will debate and vote on developments in South Ossetia and Transnistria. The Commission and Council will make statements to introduce the debate. In South Ossetia , (part of territorial Georgia), over recent weeks relations between Georgia and Russia have deteriorated, especially over the alleged spying by Russia. Russia announced it was suspending all air, road, rail, sea and postal links with Georgia, which is heavily reliant on trade ties with Russia.
In early September, four people are reported to have been killed in clashes in Georgia's breakaway region of South Ossetia. Georgian police said they were fired upon as they tracked smugglers. One of their number died and two were hurt. However South Ossetian police said they came under fire from Georgian forces using heavy small arms and mortars, and that three of their number died. South Ossetia is under a tense stand-off between Georgian forces and separatists, who are backed by Russia. A helicopter carrying Georgia's defence minister over the region was shot at.
Georgia’s relations with Russia since independence have been complicated by three interconnected sets of issues: Russia’s perceived support for the separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the lack of agreement on a timetable for the withdrawal of the remaining Russian bases in Georgia following the commitments of Russia at the OSCE Istanbul Summit of 1999, and Russia’s perception of Georgia as a safe haven for Chechen rebels.
Transnistria
On 19 September 2006, the Council made the following statement on Transnistria: "The European Union is aware that a "referendum" in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova has taken place on 17 September 2006. This "referendum" contradicts the internationally recognized sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova. The EU considers that the situation in Transnistria does not allow the free expression of popular will. The EU reiterates that it recognizes neither the "referendum" nor its outcome.
The European Union calls upon the mediators and observers in the OSCE-led 5+2 talks to make public statements to the same effect.
The European Union fully supports Moldova's territorial integrity and calls on both parties to the conflict to return immediately to the negotiating table in the 5+2 format and work towards a speedy and transparent solution of the Transnistria conflict. "
Moldova is one of the poorest countries in Europe. Debate : 11.10.2006 DELEGATION TO THE EU-ARMENIA, EU-AZERBAIJAN AND EU-GEORGIA PARLIAMENTARY COOPERATION COMMITTEES EU-Georgia relations Delegation to the EU-Moldova Parliamentary Cooperation Committee EU-Moldova relations

Rebuilding of Balkans moves on to next stage
2006-10-11 - 11:03
In a consultation report by Jelko KACIN (ALDE, SI) the Foreign Affairs Committee backs plans to phase out the European Agency for Reconstruction. The agency was set up in 2000 as the main instrument for reconstruction in war-damaged Kosovo. Its activities were later extended to Serbia, Montenegro and the FYR of Macedonia. The agency has its headquarters in Thessaloniki and has operational centres in Pristina, Belgrade, Podgorica and Skopje.
The Commission is proposing to discontinue the agency at the end of 2008. However, the current regulation runs until the end of this year, so simultaneously an extension of the agency's existence until 2008 needs to be ensured.
The reason the agency should be discontinued in two years' time is that Stabilisation and Association Agreements are coming into place for all the countries in the Western Balkans. There is therefore no longer any justification for having a separate reconstruction instrument for Kosovo, Serbia, Montenegro and FYROM and thus making a distinction between them and countries such as Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Albania.
The Foreign Affairs Committee agrees, but feels that the winding down of the agency should be performed in such a way so as not to cause any disruptions and that precious expertise should not be lost.

Following the debate at the last Strasbourg plenary session on 28 September, MEPs will vote on a joint resolution on the future of patent policy in Europe. The draft resolution put forward by the EPP-ED, PES and ALDE group urges the Commission to explore all courses for improving the patent and patent litigation systems in the EU, including participation in further discussions on EPLA (European Patent Litigation Agreement) and joining the Munich convention as well as revising the Community Patent proposals. The draft resolution, as regards EPLA, says that the proposed text needs significant improvements and a satisfactory proposal for the Rules of Procedure of the EPLA Court.
The draft resolution requests that the Parliament's Legal Services be asked to provide an interim opinion on EU-related aspects of the possible conclusion of the EPLA by Member States in the light of overlaps of the EPLA with the acquis communautaire and to clarify legislative competence which rules this matter.
