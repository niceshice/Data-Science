Parliament signs off Council budget for 2008
Budgetary control
Plenary sittings
2010-05-19 - 14:49
MEPs on Wednesday voted to approve the 2008 budgetary management of the Council of Ministers, following improved cooperation with the Council. The Council's earlier refusal to participate in debates with the EP was one of the reasons why the Budgetary Control Committee had suggested postponing the decision to October.
Two weeks ago, MEPs decided to hold back their vote on the Council's budget discharge until this plenary, pending the outcome of a high level dialogue on the matter which had just been launched by Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek and Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Zapatero. Although the first discharge vote (to grant discharge or formally postpone the decision until October) should normally take place before the 15 May deadline, MEPs used this option, to hold back the vote by just two weeks, as they hoped the negotiations would enable them to grant the discharge later on. "I would like to give a second, and a last, chance to the Council to prepare all the necessary documents for the discharge." rapporteur Ryszard Czarnecki (ECR, PL) said at that time.
Until last year, the only discharge-related meetings between the two institutions were informal ones of the committee chair, the rapporteur and Council representatives. Last year, after Parliament formally postponed the decision in April, the Council agreed to meet Parliament representatives in September. They also made some new documents public.
This year, the meeting with the Council Secretariat, the Spanish presidency and EP representatives took place in March. In addition, the Spanish State Secretary Diego López Garrido participated in the discharge debate in Strasbourg in April. The MEPs have also received additional information about the 2008 budget.
MEPs will now prepare a resolution outlining the reasons for granting the discharge and suggesting how Council could improve the management of its budget. This resolution will be tabled for the 14-17 June plenary.
The Council was the last EU institution to be granted discharge for the year 2008. The only remaining EU body to be checked in October is the European Police College.
