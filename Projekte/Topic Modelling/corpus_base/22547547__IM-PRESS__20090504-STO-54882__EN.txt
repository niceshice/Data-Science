TV ad for European elections The upcoming European election is taking to the airwaves in adverts on television and at cinemas across Europe. Based on the theme of people making the news tomorrow through today's voting choices, they show people from different countries saying what they hope to hear in the future. A father calls for more paternity leave while a worker wants Europe to stop imports of foreign goods.
In another scene, a young Spanish girl calls for a ban on cars on weekdays and a women says Europe's last nuclear plant has just closed.
Filmed in 34 languages versions to reflect the fact that 375 million people will be eligible to vote in 27 countries it is hoped the ads will spur people to take part in choosing MEPs for the 2009-2014 parliamentary term.
The TV ads form a part of a wider campaign using billboards, posters, vox boxes, facebook and YouTube to raise awareness of the forthcoming election.
