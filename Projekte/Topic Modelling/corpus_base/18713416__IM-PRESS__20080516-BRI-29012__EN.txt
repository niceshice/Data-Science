Briefing - 4-5 June 2008 - Brussels plenary session
2008-05-30 - 09:12
Selected highlights of the Brussels plenary session 4-5 June 2008 include:
Wednesday 4 June 2008
The session opens at 3pm with a joint debate on foreign policy, security and defence . High Representative for Foreign Affairs Javier Solana will take part in the debate. The Foreign Affairs Committee highlights the increased effectiveness the Lisbon Treaty could give to the EU's foreign policy, while also pointing to the need for increased parliamentary scrutiny and democratic legitimacy in the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP). The Committee's stance is set out in two own initiative reports.
Parliament will debate the forthcoming EU-US Summit to be held in Slovenia on 9 and 10 June . The summit will centre on the following key areas: Regional and political issues, global security issues, present-day global challenges and bilateral transatlantic partnership. The House will also vote on a resolution on this topic.
The House then turns its attention to the EU system against illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing . MEPs in the committee propose several amendments concerning the Community list of IUU fishing vessels, the inspections to be carried out and the sanctions and other measures to be imposed by Member States.
MEPs will then debate competition, retail and financial services . Consumers should have more choice in, and pay less for, banking and financial services. This could be achieved in part by removing the obstacles to cross-border products. One way to do this is to reduce the differences between national regulations. The reports also stress the importance of improving financial literacy among consumers.
The last point on Wednesday evening is an oral question to the Commission on forced prostitution and human trafficking, especially of women for the purpose of sexual exploitation during the European football championship 2008 . Within the framework of events it organised to mark International Women's Day on 8 March 2006, the European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality launched a campaign to alert the public to the need to prevent and combat trafficking and forced prostitution during the FIFA World Cup 2006 championship.
Thursday 5 June 2008
The session opens on Thursday with MEPs debating the Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean after hearing statements from the Council and Commission. The European Commission adopted proposals on 20 May 2008 for upgrading relations with its Mediterranean partners through the Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean. The relationship is likely to be a priority of the French Presidency during the second half of 2008. MEPs will vote on a resolution on this topic.
MEPs will vote on a resolution on the deteriorating situation in Georgia following a previous plenary debate held on 7 May in Brussels. 20080516BRI29012

Security and defence
A more effective EU foreign policy in prospect, but more parliamentary scrutiny needed
2008-05-30 - 09:12
The Foreign Affairs Committee highlights the increased effectiveness the Lisbon Treaty could give to the EU's foreign policy, while also pointing to the need for increased parliamentary scrutiny and democratic legitimacy in the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP). The Committee's stance is set out in two own initiative reports. High Representative for Foreign Affairs Javier Solana will take part in the debate. 2006 annual report on the CFSP
The report by Committee Chairman Jacek SARYUSZ-WOLSKI (EPP-ED, PL) on the Council's 2006 Annual Report on the Common Foreign and Security Policy points out that "the future office of High Representative/Vice-President of the Commission will derive its legitimacy directly from the European Parliament." It also stresses the need for "transparency and democratic input" into the process of setting up the planned European External Action Service, and calls for a mechanism to be set up to provide confidential information to select Foreign Affairs Committee Members.
Energy security and the EU's neighbourhood high on the agenda
The report considers that "stability in the Western Balkans should be the top priority for the EU in 2008." It says the "dialogue with Serbia should be intensified" to take concrete steps, for example on visa liberalisation, and considers that the EU should "initiate appropriate processes in order to avoid Serbia's isolation." Committee Members also said the "EULEX mission in Kosovo must safeguard the interests of national minorities," and voice their concern at the stalemate in transferring responsibilities from UNMIK to EULEX in Kosovo.
The report "is of the view that the importance of the foreign policy dimensions of energy security [...] will continue increasing," and calls for diversification of supply, increase in energy efficiency and EU solidarity, while also deploring "the uncoordinated signing of bilateral energy agreements by Member States." In addition, Members note that strengthening the European Neighbourhood Policy should be a "main objective for 2008," especially in three key regional cooperation areas: the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea, the latter two of which should be "assured by finding new organisational structures for regional cooperation."
Russia and China
The committee "considers the review in 2008 by the Union of its relations with Russia as very important," and asks Member States to "coordinate relations with the Russian Federation on the basis of the Union's common interests. "The report recommends that "political and economic relations with China be deepened in 2008, on condition that substantial progress be made in the field of democracy and human rights, and that China heed the EU's grave concerns about its conduct in Tibet."
European Security Strategy (ESS) and European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP)
The report by Helmut KUHNE (PES, DE) on the implementation of the European Security Strategy (ESS) and the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) calls on the High Representative to "assess in a White Paper the progress made, and any shortcomings, in the implementation of the ESS since 2003," and to "include in that White Paper proposals for improving and complementing the ESS."
The Committee adds that a future assessment of the ESS "has to be carried out with greater democratic accountability and therefore be made in close consultation" with the Parliament. Committee Members in the committee also stress the need to "have a European Parliament position available before an ESDP mission," to add democratic legitimacy to EU military operations.
Battle Groups, EUROCORPS, a Peace Corps and a Human Security Response Force
The report deplores the fact that partly due to "narrowly defined terms of deployment," the Battle Group concept has "not solved the force generation problem for concrete operations." It therefore calls for urgent clarification of the Battle Group concept. The committee "proposes to place EUROCORPS as a standing force under EU command and invites all Member States to contribute to it."
In addition, committee Members called on the Council and Commission to "establish an EU Civil Peace Corps for crisis management and conflict prevention." Finally, although most references to the concept of human security in the report were voted down, the Committee still asked the Council to "examine options for the setting up of an integrated civil-military 'Human Security Response Force' to carry out human security operations."
Military Erasmus
The report calls for continued improvement in interoperability between EU national armed forces; deplores the existing heterogeneity in training and equipment among various armed forces of the Member States and calls for a military 'Erasmus' programme that would include common training for military personnel that could be deployed in operations.
Non-proliferation and weapons exports
The report reiterates the Parliament's long-standing position that it "finds it embarrassing that, despite the fact that the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports will celebrate its tenth anniversary in 2008, it is not yet legally binding, and uncontrolled arms exports from EU Member States seem to be continuing without much hindrance."
Members in the committee also call for Europe to be made a "nuclear-weapon-free zone" and called for a "global convention banning nuclear weapons." With regard to the specific case of Iran, the report "reaffirms that the proliferation risks attaching to the Iranian nuclear programme remain a source of serious concern to the EU and the international community" and calls "on the US to join the EU-3 in direct negotiations with Iran.

MEPs to vote on a resolution on the deterioration of the situation in Georgia
2008-05-30 - 09:12
MEPs will vote on a resolution on the deterioration of the situation in Georgia following the debate that was held on 7 May in Brussels. Parliamentary elections took place in Georgia on 21 May. The Presidency of the EU holds that the Parliamentary Elections on 21 May 2008 were an important test for democracy in Georgia, particularly in the light of the recent developments in the country, and congratulates the Georgian people for their peaceful conduct. Charles TANNOCK (EPP-ED, UK) said: "A flood of petrodollars is making Russia a resurgent power but, regrettably, it sees everything in zero-sum terms. Putin’s foreign policy priority – to reconstruct something looking like the old Soviet Union – has been focused on what Russia patronisingly refers to as its ‘near abroad’ – the former Soviet Republics in the Baltics, Eastern Europe and the South Caucasus, where Russia is determined to retain its sphere of influence. They are being punished for looking westwards towards NATO and the EU, rather than towards Moscow.
Georgia, under the Western-oriented reformist President Saakashvili, has suffered considerably from Russia’s heavy-handedness. Aside from using trade and energy supplies as diplomatic weapons, Putin has consistently sought to undermine Georgia’s territorial integrity through tacit support for the breakaway, self-styled republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The arrival of yet more Russian soldiers in Abkhazia – supposedly as peacekeepers but undoubtedly combat ready – and the shooting down of a Georgian drone recently has provocatively increased tension in the region."
Robert EVANS (PES, UK) said: "Russia has never accepted the territorial integrity of Georgia with respect to Abkhazia or South Ossetia. We know from what we have heard in recent weeks that Russian and Abkhazian separatists have apparently been involved in the spy plane incidents which have led to this rise in tension and we must all recognise that one thing has led on to another. I do not know all the diplomatic measures that are taking place, but I am concerned that the European Union is not doing enough to stop this escalating violence. Mrs Isler Béguin said a few minutes ago that history will not pardon us if we do nothing. Do nothing and the whole area could dissolve into a war – a war which no one will win.
So my message this afternoon – not just to this Parliament, but to Mr Lenarčič for the Council and, indeed, to Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner – is to do everything within your means, at the highest level, to ensure that everyone, above all the Russians, understands how dangerous the moves are that are taking place in this area and that we have got to stop this escalation before we have another Balkan crisis.

The Barcelona Process - Union for the Mediterranean
2008-05-30 - 09:12
The House will debate the Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean after hearing statements from the Council and Commission. The European Commission adopted proposals on 20 May 2008 for upgrading relations with its Mediterranean partners through the Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean. The relationship is likely to be a priority of the French Presidency during the second half of 2008. MEPs will vote on a resolution on this topic. Reaction from EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering
After the presentation by the European Commission of the Communication on the "Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean", Hans-Gert Pöttering in his current double capacity as President of the European Parliament and President of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly (EMPA) welcomed the Commission's proposal and strongly underlined the need for an enhanced parliamentary dimension of the Barcelona Process. He stated:
"I welcome the Communication of the European Commission on the "Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean" due to be launched in Paris next 13 July. The Communication recognises the role of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly as the legitimate parliamentary representation of the Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean as requested by EMPA in its Plenary Session in Athens on 28 March 2008. Furthermore the Commission has taken into account both parliamentary assemblies' views and strongly supports the strengthening of the role of EMPA in relations with Mediterranean partners".
With the "Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean" the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership enters a new phase. It will become stronger, more efficient, and, closer to citizens. It is thus a natural step to ensure the Partnership's democratic legitimacy and to promote democratic processes through dialogue and consultation by granting EMPA the enhanced status as the Parliamentary Assembly of the "Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean."
Background
Since its launch in 1995, the Barcelona Process has been the central instrument for Euro-Mediterranean relations, representing a partnership of 39 governments and over 750m people. It has been the engine for movement towards peace, security and shared prosperity in a region where long-running conflicts and tenuous reform efforts have often impeded progress. Against this background, the Partnership provides a framework for continued dialogue, engagement and development. The European Commission has supported the Barcelona Process with the provision of over €16bn from the Community budget since 1995.
Following the Spring European Council's decision, European Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner presented the outline of the structures of the Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean which aim at giving renewed vitality and visibility to the EU’s relations with Partners in the Mediterranean region. These structures include the setting up of a Secretariat and the creation of a permanent committee of Euro-Mediterranean representatives.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Forced prostitution and trafficking in women for the purpose of sexual exploitation ahead of European Championships 2008
2008-05-30 - 09:12
Anna ZÁBORSKÁ (EPP-ED, SK), on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, will be asking the Commission the following question on forced prostitution and trafficking in women for the purpose of sexual exploitation: Within the framework of events it organised to mark International Women's Day on 8 March 2006, the European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality launched a campaign to alert the public to the need to prevent and combat trafficking and forced prostitution during the FIFA World Cup 2006 championship.
This so-called 'Red Card to Forced Prostitution' campaign was a great success because it contributed positively towards reducing trafficking and forced prostitution during the championship games. We should therefore raise public awareness again during the UEFA Euro 2008 Championship in June 2008 by reminding society that this kind of violence against women and girls is unacceptable. In 2005, the Commission and the Council adopted an EU plan on best practices, standards and procedures for combating and preventing trafficking in human beings (2005/C 311/01). It includes a detailed table of specific actions to be regularly reviewed and updated. We urge Member States to implement the action plan immediately, because there is already a delay. Since this action plan covers all forms of trafficking in human beings, it calls for a coordinated policy inter- related areas, such as the inclusion of gender specific prevention strategies as a key element to combat trafficking in women and girls, as well as awareness raising measures and an evaluation of their effectiveness etc.
Can the Commission reply to the following:
- Has the action plan been implemented regarding trafficking for sexual exploitation, and what is the result and the effectiveness? What specific measures have been reported by MS in order to combat trafficking in human beings for sexual exploitation?
- To what extent have Member states correctly transposed and implemented the Directive 2004/81/EC? What actions has the Commission taken if this is not the case?
- When will the study on the links between the legislation on prostitution and the scope of trafficking in women and girls for the purpose of sexual exploitation, requested by the European Parliament Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality since January 2006, be available?
- Can the Commission indicate if and how it intends to encourage Member States to build on and further develop cross-border police cooperation in the field of the fight against trafficking in human beings and forced prostitution?
- How can the Commission support the Committee's 'Red Card to Forced Prostitution' campaign? Author Anna ZÁBORSKÁ EPP-ED SK Oral question to the Commission

Economic and monetary affairs
More choice and lower costs for bank customers
2008-05-30 - 09:12
Consumers should have more choice in, and pay less for, banking and financial services. This could be achieved in part by removing the obstacles to cross-border products, according to the Economics Committee. One way to do this is to reduce the differences between national regulations. MEPs also stress the importance of improving financial literacy among consumers. Parliament will consider two own-initiative reports, one from Othmar Karas (EPP-ED, AT), reacting to a Commission green paper on retail financial services, and one from Gianni Pittella (PES, IT), which responds to the Commission’s inquiry into competition in retail banking.
The goal: tangible benefits for consumers
According to the Karas report, the aim is to deliver tangible benefits for consumers by securing greater choice and lower prices, enhancing consumer confidence and empowering consumers. Given the need for a secure environment for both bank and customer, and believing that cross border activity is crucial to increase competition, the report calls for an approach of “targeted full harmonisation” to the regulatory framework: i.e. making essential elements of the rules equal in all Member States, while applying mutual recognition to the rest. There is also the possibility of a “28th regime” of EU regulation specifically to cover cross-border products, which the report says is worth careful study.
“Same risk, same rules”
Real and fair competition can arise only if there is a level playing field, with regulators applying the “same risk, same rules” approach to different businesses, but this does not mean adopting a “one-size-fits-all” approach. What is needed are comparable transparency and disclosure requirements, especially at the point of sale.
Financial literacy
While legislation should aim for very high standards of consumer protection , all players should take steps to improve financial literacy at all levels , including the basic principle that a higher return usually means a higher risk.
Fragmented regulation a barrier to cross-border activity
Given the closely related topic, some of the same ground is covered by the Pittella report, which also highlights the obstacles caused to cross-border banking by a fragmented regulatory approach and highlights money laundering regulations as being one area that needs to be examined .
Changing banks: a seamless process?
When customers want to change banks, says the report, there should be no disruption as they close on account and open another. Charges applied for closing an account should only be those which are “fully justified.” MEPs in the committee emphasise, moreover, that access to basic banking services is a right for all.
Common standards on information for –and on - customers
The report says there should be a comparable system in all Member States by which banks set out for customers opening an account the costs and charges they impose. If the industry does not act on this issue, legislation may be needed.
Banks need to have access to fraud and credit checking data across borders, but with proper safeguards for consumer data protection.
Pluralism in types of provider
MEPs in the committee stress the importance of pluralism in types of service provider in banking. They also want the Commission to check that the Single European Payments Area project does not reduce competition in payment settlement services .
Interbank charges
The report also calls for an examination of the different types of inter-bank charges, for credit cards, cash machine withdrawals and other payments. It says the Commission should establish agreed criteria on what is allowed by competition rules in this area, ensuring a level playing field.

Fisheries
Community system against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing
2008-05-30 - 09:12
Marie-Hélène AUBERT (Greens/EFA, FR) for the Fisheries Committee is proposing a non-binding report on the proposal for a regulation establishing a Community system to prevent ,deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. MEPs in the committee propose several amendments concerning the Community list of IUU fishing vessels, the inspections to be carried out and the sanctions and other measures to be imposed by Member States. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is a serious and growing problem worldwide. In certain fisheries, such as bluefin tuna and cod, the percentage of IUU fish is very high, sometimes as much as half of the total catch or even more. Among the most important IUU fishery scandals in recent years are bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean, cod in the Barents and Baltic Seas and Patagonian toothfish.
According to the rapporteur, Marie-Hélène AUBERT (Greens/EFA, FR), the proposal establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing "deserves the full support of Parliament, for it is to a significant extent based upon the demands that Parliament itself has made" on its report on the implementation of the EU action plan against IUU fishing, from 15 February 2007.
"If the proposal is adopted in its present form, it would put the Community at the forefront of international efforts to eliminate IUU fishing and in a position to put pressure on States which continue to allow IUU fishing by their vessels. Considering the Community's prominence as one of the largest fishing powers and the largest market in the world, the EU has a clear responsibility to be at the forefront", she says.
The essential elements of the proposal consist of :
• the creation of a list of vessels (both EU-flagged and non-EU) that are involved in IUU fishing;
• a scheme of port state control that would prohibit access by third country IUU vessels;
• a ban on the importation of IUU fish, by requiring certification by the flag state that the fish is legal;
• the development of a Community Alert System when there is a suspicion that IUU fish has been detected;
• prohibition of importing fish from countries that have been identified as not cooperating with the EU scheme;
• provisions detailing what actions are to be taken in each of the above situations.
There is also a need to ensure full compatibility between this proposal and the "Control Regulation", which is to be the subject of a new proposal for regulation in October.
The scope of the regulation and the IUU list
As far as the scope of the regulation goes, the question is whether the regulation should also apply to EU-flagged vessels or only to the vessels of third countries.
Marie-Hélène AUBERT believes that "if the provisions of the IUU regulation are not applicable to EU vessels, then it will be claimed, with justification, that the EU allows itself the privilege of conducting IUU fishing while it criticises others".
"The Community must apply the same rules to its own vessels and operators that it applies to others. Member States and parts of the industry argue that EU vessels are already regulated under the provisions of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), so they are fundamentally different from vessels from other countries. This is equivalent to saying we are better than everybody else. This position is not valid", she argues.
According to the Fisheries Committee, in addition to the owner and operator, the flag state must also be informed that one of its vessels is to be included in the European Community IUU vessel list, especially since it will then be required to take measures in this regard.
The IUU vessels list and the list of non-cooperating states should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union, says the committee. This will ensure that the list can be found in a specific official publication.
Furthermore, where one of an owner’s vessels has been included in an IUU list, a detailed inspection shall be carried out on all that owner's vessels.
Member States shall refuse to allow the export of a vessel flying their flag that is on the IUU list and may not under any circumstances grant support or subsidies to IUU vessels, MEPs propose to add.
Access to ports of Member States, the provision of port services, and the conduct of landing, transhipment or on-board processing operations in such ports shall be prohibited for third country fishing vessels that are included on the Community list of IUU fishing vessels. The report also states that Member States shall carry out inspections in their ports "of at least 50% of landings, transhipments and on-board processing operations by third country fishing vessels each year", while the Commission proposes of at least 15% of landings.
The catch certificate
The catch certificate, which would allow for a better traceability of the fish product, must continue to be a pillar of the regulation, "otherwise the entire scheme will be merely cosmetic and have no serious impact on IUU fishing", says the rapporteur.
"It has been described as too complex, but fishing in today's globalised world is a very complex business, with fish travelling all around the world between the time it is caught and the final sale to the consumer. Passing through multiple borders, ports and airports offers many opportunities to mix legal and illegal fish, in effect laundering the IUU fish. An effective and comprehensive system of traceability is essential to minimise amount of fish laundering that occurs", she adds.
Penalties must be dissuasive enough
At present, sanctions applied by the various Member States differ widely and both the Commission and the Court of Auditors have noted that the fines are not dissuasive. The European Parliament has also long called for harmonized penalties, sufficient to be dissuasive, instead of a simple "cost of doing business".
Since IUU vessels tend to concentrate on the most lucrative fisheries (bluefin tuna, cod) it is necessary that sanctions can be imposed that are high enough to be dissuasive.
The Fisheries Committee agrees that the "administrative sanctions" should include fines of a maximum of at least €300,000 for natural persons and of at least €500,000 for legal persons, adding that "Member States may also opt for penal sanctions provided that the amount of such sanctions is at least equivalent to that of the administrative sanctions".
The sanctions shall be accompanied by other sanctions or measures, in particular "a temporary ban for at least the duration of the programming period, or a permanent ban on access to public aid or subsidies", or "the repayment of public aid or subsidies received by IUU vessels during the relevant financial period".
During the first year following the entry into force of this regulation, six-monthly checks shall be carried out to determine Member States’ preparedness fully to comply with its provisions. Should any instances of non-compliance be identified, the Member State(s) concerned shall be required to make the necessary adjustments, says the Fisheries Committee.
Impact on developing countries
MEPs also add that the Commission shall, within three months of the entry into force of this regulation, publish an analysis of its probable impact on developing countries and a proposal for the funding of specific programmes to support its implementation and eliminate possible negative impacts.

Fisheries
Protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems
2008-05-30 - 09:12
The Fisheries Committee is proposing a report on a proposal for a regulation on the protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems in the high seas from the adverse impacts of bottom fishing gears, which is a priority of the Slovenian Council Presidency in the fisheries sector. The rapporteur, Duarte FREITAS (EPP-ED, PT), welcomes the Commission proposal but is putting forward a number of amendments which he considers to be important for the general balance of the regulation. In coastal areas, the management and protection of ecosystems, in line with Community guidelines, are the responsibility of the coastal states. In international waters, the protection of the marine environment is generally laid down by regional maritime conventions, where these exist, while the adoption of measures for the protection and management of marine living resources and the regulation of the impact of fishing on vulnerable ecosystems comes under the responsibility of Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMO). However, there are high-sea areas that are not covered by any organisation or regional fisheries management convention, and this, in practice, is tantamount to an encouragement to engage in destructive fishery activities.
The main aim of this proposal is to fill this vacuum and take the lead in regulating fishing activities in such areas. The proposed regulation implements the recommendations issued by the General Assembly of the United Nations on measures to eliminate destructive fishing practices that threaten vulnerable marine ecosystems in the high seas. The proposal applies to EU vessels operating in the high seas in areas that are not subject to regulation by a RFMO and thus require unilateral flag State regulation.
In order to conduct fishing activities with bottom gears in the high seas, Community fishing vessels must have a special fishing permit. The applications for these fishing permits shall be accompanied by a detailed fishing plan specifying in particular:
• the intended location of the activities;
• the targeted species;
• the depth at which the gears will be deployed;
• the configuration of the bathymetric profile of the seabed in the intended fishing grounds.
According to the Fisheries Committee, the type of gear should be mentioned, in addition to the depths, given that each type of equipment represents a different potential threat to the ecosystems. The fishing plan should also specify the species likely to be taken as by-catch, MEPs say.
Given that the specific conditions for the validation of fishing permits in particular areas is contained in Articles 4 and 5 of the proposal, MEPs in the committee consider that the depth restrictions proposed in Article 6 ("The use of bottom gears at depths beyond 1000m shall be prohibited") are totally unnecessary. Moreover, there are no scientific studies which prove that vulnerable marine ecosystems exist or cease to exist above or below this particular limit, adds the report.
Other amendments are intended to simplify procedures, an essential factor in protecting the ecosystems in question, and to add a reference to the work now under way in the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO).
Member States should be given some time to prepare for the necessary new administrative procedures. Therefore, the rapporteur proposes that the regulation enters into force 30 days after its publication in the Official Journal of the EU, instead of on the seventh day following that of its publication, as indicated by the Commission.

Agriculture
Young farmers need more incentives, say MEPs in the Agriculture Committee
2008-05-30 - 09:12
The European Parliament will debate and vote on an own initiative report by Donato Tommaso VERALDI (ALDE, IT), calling on the EU to boost its incentives for young farmers with a view to effect generation change and make the agro-food sector more dynamic. In recent years there has been a trend towards the depopulation of rural areas in the EU, which is more marked in remote areas, together with a steady ageing of the rural population. More than 50% of EU holdings are run by farmers over the age of 55, and 25% by farmers over the age of 65.
However, farms run by young people are, on average, more profitable and young farmers are more willing to adopt innovative solutions, use environment-friendly farming methods and adjust to market requirements. MEPs in the Agriculture Committee feel the "health check" of the CAP is a good opportunity to tackle the issue.
Therefore, the report drafted by Donato Tommaso VERALDI (ALDE, IT) on the future of young farmers under the ongoing reform of the CAP calls on the EU to boost its incentives for young farmers and remove obstacles to their settlement, making the sector more attractive to young people. These incentives include:
• improving setting-up support as these policies no longer meet farmers' needs or reflect the difficulties involved in taking over / setting up in problem farming areas;
• solving high indebtedness and credit access problems which makes it difficult for young farmers to establish a good competitive position;
• facilitating succession and land policy measures including facilitating succession arrangements for non-family members and looking into the "considerable increase in land prices"; and
• improving training and access to research by, for example, increasing support for lifelong training for farmers and improving farmers' access to research findings and the latest innovations relating to production methods and tools.
UK and Ireland
In 2005 young farmers (under the age of 35) in the UK represented 5.6% of the total farming workforce and in Ireland they represented 10.5%. The EU average was 8.3%. In 1995, the proportion of young farmers in the total farming workforce was significantly higher, representing approximately 10% in the UK and 14% in Ireland.

EP Committee on International Trade calls for changes to EU customs policy
2008-05-30 - 09:12
MEPs in the Committee on International Trade call on the Commission and Member States to establish a unified customs service and to pay particular attention to the problems faced by SMEs in an own initiative report drafted by Jean-Pierre AUDY (ALDE, FR). 2008 is the 40th anniversary of the customs union which, over time, has led to the abolition of all import and export customs duties between EU Member States and to the adoption by those countries of a common external tariff in their relations with third countries. It is a vital aspect of the proper functioning of the internal market and the correct application of the Union’s trade agreements.
The report by Jean-Pierre Audy, noting that European customs has reached a turning point due to the level of uncertainty and slowdown in World Trade Organisation's (WTO) slowdown, stresses the importance of effective import and export rules and procedures for the implementation of trade policy.
An ongoing lack of harmonisation
The committee criticises the reluctance of the Commission and the Member States to envisage new structures to ensure that Community customs legislation is applied in a uniform manner and calls for the establishment of a "unified European Union customs service to enable customs rules and procedures to be implemented more effectively".
The report notes the objections from certain Community industrial sectors with regard to the uniform application of the value-added criterion and "calls on the Commission and on the Member States to take account of these justified criticisms as far as possible".
New customs tasks
The report calls on the Commission and Member States to ensure that imported goods comply with European consumer protection standards and reiterates the need to establish an EU-level plan to combat counterfeiting and piracy.
A worrying erosion of freedom in the name of security
MEPs in the committee "deeply deplore" the adoption of the HR1 legislation by the US Congress in July 2007 and fear that once implemented, such measures will "curb the development of transatlantic trade". The report "acknowledges the legitimacy of concerns relating to the security of people and goods, but stresses the need to strike a fair balance between control and facilitation".
Customs feasibility and SMEs
The committee also "deplores the fact that the 'customs feasibility' of certain trade policy initiatives is not always properly assessed and taken into account" and calls on the Commission to pay particular attention to the problems encountered by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

External/international trade
A more responsive Generalised System of Preferences for developing countries
2008-05-30 - 09:12
The EP wants to make the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) system more responsive to the interests of beneficiary countries, especially Least Developed Countries. MEPs in the International Trade Committee also want the European Parliament to be better informed in a non-binding report being forward to plenary. In 1968, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) recommended the creation of a ‘Generalized System of Preferences’ (GSP) under which industrialized countries would grant trade preferences to all developing countries on a nonreciprocal basis, not just to former colonies.
The current system's guidelines cover the 2006 to 2015 period. The first multi-annual implementing regulation is valid from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2008. The second will be implemented from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011.
According to the report drafted by Helmut Markov (GUE/NGL, DE), chair of the Trade Committee, the Commission shall provide developing countries and especially LDCs with adequate technical assistance for building the institutional and regulatory capacity required to reap the benefits of international trade and the GSP.
In terms of Parliament's information, the report asks the Commission to prepare an impact assessment study of the effects of the GSP covering the period from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2009. The study shall be transmitted to the Committee, the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee by 1 March 2010.
At the time of the conclusion of the Doha Round, the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament, examining the impact of the negotiations on the GSP and considering the measures to be adopted to ensure the effectiveness of these preferences.

Development and cooperation
Work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2007
2008-05-30 - 09:12
Alain HUTCHINSON (PES, BE) will present an own-initiative report on behalf of the Development Committee on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2007. The report welcomes the fact that in 2007 the Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) provided a framework for an open, democratic and in-depth dialogue on the negotiation of EPAs between the European Union and the ACP countries, as shown by the adoption of the Kigali Declaration on development-friendly EPAs. The committee stresses the concerns expressed by the JPA over several aspects of the negotiations, with regard to both form and substance and points out that the debate is continuing since the adoption of EPAs with the Caribbean and interim agreements with certain countries and regions.
MEPs call on the parliaments of the ACP countries to demand that their governments and the Commission involve them in the process relating to the preparation and implementation of the Country Strategy Papers concerning cooperation between the European Union and their country (period 2008-2013).
The report calls on the Commission to supply all available information to the parliaments of the ACP countries and to provide them with assistance in this work of democratic control, in particular by supporting their capacities.
Darfur and Congo
The report Considers that the JPA resolution on the situation in Darfur, adopted in Wiesbaden on 28 June 2007 and the JPA resolution on the situation in Congo, in Kigali on 22 November 2007, are significant examples of this enhanced dialogue;
Parliament considers that the JPA, a forum for debate between European and ACP parliamentarians, plays a positive role in political dialogue and in the quest for a global, inclusive agreement for peace and development for the people of Darfur.

Food safety
Hygiene of foodstuffs
2008-05-30 - 09:12
Horst SCHNELLHARDT (EPP-ED, DE), on behalf of the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee will be presenting his report concerning the abolition of discrimination in transport rates and conditions on the hygiene of foodstuffs. This proposal deals with a "fast track action" relating to Regulation 852/2004/EC on the hygiene of foodstuffs. The purpose is to exempt small food businesses able to control food hygiene simply by implementing the other requirements of Regulation 852/2004/EC from the requirement to put in place, implement and maintain a permanent procedure or procedures based on the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles. This exemption will apply to micro-enterprises that are predominantly selling food directly to the final consumer. These enterprises have less than ten employees and have an annual turnover or annual balance sheet total that does not exceed €2m. The exemption would, therefore, not apply to large surface supermarkets and franchisers of supermarket chains.
The main amendments proposed are as follows:
- Members changed the title of the proposal, following the decision of the Conference of Presidents of 5 July 2007 authorising the ENVI and TRAN committees each to draw up a legislative report on the basis of Commission proposal. (Please seeCOD/2007/0037A). The Committee also proposes to delete the references to transport rates and conditions in this proposal;
- the legal basis for the proposal amending Regulation No 11 should be Article 75(3) of the EC Treaty, and the legal basis for the proposal amending Regulation No 852/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs should be Articles 152(4)(b) and 95 of the EC Treaty;
- the competent authorities must apply the flexibility provided for in Regulation (EC) No 852/2004, in particular Article 5(2)(g) and (5) thereof, in order to avoid undue burdens for small businesses;
- food business operators may be exempted from the requirement to put in place, implement and maintain a permanent procedure or procedures based on the HACCP principles. This shall apply only to businesses within the meaning of Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC of 6 May 2003 (with a particular focus on micro-enterprises) and the activities of which consist predominantly in the direct sale of food to the final consumer, and provided the competent authority considers, on the basis of a regular hazard analysis, that either there are no hazards that must be prevented, eliminated or reduced to acceptable levels, or that identified hazards are sufficiently and regularly controlled through the implementation of general and specific food hygiene requirements. In requiring evidence of compliance with the requirements laid down in Article 4(2) to (6), the competent authority shall take due account of the nature and size of the food business.
