50 years of the European Parliament - evolution, powers, policies, presidents and elections
Institutions
2008-03-12 - 19:17
The European Parliament celebrated its 50th anniversary on 12 March 2008 in Strasbourg during its plenary session. The President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering , the President-in-office of the Council and Prime Minister of Slovenia, Janez Janša and European Commission President José Manuel Barroso addressed the House.
This background note details the evolution of what was the European Assembly of 142 nominated Members with just four official languages and is now the directly elected European Parliament, with Members speaking 23 languages.
The European Parliamentary Assembly met for its constituent meeting in Strasbourg on 19 March 1958 with simple consultative powers.
The European Parliament of 2008 has wide decision-making powers on legislation, the budget and control and scrutiny of the European Commission. In fact, the European Parliament is unique in the world. There is no other directly elected supra-national parliament with such wide-ranging power.
Once and if the Lisbon Treaty is ratified, the European Parliament, following the elections in June 2009, will be composed of 751 MEPs with its powers once more enlarged.
Specifically, this background note highlights and recalls, over the last 50 years, key legislation adopted by the European Parliament, increases in its powers, dates of past European elections and elections of Parliament's Presidents, as well as the increase and evolution in the number of both MEPs and languages. There is also a list of EP Sakharov Prize-winners, an annual award for freedom of thought.
This note serves as a brief explanation of some European Parliament highlights over the last 50 years.

The European Parliament in action - key events and legislation since Parliament enjoyed co-decision powers with the Council
Current parliamentary term:
Consumer credit legislation adopted
16 January 2008
Parliament adopted a directive aiming to stimulate the European market while still protecting consumers. The new directive aims to harmonise consumer credit contracts in a number of areas, such as standard information to be included in advertising provided to consumers before contracts are signed and when they are concluded, calculations of the total cost of a loan, the right to cancel and the right to pay off a loan early.
Equitable Life report adopted
19 June 2007
Parliament overwhelmingly approved the final report by its committee of inquiry into the crisis at Equitable Life, a British life assurance company. The report includes a call for the UK government to set up a compensation scheme for policyholders who lost money. It also contains far-reaching recommendations on EU lawmaking, aimed at preventing such cases in future and at fostering a healthy European pensions and insurance market.
Mobile phone roaming legislation adopted
23 May 2007
The Regulation was adopted by an overwhelming majority to ensure that consumers can benefit from cheaper roaming. Thanks to an agreement brokered by the European Parliament, this new law cuts the cost of making and receiving mobile telephone calls while abroad in the EU, for at least 140 million users.
Investigations into CIA report adopted
14 Feb 2007
The final report on illegal CIA activities in Europe was approved by a majority of 382 against 256 with 74 abstentions, deplores the passivity of some Member States in the face of illegal CIA operations, as well as the lack of co-operation from the EU Council of Ministers.
REACH legislation adopted
13 December 2006
The draft regulation on REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of CHemicals). REACH, obliges producers to register all those chemical substances produced or imported above a total quantity of 1 tonne per year. Registration affects about 30,000 substances. MEPs succeeded in including the substitution of the most hazardous substances where alternatives exist, recognition of a duty of care by manufacturers and the promotion of alternatives to animal testing.
Services Directive adopted
15 November 2006
The services directive which aims to facilitate the provision of cross-border services by removing obstacles to the free movement of services in the internal market reached its final stage with the European Parliament approving the Council common position with minor changes. The final position adopted by Parliament broadly reflects the Parliament's first reading position achieving a balance between competition and social protection.
Port Services directive rejected for the second time
17 January 2006
The European Parliament for a second time torpedoed proposals on market access to port services. Many MEPs demanded in its place legislation on transparency and fair competition between ports. A number of MEPs also criticised the omission of Parliament's wishes on self-handling and pilot services, which were extremely controversial points of the first ports package.
Airlines blacklist adopted
16 Nov 2005
Parliament's first reading report was adopted with 577 votes in favour 16 against with 31 abstentions. It gave the green light for the introduction of an EU-wide blacklist of airlines that do not meet safety requirements.
Software Patents rejected
6 July 2005
Parliament rejected legislation on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions. This decision, supported by 648 MEPs on 680 who voted, reflected disagreement between MEPs and the Council: Members sought a way to avoid the granting of patents on pure software, while protecting inventions using computer programmes.
Tony Blair launches UK Presidency in the EP
23 June 2005
Tony Blair makes a speech to the European Parliament to launch the UK Presidency of the EU (second half of 2005). Tony Blair told MEPs that whatever they disagreed on, everyone agreed that a profound debate about the future of Europe was underway. He said this could not be resolved by trading insults or in terms of personalities, but only by an open and frank exchange of ideas.
1999-2004 Parliamentary term:
Temporary committee on improving safety at sea
21 April 2004
Following the Prestige disaster, the European Parliament decided to set up a temporary committee. In its final report, MEPs called for the creation of a European maritime safety area. This area should be based on: the banning of substandard vessels, the drawing up of joint protocols on action in the event of disasters, the introduction of a system of liability and the improvement of living and working conditions for seafarers.
Port services, rejection
20 November 2003
MEPs rejected, by 209 in favour, 229 against and 16 abstentions, the text, proposed by the conciliation committee, on the liberalisation of port services. The EP sunk port services directive for the second time on 18 January 2006
Ban on animal testing known as cosmetics directive
27 February 2003
MEPs approved a directive to outlaw animal tests for finished cosmetics products throughout the EU as of 2004. They also voted to phase in bans on tests of cosmetics ingredients that use animals and on any sales in the EU of animal-tested products and ingredients.
Renewable Energy
27 September 2001
The Directive on renewable energy sources set a target of 12% of energy consumption from renewables for the EU-15 by 2010. With the 2004 enlargement, the EU's overall objective became 21%. It also constitutes an essential part of the measures needed to comply with the Kyoto Protocol.
1994-1999 Parliamentary term:
Pressure from the European Parliament forces the European Commission to resign
14 January 1999
Parliament approves by 319 in favour, 157 against and 54 abstentions, a resolution to set up a committee of independent experts. On 15 March, the committee delivers its final report and denounces Commission's responsibility. The day after, the Jacques Santer Commission resigns.
Legal protection of industrial designs and models
13 October 1998
Parliament approved a directive to provide effective protection for industrial designs and models throughout the EU, the aim being to remove obstacles to the free movement of goods and guarantee undistorted competition. The final agreement provided for a ban on the introduction by Member States of any obstacles to free movement of goods, although changes in national law would be allowed if towards liberalisation.
Free market in Telecommunications
6 October 1997
With a series of legislative acts, the telecommunications market was opened up to competition across the Union. MEPs persuaded, inter alia , Council to introduce a requirement for Member States to ensure that all users have access to a basic set of quality services at a reasonable cost (universal service obligation).
Temporary committee of inquiry on BSE
19 February 1997
MEPs adopt the final report of the temporary committee of inquiry set up in 1996 and make 79 recommendations to combat BSE. The parliament also decided to set up another temporary committee to follow up its recommendations on BSE.

50th anniversary of the European Parliament commemorated in Strasbourg - 12 March 2008
50 years of the European Parliament celebrated in Strasbourg To celebrate the European Parliament's 50th anniversary on 19 March 2008, the presidents of the EP, the Council and the Commission each addressed the House in a special sitting in Strasbourg plenary on Wednesday, 12 March 2008. The speeches were preceded and followed by performances by the European Youth Orchestra.
In his opening address, European Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering first welcomed several former presidents of the European Parliament, the president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, speakers of national parliaments and numerous other dignitaries.
Mr Pöttering stressed that "step by step, the European Parliament has fought to secure more and more rights and has become ever more aware of its responsibility and of what it can do; and today it does credit to its name".
"Today, we are 785 Members from 27 European nations; we represent seven political groups and more than 150 national political parties; we are both a legislative and a budgetary authority, on an equal footing with the Council of Ministers; we exercise oversight over the European Commission and elect its President; we are the representatives of close to 500 million Union citizens; we reflect all political tendencies in the European Union; we have become self-assured and a major player in European politics", he said.
Talking about the Reform Treaty President Pöttering said "The Treaty of Lisbon will further strengthen our rights. In future, decisions on important issues now of concern to citizens in the European Union can be taken only if the European Parliament gives its consent".
"The Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter of Fundamental Rights will make a decisive contribution towards making democracy and parliamentarianism in the European Union a reality at all levels. We can be proud of our consistent support for the Reform Treaty and for the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
To applause from the House, he stressed the role of national parliaments, saying "the cooperation between the European Parliament and national parliaments is of special concern to us. We must endeavour, in future, to maintain that cooperation".
"An achievement worth embracing and celebrating"
The president-in-office of the Council, Janez Janša , prime minister of Slovenia, began by saying “Ce n’est pas sans émotion que je prends la parole", echoing the words spoken by Robert Schuman, the first President of the European Parliamentary Assembly, in his inaugural address on 19 March 1958.
Mr Janša recalled that, in the aftermath of two wars and in a world dominated by East-West tensions, "six Member States of the European Communities brought together 168 million Europeans, healed the wounds of the war, made economic progress and, together with the Euro-Atlantic alliance, safeguarded an area of freedom and democracy" - although "most of the remaining part of Europe, regrettably, existed in a totalitarian Communist environment".
But now, he said, an "entirely different image presents itself". With the "elimination of the borders that once divided Europe", "practically all of wider Europe now also lives in freedom and democracy. This is an achievement worth embracing and celebrating."
The existence and the operation of the European Parliament from 1958 is "a direct reflection of the progress achieved in the process of integration over the past fifty years", he added.
However, "if the first fifty years of the EU have been dedicated to the European agenda – to our own political and economic development and reform – the next fifty years will also put the global agenda at the forefront of our attention." Apart from economic issues, energy and climate change, Mr Janša highlighted human rights and intercultural dialogue as areas in which the European Parliament plays a key role.
The range of EU activities is increasing all the time but a single rule applies to them all: "success is directly proportional to unity". In the words of Jean Monnet, “Each man begins the world afresh. Only institutions grow wiser; they accumulate collective experience.” "Our joint task is therefore to promote the European collective experience. From this experience, we can draw the strength to address current challenges", argued Mr Janša.
On a personal note, the prime minister told the House "I know what this time represents for our generation, being born myself in the same year as the European Parliament" and he looked forward to "the next major anniversary of this home of European democracy".
European Commission President José Manuel Barroso
It has been 50 years since Schuman brought together the three European communities in a new single assembly, but the political choice outlining a European representative democracy has been confirmed at every subsequent stage of the European construction, said Commission President José Manuel Barroso.
The founding fathers foresaw that Europe needed lasting and strong institutions to enshrine the ever-deeper links among the Six. These institutions also had to be able to evolve, he continued, noting that Europe's "unique institutional triangle" has since proven its vitality by adapting to vast growth in the tasks entrusted to the Union and to the dynamics of enlargement.
"We owe this success to the ingenuity and balance of our institutional construction, which does not follow the usual distribution of powers. We owe it also to the way we work, which respects both the Community method and subsidiarity", he added.
Fifty years on, Europe, living in peace and spanning the continent, still needs strong institutions to tackle the challenge of our time: globalisation. Its experience of opening markets, accompanied by rules that reflect its values of freedom, solidarity and sustainable development, mean that "Europe alone has the dimensions, institutions and instruments necessary to shape globalisation", said the President.
Mr Barroso saluted Parliament's contribution to the European project, in every field of daily life. In 50 years, Parliament has gained many powers and prerogatives. Some of this power derives from the peoples' votes. Some is formal, such as co-decision and budgetary powers. And some derives from political influence - Parliament has become a co-legislator and an influential partner in the institutional triangle, but has also developed close links with national parliaments, he said.
Parliament's power has strengthened Europe as a whole. A strong European Parliament is an indispensable partner for other institutions, and in particular the European Commission, said the President, adding that the Lisbon Treaty, once ratified, will extend Parliament's powers, and also strengthen the Commission's dual democratic legitimacy through stronger links with Parliament and the Council.
Mr Barroso concluded with a quote from Portuguese writer Agustina Bessa Luis: "At 15 years old you have a future; at 25, a problem; at 40, experience; but before 50 years old, you have no history".
