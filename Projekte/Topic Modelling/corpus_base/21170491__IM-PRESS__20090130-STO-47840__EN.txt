"Un giorno da leone" (A day as a Lion) by Maurizio Chelucci We asked you to send in photos on the theme of "hard times" and chose one by Rome-based Maurizio Chelucci. The 47-year old Italian has been taking photos since he was young. His photo is entitled "A day as a Lion". Thank you for your entries, many of which can be viewed on the Flickr account below.
When describing his photo, Maurizio quoted John Belushi in the film "Animal House". "When the going gets tough, the tough get going."
The author of the photo describes what is happening as an example of "a strategy of survival that is not likely to damage anyone". He is an event manager and coordinator of exhibitions and has exhibited in Italy and abroad.
Maurizio Chelucci started taking photos when he was 15 for travel reports in Europe and Africa. Nowadays his activity is more focused on contemporary photography.
Our next topic is "The art of politics". Please send your entries to this address guestphotographer@europarl.europa.eu by midnight on 22 February.
