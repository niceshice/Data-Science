EP President expresses indignation at terrorist attacks in Mumbai, and pays tribute to businessman killed by ETA
EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering expressed his indignation at the "co-ordinated series of terrorist attacks" in Mumbai, and extended his sympathy to the family of victims who had lost their lives and those who were seriously injured through these crimes "that cannot be accepted". Mr Pöttering expressed his relief "amongst the great sadness" that all "participants of the EU delegation arrived back home safe and sound". MEPs also observed a minute of silence in tribute to the victims of terrorism in Mumbai and Mr Ignacio Uría Mendizabal, a 70-year old business man killed by the illegal Basque group ETA in Azpeita, Spain. Attention was also drawn to World AIDS Day on 1 December.
Common human values, inner peace and Tibet: Dalai Lama at European Parliament
The importance of individual happiness, which can be achieved with the help of universal human values - whether religious or non-religious - was one major theme in an address by the 14th Dalai Lama to the European Parliament on Thursday (4 December). The other topic raised by the Buddhist spiritual leader was the current plight and the future of Tibet. The Dalai Lama gave his speech to a formal sitting of the House as part of European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. In his welcoming address, European Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering alluded to the recent atrocities in Mumbai, saying that in such times "faith leaders who preach a message of peace and reconciliation between peoples can make a major contribution to our society."
MEPs debate the European Council of 11 and 12 December: Climate change, economic crisis and Lisbon Treaty
European Affairs Minister Jean-Pierre JOUYET underlined that the three main topics of the European Council 11 and 12 December would be: The Lisbon Treaty, the EU's response to the economic and financial crisis, and the fight against climate change. On the Lisbon Treaty, the Minister recalled that Ireland had just gone through a cross-party exercise of finding a way forward and whose conclusions were: Ireland must not be sidelined in Europe, full participation of Ireland in the EU is desirable and it was for Ireland to come forward with a solution taking into account the concerns expressed on 12 June in the referendum. Commission President José Manuel BARROSO focussed his comments on three priorities for the forthcoming summit: to enact decisive measures towards economic recovery, to show Europe will be able to equip itself to become low carbon economy giving leadership in fighting climate change, and to set out a road map to ratification for the Treaty of Lisbon. Most group speakers agreed the need for a deal on the climate change package on 17 December in Strasbourg and supported the Commission's proposals on the economic crisis. Some of the smaller groups asked for the Lisbon Treaty to be forgotten given the No vote in Ireland on 12 June.
MEPs debate climate change and energy package ahead of key vote
In the debate on climate change and energy package with the Council and Commission, most political group speakers underlined the urgency of reaching an early deal on 17 December in Strasbourg stating that climate change was the greatest challenge of our times. Other speakers said the package was not ambitious enough while one speaker questioned the science of climate change. Energy Commissioner Andris PIEBALGS said that the three institutions were close to reaching an agreement on the climate change package with only a few issues outstanding. Environment Commissioner Stavros DIMAS said that the climate change and energy package was one of the most significant pieces of work the EU had carried out over recent years. A low carbon economy would boost Europe's competitiveness and encourage innovation. Mr Dimas said that significant progress has been made and was "optimistic of a first-reading agreement".The Council presidency was represented by Jean-Louis BORLOO , French Minister of Ecology and Sustainable Development and Planning, who told the House that "the eyes of the world are on Europe this month" and that we are at "a turning point in our history".
€1 billion budget facility for rapid response to soaring food prices in developing countries
The European Parliament adopted a report by Gay MITCHELL (EPP-ED, IE) which says that the Commission's proposal for a 1-billion-euro fund to address the food crisis is a major, and very timely, contribution to meeting this urgent challenge. The report sets out that the total financial reference amount for the implementation of this Regulation over the period 2008-2010 will be €1 billion. The legislative resolution was adopted with 561 votes in favour, 24 against and 34 abstentions. MEPs adopted a compromise agreement between Parliament, Council and Commission allowing for adoption in first reading of the regulation establishing the 1 billion euro food facility.
Preventing VAT fraud: yes to better data collection and exchange
As part of a series of measures to help prevent VAT fraud, Parliament is backing a plan to accelerate the collection and exchange of data on intra-Community transactions, by having companies make monthly electronic statements of their data, as opposed to quarterly statements, often on paper, and imposing a one-month, rather than three month, deadline on Member States to share this information. Parliament adopted on two reports from José-Manuel Garcia Margallo (EPP-ED, ES) covering different aspects of the proposals. They reports also make clear that the Commission should review the administrative burden of these arrangements after two years.
Herring stocks off the West of Scotland
Parliament adopted a report by Struan STEVENSON (EPP-ED, UK) to introduce a multi-annual management plan for West of Scotland herring. The rapporteur recommends that, rather than complete closure of the fishery, a stock recovery plan should be put in place where the biomass falls below 50,000 tonnes. The West of Scotland herring stock is fished mainly by vessels from the UK, Netherlands, Germany and France. The report was adopted with 529 votes in favour, 49 against and 9 abstentions.
Small Business Act will "have a significant positive effect on the environment for SMEs"
SMEs are crucial to Europe's economy, providing over 100 million jobs. In view of the current financial market crisis, the European Council must confirm that it will formally approve the Small Business Act (SBA) and make its provisions binding, say MEPs in a resolution put forward by the EPP-ED and Socialist groups. The resolution was adopted with 614 votes in favour, 11 against and 9 abstentions.
Governments should adopt position on EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports without delay, say MEPs
Parliament adopted a resolution on the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports strongly criticising the current political impasse on the non-adoption of the Common Position and urging the French Presidency, and otherwise the forthcoming Presidencies, to resolve the issue by ensuring that the Common Position is adopted without further delay. This year marks the tenth anniversary of the EU Code on Arms Exports, yet, despite calls from Parliament, the failure of the Council to adopt the Common Position since 2005 has left "the issue unresolved". 20081127BRI43138 Texts adopted 4 December 2008 Draft Agenda - 15-18 December - Strasbourg plenary session

EP President expresses indignation at terrorist attacks in Mumbai, and pays tribute to businessman killed by ETA
2008-12-05 - 11:34
EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering expressed his indignation at the "co-ordinated series of terrorist attacks" in Mumbai, and extended his sympathy to the family of victims who had lost their lives and those who were seriously injured through these crimes "that cannot be accepted". According to the Indian Ministry of Interior, the attack caused the death of 190 people, 22 of whom were foreign citizens, and left over 200 people injured and many in a critical condition.
Hans-Gert Pöttering said, "Today we are all Indians. Terrorism is a direct attack on freedom, human rights and democracy. Terrorism is an attempt to use blind violence to destroy our values, values which bind us in the European Union and our Member States."
Relief for MEPs and staff who came home amongst great sadness
Noting that the EP Committee on International Trade was present in Mumbai at the time of the attacks, Mr Pöttering expressed his relief "amongst the great sadness" that all "participants of the EU delegation arrived back home safe and sound". He welcomed home MEPs Sajjad Karim, Ignasi Guardans, Erika Mann, Syed Kamall, Bela Glatterfelder, Daniel Caspery, Jan Tadeusz Masiel and staff of the European Parliament, all of whom were in Mumbai at the time of the attacks.
Pöttering also stressed that "at a time of events like this, citizens of Mumbai can turn to any EU Member State for support. This is the kind of solidarity that the EU is all about".
A minute's silence for businessman killed by ETA
MEPs also observed a minute of silence in tribute to the victims of terrorism in Mumbai and Mr Ignacio Uría Mendizabal, a 70-year old business man killed by the illegal Basque group ETA in Azpeita, Spain.
World AIDS Day - 1 December
EP President Pöttering also drew attention to World AIDS Day on 1 December. He stated that according to the World Health Organisation from 1999-2006, there had been 800 000 new cases in Europe. One in ten of the infections were in people under 25. President Pöttering called for better information and early treatment and underlined the importance of people having the infection not being stigmatised by society.
Change to the agenda - vote on Israel's participation in EC programmes postponed
At the request of the GUE/NGL group and supported by the Greens/EFA, Parliament voted in favour - 194 votes in favour to 173 against - of postponing the vote on Israel's participation in EC programmes to a later date. The debate will nevertheless take place on Wednesday 3 December.

Common human values, inner peace and Tibet: Dalai Lama at European Parliament
2008-12-05 - 11:34
The importance of individual happiness, which can be achieved with the help of universal human values - whether religious or non-religious - was one major theme in an address by the 14th Dalai Lama to the European Parliament on Wednesday. The other topic raised by the Buddhist spiritual leader was the current plight and the future of Tibet. The Dalai Lama gave his speech to a formal sitting of the House as part of European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. Dalai Lama's non-violent approach "an extraordinary example", says EP President In his welcoming address, European Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering alluded to the recent atrocities in Mumbai, saying that in such times "faith leaders who preach a message of peace and reconciliation between peoples can make a major contribution to our society." Turning to the situation of Tibet, the EP president stressed that "the European Parliament seeks to be a voice raised in defence of human rights and human dignity. In this respect, Parliament has consistently sought to highlight the human rights of the Tibetan people". While respecting China's territorial integrity, he stressed that "in our dialogue with China, we have a responsibility to be open and honest in expressing our commitment to our shared values of democracy, the rule of law, human rights and freedom of expression". Concluding, he told the Dalai Lama, "Your non-violent approach provides an extraordinary example of committed and peaceful campaigning for a worthy cause". Dalai Lama: happiness can be based on religious or non-religious values While asking MEPs to take note of his written statement (see link below), the Tibetan spiritual leader chose to speak without notes. Describing himself as "just one of 6 billion people", he said his first concerns were to promote human values and religious harmony. He stressed the importance of leading "a happy life", which could best be achieved by having "peace of mind" and argued that there was nowadays too much emphasis on material values, with "too much stress, suspicion, ambition and greed". However, he believed that inner value "does not necessarily come from religious teaching" but is a "biological" necessity, since "we are social animals". In fact, he saw "secular ethics" and an emphasis on "inner peace" as a basis for a happy life, and he advocated "secular methods", including "common sense, common experience, religious and scientific findings". He pointed out that Buddhism was a "non-theistic religion". Commenting on the number of women MEPs in the Chamber, the Buddhist leader said the historical emphasis on physical strength was now being superseded by an emphasis on mental powers - a development which would give the advantage to women and which he welcomed since women were "more feeling and more sensitive". Tibet Turning to his other major concern, the fate of Tibet, the Dalai Lama reiterated his well-known position that he sought not independence but general autonomy for Tibet within the People's Republic of China, and also that he was committed to non-violence in pursuing that goal. The Chinese constitution, he pointed out, specifically mentions minority rights. Indeed, his approach was best for China itself, argued the Tibetan spiritual leader, since "general harmony and unity can only come through trust and mutual respect". He also asked the European Union to play a role, saying that while it should keep close to China, nevertheless - to quote a Tibetan saying - "if you are a true friend you will make clear your friend's faults". The Dalai Lama concluded by thanking the EP Tibet Intergroup for its support and said he was joining their 24 hour fast in support of the Tibetan people.

European Council
MEPs debate the European Council of 11 and 12 December: Climate change, economic crisis and Lisbon Treaty
2008-12-05 - 11:34
Ahead of the European Council of the 11 and 12 December, MEPs debated the three key topics, namely, the climate change and energy package, the response to the economic crisis and progress on the Lisbon Strategy. Most group speakers agreed the need for a deal on the climate change package on 17 December in Strasbourg and supported the Commission's proposals on the economic crisis. Some of the smaller groups asked for the Lisbon Treaty to be forgotten given the No vote in Ireland on 12 June. Council - French Presidency
European Affairs Minister Jean-Pierre JOUYET underlined that the three main topics of the European Council 11 and 12 December would be: The Lisbon Treaty, the EU's response to the economic and financial crisis, and the fight against climate change.
On the Lisbon Treaty , the Minister recalled that Ireland had just gone through a cross-party exercise of finding a way forward and whose conclusions were: Ireland must not be sidelined in Europe, full participation of Ireland in the EU is desirable and it was for Ireland to come forward with a solution taking into account the concerns expressed on 12 June in the referendum. Mr Jouyet recalled that 25 parliaments had ratified the Lisbon Treaty and the European Council would draw up a "road map" on the way forward.
As to the economic crisis , Minister Jouyet said that the EU had already responded by bringing forward proposals. The European Commission he said was on the right track. The European Social Fund, the Globalisation Fund, structural funds and the European Investment Bank would all be crucial in finding a response. It would also be essential funding for SMEs who bore much of the economic crisis.
On the energy and climate change package , Minister Jouyet underlined the importance of reaching a deal under the French Presidency in order to be ready for the negotiations in Copenhagen.
European Commission
Commission President José Manuel BARROSO focussed his comments on three priorities for the forthcoming summit: to enact decisive measures towards economic recovery, to show Europe will be able to equip itself to become low carbon economy giving leadership in fighting climate change, and to set out a road map to ratification for the Treaty of Lisbon.
The Commission's proposal on the economy was to "inject €200bn to get the economy moving again via unprecedented joint action - it is plan which is not the lowest common denominator, but which does take account of the different budgetary situations of the Member States". It was a matter of defining common goals to be attained jointly. There would need to be coordination in the implementation of the plan as well as in drawing it up.
"This is a test the about very idea we have of Europe - do we want a European response to global problems: it can show we have requisite coordination and budgetary stimulation while guaranteeing long term viability of public expenditure," he said.
Mr Barroso also called for a change to the EU budgetary framework to allow unspent appropriations to pay for environmentally friendly energy projects.
On climate change, Parliament had, he said, helped to show it to be one of the major political, economic and civilisational issues at this time. Despite the downturn, the EU had not wavered in its commitment to core 20-20-20 goal for 2020. The European Council would be crucial to reaching an agreement on climate change legislation but Parliament's role was vital too. As well as its democratic input, Parliament was indispensable in building the necessary cross-party and cross-border consensus.
"Some would argue in this economic downturn, that the Lisbon treaty discussion is a distraction - they are wrong." The crisis had shown the EU to be essential in helping to ensure the welfare of its citizens. This was, he said, the time to make its tools to achieve this more effective and efficient. The EU had, he said, shown maturity in respecting the Irish vote and taking time, working together with Ireland to find way forward which also respected the positive ratification decisions in other Member States. It was now urgent to see a treaty in force: "I hope next week we will have a road map to allowing Ireland to ratify too."
Political group speakers
Joseph DAUL (EPP-ED, FR) welcomed the Commission's recovery plan, which is "an appropriate tool for responding to current difficulties", but stressed that "the economic and social cohesion of our countries has to remain the key priority". The Commission's proposals are a "good step forward", he said, but "our priority has to be to prevent us getting into a downward spiral of recession". He found it "deeply regrettable that some political families do not agree with that approach".
With regard to the energy and climate package, Mr Daul called "on all those involved to do their utmost to find a satisfactory agreement". The EU must show the way by adopting a responsible, political attitude, which is tailored to the situation, he said, and the fact that "we have made progress on some of the texts is a positive sign".
For the PES group, Poul Nyrup RASMUSSEN (DK) said that that 21 million will be unemployed in one year's time, and 25 million will be unemployed by 2010 "unless we do something". He stressed the importance of "true co-ordination" in tackling the current financial difficulties, and proposed that Member States invest 1% of GDP "this year, in 2010 and in 2011". "I share your ambition", he said, "but there is a lack of goals in practise."
Graham WATSON (ALDE, UK) noted that for this European Council "speed no longer seems to be of the essence". "We need the Council and Commission to acknowledge what Martin Luther King called the 'fierce urgency of now'", he said. "We've got to stay in the growth and stability pact, maintain competitions and meet the challenge of the Lisbon agenda, but we've got to act fast."
Regarding the climate package, Mr Watson said "If we don't tackle climate change now," "the bill will balloon". "Last week's CO2 deal on cars show how easy it is to take the path of least resistance, to let vested interests get ahead of global interests," he said.
He also stressed the importance of cohesion between member states, stating that the Mumbai terrorist attacks highlighted the failure of the EU when an EU Consul told Members of Parliament that he could only help citizens of his own country.
Rebecca HARMS (Greens/EFA, DE) asked if there was going to be an "ambitious climate strategy" against the backdrop of the economic and financial crisis. "I would assert that everything the Commission has said so far seems to negate what has been done in the trilogue." Emissions trading is the most important lever we have in climate policy, she argued, and yet energy intensive industries are being allowed an opt-out, and only developing countries are to meet CO2 targets. "The Commission needs to stop making mistakes of the past," she added.
Brian CROWLEY (UEN, IE) said that on the economic recovery plan all Member States would need to work together and what the Commission is proposing "dovetailed nicely" into the Member States' policies. It was ironic, he said, that it was this crisis that brought the UK government closer to the EU. Collective effort and will was the answer. On the Lisbon Treaty, Mr Crowley welcomed the recent report of the Irish Parliament. All Member States, he said, would have to make changes and compromise.
Mary Lou McDONALD (IE) spoke for the GUE/NGL group. She said that if (Irish Taoiseach) Brian Cowan told EU leaders Irish support for Lisbon could be won with soothing noises and political declarations, he would be being misleading. The Irish people had "concerns on workers rights, public services, militarisation and democracy. These are shared by millions of working people across Europe." As governments recognised the need for state intervention to meet people's needs, the Lisbon Treaty was a "coronation of the failed free market approach", she said. EU leaders should "lead from the hearts and spirits of the people" rather than reflecting the interests of lobbyists or bureaucrats, she said.
For the IND/DEM group, Hanne DAHL (DK) said we now faced a hollow compromise on the Treaty, as result of manipulation and threats in the wake of the Nice Treaty. Making the Commission smaller was bad news for Ireland and for her own Member State, she said. "Democracy has failed here. We lecture people on democracy, with the Sakharov Prize, but democracy is about more than threats and promise. Where people have spoken, they have said no."
Jim ALLISTER (UK), a non-attached MEP, said the summit should focus solely on the economic crisis, but "sadly will devote time to trying to subjugate will of the Irish people. This juggernaut-Mugabe approach would not be dared with large country, but the Republic of Ireland votes were fair game to be pushed around by the European elite for whom precious Lisbon project is more important than democracy," he said.
Response by Commission President
Responding to the leading group speakers, Mr Barroso welcomed support for the economic recovery plan. He agree with Mr Rasmussen that employment was a key issue: indeed, it would be the main measure of the success of the steps taken.
It was, he said, vital to build a cross-party and cross-border consensus on the need for policy coordination to get the greatest effect out of the measures taken. He called for MEPs to try to influence finance ministers from their political families to abandon their traditional resistance to coordination of economic measures: "If it is not now, in face of this crisis that we can agree on more coordination, then when? This is why I see it as a test for Europe. Is Europe going to translate concern into coordination for the future? This is the position I will bring to European Council on behalf of the Commission."
British and Irish speakers
In relation to economic issues, Timothy KIRKHOPE (EPP-ED, UK) said that the UK government has announced the largest level of borrowing in history and is now saddled with massive borrowing for the foreseeable future. "Last week we had details of the Commission's important recovery plan – which I believe contained some very positive items – but I do fear that this initiative may not alone deal with the immediate problems. The focus should be to get the banks to lend to each other and to businesses and ordinary people. With unemployment set to soar, we must build confidence, not leave a legacy of debt and higher taxes for our children and grandchildren to contend with."
Regarding the Lisbon Treaty, Andrew DUFF (ALDE, UK) said he believed that we are making some progress at last. The Czech Court and the Irish Parliament have comprehensively and decisively blunted the attack upon the Treaty from the nationalist and reactionary forces. It is now up to the Czech Parliament and the Irish Government, he said, to take the next decisive steps. "We need a clear pledge from the Taoiseach that he is to hold a second referendum at a specific time and we need a more professional campaign plan. The Parliament here appeals to the profound generosity of the Irish people and to their sharp intelligence to see the seriousness of the consequences of a second 'no'."
While there is an overwhelming desire in Ireland to remain at the heart of European affairs, now more important than ever in the current economic climate, Proinsias DE ROSSA (PES, IE) stressed that Irish citizens, however, need assurances that the misleading claims on Lisbon by the 'no' camp on the Commission, on abortion, on conscription, on military neutrality, no workers' rights and public services have no basis in fact. The right of all Member States to nominate a Commissioner without restriction is also important and he felt that a simple extension of that right from 2014 to 2019 will not be sufficient to ensure ratification in Ireland. In addition, a commitment to add a social clause on labour rights to the posting of workers directive. Mr De Rossa urged the Council and the Commission to address these matters urgently at the coming summit.
On the Lisbon Treaty, Avril DOYLE (EPP-ED, IE) said, "yes we have had time to digest and analyse the 12 June vote, but no, Minister Jouyet, we will not – and should not even attempt – to ratify again at the beginning of next year, or we risk failure again with our deeply unpopular government." She expressed her thanks to the French Presidency's offer of all assistance with legal guarantees and any assurances that may be required. "I thank all Members and you, Madam President, for your understanding as we continue to trespass on your patience."
Neena GILL (PES, UK) said that given the massive increase of loss of life due to terrorist attacks across the world where innocent people from east, west, north and south are increasingly targets, she believed it is remiss of the Council not to put this issue on the agenda of next week's council meeting. The US is acting but Europe not, she said. "As we speak Condoleezza Rise is over there but where is Javier Solana? Tensions are increasing between two nuclear states. Europe should and could do more, especially by looking at the agreements it has like the strategic partnership with India but adequately resorting the sentiments that have been there as to how they can be achieved and realised."
Mairead McGUINNESS (EPP-ED, IE) said that "we wait to see what the Irish Government says next week. It does not have much public confidence at the moment so it may not be the best of times to talk about another vote if that is what has to happen. But I do believe that there is sense prevailing in Ireland and that people are now reflecting on the situation we find ourselves in and now know that we need to be at the heart of Europe given the crisis that we are in."
Richard CORBETT (PES, UK) questioned where in a situation where 25 or 26 countries have said 'yes' to the Lisbon Treaty and just one has said no, it is not unreasonable, nor indeed undemocratic to ask whether the one is willing to reconsider, but provided the rest of us are willing to meet the concerns that were expressed when they voted no. That, he said, is not to ignore the result of the Irish referendum, but to respond to the result, look at the concerns that were expressed and try to meet them. But that requires Ireland to tell us exactly what concerns were expressed, to define a list of demands that we can then respond to or at least negotiate over. The solution, he said, has to be acceptable to all 27 countries, preferably that means not renegotiating the whole Treaty but interpreting it, clarifying it, adjusting the way it could be implemented to meet the concerns. Concluding, Mr Corbett said he was confident that this could be done but it requires the first step from Ireland. He was glad that the Irish Parliament is taking the initiative on this instead of leaving it to the government. audio, 28:48 - Council and Commission (J.-P. Jouyet, J. M.

MEPs debate climate change and energy package ahead of key vote
2008-12-05 - 11:34
In the debate on climate change and energy package with the Council and Commission, mos political group speakers underlined the urgency of reaching an early deal on 17 December in Strasbourg stating that climate change was the greatest challenge of our times. Other speakers said the package was not ambitious enough while one speaker questioned the science of climate change. European Commission
Energy Commissioner Andris PIEBALGS said that the three institutions were close to reaching an agreement on the climate change package with only a few issues outstanding. An agreement on the renewable energy directive would make a big difference especially for Europe's energy supply. The goal, he recalled was to have a 20 per cent share of renewable energy in the EU by 2020. The directive would set out the goals on bio fuels and ensure access to the energy networks for renewable energy.
The main sticking points int the trilogue, he said, was on the "co-operation mechanisms" and whether to introduce a review in 2014. The European Parliament, he said, felt that such a review could undermine the certainty for investment. Overall, there would be no changes to the binding targets but there was a need for flexibility.
Environment Commissioner Stavros DIMAS said that the climate change and energy package was one of the most significant pieces of work the EU had carried out over recent years. A low carbon economy would boost Europe's competitiveness and encourage innovation. Mr Dimas said that significant progress has been made and was "optimistic of a first-reading agreement".
On the emissions trading system he recalled that the ceilings would lead to a 21 per cent reduction by 2020 in carbon emissions. On leakage, Mr Dimas underlined the importance of reaching an international agreement, and on financing carbon capture and storage, an issue close to the heart of the European Parliament, a decision had already been taken to use the reserve.
Council Presidency
The Council presidency was represented by Jean-Louis BORLOO , French Minister of Ecology and Sustainable Development and Planning, who told the House that "the eyes of the world are on Europe this month" and that we are at "a turning point in our history".
Referring to last night's EP-Council-Commission trilogue on the climate change package, he said "we are now in a crucial phase in the negotiations" but the trilogue was proceeding as well as could be expected.
However, some difficult points remained, including the question of solidarity and progressivity in achieving the 20/20/20 targets, given the differing circumstances of different Member States and the need to increase efficiency on the electricity market without imposing a burden on consumers.
The minister told MEPs that three main blocs had emerged in the negotiations: the Baltic countries, which are committed under treaty to dismantling nuclear power stations, countries such as Poland which have less energy-efficient, high-carbon economies and need agreement on the progressivity timetable, and countries which are sensitive to the cost of the solidarity mechanisms.
He looked forward to progress being made on these issues at a meeting on 6 December in Gdansk under the French presidency and emphasised "What we don't do today will have a higher cost in the future" and "if we make this historic change it will augur well for the Copenhagen conference and for our planet".
Political group speakers
On behalf of the EPP-ED group, Joseph DAUL (FR) described the energy and climate change package as a "huge challenge" even before the financial crisis but stressed that "we cannot afford to fail". He believed "it is not impossible to win people over" and "to get our fellow citizens on our side". Europe needs "to promote eco-innovation", he said, and he was encouraged by the adoption of an agreement on reducing CO2 emissions in cars. The key was to "reassure our citizens about the future".
Describing climate change as "one of the central challenges of our time", Martin SCHULZ (DE), for the Socialist group, stressed that "the tough detailed work has been done here in this House" and therefore that "not Sarkozy but Sacconi should get the credit" (a reference to Parliament's rapporteur, Guido Sacconi). He stressed that the special procedure being used in Parliament to speed through the legislation was unusual and that MEPs would insist that the outcome of the negotiations, when finished, would have to be acceptable to the EP.
Speaking for the Liberals, Graham WATSON (UK) was pleased that "we might be days away from a historic agreement" but he warned of those who would complain. He said it was "irresponsible" of Italy to claim that energy measures would push up power bills by 17%. Concluding, he said we need the Council "to reaffirm its commitment to the 20/20/20 targets" and we must ensure that lobbying by certain interests doesn't blight this opportunity. In short, "the Council must keep its word".
Claude TURMES (LU) for the Greens/EFA warned: "We will lose all diplomatic credibility if we do not have a climate change package that looks to the future". The fact that Barack Obama wants to put renewable energies and green technology at the heart of the structure of the American economy represents an "historical opportunity", he said. "Europe has always shown international leadership. We have always set the standards for international climate policy, and now we are risking throwing it away because of the highest polluting companies."
Alessandro FOGLIETTA (UEN, IT) stressed the importance of universal targets and it is up to Europe to lead the way. The 20, 20, 20 formula represents an ambitious attempt to improve our situation, he said, but "we should be bold enough to admit that we might hamper Europe's industry if all targets are not respected multilaterally," he said, otherwise "it would render our efforts vain". Measures needed to keep Europe competitive on the world stage include providing a cost benefit analysis and evaluating the effect of instruments in the climate package and the ETS directive on Europe's SMEs and the public purse, he concluded.
Umberto GUIDONI (GUE/NGL, IT) said that people who thought the 20, 20, 20 formula will prove too costly for the European economy "are blind". There are "huge advantages" to disseminating renewable energies, including job creation, better energy use, and an improved economy. "We need to move away from the finance-based economy - bailing out our banks, which led us to this situation in the first place," he said. "Public investment should focus on innovative areas in the environment and energy," he added.
Johannes BLOKLAND (IND/DEM, NL) welcomed the "ambitious climate and energy package" and thanked the Commission for its "untiring efforts during the negotiations". At times, the Presidency gave the impression that it could not move substantially towards the position of the European Parliament and "this could really damage the energy and climate package". Some Member States are using the financial crisis as a pretext to "water down" climate obligations, but the costs in future would be far greater, he said.
Roger HELMER (NI, UK) said that we are undoubtedly facing the "greatest crisis that I have seen in my lifetime". "The threat is not posed by global warming," he said, "but by our policy responses to global warming" because "they will have a devastating economic effect". "The measures we are debating today represent the greatest collective flight from reality that we have ever seen," he concluded.
British and Irish speakers
Referring to Minister Borloo's speech in which he spoke about special arrangements for some countries in difficulty, Linda MCAVAN (PSE, UK) thought it acceptable, provided they are time limited and do not undermine the overall architecture of the project. Her group, she said, will support those special arrangements if they are in that context. Europe has to make a choice, she said, "Either we lead or we dance to other people's tunes." With regard to the economic crisis, she said it was failure to act to regulate financial institutions which has caused this crisis – failure by politicians as well as banks. Let us, she said, not make that same mistake on climate change. "If we do, it will be ordinary people who will pay the price for our failure, just as they are paying the price today for failure on the banking crisis."
In relation to carbon capture and storage, Chris DAVIES (ALDE, UK) stressed on the potential this technology has to make a huge difference in abating CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. If we are to secure an international agreement, he said, if we are to lock China in – which gets 80% of its electricity from coal – we have got to deal with the problem of big power stations, big fossil-fuel, carbon dioxide-generating power stations. The first step is to test and develop the technology. We have got to get the demonstration projects up and running. But, he said, what is on the table from the Council is not enough. It will not deliver the pledge made by heads of government last year to have up to 12 demonstration projects in operation by 2015. In the next two weeks, he said, we have a chance to negotiate a deal to actually put this technology into practice.
On climate legislation, Avril DOYLE (EPP-ED, IE) said that there is no choice. As politicians, she said, we owe it to our communities, both present and future, to stand up and be counted. Having witnessed first-hand many frustrating COPs in recent years, Mrs Doyle believed in the need for Europe to drive this process forward, as was done in Bali, and to deliver in time for the COP 15 in Copenhagen. However, she warned that we will not just ‘sign off’ on any deal. Any signing off, she said, will be done at a subsequent trialogue between the French presidency and the European Parliament. She asked Minister Borloo to make it very clear to President Sarkozy – that a generous percentage of the auction revenues should be earmarked for adaptation and mitigation in developing countries, because legislation without generous financing will not result in a global agreement.
Caroline LUCAS (Greens/EFA, UK) challenged one sentiment that has been repeated several times in the debate. We, she said, do not have to choose between tackling the economic crisis and tackling the climate crisis. We should be using the financial crisis as an opportunity to completely reshape the focus and direction of our economy, to make it a genuinely sustainable economy which will actually deliver environmental and economic benefits. This is a critical test for the whole EU project itself, and it is not one we can afford to fail.
While huge progress was made in the negotiations on renewable energy, Fiona HALL (ALDE, UK) said it was disappointing not to reach complete agreement last night, but the one clause at issue is not just about keeping inviolate the 20% by 2020 target. A lot of hard work has been done to ensure that there is legal certainly in the flexibility mechanisms which Member States can use to help them achieve their renewables targets. A review of the flexibility mechanisms in 2014 risks undoing all that good work. It risks undermining the large-scale development of renewables and green collar jobs which promise a renaissance for European regions like mine, north-east England. That is why we cannot give in on a wording which is being insisted on by just one Member State. Positive progress has been made on the renewables directive with the achievement of a strong text on biofuels and crucially indirect land use change will now be factored in at the insistence of the Parliament. This legislation, she concluded, must work well for the EU but it must also work as a strong offer on the table of the global negotiations.
Martin CALLANAN (EPP-ED, UK) expressed concern that, during the progress of this legislation, it is being speeded through both the Council and Parliament with sometimes undue haste. It is important, he stressed, that all of this legislation is scrutinised properly and that everybody has the chance to contribute to the debate. We must, he said, make sure that we get this very important legislation right and that there are no mistakes that might discovered in future.
John BOWIS (EPP-ED, UK) said that the Pacific islands are quite literally sinking beneath the waves. Global warming is bringing new diseases and also mosquitoes carrying malaria and dengue fever into that region. He reported that at the recent ACP meeting in Papua New Guinea the consequences of failing to prevent and failing to manage climate change were discussed. "Even if we meet our 2o target that means a 25% reduction in water availability; it means a 10% decline in crop yields; it means 50 million more people subject to malaria; it means 10 million more subject to coastal flooding; it means dramatic increases in respiratory, cardio-vascular, vector-borne diseases, skin cancer and eyesight problems. If they fail, we fail. Their diseases are already our diseases. Their migration will become our migration. Their desperation could lead to desperation as they spill across our borders too and it is for our sakes as much as for theirs that we must help them make progress, and make it quickly."
Colm BURKE (EPP-ED, IE) said that climate change is attacking the natural resource face of poor communities including their land and water reserves and people are subsequently being forced to migrate for survival. Such migration flows can have destabilising consequences and can threaten the overall internal security of a particular country, region or border area. Reporting on his visit to the Chad/Sudanese border area this year as a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Burke saw the devastation caused by war and food shortages. Climate change will make situations like this worse, he said, Unfortunately, those most at risk are the least culpable in creating this situation. He was delighted to see Parliament taking leadership on this matter. The EU, the US and other world powers need to act, he concluded.
The contribution in writing from Richard CORBETT (PSE, UK) welcomed the progress that has been made to date. "To be acceptable to Parliament the package of measures must be sufficiently vigorous for us to achieve the agreed EU targets of a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions and a 20% increase in renewables by the year 2020 - but also to enable us to go further and raise this up to 30% in the event of an international agreement. I am also pleased that there seems to be agreement that the bio-fuels target should be subject to strict sustainability criteria." Briefing text + related links

Development and cooperation
€1 billion budget facility for rapid response to soaring food prices in developing countries
2008-12-05 - 11:34
The European Parliament adopted a report by Gay MITCHELL (EPP-ED, IE) which says that the Commission's proposal for a 1-billion-euro fund to address the food crisis is a major, and very timely, contribution to meeting this urgent challenge. The report sets out that the total financial reference amount for the implementation of this Regulation over the period 2008-2010 will be €1 billion. The legislative resolution was adopted with 561 votes in favour, 24 against and 34 abstentions. MEPs adopted a compromise agreement between Parliament, Council and Commission allowing for adoption in first reading of the regulation establishing the 1 billion euro food facility. Aim of the €1 billion The Community will finance measures aimed at supporting a rapid and direct response to the volatile food prices in developing countries, addressing primarily the period between emergency aid and medium- to long-term development cooperation. Gay Mitchell said in the debate in Brussels "The food facility began as a proposal from the Commission, in the light of the rising food prices that provoked riots in some countries, to use EUR one billion in leftover agricultural subsidy money to relieve the situation in developing countries through agricultural inputs and emergency safety nets. The money was, in this form, expected to be wholly additional to existing development funds. Now, five months later, we have our billion, but it is in an entirely different form than that originally envisaged." More on the €1 billion The instrument aims to improve access to agricultural inputs and services, including fertilizer and seed, as well as so-called safety-net measures, aiming to preserve or improve agricultural production and to satisfy the basic food needs of the most vulnerable people. To optimise the utility and impact of this Regulation, resources, says the Parliament shall be concentrated on a limited list of high-priority target countries, in coordination with other donors and other development partners through relevant needs-assessments made available by specialised and international organisations such as those of the UN system, in consultation with partner countries. Parliament succeeded in securing funding for agricultural aid for developing countries: it was possible to maintain the total amount of €1 billion that had been proposed for "a facility for rapid response to soaring prices in developing countries" over the three-year period 2008-10. The funds will come from three sources: the flexibility instrument, the emergency aid reserve and the redeployment of funds within the external relations heading. €760 million is "fresh money", including, in 2008, mobilisation of the Emergency Aid Reserve still available in this year’s budget, amounting to €22 million, and an additional sum of €240 million – this raising of the funding ceiling of the Emergency Aid Reserve (EAR) in 2008 required unanimity in Council and an adjustment of the inter-institutional agreement. €78 million will come from the 2009 EAR. The institutions also agreed on the use of the flexibility instrument for 2009 for €420 million. The final €240 million will come from the re-deployment of funds in the (external relations) stability instrument which had not already been earmarked for a particular goal. Review In December 2009 the Commission must provide the European Parliament and the Council with an initial interim report on the measures undertaken. The reports mentioned in this Article shall pay particular attention to the requirements of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the Accra Agenda for Action.

Taxation
Preventing VAT fraud: yes to better data collection and exchange
2008-12-05 - 11:34
As part of a series of measures to help prevent VAT fraud, Parliament is backing a plan to accelerate the collection and exchange of data on intra-Community transactions, by having companies make monthly electronic statements of their data, as opposed to quarterly statements, often on paper, and imposing a one-month, rather than three month, deadline on Member States to share this information. Parliament adopted on two reports from José-Manuel Garcia Margallo (EPP-ED, ES) covering different aspects of the proposals. While supporting the changes, MEPs adopted amendments to clarify some procedural aspects, and ensure Member States publicise and share best practice.
The reports also make clear that the Commission should review the administrative burden of these arrangements after two years.
As usual with taxation policy, Parliament’s role is consultative and if the changes are to be adopted there will need to be unanimity in the Council. Common system of VAT: combating tax evasion connected with intra-Community transactions Common system of VAT: administrative cooperation in combating tax evasion connected with intra-Community transactions (amend. Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003) Text, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 4 December)

Fisheries
Herring stocks off the West of Scotland
2008-12-05 - 11:34
Parliament adopted a report by Struan STEVENSON (EPP-ED, UK) to introduce a multi-annual management plan for West of Scotland herring. The rapporteur recommends that, rather than complete closure of the fishery, a stock recovery plan should be put in place where the biomass falls below 50,000 tonnes. The West of Scotland herring stock is fished mainly by vessels from the UK, Netherlands, Germany and France. The report was adopted with 529 votes in favour, 49 against and 9 abstentions. Key points Recent scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) indicates that the stock of herring in the seas to the West of Scotland is slightly overexploited with respect to maximum sustainable yield. Advice from scientific agencies, supported by advice from stakeholders, indicates that better management would result from setting Total Allowable Catches (TACs) in the framework of a multi-annual plan. The plan will be subject to review at least every four years. In the Commission proposal establishing a multi-annual plan for the stock of herring distributed to the West of Scotland the target fishing mortality rate (measure of catches) is set at 0.25 when the size of the spawning stock is greater than 75,000 tonnes, and 0.2 when it is between 75,000 tonnes and 50,000 tonnes. Should the stock fall below the 50,000 tonne level, the fishery would be closed until it recovers. Year-on-year variations in TAC would be limited to a maximum of 15% as long as the stock is in good condition (i.e. above the 75,000 tonne level). The rapporteur does not agree with the Commission that a sustainable fishery can be maintained by managing annual mortality at 0.25 when the stock size is above 75,000 tonnes and at 0.20 when the stock size falls below 75,000 tonnes, but remains above 50,000 tonnes. "Nor do I accept that the fishery should be closed if spawning stock levels fall below 50,000 tonnes. On the contrary, I accept the argument of the Pelagic RAC that such harvest rules represent a ‘blunt’ instrument which could lead to dramatic and unwarranted reductions in TAC and would thus undermine the viability of the fishery and destabilise the industry without adequate scientific justification", he says. In these circumstances, after taking advice from STECF, the fishery could remain open with a strict recovery plan in place. "The Commission's assessment is uncertain and although the closure of fishing activities will be needed at certain points, it is inappropriate for the fishery to be automatically closed when the spawning stock was estimated to be only slightly below 50,000 tonnes", states the report. In those years when ICES and STECF can provide estimates of spawning stock biomass at less than 75,000 tonnes but equal to or greater than 50,000 tonnes, the TAC for the following year should be set at 0.2. However, to maintain catch stability in the fishery, the TAC should not vary more than plus or minus 20% from the current TAC in any given year, according to the rapporteur. In any year when ICES and STECF are unable to provide estimates of spawning stock size or fishing mortalities, the TAC should remain unchanged from the previous year, adds Struan STEVENSON. However, in the second and in each subsequent year during which no scientific forecast is available the TAC should be reduced by 10% compared to the previous year. Special fishing permits will be required for vessels fishing the stock and these vessels will not be allowed to fish both inside and outside the West of Scotland area on the same fishing trip unless they transmit their catch reports daily to the fisheries authorities in their flag state. Monitoring of licensed fishing vessels with permits to fish in the area will be conducted by utilising electronic log-books with daily transmission of catch reports to the Fisheries Monitoring Centre of the flag Member State, VMS and administrative cross-checks between landing declarations and recorded catches.

Small Business Act will "have a significant positive effect on the environment for SMEs"
2008-12-05 - 11:34
SMEs are crucial to Europe's economy, providing over 100 million jobs. In view of the current financial market crisis, the European Council must confirm that it will formally approve the Small Business Act (SBA) and make its provisions binding, say MEPs in a resolution put forward by the EPP-ED and Socialist groups. The resolution was adopted with 614 votes in favour, 11 against and 9 abstentions. Formerly approving the SBA will "ensure the necessary high visibility", while making its provisions binding will "have a significant positive effect on the environment for SMEs". Concrete measures and screening system needed to ensure SBA is effective Moreover, for the SBA to be effective, Member States need to be fully behind its implementation. This means putting in place concrete measures at both Member State and regional level to "complement measures adopted at EU level". EU members are asked "to announce how and within what timeframe the elements of the Think Small First principle will be incorporated into the national regulatory frameworks". There should also be a screening system in place to monitor the progress and implementation of the SBA, set up by both the Commission and Member States, and progress made in the implementation process should be included in a stand-alone chapter in the annual reports on the Lisbon Strategy national reform programmes, both of which would ensure that the SBA is effective, say MEPs. €30 billion for SME loans is not sufficient The resolution states that the current financial market crisis has made the shortcomings of the present framework for SMEs even more obvious and has heightened the urgency of having their needs better taken into account. As such, MEPs call on the Commission and Member States to ensure that SMEs have access to finance "in this critical moment". The new package of the European Investment Bank envisaging €30 billion for SME loans as agreed by the ECOFIN is welcome but MEPs are of the view that the amount "will not be sufficient to solve the current problems of SME financing".

Governments should adopt position on EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports without delay, say MEPs
2008-12-05 - 11:34
Parliament adopted a resolution on the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports strongly criticising the current political impasse on the non-adoption of the Common Position and urging the French Presidency, and otherwise the forthcoming Presidencies, to resolve the issue by ensuring that the Common Position is adopted without further delay. The adoption of the Common Position will make the Code a legally binding arms export control instrument for all EU Member States. This year marks the tenth anniversary of the EU Code on Arms Exports, yet, despite calls from Parliament, the failure of the Council to adopt the Common Position since 2005 has left "the issue unresolved". Parliament is convinced that the adoption of the Common Position on the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports to third countries is vital for the orderly implementation of the future Directive on intra-Community transfers of defence-related goods and for an efficient control of arms exports. EU to gain in credibility The resolution reiterates that the EU's contribution to an internationally binding Arms Trade Treaty will strongly gain in credibility as soon as its own arms exports regime becomes legally binding. Parallel measures to be taken Parliament also stresses that the following measures should be taken in parallel with the adoption of the Common Position: (a) preventing irresponsible arms transfers by a strict application of the Code's criteria to both companies and national armed forces; (b) preventing illegal arms trafficking by air and sea; improving and applying brokering controls by calling on all Member States that have not yet done so to incorporate the letter and spirit of the 2003 EU Common Position on the control of Arms Brokering into their national legislations; (c) prompt investigation of recent allegations relating to violations of arms embargoes; (d) preventing the selling-off to private brokers of arms collected in the course of ESDP and SSR operations and other EU initiatives, and their subsequent transfer to other regions of violent conflict or tension; (e) improving the transparency and quality of data submitted by EU Member States in the context of the Annual Report on the Code of Conduct.
