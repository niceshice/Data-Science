Christopher COAKLEY BXL (+32) 2 28 44859 STR (+33) 3 881 76853 PORT (+32) 498 98 33 26 EMAIL envi-press@europarl.europa.eu The European Parliament is calling for a binding global deal on climate change to be agreed by 2015. The "ping pong blame game" between the US and China is holding up progress towards this deal and must come to end, said Jo Leinen (S&D, DE), Chair of the EP delegation to the UN climate change summit in Durban (South Africa) on Wednesday.
“We urgently need countries to sign up to a ‘roadmap’ that will lead to agreement on a binding global deal by 2015. The recurring ping-pong blame game between the US and China is no longer acceptable and must come to an end.
“The European Parliament strongly supports a Kyoto Protocol second commitment period, as long as environmental integrity is respected.
“EU climate legislation set our targets for 2020 and we are ready to commit to more ambitious goals for the future to achieve a low carbon economy by 2050. The financial crisis should not be an excuse to give up climate protection, but an opportunity to invest in green technologies.”
On financing of climate aid, Mr Leinen added:
“We must not leave Durban without agreement on the promised Green Climate Fund and we cannot accept that it remains an empty box. Success in Durban depends on securing funds to help poorer countries take the necessary adaption and mitigation measures. Let’s not forget that this is an African summit and Africa stands to suffer most from climate change.”
“Shipping and aviation must now play their part. It’s positive that a UN draft at last mentions a maritime levy and it is crucial that this remains in the text at the end of this week. The EU also expects all countries and airlines to respect our legislation on including aviation in emissions trading. “
