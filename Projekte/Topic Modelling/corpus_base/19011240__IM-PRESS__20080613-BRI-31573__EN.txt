Statement by the President of the European Parliament on the Irish referendum
Speaking at the opening of the Strasbourg plenary, EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering said: "The referendum result of 13 June 2008 in Ireland confronts the EU with one of the most difficult challenges in its history. The Lisbon Reform Treaty, derived from the Constitutional Treaty, which itself was drafted by a Convention meeting in public and comprising members of national parliaments and the European Parliament, allows the EU more democracy, greater ability to act and greater transparency.
Pöttering on the Middle East: We must support the Annapolis objectives and reach a two-state solution
EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering made a declaration in the name of the Conference of Presidents. "On the ground, six months after the Annapolis conference, concrete measures need to be taken in on order to meet the objective of a two-State solution by the end of the year.
European Parliament approves Jacques Barrot as Justice Commissioner and Antonio Tajani as Transport Commissioner
MEPs voted in favour of the change of portfolio for Commission Vice-President Jacques Barrot , who is taking over responsibility for freedom, security and justice, by 489 votes in favour, 52 against and 19 abstentions. The House also voted in favour of the appointment of Antonio Tajani as the new Italian Commissioner to be responsible for transport, with 507 votes in favour, 53 against and 64 abstentions. Mr Tajani is now also a Vice-President of the Commission.
MEPs debate the forthcoming European Council after the No vote in Ireland
MEPs held a debate in Strasbourg ahead of the Brussels European Council of 19 and 20 June. All groups in the House accepted and respected the outcome of the vote in Ireland. Many groups underlined the need to continue the ratification processes and to respect those Member States that had already ratified the Lisbon Treaty. Some of the smaller groups, however, called for an immediate end to the ratification process.
Energy: European Parliament adopts full ownership unbundling for electricity
In a hotly contested vote, the European Parliament adopted provisions in support of full "ownership unbundling" - the separation of firms' generation assets from their transmission networks - in the electricity market. In doing so, (and in endorsing a stronger role for the Energy Regulators Agency) it went even further than the original Commission proposal and challenged an agreement reached recently by the Council.
MEPs give green light for new EU waste legislation with binding 2020 targets
The EU will have new waste legislation which includes targets for re-use and recycling of waste to be attained by 2020 after MEPs adopted amendments. The directive sets out rules on recycling and requires Member States to draw up binding national programmes for waste prevention. Waste prevention targets will be considered by the Commission in the future. Incineration of waste will be categorised as a recovery operation rather than disposal, provided it meets a certain energy efficiency standard.
Water pollutants to be more strictly controlled as MEPs adopt legislation
Use of 33 pollutants - mainly pesticides and heavy metals - likely to be found in rivers, lakes and coastal waters must be reduced or ended, depending on the level of risk involved. By 2018 Member States will have to reduce pollution from "priority substances", and ceasing or phasing out emissions, discharges and losses of "priority hazardous substances". This forms part of a second-reading agreement with Council and adopted by the EP with 673 in favour and 10 against and 5 abstentions.
MEPs adopt legislation on higher safety standards for road infrastructure
MEPs adopted a legislative report on a directive to upgrade road safety management standards. The aim is to establish EU-wide standards on road infrastructure management. Safety standards for roads, in particular in road design maintenance, differ greatly between the Member States. The Directive requires the establishment and implementation of rules relating to road safety impact assessments, road safety audits, the management of road network safety and safety inspections by the Member States.
Better protection for pedestrians and cyclists to be introduced more quickly
Plans to reduce the number of pedestrians and cyclists injured on Europe's roads by introducing tougher standards on the safety of motor vehicles were adopted by MEPs in a first-reading report by Francesco FERRARI (ALDE, IT. Each year 8,000 pedestrians and cyclists are killed and 300,000 injured across the EU. MEPs endorsed a compromise already reached between Parliament and Council negotiators.
Intelligent car technology take-up too slow, says European Parliament
Take-up of intelligent car technologies remains very low, given their potential, says Parliament in an own-initiative report adopted by MEPs. These technologies need to get cheaper, but also to be better publicised, it stresses, noting that if fully deployed, with the necessary infrastructure, EU-wide emergency call technology could save up to 2,500 lives a year on EU roads, and electronic stability control up to 4,000. Rapporteur Zita GURMAIi (PES, HU), who saw her report adopted without amendments, noted that Intelligent Vehicle Systems could substantially reduce the annual death toll on European roads - currently 41,600 as well as alleviating or remedying congestion, environmental and public health problems. The report was adopted with 417 votes in favour 6 against and 5 abstentions.
Inland transport of dangerous goods
Parliament adopted a legislative report on the inland transport of dangerous goods. The proposed Directive aims to simplify and update the existing dangerous goods rules and at the same time extend the scope of the current rules by including inland waterways. The proposal also endorses a user-friendly single set of rules for the inland transport of dangerous goods in the European Union.
High oil prices: structural causes, speculation and taxes debated by MEPs
Are rising oil prices mainly the result of long term economic changes at global level, or is speculation more of a factor? Should taxes on energy be cut across the board to help consumers and businesses, or should support be targeted on those hardest hit? These were some of the issues raised in a debate with Council and Commission on the impact of the high oil and energy prices. Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs told MEPs he started each day by checking oil prices, and lately the direction was always up. The dollar price had tripled in three years. "Our dependency on imported oil is high and costs are increasing steadily. There is a direct negative impact on citizens and businesses."
Asma Jahangir, UN special rapporteur, on European Year of Intercultural Dialogue
The United Nations Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, Asma Jahangir , addressed a formal sitting of the House on Wednesday as part of Year of Intercultural Dialogue. She urged that "intercultural dialogue" be understood in a wide sense, bringing together a range of religious and non-religious perspectives; it should include dialogue at grassroots level rather than being conducted purely by leaders; and she strongly opposed the idea of outlawing "defamation of religions".
Parliament backs Slovakia’s euro area membership
MEPs have approved Slovakia's bid to adopt the euro on 1 January 2009. At the same time, they stressed that Slovakia should make further efforts to keep its rate of inflation down and continue structural reforms to its economy. In a report drawn up by David Casa (EPP-ED, MT), Parliament agrees with the Commission that Slovakia has met the criteria to join the euro.
Parliament adopts directive on return of illegal immigrants
The compromise reached between Parliament negotiators and the Council on the directive on the return of illegal immigrants was approved at first reading by the full Parliament on Wednesday (18 June). This legislation, which is a step towards a European immigration policy, will encourage the voluntary return of illegal immigrants but otherwise lay down minimum standards for their treatment. The debate took place on Tuesday (17 June) and a summary is given in this publication.
Sheep and goat farming: a valuable sector in need of a helping hand say MEPs
MEPs adopted a report for urgent EU action to support sheep and goat farming, including producer income support and marketing measures. In addition, the Commission's plans for compulsory electronic tagging of every animal should be rethought, says the House. The report EP by rapporteur Liam AYLWARD (UEN, IE), was adopted with 492 votes in favour, 30 against and 9 abstentions.
Clearer rules on European Ombudsman's access to information
Proposed changes in the rules governing the European Ombudsman's access to information held by EU bodies and evidence given to him by EU civil servants, are set out in a report, adopted by the European Parliament, on the Ombudsman's Statute. The key aim of these changes is to boost citizens' confidence in the Ombudsman's work. The debate took place on 21 April 2008.
Fish and timber in West Africa need more sustainable EU policies say MEPs
Fish and timber are natural resources often not managed in a sustainable way in West Africa due to inadequate EU policies, says a report adopted by the European Parliament. The own initiative report adopted with 559 votes in favour 11 against and 17 abstentions is part of a periodic review of EU policies.
Parliament opposes sale of chlorinated chicken in EU
MEPs are calling on the Council to reject the Commission's proposal to authorise four antimicrobial treatments for poultry carcasses for human consumption. Imports of such poultry meat might undermine European standards, says the House. A resolution adopted by 526 votes in favour to 27 against with 11 abstentions stresses that authorisation of these four antimicrobial treatments for poultry carcasses would pose "a serious threat to Community rules and standards". This would constitute a setback for the efforts and adjustments made by poultry professionals with a view to reducing the incidence of bacterial infection in the EU.
More EU action needed to prevent and react to natural disasters say MEPs
In view of the increasingly acute problems with forest fires and droughts in the European Union, the European Parliament in a resolution stresses the need to increase the EU's capacity to prevent and to respond to those natural disasters. MEPs urge the Commission to ameliorate the existing instruments and adopt new ones if necessary. The resolution was adopted with 523 votes in favour and 37 votes against.
Human rights and Russian actions in Georgia worry MEPs otherwise supportive of Partnership and Cooperation Agreement
The deteriorating human rights conditions in Russia and Moscow's actions in Abkhazia and South Ossetia were the top worries of MEPs discussing the upcoming EU-Russia summit. A resolution, adopted with 488 votes in favour, 34 against and 30 abstentions, stresses these concerns, while expressing the House's satisfaction that the negotiations on a new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) can now begin.
Human rights: Burma, Somalia, Iran
In its three human rights resolutions adopted on Thursday (19 June) in Strasbourg, the European Parliament criticises the Burmese government's treatment of its own people, voices concern at the high civilian death toll in Somalia's civil war and condemns the executions of juveniles in Iran. 20080613BRI31573 Texts adopted 17-19 June 2008

Statement by the President of the European Parliament on the Irish referendum
2008-06-23 - 11:05
Speaking at the opening of the Strasbourg plenary, EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering said: "The referendum result of 13 June 2008 in Ireland confronts the EU with one of the most difficult challenges in its history. The Lisbon Reform Treaty, derived from the Constitutional Treaty, which itself was drafted by a Convention meeting in public and comprising members of national parliaments and the European Parliament, allows the EU more democracy, greater ability to act and greater transparency. It strengthens the European Parliament, gives national parliaments more responsibility in determining the course of European policy, allows citizens of the European Union a power of initiative in relation to the European Institutions, and guarantees local self-government. The Lisbon Treaty is the answer to criticisms which citizens have levelled at the deficits of the European Union. This Treaty brings the European Union closer to its citizens. We must make it abundantly clear that the adoption of the Reform Treaty is an absolute necessity, to enable the European Union to defend its values and interests in the 21st century. Without the reforms which are made possible by the Lisbon Treaty, the accession of further countries to the European Union is hardly conceivable. We call upon the EU Summit on Thursday and Friday in Brussels to take all appropriate steps to make the Reform Treaty a reality. The ratification process must continue without reservation. We call upon the Irish Government, for its part, to submit proposals as to how we can jointly progress beyond this difficult phase in European politics. The European Parliament will devote all its energies and display maximum commitment to overcoming these challenges. We expect the same of the European Commission and of the governments of all European Union Member States. We equally expect the European Parliament to be comprehensively involved in the work concerned. It remains our goal to see the Lisbon Treaty enter into force before the elections of June 2009 to the European Parliament. Provided that you agree to this, I shall resolutely defend these principles to the European Council on 19 and 20 June in Brussels."

Pöttering on the Middle East: We must support the Annapolis objectives and reach a two-state solution
2008-06-23 - 11:05
The President of the European Parliament Hans-Gert Pöttering made a declaration in the name of the Conference of Presidents. "On the ground, six months after the Annapolis conference, concrete measures need to be taken in on order to meet the objective of a two-State solution by the end of the year.
Despite some encouraging progress, there is little reason for optimism in realising the ambitious goals of Annapolis, this is the conclusion of a delegation of 14 MEPs of the EP working group on the Middle East who were in Israel and Palestine from 30 May to 2 June 2008 led by Véronique de Keyser (PES, BE).
With the objective of reaching a two-state solution by the end of this year, the essential elements of an agreement consist of boosting security forces by the Palestinians themselves, solving the question of the expanding colonies in particular for Jerusalem and creating the conditions to allow economic development and increased freedom of movement in the West Bank, and finally tackling the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip given its isolation and international sanctions.
The report adopted unanimously by the delegation last week and presented to the Council and Commission and the Conference of Presidents is worrying. Some encouraging progress has taken place, but unfortunately in very limited sectors. The general evolution does not give hope to be optimistic as to the goals set out at Annapolis.
The credibility of the Palestinian Authority must be strengthened and the conditions needed for sustainable economic development must be put in place in an efficient way. It is necessary to fight the policies of constant divisions and the separation of territory which Israel is applying. In agreement with the US government and as its intermediary Condoleezza Rice explained there must be an end to the expansion of the colonies in East Jerusalem.
Israelis and Palestinians have engaged in good faith and in the spirit of reconciliation and negotiation. This engagement must be taken seriously. It is up to us Europeans to support our partners in this process. The European Parliament will carry out its role with determination.
EU relations with Israel and the Palestinian Authority must be developed in such a way as to encourage the peace process. The Barcelona Process and the Union for the Mediterranean could be a further element in the promotion of peace. The European Parliament expects to be fully consulted in developments in this field.
As we sit here, the fishermen of the Gaza Strip have left their boats in the water. On the basis of the blockage, the fishermen are protesting for their rights to fish their waters so they can live. Our delegation promised to support the fishermen. In the name of the European Parliament, I would therefore offer my support to the fishermen. "

European Parliament approves Jacques Barrot as Justice Commissioner and Antonio Tajani as Transport Commissioner
2008-06-23 - 11:05
MEPs voted in favour of the change of portfolio for Commission Vice-President Jacques Barrot, who is taking over responsibility for freedom, security and justice, by 489 votes in favour, 52 against and 19 abstentions. The House also voted in favour of the appointment of Antonio Tajani as the new Italian Commissioner to be responsible for transport, with 507 votes in favour, 53 against and 64 abstentions. Mr Tajani is now also a Vice-President of the Commission. These changes follow the resignation of Franco Frattini, the previous Italian member of the Commission, who is now Foreign Minister in the Italian government. Commission President José Manuel Barroso asked Jacques Barrot of France, who has been Vice-President of the Commission since 2004, to take over Mr Frattini's role as Commissioner for Freedom Security and Justice, while Mr Barrot's former responsibility for transport passes to Mr Tajani.
Before today's vote, the two Commissioners faced hearings before the relevant Parliamentary committees on Monday evening. See the links below for more details.

European Council
MEPs debate the forthcoming European Council after the No vote in Ireland
2008-06-23 - 11:05
MEPs held a debate in Strasbourg ahead of the Brussels European Council of 19 and 20 June. All groups in the House accepted and respected the outcome of the vote in Ireland. Many groups underlined the need to continue the ratification processes and to respect those Member States that had already ratified the Lisbon Treaty. Some of the smaller groups, however, called for an immediate end to the ratification process. For the Council Presidency, Slovenian European Affairs Minister Janez Lenarčič said the first topic on the agenda for the European Council would be the result of the Irish referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. He said the Slovenian presidency was "disappointed" at the result of the referendum but that it "respects" the will of the Irish electorate. However, Slovenia had spoken to several heads of state or government, who were determined to proceed with ratification in their countries. Overall, he believed a solution could be found but the European Council would first listen to the views of the Irish prime minister.
Turning to other issues to be discussed at the summit, Mr Lenarčič highlighted soaring food and oil prices and listed short and medium term steps that could be taken to mitigate the problems. These ranged from agricultural policy measures to sustainable development of biofuels. Other topics on the agenda would be the Western Balkans, implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, the climate change and energy packages and the European Neighbourhood Policy. The minister concluded by congratulating Slovakia, which will join the euro on 1 January 2009.
European Commission President José Manuel Barroso also acknowledged that while the European Council would be discussing many issues, "foremost on everybody's minds will be the No vote in Ireland". He too saw the vote as "a disappointment" to all those in favour of a stronger, more efficient and accountable European Union and stressed that "the No vote did not solve the problems which the Treaty seeks to tackle".
Thus, while fully respecting the outcome of the Irish referendum he was keen to emphasise that "We must show the same respect for all national ratifications". He pointed out that "there have been nineteen democratic decisions in the process so far: eighteen in favour of the Treaty of Lisbon; one against. Eight other Member States still have to take position".
Mr Barroso then made an impassioned plea. He said "there is no way around the fact that governments have a particular responsibility" and "years of treating the European Institutions as a convenient scapegoat leaves fertile ground for populist campaigns. In the end, it only serves to make life easy for the euro-sceptics. As I said before, you cannot bash Brussels from Monday to Saturday and expect citizens to vote in favour of Europe on Sunday".
Of all the other topics on the summit agenda, Mr Barroso singled out food and fuel price rises and described the measures the Commission favoured to alleviate them. However, he saw short term measures as only part of the answer. More broadly, "the pressures being faced by Europeans today show why the EU's goals on energy security, energy efficiency and climate change are so crucial". Ultimately, "the structural response to the structural challenges we face is to save and diversify". Against this background, "adoption of our climate change and energy security package is therefore a matter or urgency".
In conclusion, the Commission president said the task of the European Council this week will be "to show that setbacks like the no vote do not mean paralysis for Europe", since "the case for an effective European union is stronger than ever."
Political group speakers
Joseph DAUL (EPP-ED, FR) said that his group respected the decision of the Irish people just as much as the 18 Member States that had ratified the Treaty of Lisbon. He recalled that the EU is founded on freedom of expression and democracy and that as a result no Member State could prevent another from expressing itself. It is now for the European Council to analyse the message of the Irish people who are concerned about the EU's trade, agriculture and tax policy.
The aim of the EU to guarantee peace on the continent of Europe is no longer held by the young generation. The European Parliament, which often adopted complicated texts, must take its responsibility. Mr Daul called on the European Council to take on board the concerns of citizens on food and oil prices.
"The Lisbon Treaty enables progress and allows the EU to function better with its voice heard louder int he world", he recalled. He concluded by saying that the period of introspection should end quickly. "We must stop the naval-gazing".
"The EU has spent eight years ratifying various treaties" noted Martin SCHULZ (PSE, DE) and yet is now unable even to put its own house in order, even though this is what it asks of would-be new members. "Who is turning the institutions into scapegoats?" he continued, suggesting that Council ministers might be less free to blame disasters on "Brussels" if their debates were not held behind closed doors.
Crisis of confidence
That Ireland's "no" vote defied calls from all Irish political parties to vote "yes" points to a crisis of confidence in national and supranational institutions - and "the integration process is on the line," he affirmed.
Internal Market Commissioner Charlie McCreevy's visit to Ireland, during which he admitted not having read the Lisbon Treaty and implied that this was not really necessary, had done little to help, noted Mr Schulz.
The internal market portfolio should be taken away from Mr McCreevy, who had engaged in a "one-sided" drive for "deregulation at any cost without social flanking measures," added Mr Schulz.
No soul
"We must find a way out of the impasse and get the Irish back on board", said Mr Schulz, affirming that where once it had been the pro-European movement that had "soul", now it was the anti-Europeans. "Where's the passion gone?" he asked.
"People speak ill of Europe because they have ängst," he continued, but "Europe is a great tribute to peace in the world - fight for tolerance, and "don't be drowned out by that lot", he urged.
On his way to Brussels on Thursday, the Irish Prime Minister could well be asking himself "Where did it all go wrong?" said Graham WATSON (ALDE, UK), noting that the Irish "no" had come on the threshold of a French Presidency, leaving the EU with the Nice Treaty. "We have come from Nice to Nice" he said.
Mr Watson claimed that a "majority in every Member State backs the EU," but agreed that trust in institutions is ebbing away.
"The EU cannot be made 'with or without you' - you cannot dissolve the people", he continued, stressing that "in a landscape littered with lies, people are not persuaded - we have done little to convince them." Every national government needs to plan for dialogue, and it is the job of political parties in every Member State to remedy this, he added, despite the fact that "wealth these days is amassed les honestly, and shared less fairly, than it used to be."
MEPs' mailbags are filled with cross-border complications, e.g. to with property rights or data protection, so "we know Lisbon is needed, even though this is not obvious to the citizen", said Mr Watson, who urged the EU to "get on with business", if necessary using the Nice Treaty to tackle real problems.
He also suggested launching a Guinness-style compaign publicising why "Europe is good for you." Europe means "too much, to too many, to be stopped in its tracks" he concluded.
"We have always said the EU needs a short constitution and charter of rights, on a sound economic footing," said Monica FRASSONI (Greens/EFA, IT), adding that whilst "Ireland's verdict must be respected, it is not more democratic than ratification."
The treaty text, she said, is "unintelligible, hedged round with a forest of protocols and opt-outs" and some countries "will not swallow this", she continued, stressing that "governments of opaqueness have lost out".
What is required is an agreement on a "positive text that flows from convinced countries and democratic forces and is big enough to take the process forward" she concluded.
Brian CROWLEY (UEN, IE) said the no vote represented a "sea change with regards to the opinion of one set of voters in the European Union" towards the treaty and because of the diversity of the people who opposed the treaty, more time is needed to analyse the reasons why.
He also said that "this is a time of respect, not just respect for the Irish voters who gave the democratic opinion with regard to this treaty, but respect for the other countries and their individual rights about how they operate and how they ratify a treaty". "Allow us to move forward. The European project is one worth saving. It is not just about peace or prosperity, it is about solidarity."
Francis WURTZ (GUE/NGL, FR) said: "The European Council would be well advised too avoid any arrogance expressed against the Irish people" and that the way the Lisbon Treaty which was presented in an "incomprehensible way" is an example of the "ivory tower syndrome that we see in the European Union that's creating so much concern amongst our citizens". For Mr Wurtz, the No vote was about the "role that Europe plays around the world" and said "we hope that we are going to have a fairer politics in Europe now".
Nigel FARAGE (IND/DEM, UK) said "well done the Irish" and that "it is perfectly clear that the ratifications should stop now and the implementation of the treaty should stop now". He also said the decision to continue with the ratification of the treaty is "EU nationalism and it is the most dangerous political phenomenon to have swept Europe since 1945" and said to the house that "you are destroying the EU in the eyes of the voters".
Ashley MOTE (NI, UK) said: "Lisbon required unanimity, you ignore that and you ignore the rule of law itself. The Irish are not just 10% of the EU, they are 100% of those that are allowed to vote and we all know that others would have voted no given the chance". He also said "suggesting that the process should go on is an arrogance of breathtaking proportions".
Barroso response to the debate
José-Manuel Barroso welcomed the consensus in the European Parliament to continue the process of ratification which would allow "dialogue with the Irish in an atmosphere of solidarity". According to him, the only way to construct legitimacy is to present concrete results for citizens. Finally, in reaction to statements by Mr Schulz about Commissioner McCreevy, he concluded "do not look for easy scapegoats." Attacking the Irish Commissioner is not the best way to have a constructive dialogue. We will only solve the problem when we concentrate on citizens' expectations."
British and Irish speakers
Philip BUSHILL-MATTHEWS (EPP-ED, UK) said that "our problem must not be to discuss the speed at which the EU should now move; it should be to discuss its direction. Listen to the people and they will tell you." If the ratification process continues, he said, it will show that EU leaders have learnt nothing and that politicians still believe they know best and that it is the people who are wrong.
Rather than ignoring the Irish vote, he said, we should build upon it. "The ratification process should stop. The listening to the people should begin."
Marian HARKIN (ALDE, IE) said that a core issue in the Lisbon debate in Ireland was the principle of unanimity. For Lisbon to be ratified, she said, we need unanimity. All 27 Member States must agree – that is core. This is the first real test of unanimity under Lisbon. "As politicians, our job is to rise to that challenge, to listen to our citizens, to find solutions and to get on with the business of building a better Europe. Some on the ‘no’ side in Ireland spoke of a better deal. Let us be optimistic and look for a better deal for all citizens. We need some time and space in Ireland to reflect and respond to find solutions. The good will for Europe is there in Ireland."
Bairbre DE BRÚN (GUE/NGL, UK) (speaking in Irish) said that the bulk of the Irish people had not voted against Europe. Ireland had made a lot of progress in the EU but the question the Irish people were asking was: "Did we have the best deal through the Lisbon Treaty?". The Lisbon Treaty is over after the No vote and ratification must be stopped. Continuing (In English) she said "we need to listen very carefully and calmly to what the Irish people have said." The key issues are: the democratic deficit, neutrality and EU militarisation, workers' rights and the impact of the Lisbon Treaty on the developing world. In conclusion, she said "democracy must prevail, we must listen carefully."
Kathy SINNOTT (IND/DEM, IE) said that "if the response to the democratic will of the people that I have heard in the last five days is outrage, then there is something wrong. Make no mistake: Ireland is pro European. We believe, as obviously you do not, that the project has lost its way. It has lost sight of the one thing it needs most – democracy – and forgotten the only people that matter – its citizens. So, before you try to bypass our democratic decision, ask yourself two questions. One: do you truly believe that this Treaty would survive referendums in the other 26 countries? And two: is threatening a country for being democratic an action of democracy?"
Andrew DUFF (ALDE, UK) thought it bizarre that "Mr Farage and his right-wing troops here prefer to let a referendum in a foreign country take a decision on behalf of, and in place of, the British sovereign Parliament. It confirms my opinion that the plebiscite is a form of democracy, possibly suited for revolutionary circumstances, but completely unsuited for informed and deliberative decisions on complex treaty revision." That is why, Mr Duff concluded, that this Parliament must assist the Council to deliver the content of the Lisbon Treaty
"The Lisbon Treaty is dead" stated HUDGHTON (Greens/EFA, UK). "Without unanimity that is simply a legal fact. Voters, not just in Ireland but in France and the Netherlands too, have said ‘no’ to the Treaty text or its twin brother. To regain the confidence of our peoples, we must do more than just re-badge and rename the Lisbon text and try to push ahead. The new Treaty was too easy to ridicule and too complex and obscure to explain, making it difficult for ‘yes’ campaigners in any country in a referendum.
It is, he said, up to the other eight Member States to decide whether and how to continue with ratification, but Mr Hudghton thought it would be very helpful if, for example, the UK were to decide to do so by referendum and "let us see whether we have the confidence of the people to continue with this process."
While Avril DOYLE (EPP-ED, IE) was deeply disappointed with the result, we must, she said, accept and respect it as the democratic will of the people. A measured response to the genuine concerns of the Irish electorate is called for, she said, but we must not appease the extremists. The Irish Government, she said, must analyse the outcome calmly, to establish exactly what happened and provide answers. She hoped that colleagues would agree with her that a "two-speed Europe is not the answer but the beginning of the end of our Union, the most successful democratic peace project of our time." It has, she said, always been easier to peddle fear than hope.
Richard CORBETT (PES, UK) said that as well as reflecting on the Irish result, we must also listen to the other 26 countries, their results and also concerns that may be expressed during their ratification. And then we must rise to the enormous challenge of bridging the gap. "If we do obtain 26 ratifications and one rejection, it is neither unreasonable nor undemocratic to ask the one whether they could consider the possibility of adjusting the reform package, reviewing it, explaining it better, perhaps seeking a new compromise rather than block all reform. There is nothing unreasonable or undemocratic about that. After all, even some of the ‘no’ campaigners in Ireland professed they claimed their intention was to renegotiate and seek a better agreement."
"Some people – and we have heard that from some parts of this House – only want to listen to one side, to the answer that they like, which is the answer ‘no’. I want to listen to both sides and then find a solution acceptable to all 27 countries. That is the challenge we must all rise to", he concluded.
For Proinsias DE ROSSA (PES, IE) "Lisbon is not dead." Nevertheless, he continued, the choice made in Ireland is a sovereign decision of the Irish people. The only people who can vary that decision on that Treaty are the Irish people. Proposing a new deadline for ratification of Lisbon, Mr De Rossa thought that setting it before the European elections is a reasonable target. "If the Irish people continue to be dissatisfied with Lisbon in whatever form it is finally agreed between us and the rest of Europe, then Ireland will have no option but to renegotiate its relationship with the Union. That would be a disastrous course for our country. Europe has very little to lose if it loses Ireland, but Ireland has everything to lose if it loses Europe.
Citing global challenges - climate change, demographic change, migration and energy crisis, hunger and poverty killing millions, human insecurity, international crime, topped by an identity crisis in virtually every one of our Member States - these cannot be solved by any Member State pulling the shutters down and hoping they will go away.
Concluding, Mr De Rossa urged that Europe demonstrate tangible capacity to deliver decent living and working conditions. That, he said, will reinforce our unity and our solidarity and produce a positive solution to this crisis.
Gary TITLEY (PES, UK) said that clearly the Lisbon Treaty cannot come into force on 1 January as was hoped. "We have to wait for the Irish Government to tell us how they think we should proceed. But meanwhile other states should exercise their sovereign right to ratify this Treaty. My own Member State will finish its ratification today in accordance with its long-standing and widely respected parliamentary tradition."
Taking into consideration globalisation and the insecurity it generates, the EU, he said, is a political process designed to deal with those issues, looking at the Millennium Development Goals, at climate change, at migration. What action is needed to improve the lot of our citizens?
Concluding, Mr Titley questioned the the Slovenian presidency: "could you tell me what are the implications of the Irish vote for Croatia’s accession to the European Union?"
Mairead McGUINNESS (EPP-ED, IE) worried that those who voted ‘no’ felt there were no risks in doing so, they felt, perhaps, the status quo would prevail. Now, she said, it is very clear from this debate that other countries believe that their process of ratification through parliament is equally valid and that that will proceed.
There is, she said, urgency for the Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Brian Cowen, to come forward in the next few days with certainly a reflection, and perhaps proposals, on the way forward.
Addressing Kathy Sinnott, concerning the worry about loss of values in Ireland, Ms McGuinness said "we cannot blame Europe for the loss of values in Ireland. We have done that ourselves, and let us stop throwing the buck at the European Union and maybe look at our own values of materialism in Ireland and elsewhere."
Jim ALLISTER (NI, UK) ( in writing ) said that the Treaty is dead. Lisbon had set its own test for survival - unanimous ratification and it failed that test. The challenge now is whether some 'elite' have the honesty and integrity to admit that the Treaty is dead with no prospect of resurrection.

Energy: European Parliament adopts full ownership unbundling for electricity
2008-06-23 - 11:05
In a hotly contested vote, the European Parliament adopted provisions in support of full "ownership unbundling" - the separation of firms' generation assets from their transmission networks - in the electricity market. In doing so, (and in endorsing a stronger role for the Energy Regulators Agency) it went even further than the original Commission proposal and challenged an agreement reached recently by the Council. On 6 June, Member States reached a compromise modelled after a so-called "third way" proposal, endorsing two alternatives to ownership unbundling: the "independent system operator" (ISO) and "independent transmission operator" (ITO) models. Both of these would have allowed European energy companies to retain their network assets, provided they met strict conditions to ensure separation of interests between supply and transmission. The Parliament, in turn - following the lead of its Industry Committee - rejected both derogations, backing full ownership unbundling as the only option for electricity companies.
"I'm disappointed with the agreement reached by the Council", explained Eluned Morgan (PES, UK) during a debate held prior to the vote. "You've bent too much to the will of the minority", added the rapporteur on electricity. This minority, she said - Austria, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, Latvia and the Slovak Republic, all of whom backed the "third way" proposal - "protect national champions who want to invest in other markets, but refuse entry into their own". "I am also disappointed with the Commission for not defending its own position" [in favour of unbundling], she then said. "You've backtracked. We haven't."
MEPs also preserved the Commission's proposal to prevent control of transmission systems or transmission system operators "by a person or persons from third countries."
Making a difference at the consumer end
MEPs also bolstered the draft legislation with a number of consumer protection measures. Customers, they decided, should have:
the right to withdraw from contracts with their electricity providers without charge
the right to compensation if service quality levels are not met (as with, for example, inaccurate and delayed billing)
access to information on their rights through bills and electricity company web sites
access to information on procedures to be followed in case of disputes
the right to change supplier within two weeks
the right to be informed, at least quarterly, of actual electricity consumption and costs
access to smart meters within 10 years of the directive's entry into force
the right to have their electricity provided by a supplier regardless of the Member State in which the supplier is registered
the right to protection against market abuse: to that end, national authorities must be able to impose "price caps in uncompetitive markets for a defined and limited period"
independent complaints services and alternative redress schemes such as an independent energy ombudsman or a consumer body
Aside from these provisions, the Committee also saw to it to address the needs of vulnerable energy consumers. It decided, therefore, that EU countries should take "appropriate measures [...] to ensure that the number of people in energy poverty" – those unable to afford heating the home to an acceptable standard, as defined by the WHO – "decreases in real terms." MEPs also insisted that countries work towards cutting the cost of energy to low income households - and that Member States protect pensioners and disabled people from disconnection in winter. In the same vein, they backed an amendment mandating national authorities "to introduce pricing formulas which increase for greater levels of consumption."
The climate dimension...
Bearing in mind the inextricable link between energy consumption and climate change, members also authorised national authorities to require system operators "to give priority to generating installations using renewable energy sources or waste or producing combined heat and power" -- except when the safety and reliability of the grid is compromised. Member States "may require", MEPs also added, "that electricity revenues from domestic consumers be spent to fund energy efficiency".
... And the regional dimension
National authorities should work together to integrate their national markets "at least at one or more regional levels", the Committee also decided "as a first and intermediate step towards a fully liberalised common European market". "A concerted effort should also be made towards integrating the EU's "electricity islands."
More powers for the Energy Regulators Agency
In two separate reports - authored by Giles Chichester (EPP-ED, UK) and Alejo Vidal-Quadras (EPP–ED, ES) - MEPs endorsed a strong decision-making role for the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators. (Here too, they went against the grain of the Council compromise, which would have granted the Agency advisory powers only)
The Commission, in its original proposals, had created two new bodies, the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSOE) and gas (ENTSOG), endowing each with the power to adopt:
network codes on : - security rules, including interoperability rules and procedures for emergency situations; grid connection and access rules; cross-border capacity allocation and congestion management rules; network-related transparency rules
energy efficiency rules including a 10-year investment plan; an annual work programme research plans.
The Agency, under such a model, would only have played an advisory role vis-à-vis the ENTSOs. The EP vote, however, flips the scheme around: the political groups agreed that it ought to be (a) the ENTSOs who - on the basis of Agency guidelines - propose the rules, plans and codes cited above, and (b) the Agency which adopts them. Moreover, MEPs decided, the Agency should be competent to monitor the ENTSOs' implementation of the network codes. It should also have a considerable say in defining "issues of prime importance" for the development of the internal market in electricity and gas.
With new competences come new responsibilities. The Agency, MEPs decided, should therefore be made more accountable: its director should be subject to a vote of approval by the European Parliament and should thereupon regularly report back to the EP on the performance of his or her duties.
The seat of the Agency, MEPs decided, should be in Brussels.

Towards a European Charter on the Rights of Energy Consumers
2008-06-23 - 11:05
MEPs adopted a report titled "Towards a European Charter on the Rights of Energy Consumers" which underlines the potential added value of the Charter as an information tool collecting and consolidating the energy rights of consumers as already adopted in the existing EU legislation. MEPs call on Member States to invest as a priority in energy efficiency measures for low-income households, thereby addressing, in a strategic manner, both the problem of fuel poverty and the "20% by 2020" energy
efficiency target adopted at the 2007 Spring European Council.
The report stresses that European electricity and gas consumers have the right to be connected to the networks and to be supplied with electricity and gas, at reasonable, transparent, non- discriminatory and clearly comparable tariffs and prices, including adjusted prices and tariffs resulting from their respective indexation mechanisms; non-discrimination should include a prohibition on discriminatory charges on certain methods of payment, in particular for those, often vulnerable, consumers charged by means of a prepayment meter.
Single entry point
The European Parliament calls on Member States to put in place a physical single entry point for any consumer information request, for example through national energy regulators, thus facilitating consumer access to information and at the same time ensuring that information is available as close to consumers as possible in terms of place, time, tools and thoroughness.
Renewable energy
The report considers that priority should be given to renewable energy sources, combined heat and power and other embedded generation, and that the right of consumers to make an informed choice in favour of renewable energies should be recognised in the Charter. The House considers therefore that all consumers should be informed in an objective, transparent and non-discriminatory way about the sources of energy available to them.
Parliament calls on Member States to invest as a priority in comprehensive energy efficiency measures for low-income households, thereby addressing in a strategic manner both the problem of fuel poverty and the "20% by 2020" energy efficiency target adopted at the 2007 Spring European Council.
Smart meters
MEPs consider that Member States should be required to ensure that the roll-out of smart meters is completed with minimum disruption to consumers within 10 years after the entry into force of the Directives for the internal market in electricity and gas, and it should be the responsibility of energy distribution or supply companies.
NRAs should be made responsible for monitoring the process of such development and for laying down common standards for that purpose. Member States, say MEPs, should be required to ensure that standards establishing the minimum technical design and operational requirements for meters address interoperability issues to provide maximum benefit at minimum cost to consumers.
Finally, the report asks the Commission to carry out an in-depth study on the current use of smart meters in private households and, if necessary to carefully examine the possibility of developing and, after consulting Parliament, financing with a view to promoting best practices. The report underlines the importance of promoting and supporting industry in its efforts in this regard.

MEPs give green light for new EU waste legislation with binding 2020 targets
2008-06-23 - 11:05
The EU will have new waste legislation which includes targets for re-use and recycling of waste to be attained by 2020 after MEPs adopted amendments. The directive sets out rules on recycling and requires Member States to draw up binding national programmes for waste prevention. Waste prevention targets will be considered by the Commission in the future. Incineration of waste will be categorised as a recovery operation rather than disposal, provided it meets a certain energy efficiency standard. The second-reading agreement with Council adopted by MEPs sets the definitions and ground rules for all the other pieces of EU legislation relative to waste - it therefore has a direct or indirect impact on them all.
In the debate on Monday 16 June, Parliament's rapporteur Caroline JACKSON (EPP-ED, South West, Conservative UK) said: "It has been a long and tortuous road to this second reading. There was much resistance to what we wanted to do and the Council drove a very hard bargain... That is the best deal available. Anyone who thinks that we could get anything better by going to conciliation would be deceiving themselves."
The compromise was supported by many speakers during yesterday's debate though several speakers would have liked to achieve more. Several MEPs were unhappy that the compromise was too weak and criticised that no binding waste prevention target is included or would have preferred to have even tougher targets for recycling and re-use.
Inclusion of targets for re-use and recycling
MEPs managed in including in the directive a new article on re-use and recycling targets, which was foreseen neither by the original Commissions' proposal nor by the Common Position. The compromise states that Member Sates "shall take the necessary measures designed to achieve the following targets":
- by 2020 for re-use and recycling of waste materials such as paper, metal glass from households and similar waste streams: 50 %
- by 2020 for non hazardous construction and demolition waste: 70 %
In the debate Commissioner Dimas underlined that "it was hard to persuade the Member States for objectives". Answering several MEPs who criticised the targets for being too weak, he confirmed that: "If these targets are not met in 2020, the Commission can take Member States to court for non-compliance with the requirements of the Directive."
A special target for manufacturing and industrial waste, as demanded by MEPs is not included in the compromise but the Commission has to examine the targets by 2020 and eventually reinforce them or consider setting targets for other waste streams.
Waste prevention is reinforced - targets to be considered in the future
The new directive will oblige Member States to establish waste management plans and waste prevention programmes with waste prevention objectives 5 years after entry into force of the directive. Further to this duty the compromise includes a new article on waste prevention. The Commission shall propose - if appropriate - by end 2014 the setting of waste prevention and decoupling objectives for 2020.
Incineration
For MEPs, a crucial aim is to reduce the amount of landfill and incineration, both of which cause pollution. Members were divided over whether incineration of municipal solid waste should be regarded as a "disposal" or a "recovery" operation, the latter one being a better option regarding the waste hierarchy. In the vote, MEPs backed the Commission and Council position that it should be categorised as recovery, provided it meets a certain energy efficiency standards (energy efficiency formula in annex II to the directive). According to the Commission this has the effect that only the most energy efficient existing municipal solid waste incinerators will be classified as recovery installations.
In the debate, Mrs Jackson said: "This is a positive incentive to incinerator operators to reach high standards and we would do well to remember, in these fuel poor days, that waste can be a useful fuel. But it is important to recognise that the Parliament has now ensured, by writing in targets for recycling and emphasising waste prevention objectives, that incineration of residual waste will have to go hand in hand with recycling."
MEPs also managed to include a revision after 6 years of the energy efficiency provisions into the compromise.
Member States to stick to binding five-stage hierarchy
The five-stage waste hierarchy, which is designed to prevent and reduce waste production, is made more certain and comprehensive and moved to a more prominent place. The hierarchy lays down an order of preference for waste operations: prevention, re-use, recycling, other recovery operations and, as a last resort, safe and environmentally sound disposal. Member States shall treat it "as a priority order", in waste prevention and management legislation rather than as a "guiding principle" as proposed by Council. Departing from the hierarchy may be possible where it is justified by "life cycle" thinking on the overall impacts of the generation and management of such waste.
The directive includes furthermore a definition on by-products and of the "end-of-waste" status. It introduces an extended producer responsibility and asks Member States to take measures to encourage the separate collection of bio-waste.
Some figures
The 1.8 billion tonnes of waste generated each year in Europe works out at 3.5 tonnes per person. This consists mainly of waste from households, commercial activities (e.g., shops, restaurants, hospitals etc.), industry (e.g. pharmaceutical companies, clothes manufacturers etc.), agriculture (e.g. slurry), construction and demolition projects, mining and quarrying activities and from energy generation.
Municipal waste generation averages 530kg per person per year, an average that masks significant differences among Member States. For example, per capita waste generation is 300 to 350 kg per annum in the EU-10 Member States, but around 570 kg in the EU-15.
In 2005, 49% of EU municipal waste was disposed of through landfill, 18% was incinerated and 27% recycled or composted.

Water pollutants to be more strictly controlled as MEPs adopt legislation
2008-06-23 - 11:05
Use of 33 pollutants - mainly pesticides and heavy metals - likely to be found in rivers, lakes and coastal waters must be reduced or ended, depending on the level of risk involved. By 2018 Member States will have to reduce pollution from "priority substances", and ceasing or phasing out emissions, discharges and losses of "priority hazardous substances". This forms part of a second-reading agreement with Council and adopted by the EP with 673 in favour and 10 against and 5 abstentions. The objective of the directive is to achieve good surface water chemical status. Environmental quality standards (EQS), which take the form of maximum allowable concentrations and annual average values, for 33 pollutants like pesticides, heavy metals and others are proposed. These substances may endanger the survival of ecosystems, and via the food chain, human health, says the report drafted by Anne Laperrouze (ALDE, FR).
"This directive will guarantee a higher level of the protection of water by principally applying the principal of polluter-pays and corrects" said the rapporteur after the vote.
More substances to be controlled by 2018
Member States will have to "make progress towards compliance" with the reduction or cessation objectives set by the water quality standards (EQS) by 2018. The proposed directive on water quality is the final piece of legislation needed to support the Water Framework Directive.
Thirteen of the 33 pollutants covered by the directive are already identified as "priority hazardous substances". Heavy metals like cadmium and mercury are among these substances. C easing or phasing out emissions, discharges and losses of "priority hazardous substances" will be required by 2018.
In its first-reading, Parliament had wanted to phase out a wider range of substances, but the Council has only been willing to take on board the list of 33. The majority of MEPs were willing to accept this as a first step, since some action was seen as better than none, with a further review already scheduled.
MEPs ask the Commission to make a proposal as to classify 13 extra substances (including, dioxins, PCBs and Bisphenol) as "priority substances or priority hazardous substances".
In order to classify these 13 new substances as "priority" or "hazardous" ones, the Commission will make a new legislative proposal in 2011. The EQS for the new priority substances will be proposed in 2013 . Adoption of these EQS is scheduled in 2015 matching the deadline of the second river basin management plans Member states will have to submit.
Reducing the extent of mixing zones in the future
Close to pollution sources, it will not be possible to comply quickly with environmental quality standards. In these 'mixing zones', pollutant concentrations may exceed the limits, provided that they do not prevent the rest of the body of surface water from meeting the standards.
MEPs want to guarantee that Member States ensure the best available water treatment techniques when they establish "mixing zones". A description of measures taken to reduce the extent of the mixing zones in the future should be included in river basin management plans.
Inventory of discharges, maps if available
Member States will have to establish an inventory, including maps, if available, of emissions, discharges and losses of all priority substances and pollutants for each river basin district or part of a river basin district lying within their territory including their concentrations in sediment and biota . These inventories will be part of the river basin management plans (to be submitted in 2009 and to be updated in 2015).
Member States sharing bodies of surface water should coordinate their monitoring activities and the compilation of inventories
Entry into force
The directive will be adopted in 2008 and will enter into in 2010 at the earliest (18 months of transposition).

MEPs adopt legislation on higher safety standards for road infrastructure
2008-06-23 - 11:05
MEPs adopted a legislative report on a directive to upgrade road safety management standards. The aim is to establish EU-wide standards on road infrastructure management. Safety standards for roads, in particular in road design maintenance, differ greatly between the Member States. The Directive requires the establishment and implementation of rules relating to road safety impact assessments, road safety audits, the management of road network safety and safety inspections by the Member States. To raise standards, the draft directive provides for impact assessments of the effect of road building on safety, safety audits and inspections, and improved safety in the existing road network. This would include the identification of high-risk road sections as well as the use of intelligent road signs and intelligent transport systems and telematics services for emergency and signage purposes. The EP Transport Committee initially rejected the draft directive outright, on the grounds that it risked creating too much red tape and that this area was best dealt with at national level. EP negotiators have now reached an agreement reached with the Council, which the House endorsed in Strasbourg. The EP rapporteur is Helmuth Markov (GUE/NGL, DE) and was adopted with 498 votes in favour, 8 against and 6 abstentions. The substance of the legislation is contained in the annexes to the directive but, under the compromise, these will be non-binding on Member States. Thus, the directive will in effect not lay down any major substantive requirements but rather serve as a set of guidelines for Member States on how to manage road infrastructure safety. Road signs MEPs say that Member States must ensure that signs are in place to warn road users of road infrastructure segments that are undergoing repairs and which may thus jeopardise the safety of road users. These signs must also include signs visible during both day and night time and set up at a safe distance. Roadside parking Parliament underlines that sufficient roadside parking areas are very important not only for crime prevention but also for road safety. Parking areas enable drivers to take rest breaks in good time and continue their journey with full concentration. The provision of sufficient safe parking areas should therefore form an integral part of road infrastructure safety management. The rapporteur and on behalf of the EPP-ED, PES, ALDE, EUL/NGL and Greens/EFA tabled a range of amendments on assessments and audits, on sufficient roadside parking areas in order to promote crime prevention, and on the use of uniform signs EU-wide in order to warn road users of road infrastructure segments undergoing repairs.

Better protection for pedestrians and cyclists to be introduced more quickly
2008-06-23 - 11:05
Plans to reduce the number of pedestrians and cyclists injured on Europe's roads by introducing tougher standards on the safety of motor vehicles were adopted by MEPs in a first-reading report by Francesco FERRARI (ALDE, IT. Each year 8,000 pedestrians and cyclists are killed and 300,000 injured across the EU. MEPs endorsed a compromise already reached between Parliament and Council negotiators. A new EU regulation seeks to reduce these figures by laying down stricter safety requirements to be observed by manufacturers of cars, SUVs and light goods vehicles. The regulation replaces the Directive 2005/66/EC and the Directive 2003/102/EC, some of whose requirements have now been deemed by an independent study not to be feasible.
The new standards relate essentially to a number of performance tests that vehicles and frontal protection systems are required to pass, and the compulsory introduction of brake assistance systems. Differentiated timetables for the introduction of these standards will apply to "new vehicles" (new cars made under an existing design) and "new vehicle types" (cars made under new, not yet existent, designs).
Under the agreement struck with the Council, most of the amendments to the Commission text adopted by the EP have been accepted. In particular, MEPs have successfully pushed for the new requirements to be introduced more quickly than the Commission had proposed.
The main points covered by the agreement are as follows:
- The compulsory introduction of brake-assist systems (BAS) and the performance tests that cars have to pass in order to increase pedestrian protection (passive safety measures) will be introduced between 9 and 15 months earlier than the Commission is proposing. In addition, thanks to MEPs, no time distinction is to be allowed between lighter and heavier cars as far as the introduction of BAS is concerned. Under the Commission's proposal, manufacturers of certain types of SUV would have had more time to comply.
- Frontal protection systems (FPS), better known as bull bars, will have to pass the same performance tests as the vehicles on which they are intended to be installed.
- With regard to collision avoidance systems (for example, future technology such as infra-red systems that can identify pedestrians and other obstacles and avoid collisions with them more reliably than the car driver), it was agreed that once any such a system is developed, the EU co-legislators (EP and Council) will have the right to assess the effective potential of this active safety measure, and that there will be no automatic trade-off between passive safety requirements and anti-collision systems.

Intelligent car technology take-up too slow, says European Parliament
2008-06-23 - 11:05
Take-up of intelligent car technologies remains very low, given their potential, says Parliament in an own-initiative report adopted by MEPs. These technologies need to get cheaper, but also to be better publicised, it stresses, noting that if fully deployed, with the necessary infrastructure, EU-wide emergency call technology could save up to 2,500 lives a year on EU roads, and electronic stability control up to 4,000. Rapporteur Zita GURMAIi (PES, HU), who saw her report adopted without amendments, noted that Intelligent Vehicle Systems could substantially reduce the annual death toll on European roads - currently 41,600 as well as alleviating or remedying congestion, environmental and public health problems. The report was adopted with 417 votes in favour 6 against and 5 abstentions.
New systems too expensive for the consumer
But so far, penetration rates for intelligent car systems and applications remain very low in relation to their potential, says the committee. Many consumers cannot afford the new systems, so they need to get cheaper as soon as possible. Members also called for better public information about intelligent cars. Car dealers should play a key role in here, as well as TV and the internet. MEPs called on the Commission to focus its efforts on countries where the availability of intelligent systems is still very low.
Towards a pan-European emergency call system
The House backs plans to roll out the pan-European emergency call system eCall by 2010. In the event of an accident, this system alerts the emergency services automatically, providing the exact location of the vehicle. If fully deployed across the EU, eCall technology, combined with the 112 emergency number, could save up to 2,500 lives a year.
The report calls on the 14 Member States that have yet to sign a Memorandum of Understanding on the system's introduction to do so by mid-2008. The Commission is also asked to further develop the regulatory framework for the full harmonisation of 112 emergency call standards and for EU-wide eCall technology using 112.
Electronic Stability Control (ESC)
Members also advocated accelerating the introduction of Electronic Stability Control (ESC), which reduces the danger of skidding. It is believed that 4,000 lives could be saved annually, and 100,000 crashes avoided if all cars had ESC. They fully supported the goal of achieving 100% availability of ESC for the model year 2012.
ICTs and the environment
MEPs also asked the European Commission to develop a methodology for measuring the impact of Information and communication technologies (ICTs) on CO2 emissions, arguing that this could help to cut fuel consumption and emissions. Adaptive Cruise Control, which adapts the speed of a car to surrounding traffic, could lead to a 3% overall reduction, they say.
The use of portable or nomadic devices
Members noted that the use and availability of portable or nomadic devices had increased and called on stakeholders to work on ways to ensure that such devices neither distract the driver nor prove dangerous in an accident.
Technology cannot replace training
Finally, MEPs warned that the greater sense of safety promoted by this technology may encourage drivers to take less responsibility, and stressed the primary importance of proper training for drivers.

Inland transport of dangerous goods
2008-06-23 - 11:05
Parliament adopted a legislative report on the inland transport of dangerous goods. The proposed Directive aims to simplify and update the existing dangerous goods rules and at the same time extend the scope of the current rules by including inland waterways. The proposal also endorses a user-friendly single set of rules for the inland transport of dangerous goods in the European Union. The proposed directive will make an important contribution to ensuring the safety and security of the transport of dangerous goods in the European Union. It updates the existing four directives and four Commission decisions on this issue and merges them into one piece of legislation.
Parliament's vote approved the common position where the Council introduced several modifications, which are summarised as follows:
those Member States which have no railway systems will be exempted from transposing and implementing the proposed directive, insofar as rail is concerned;
all Member States, which have no inland waterways or whose inland waterways are not linked to those of other Member States, will be given the possibility of not applying the Directive, insofar as inland waterway transport of dangerous goods is concerned;
a transitional period of up to two years for the application of inland waterways;
provisions provided for to allow sufficient time for the adoption of national provisions, the establishment of legal frameworks and the training of personnel.
The transposition date is set for 30 June 2009 and Member States may maintain national restrictions on the transport of substances containing dioxins and furans for certain periods of time.

High oil prices: structural causes, speculation and taxes debated by MEPs
2008-06-23 - 11:05
Are rising oil prices mainly the result of long term economic changes at global level, or is speculation more of a factor? Should taxes on energy be cut across the board to help consumers and businesses, or should support be targeted on those hardest hit? These were some of the issues raised in a debate with Council and Commission on the impact of the high oil and energy prices. Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs told MEPs he started each day by checking oil prices, and lately the direction was always up. The dollar price had tripled in three years. "Our dependency on imported oil is high and costs are increasing steadily. There is a direct negative impact on citizens and businesses."
The Commission, he said, had been working through a five-point plan since 2005, with steps on energy efficiency, cars, fuel quality and renewable energy. This should lead to a decrease in oil consumption in the years ahead, as the switch to more efficient and renewable energy sources begins. "Our policies have not failed: without them the current situation would be even harder. But we need to step up our efforts," he said.
In the short term, there could be steps to help consumers and the most vulnerable groups through social measures, targeted at poorest households, but he said we should be cautious about tax changes. They were often politically attractive, but could end up making the long term problem more difficult.
The recent climate and energy package was aimed at sustainability, security of supply and efficiency. "We should lead international action and enable functioning of global, efficient energy markets. A renewed push for renewable energy is beneficial for the climate, but also our economy."
For the Council presidency -in-office, Slovenian European Affairs Minister Janez Lenarcic stressed that the causes of the oil price rises were structural in nature: it was unlikely that oil production would increase to meet demand. Solutions would have to be long-term in nature and would include more competitive energy markets, greater transparency on the oil markets, diversification of supply and increased energy efficiency.
Mr Lenarcic recalled the EU's goals of cutting energy consumption by 20% and deriving 20% of energy from renewable sources by 2020. Legislation would not be enough to achieve energy savings: both domestic and industrial consumers must be urged to make an effort. And measures in addition to those already taken by the EU would be needed to promote diversification.
The minister also reminded the House of the Manchester Agreement of 2003, under which the EU had undertaken "not to react to oil prices through distorting fiscal measures". In addition, he referred to last week's G8 meeting, which had concluded that "oil price rises are a global problem requiring a global solution". Concluding, he said the need was for coordinated measures at EU and international level, and these measures "must be prudent and not create fresh problems".
Political group speakers
For the EPP-ED group, Jean-Pierre AUDY (FR) said that imagination was needed. He called for a Community instrument to ensure annual energy price stability, "so that people could plan ahead for major changes in energy prices, without constant daily fluctuations due to speculators."
Speaking for the Socialist Group, Hannes SWOBODA (AT) complained that the Commission was not addressing speculation as a cause for part of the price rises. "The proposal is very weak so far. We sought to protect consumer rights when we voted on the Morgan report [on the electricity market] and social measures are needed too. Citizens, like those in Ireland, worry that nothing happens to take account of their concerns."
For the ALDE group, Marco CAPPATO (IT), said there was no need to impose price controls. Instead we should aim for more ambitious targets on energy efficiency. "The gas market debate shows that only the Member State governments are opposing a real European policy of competition and an appropriate energy mix Let's not ask Europe to solve problems national politicians have caused us," he said.
Claude TURMES (LU) of the Greens/EFA group proposed coordinated national taxes on energy speculators, given the "huge" profits of Exxon and similar companies. This could raise revenue to help those most hurt by oil price rises and fund measures for energy efficiency. "This is a structural crisis," he said, "we need to be more ambitious on energy efficiency."
Gintaras DIDŽIOKAS (UEN, LT) said the EU's energy product tax policy should be updated. The public was paying VAT, excise duty and import taxes, and paradoxically the authorities wanted to squeeze the public further. Tax policy changes were not the whole solution but could introduce an element of greater flexibility.
On behalf of his group, Dimitrios PAPADIMOULIS (GUE/NGL, EL) was disappointed with the Council and Commission, whom he accused of being long on words but short on action. He saw speculators as part of the problem. And national treasuries, which actually benefited from oil price rises at the public's expense, could use their revenue to mitigate the effects of price rises on the most vulnerable parts of the population.
Commissioner's response to debate
In his response to the debate, Commissioner Piebalgs downplayed the impact of speculation on prices, noting that it was physically impossible for companies to horde large oil stocks. High prices were a market signal that more investment was needed, and no European companies were making windfall profits without investing. The right solution, he said, was to make energy efficiency the number one priority, and also taking action to boost renewable and alternative energy sources, such as nuclear power.

Asma Jahangir, UN special rapporteur, on European Year of Intercultural Dialogue
2008-06-23 - 11:05
The United Nations Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, Asma Jahangir, addressed a formal sitting of the House on Wednesday as part of Year of Intercultural Dialogue. She urged that "intercultural dialogue" be understood in a wide sense, bringing together a range of religious and non-religious perspectives; it should include dialogue at grassroots level rather than being conducted purely by leaders; and she strongly opposed the idea of outlawing "defamation of religions". Welcoming Mrs Jahangir, EP Vice-President Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou said that her speech would contribute to the EP's message of promoting free dialogue and mutual comprehension. She also quoted Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which underpins Mrs Jahangir's work: "Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance". Lastly, Mrs Kratsa expressed support for Mrs Jahangir's well-known emphasis on the need for wider participation in politics, including by women, and the importance of education.
Intercultural dialogue must be based on real diversity
In her speech, Mrs Jahangir first asked: "does “inter cultural ” also include “inter religious ” dialogue?" and answered in the affirmative "since religions are part of culture". However, “ intra -religious” tensions must also be addressed. "Consequently, intercultural dialogue should also take the believers of different denominations of the various religions on board and their ideas into account".
Similarly, "what about dialogue between theistic, non-theistic and atheistic believers? All of these believers are protected under international human rights law as well as the right not to profess any religion or belief. So in my opinion these dimensions should also be included in initiatives of intercultural dialogue." Ultimately, "government and civil society have a role in creating an environment where people of various religions and beliefs can effortlessly interact".
Dialogue - the only way to bridge divides
Mrs Jahangir stressed that "there have always been individuals who try to prove that their culture, their religion, their language or their history is superior to that of their neighbours." Nevertheless, "religions share many moral values which could and should make it possible for them to come to a common understanding of respect".
Moreover, intercultural dialogue must not be seen as an elite concern. She had witnessed grassroots examples of successful intercultural dialogue in Israel and Palestine, and in Northern Ireland. "However, the grassroots efforts rarely make headlines in the media – unlike interreligious violence", she said.
Not only religious leaders should be involved
Thus, while recognising that high-level meetings of religious leaders are important, Mrs Jahangir stressed the need for other contributions. Not only should debates "if possible also include believers who are dispassionate about their faith as well as atheistic and non-theistic believers and members of religious minorities. Any dialogue would also greatly benefit from the perspectives of women, who tend to be marginalised in major events of interreligious dialogue." And, referring to a recent round table discussion in London on legislation against discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, she pointed out "that discussion would have been completely different without the participation of members of the Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement".
A firm "No" to any ban on "defamation of religion"
Mrs Jahangir then asked "does dialogue exclude the possibility to criticize the tenets of other religions?" To applause from the House, she said "In my opinion, in a true dialogue one of the options should also be that the interlocutors ultimately may 'agree to disagree' ".
But, to further applause from MEPs, she added "I firmly believe, however, that it would be wrong to follow the approach of protecting religions per se rather than individuals or groups of believers as affirmed by international human rights standards. On many occasions I have voiced concerns that criminalizing “defamation of religions” can be counterproductive, since it may create an atmosphere of intolerance and fear and may even increase the chances of a backlash." And crucially, "accusations of “defamation of religions” might stifle legitimate criticism or even research on practices and laws appearing to be in violation of human rights but that are - or are at least perceived to be - sanctioned by religion".
Values as a bridge between different beliefs
Concluding, Mrs Jahangir Universal said "values should serve as a bridge between different religions and beliefs" and "this may ultimately also lead to the reinforcement of universal human rights".
Mrs Jahangir took part in a debate with MEPs on Thursday (19 June) at a meeting of the EP Subcommittee on Human Rights.

Immigration
Parliament adopts directive on return of illegal immigrants
2008-06-23 - 11:05
The compromise reached between Parliament negotiators and the Council on the directive on the return of illegal immigrants was approved at first reading by the full Parliament on Wednesday (18 June). This legislation, which is a step towards a European immigration policy, will encourage the voluntary return of illegal immigrants but otherwise lay down minimum standards for their treatment. The debate took place on Tuesday (17 June) and a summary is given hereunder .
The draft directive was adopted by Parliament under the co-decision procedure by 369 votes to 197, with 106 abstentions. The House approved the compromise amendments tabled by the EPP-ED group. Other amendments, by the PES, Greens/EFA and GUE/NGL groups, seeking to make the legislation more favourable to individuals who are the subject of an expulsion order, were thrown out, as was a proposal to reject the directive outright, which was tabled by the last two groups.
The purpose of the legislation is to lay down EU-wide rules and procedures on the return of illegal immigrants. It covers periods of custody as well as re-entry bans but also includes a number of legal safeguards. Member States will be banned from applying harsher rules to illegal immigrants but allowed to keep or adopt more generous rules. In any case, this EU legislation applies only after a decision has been taken by the national authorities to deport an illegal immigrant: each Member State retains the power to decide in the first place whether it wishes to regularise or deport the immigrant.
Six-month detention period, with possible 12-month extension
Under the legislative text as adopted today, where a decision is taken to deport an individual, a two-step approach follows. First, the deportation decision is immediately followed by a voluntary departure period , limited to between seven and thirty days.
Then, if the deportee does not leave, a removal order will be issued. If the removal order is issued by a judicial authority which believes the individual in question might abscond, the person can be placed in custody. At present detainees can be held indefinitely in some Member States, including the UK (Ireland has a maximum of 8 weeks), but the directive lays down a maximum period of custody of six months, which can be extended by a further 12 months in certain cases. An amendment by the PES group, seeking to reduce this to three months plus a further three months, was rejected.
If a person is placed in custody following an administrative decision, this decision must be approved by the courts "as speedily as possible". The original draft legislation required a court order within 72 hours, while the EP Civil Liberties Committee wanted 48 hours. A PES amendment seeking to restore the deadline of 72 hours was rejected.
A re-entry ban would apply for five years maximum if the person is deported after the voluntary return period has expired, or longer if the individual represents a serious threat to public safety. However, Member States retain the right to waive, cancel or suspend such bans.
UK and Ireland have not opted-in
The UK and Ireland are not affected by the directive because they have not opted into this area of Community law.
The UK government argues that a strong returns regime in the EU is in everyone's interest, including the UK. But it is not persuaded that this Directive delivers the strong returns regime that the EU needs and that's why the UK government has chosen to exercise its right not to participate in this proposal.
Several Member States, argues the UK government, have made the point in the discussions that the Directive makes returning illegally staying third country nationals actually more difficult and more bureaucratic - by introducing restrictions on detention, obligations to provide legal aid to irregular migrants, and increasing the possibilities for challenging the return decision - over and above the strong protections already in place in EU law for refugees and asylum seekers.
Children and families to be detained only as a last resort
The directive also states that children and families must not be subject to coercive measures and can only be held in custody as a last resort. Unaccompanied minors may only be deported if they can be returned to their family or to "adequate reception facilities" in the state to which they are sent.
Emergency situations
An article inserted by the Council provides for greater flexibility for the authorities in "emergency situations". If an "exceptionally large number" of third-country nationals places "an unforeseen heavy burden" on the administrative or judicial capacity of a Member State, that state may decide to allow longer periods for judicial review as well as less favourable conditions of detention.
Member States must also take account of the situation of the individual’s country of origin, under the principle of non-refoulement (which states that no State may send a refugee to a country where his/her life or liberty may be endangered). Following a recent ruling by the Court of Justice, the European Parliament will in future decide jointly with the Council (under co-decision) which countries are deemed “safe”.
Legal aid subject to the terms of the "procedure" directive
The directive provides for legal aid to be granted to illegal immigrants who have no resources, albeit “in accordance with relevant national legislation or rules regarding legal aid" and with the “procedure directive” of 2005 on aid to asylum seekers.
The Community return fund, set up for the period 2008-13 with funding of €676 million, may also be used to finance legal aid.
Once the directive is adopted, Member States will have 24 months to bring it into effect. First of all, ministers have to approve the agreement officially at a Council meeting in July.
Debate - Tuesday, 17 June 2008
Political groups hold different positions ahead of vote
MEPs debated the text on the Return directive as negotiated between the EP rapporteur Manfred WEBER (EPP-ED, DE) and the Council in Strasbourg. The groups in favour of the text stress the importance of moving forward with a European policy on migratory flows, while those opposing it underline that the rapporteur has given too much to the Council and the Parliament must amend the text.
Most speakers supported the need for a directive, but while the EPP-ED, ALDE and UEN groups support the compromise text, the PES want some changes to boost immigrants' rights, and the Greens/EFA, GUE/NGL and IND/DEM will vote against the directive.
Council
The debate was opened by Slovenian Interior Minister Dragutin MATE , speaking for the Council Presidency-in-Office, who highlighted the fact that the return directive was the first EP-Council legislative act on migration. One of the problematic areas in the negotiations in Council had been the maximum period of detention, but the six month period laid down in the directive would now apply in all Member States.
However, the biggest difficulty had been legal aid, particularly as the Member States had differing experiences, depending on whether they were near to or far from migratory flows. The minister also stressed that the directive protected vulnerable groups such as children. On all these points he argued that the compromise embodied in the directive "represents progress" and he urged the EP to approve the text.
Commission
Commissioner Jacques BARROT , who is expected to take over the justice, freedom and security portfolio at the Commission this week, said the Commission advocated "an integrated approach to immigration". If nothing was done, there was a danger of a "vicious circle" in migration policy. He emphasised that "the directive is in line with the European Convention on Human Rights", it "gives priority to voluntary returns" and "it protects the rights of children and families". The Commission would monitor implementation of the legislation to ensure that the standards of the European Convention and the UN Declaration on Human Rights were observed.
Parliament's rapporteur, Manfred WEBER (EPP-ED, DE), stressed that this was "a complex topic" but that in the Civil Liberties Committee a large majority had come out in favour of the compromise. He stressed that the directive dealt not with asylum but with immigration and he challenged some of the legislation's critics, since he saw it as a way to ensure that "slavery in the EU comes to an end". The directive includes protection for "children and unaccompanied minors, access to health and education systems and the use of detention only when necessary". So "why the mud-slinging?", for example from NGOs. Moreover, all the Council of Europe's guidelines were included in the directive, so why was that body being critical? In conclusion, Mr Weber said that what he wanted to see was "a strong, humanitarian Europe".
Political group speakers
On behalf of the EPP-ED group, Agustín de Mera GARCIA CONSUEGRA (ES) described the directive as "a firm and decisive step" towards regulating legal immigration. A key objective was to encourage voluntary returns. "Forced return will only be used as a last resort" and there would be "protection of fundamental rights, access to language services and a right of appeal". At present there were places in the EU where immigrants could be held in custody indefinitely but the directive would change that. He also stressed the clear distinction between immigration and asylum legislation and the fact that the Court of Justice would have jurisdiction.
Martine ROURE (PES, FR) said that her Group would not accept the compromise put forward, not because Socialists are against a returns policy, but because the compromise does not provide adequate protection of fundamental rights.
She said it was wrong to say that the directive would allow people to come out of an illegal situation or that it would give people the right to stay. The rights established in the directive are not binding, she said, and would not allow for an improvement in detention in EU. She said that MEPs should apply all their powers through co-decision to improve the fate of detainees.
Jeanine HENNIS-PLASSCHAERT (ALDE, NL), argued that the compromise package made it clear that Member States should maintain more favourable standards if they already have them. Indeed, she said, the Council agreed to a political statement in the agreement on the directive stressing that the directive cannot be used to lower standards.
"Do we want a directive or not?" she asked. "Many Member States would be happy if this directive died through lack of agreement, so the irony is that if we don't agree this compromise package, we would be supporting those Member States. At present no EU legislation exists - with this package we would have infringement procedures.
Jean LAMBERT (Greens/EFA, GB) said that her group could not accept the negotiated text. The text simply does not meet the standards that were set out at the beginning, she said. On the length of detention, Ms Lambert was concerned about what long periods of detention can do to the mental health of the people detained. Family life is put at risk. Ms Lambert stated that her group was concerned about where would be returned to citing concerns about handshakes between Prime Minister Berlusconi and Colonel Gadhafi.
Andrzej Tomasz ZAPAŁOWSKI (UEN, PL), argued that, before we speak about legal protection for families from outside the EU, we should be hearing something about saving our own culture on families, which has been a model for the rest of the world.
Giusto CATANIA (GUE/NGL, IT) said that "the directive is a disgrace, an insult which aims at ruling out thousands of years of welcoming people, of openness in Europe It seeks to limit free circulation. We are talking about 18 months not 6 months detention without having committed any crime. Detained in degrading and humiliating conditions as the Committee has seen in various detention centres. This directive is being forced upon us by Governments. We are being dictated to by the Council "Accept it or go away" It is not co-decision. What are people outside the Parliament saying about this directive? Amnesty International, Council of Europe .. all saying do not approve it. There is a need to consult wider. People are dying to get into the EU, 12,000 have died over recent years. The Mediterranean is becoming a cemetery. We should not approve this directive.
Hélène GOUDIN (IND/DEM, SE) said that "If all doors are closed people may well try getting in through the back door. The EU is becoming a Fortress Europe. We see every day pictures of people paying with their lives. Many human rights organisations have criticised this directive: Caritas and Amnesty International for example. There is no European Added Value in creating this inhuman and expensive situation. The result of this ban or return will lead to an increase in illegal immigration, more human trafficking and a hatred for the system we are setting up in our western world. Human rights organisations have warned us. We need an international effort for Human Rights."
Frank VANHECKE (NI, BE) said that it is clear there is currently a total lack of co-ordination in tackling this problem. That it is difficult to deal with, he said, is evidenced by the many different reactions to the directive. The Directive offers choice between deportation or legalisation. Mr Vanhecke wanted a genuine directive to stem the tide but this directive does not move even one step in the right direction.
British speaker
Baroness Sarah LUDFORD (ALDE, UK) described the directive as "imperfect but necessary to raise standards", stated there has been a lot if misinformation about it causing negative reactions and also said "an assessment of the value of the directive comes perversely from the very fact that the UK is not opting into it" as "it does not want to be constrained by the high standards in the directive, not least the time limits and the conditions on detention, such as the separation of immigration detainees from convicted criminals".
Responses of Council, Commission and EP rapporteur
Replying to the debate for the Council, Mr Mate made or re-emphasised a number of points. He said the return directive dealt with immigration, not asylum (which is governed by a separate directive in force since 2003). It was wrong to say that the standard maximum period for detention is 18 months: the normal maximum is six months, to be extended to 18 only in special circumstances. No Member State will be allowed to adopt rules on detention that worsen the current situation. Children will have greater protection than at present (a point that had been difficult to negotiate with the Member States).
For many Member States the compromise was barely acceptable and they would prefer to deal with these matters at national level. If there was no first-reading agreement, some states would seek to introduce tougher measures at second reading. Overall the text was a compromise that avoided extremes and did not represent the position of any single country. Ultimately, he pointed out, "all of us are accountable to our electorates".
For the Commission, Jacques BARROT said the return directive would not exist in isolation but was part of a planned package on immigration and asylum. One benefit of the directive was that it created a Community-based legal framework, allowing scrutiny by the Court of Justice and the European Parliament. The EP had achieved progress, notably in the provisions protecting child immigrants. He pointed out that the EU had a fund of around €700 million to help with the costs of legal aid and health care. Lastly, he would ensure that in the implementation of the directive human rights were fully respected.
Winding up the debate, EP rapporteur Manfred WEBER rejected the accusation that the EU was "guilty of mass graves in the Mediterranean". He saw the directive as the best available compromise, predicting that even the NGOs and MEPs who were critical of it "will use the provisions of this directive to go to the Court of Justice to gain benefits for immigrants". Concluding, he said "tomorrow's vote is not on whether this directive is ideal, but on whether it represents progress for the EU. The answer is Yes".

Euro
Parliament backs Slovakia’s euro area membership
2008-06-23 - 11:05
MEPs have approved Slovakia's bid to adopt the euro on 1 January 2009. At the same time, they stressed that Slovakia should make further efforts to keep its rate of inflation down and continue structural reforms to its economy. In a report drawn up by David Casa (EPP-ED, MT), Parliament agrees with the Commission that Slovakia has met the criteria to join the euro. Ongoing efforts urged on inflation and structural reform MEPs note that the European Central Bank has identified risks concerning the sustainability of the low inflation rate achieved by Slovakia, and urges further fiscal consolidation, with a balanced budget in the medium-term, and for the social partners to keep wage growth in line with productivity growth in order to maintain a low inflation environment. They also call for the structural reforms to the labour, services and product markets to continue and say the government of Slovakia should ensure competition, notably in sensitive sectors such as energy. Informing the public The report also calls for a public information campaign to explain the benefits of the single currency ahead of the conversion, and for the necessary steps to be taken to minimise price increases during the changeover period. An observatory should be set up to monitor the prices of a selection of basic goods so as to fight false perceptions about price increases. Changes after the assessment MEPs stress that all relevant measures taken by a Member State applying for membership of the euro area, after the publication of the convergence reports of the Commission and the ECB, should be taken into account by the Council on the basis of the relevant Parliament resolution and integrated into the monitoring process. Next steps The European Council is expected to take a political decision on Slovakia's euro membership at its 19-20 June summit, with the formal legislation being put to the vote at the following meeting of EU finance ministers. Parliament's role in decisions on euro area enlargement is consultative.

Agriculture
Sheep and goat farming: a valuable sector in need of a helping hand say MEPs
2008-06-23 - 11:05
MEPs adopted a report for urgent EU action to support sheep and goat farming, including producer income support and marketing measures. In addition, the Commission's plans for compulsory electronic tagging of every animal should be rethought, says the House. The report was adopted with 492 votes in favour, 30 against and 9 abstentions. The sheep and goat sectors in Europe are at a critical stage, argues EP rapporteur Liam AYLWARD (UEN, IE) in his own-initiative report. Swift measures need to be taken by the EU to preserve sheep and goat farming on an economically sustainable basis.
Mr Aylward raised several points in the debate and underlined: "The introduction of a new environmental sheep maintenance scheme would allow sheep farmers to be paid under on a per ewe basis, in recognition of the positive environmental attributes associated with the maintenance of sheep production, to be co financed by national and European Union funding."
The structural decline in the production of sheep and goats has significantly accelerated since the 2003 CAP reform. Of the total EU-27 sheep flock, 83 % is concentrated in six countries: Spain, the UK, Italy, Greece, Romania and France. However, sheep farming is also important for Portugal, the Netherlands and Ireland. The sheep flock dropped by 18% in the EU-15 between 1990 and 2006. Almost all countries were affected, except Spain. The UK flock in particular suffered from the foot-and-mouth crisis in 2001. In France numbers fell by 30%.
Electronic identification
Parliament calls on the Commission and Council of Agriculture Ministers to consider the possibility of introducing Community financing for the application throughout the European Union of the electronic identification system for sheep intended for 31 December 2009, because, even if this system will improve traceability, flock management and measures against fraud, it will create new administrative burdens and high costs for this sector, which is in crisis.
The report proposes a range of measures to help the sector. These include:
- new financial support to halt the decline in production, including a per capita sheep premium and special payments for traditional mountain breeds;
- greater flexibility in the introduction of the new EU electronic sheep tagging system (which is costly for producers): each Member State would decided whether to use such a system;
- a labelling system for sheepmeat products, with an EU logo to allow consumers to distinguish between EU and non-EU products;
- measures to promote consumption of lamb and goat, especially among young people;
- research into the supply chain and claims that supermarkets abuse their power to influence prices;
- research into better veterinary products to combat diseases such as blue tongue;
- a task force to oversee reform of the sector.

Ombudsman
Clearer rules on European Ombudsman's access to information
2008-06-23 - 11:05
Proposed changes in the rules governing the European Ombudsman's access to information held by EU bodies and evidence given to him by EU civil servants, are set out in a report, adopted by the European Parliament, on the Ombudsman's Statute. The key aim of these changes is to boost citizens' confidence in the Ombudsman's work. The debate took place on 21 April (see link below). Changes in the Ombudsman's Statute were requested by the Ombudsman himself, Mr Diamandouros, in a letter sent to EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering in July 2006. The report was adopted with 576 votes in favour, 8 against and 6 abstentions. Clearer rules on access to confidential documents MEPs adopted an amendment to a provision that obliges all EU institutions and bodies to provide the Ombudsman with the information he requests. This amendment deletes the current caveat that information may be refused on grounds of secrecy, which Members felt that citizens could interpret as restricting the Ombudsman's right to acquire information. The new text spells out the rules on the handling of classified information obtained by the Ombudsman and his staff in the course of their inquiries. The report says that they would be required not to divulge any sensitive information or any document falling under the scope of the Community legislation regarding the protection of personal data. Officials bound to testify MEPs also agreed to change the rule on the testimony of EU officials. The approved text deletes a requirement that Community civil servants must testify "in accordance with the instructions from their administrations". Again, the House felt that this wording might mislead citizens into thinking that officials are not always required to tell the truth. The report setting out amendments to the statute of the European Ombudsman and his staff is drafted by Anneli JÄÄTTEENMÄKI (ALDE, FI) After the plenary vote in Parliament, the agreement of the Council is also needed for the changes to enter into force.

Social policy
EP backs plans to designate 2010 as the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion
2008-06-23 - 11:05
"Wealth inequalities and severe poverty are matters of growing concern across the Union", says the European Parliament backing a first-reading compromise negotiated with the Council beforehand which designates 2010 as the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. The EU will provide €17 million for events, information campaigns and studies. 78 million EU citizens live at risk of poverty, 19 million of them are children, stresses the co-decision report. The report drafted by Marie PANAYOTOPOULOS-CASSIOTOU (EPP-ED, EL) was adopted with 635 votes in favour 29 against and 10 abstentions. In amending the priorities for the European Year, MEPs therefore want initiatives to focus on fighting child poverty and the intergenerational transmission of poverty. Special attention should also be paid to large families, single parents, families caring for a dependent person, and children in institutions. Budget: Highest amount ever granted to a European Year The EU will provide €17 million for events, information campaigns and studies in the course of the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion - the highest amount ever granted to a European Year. Actions on a European scale can receive benefits of up to 80%, whereas actions at local, regional or national level can be co-financed up to 50% from EU funds. The events should inter alia address in-work poverty, homelessness as well as the needs of people with disabilities and their families. Initiatives should aim at facilitating access to culture and leisure opportunities and at overcoming discrimination of immigrants and ethnic minorities, stresses the text. Support less-favoured regions The compromise text equally says that more support is needed for less-favoured regions, for areas with permanent structural disadvantages, for outermost regions, for certain islands and island Member States and for areas that have been affected by recent deindustrialisation or industrial conversion. The compromise carried over the Employment Committee's suggestion to promote studies on the relation between severe poverty and fundamental rights. Use synergies with UN International Day for the Eradication of Poverty The European Year should make use of the synergies arising from the activities organised for the UN International Day for the Eradication of Poverty on 17 October, says the text.

Development and cooperation
Fish and timber in West Africa need more sustainable EU policies say MEPs
2008-06-23 - 11:05
Fish and timber are natural resources often not managed in a sustainable way in West Africa due to inadequate EU policies, says a report adopted by the European Parliament. The own initiative report adopted with 559 votes in favour 11 against and 17 abstentions is part of a periodic review of EU policies. The report draws on the role of the EP Committee on Development to assess how EU policies affect development in a new power granted by the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) that entered into force in December 2006. The periodic review of EU policies is called "policy coherence for development (PCD)" and forms part of the 2005 European consensus on development.
MEPs say that the creation of a legal framework that will guarantee protection for current and potential Community investment stemming chiefly from the creation of joint ventures, which presently encounter too many obstacles to investment in the third country, mainly owing to the loss of control over the business and legal uncertainty in almost all countries in the region.
Preventing timber sales from destructive and illegal sources
Concerning timber policies, the report calls on the Commission to propose comprehensive legislation preventing timber from illegal and destructive sources being placed on the market and is concerned that cheap imports of illegal timber destabilises internal markets and reduces the tax revenues of producer countries.
MEPs are concerned about the negative effects of deforestation on climate change and indigenous communities and therefore call on the Commission to "respond favourably to requests to finance sustainable forest management initiatives" and for Member States and the Commission to "speed up the adoption of a green public procurement policy".
More sustainable fishing activities needed
The report calls on the EU to make fishing activities in West Africa more sustainable and considers that the EU's fisheries policy must be in accordance with the Food and Agricultural Organization's (FAO) Code of Conduct.
MEPs call on the Commission and West African Governments to curb illegal fishing and control fish stocks, and also note that when the EU reduces its activities in West African waters, their place may be taken by fleets from countries with less respect for the principles of sustainability.
Local impact of EU policies
The report stresses the importance of policy coherence as one of the EU's contributions to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and the impact of EU fisheries and timber policy on local sustainable development.
As more than 80% of the fish and timber exported by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) goes to the EU, the report states that "the EU can play a significant role for the region's further development in these areas".
In its policy assessment, the report included Member States of ECOWAS (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Côte d'Ivoire, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo), Mauritania and Cameroon.

Fisheries
MEPs express solidarity with fishermen and call for payment of aid to the fisheries sector
2008-06-23 - 11:05
In adopting a joint resolution on the crisis of the fisheries sector due to the rising fuel price, MEPs expresses their solidarity with the EU fishermen and call on the Commission and the Council to envisage measures in order to resolve the present situation in the fisheries sector. MEPs furthermore call on the Member States to speed up procedures to enable the payment of aid on de minimis aid in the fisheries sector. MEPs reiterate in this context their call to the Commission to revise the abovementioned regulation so as to increase the aid to EUR 100 000 per vessel instead of per undertaking, so that the level of aid is brought closer to that in other economic sectors.
Parliament asks for the fishing fleet adjustment plans to be brought into force in all the Member States and for the financial means necessary for voluntarily restructuring of fleets to be provided, and with this aim:
(a) calls on the Commission to establish priority criteria for the segments of the fleet that have been most affected by this crisis;
(b) considers it essential that national Operational Programmes under the European Fisheries Fund be reviewed to allow for more targeted spending;
(c) calls for assistance with a one-off change in fishing gear to produce a less fuel-intensive fishing method;
(d) encourages the purchase of equipment to improve fuel efficiency;
The House asks the Commission to submit proposals on a 7-year compensation scheme for CO2 reduction in the fisheries sector, based on the current price of € 25 per tonne of CO2.
The European Parliament asks the Commission to support the creation of a specific fisheries-oriented research and development fund, within the existing 7th R&D Framework Programme, to help finance projects aimed at investigating alternative energy sources and improving energy efficiency in the fisheries sector.
MEPs urge the Commission to formulate specific proposals to alleviate the situation in the areas most dependent on fisheries.
The resolution was adopted with 454 votes in favour, 84 against and 24 abstentions.

Food safety
Parliament opposes sale of chlorinated chicken in EU
2008-06-23 - 11:05
MEPs are calling on the Council to reject the Commission's proposal to authorise four antimicrobial treatments for poultry carcasses for human consumption. Imports of such poultry meat might undermine European standards, says the House. A resolution adopted by 526 votes in favour to 27 against with 11 abstentions stresses that authorisation of these four antimicrobial treatments for poultry carcasses would pose "a serious threat to Community rules and standards". This would constitute a setback for the efforts and adjustments made by poultry professionals with a view to reducing the incidence of bacterial infection in the EU. MEPs draw attention to the "considerable investments" made in this area by European poultry professionals, in accordance with Community legislation. This was done to reduce pathogen contamination by implementing a total food chain approach. This decision is likely to undermine European consumer confidence in foodstuffs sold within the European Union, says the resolution. MEPs ask to be consulted and informed by the Commission before any further decisions in preparation for the October 2008 TEC meeting. Background According to MEPs, the Commission's decision of 28 May 2008 proposal to authorise poultry treated with chemicals or antimicrobial substances follows on from the request by the United States for imports into the European Union. At its meeting of 2 June 2008 the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health rejected the above Commission proposal by 316 votes to nil, with 29 abstentions, thus sending out a clear and forceful message prior to the EU-US Summit in Brdo, Slovenia. The Agriculture Council of 15 July 2008 is expected to discuss the Commission's decision. Ministers can reject the decision by qualified majority.

Civil protection
More EU action needed to prevent and react to natural disasters say MEPs
2008-06-23 - 11:05
In view of the increasingly acute problems with forest fires and droughts in the European Union, the European Parliament in a resolution stresses the need to increase the EU's capacity to prevent and to respond to those natural disasters. MEPs urge the Commission to ameliorate the existing instruments and adopt new ones if necessary. The resolution was adopted with 523 votes in favour and 37 votes against. According to MEPs it is a high -priority for the EU to step up its disaster response capacity. The whole disaster cycle (prevention, preparedness, response and recovery) at national, EU and international levels should be covered by adequate Commission proposals to be presented by the end of 2008. The Commission is urged to submit a package of legally binding instrument (e.g. a framework directive) to fill existing gaps as regards disaster prevention and response. The proposals should include the setting up of key resources that have guaranteed availability for participating in European civil protection operations at any time, based primarily on national capacities.
MEPs criticise the Commissions proposal to create a European Civil Protection Force from May 2006 as not sufficient and call on the Commission to develop a more specific proposal to pursue the development of a rapid response capacity on the basis of the civil protection modules of the Member States.
To ensure the necessary integration of prevention and disaster risk reduction into the Structural Funds and Cohesion programmes, MEPs ask for the strengthening of existing guidelines and the development of new ones. Also the Monitoring and Information Centre - through which any country affected by a major can launch a request for assistance - should be strengthened to enable it to actively support the operations by the Member States.

External relations
Human rights and Russian actions in Georgia worry MEPs otherwise supportive of Partnership and Cooperation Agreement
2008-06-23 - 11:05
The deteriorating human rights conditions in Russia and Moscow's actions in Abkhazia and South Ossetia were the top worries of MEPs discussing the upcoming EU-Russia summit. A resolution, adopted with 488 votes in favour, 34 against and 30 abstentions, stresses these concerns, while expressing the House's satisfaction that the negotiations on a new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) can now begin. The Parliament expresses "its satisfaction that it has finally been possible to overcome the obstacles to reaching an agreement on the mandate for negotiations with the Russian Federation on a new Partnership Agreement." The start of negotiations had been held up by a Polish veto related to a Russian ban on meat exports, and more recently by Lithuania, which was concerned about Russian energy policy and its actions in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Frozen conflicts, frosty US relations The resolution repeats Lithuanian worries, voicing the Parliament's "serious concern over Russia's decision to establish enhanced links with the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia and reiterates its full support for the territorial integrity of Georgia." The House also asks the Council to raise the issue of "the shooting-down of a Georgian drone by a Russian aircraft, as well as the recent substantial increase in the number of Russian troops in Abkhazia," during the upcoming summit. In an indirect allusion to the question of US plans to establish an anti-missile shield in Europe, the House also "appeals to the Governments of Russia and the United States to intensify the discussions on defence and security issues directly or indirectly involving the European Union Member States," and urges them "to refrain from any steps and decisions which might be considered a threat to peace and stability on the European continent." Human rights and rule of law within Russia MEPs express their "deep concern over the increasingly frequent attacks on ethnic, racial and religious minorities in Russia," as well as about "the deteriorating situation of human rights defenders and difficulties faced by NGOs active in the promotion of human rights and in environmental protection and ecological issues with regard to their registration and in carrying out their activities." They are also "deeply concerned about the newly amended legislation on extremism, which could have an effect on the free flow of information and could lead the Russian authorities to further restrict the right to free expression of independent journalists and political opponents." With special regard to foreign companies and their possibilities for doing business in Russia, the Parliament "is concerned about the lack of predictability in the application of rules by authorities" there. On energy policy, the House repeats that "the principles of interdependence and transparency should be the basis" of EU-Russia cooperation, and stresses--in this area, as all others--"the importance of unity among the EU Member States in their relations with Russia."

Human rights
Human rights: Burma, Somalia, Iran
2008-06-23 - 11:05
In its three human rights resolutions adopted on Thursday in Strasbourg, the European Parliament criticises the Burmese government's treatment of its own people, voices concern at the high civilian death toll in Somalia's civil war and condemns the executions of juveniles in Iran. Burmese junta condemned
Parliament's resolution on Burma deplores the continuing oppression by the junta, the renewed house arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi, the government's actions following the recent cyclone and the ineffectiveness of EU sanctions on Burma.
The resolution condemns "the decision by the Burmese authorities to extend the house arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi" and the detention of the group of political activists demanding her release, and expresses shock at the calls in official newspapers for the public flogging of Aung San Suu Kyi.
In the wake of "reports that the Burmese army murdered political prisoners in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis", Parliament "calls for a judicial investigation under UN auspices" into these claims. It also "deplores the ongoing imprisonment by the Burmese authorities of victims of Cyclone Nargis who attempt to seek aid from international aid organisations in Burma". The government is urged to allow international humanitarian workers and supplies unhindered access to the areas affected by the cyclone and "to stop official interference in the delivery of aid and to cooperate fully with humanitarian organisations".
Call on government and ASEAN states to promote democratic change
The holding by the junta of the referendum on the constitution only days after the cyclone is criticised and its results dismissed as "lacking credibility". MEPs call on the authorities "to lift all restrictions on peaceful political activities in the country and to move towards an inclusive process of national reconciliation and restoration of democracy, the rule of law and full respect for human rights".
Given the evidence of continuing violations of human rights in the country, the resolution "urges the Burmese authorities to enter into close dialogue with the UN Special Rapporteur and to accept his request to visit Burma". It also calls on ASEAN countries "to put serious pressure on the Burmese authorities to bring about democratic change".
Tougher EU sanctions needed
Lastly, Parliament believes that the EU’s targeted sanctions against the Burmese junta are still having a limited effect on the regime, thus falling short of the objectives sought. It therefore reiterates its call on the Council "to take further steps and effectively hamper access by the junta to the EU’s financial system" and "calls on the Council and the Member States to monitor closely, and ensure the effective application of, the targeted sanctions".

Routine killing of civilians in Somalia
In a resolution on Somalia, MEPs look at the prolonged civil war and its implications for the peace and reconciliation process in the country, as well as for the security and stability of the Horn of Africa as a whole.
Since February 2007, some 856,970 Somalis have fled fighting in Mogadishu, while 2.6 million Somalis - about 35 per cent of the population - are in need of humanitarian assistance.
The EP resolution calls for a halt to the fighting and the widespread atrocities committed by all parties to the conflict, with the loss of life of many civilians, and it demands investigations into all human rights violations. It urges all sides to ensure unhindered humanitarian access and assistance to affected populations and to ensure the safety of local and international humanitarian workers.
The peace deal reached between the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia (TFG) and the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia (ARS) is welcomed, but MEPs stress the need for "a genuine reconciliation process".
They also call on the Somali Transitional Government, in collaboration with the UN and the African Union, "to use all available means to prevent, deter and suppress piracy and armed robbery committed from the Somali coast against vessels, especially those carrying humanitarian aid".
Key role for the international community
The role of the outside world will be crucial in bringing peace to this region. The EP urges that neighbouring Kenya be pressed to play a constructive role. As to the European Union, MEPs call for "all donors, and the EU in particular, to increase the provision of humanitarian assistance" and for the Commission "to ensure that EU aid is not being misappropriated".
The UN Security Council is asked "to strengthen the UN arms embargo on Somalia" and "to ensure that the embargo is fully respected by states in the region" as well as "to investigate and impose targeted sanctions on all individuals accused of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity in Somalia, including possible referral to the ICC".
The resolution backs the UN Security Council resolution, adopted on 15 May 2008, calling for the possible deployment of a 28,500-strong UN peacekeeping force but it urges that peacekeepers "be mandated to protect civilians, including women, children and internally displaced persons, and include a strong human rights component, with the capacity to monitor, investigate and report human rights violations".

Executions of juveniles in Iran
The use of the death penalty in Iran, particularly for minors, is condemned in yet another EP resolution on the deteriorating human rights situation in that country. EU states are urged not to deport to Iran any people whose lives could be in danger there.
According to the resolution, "Iran and a few other countries still execute minors, but Iran is known to have executed more juvenile offenders than any other country in the world, and according to reports more than 100 individuals are on death row in Iran for crimes allegedly committed when under the age of 18".
The EP "strongly condemns the death sentences and executions in Iran, in particular those imposed or carried out on juvenile offenders and minors". Indeed, it stresses that "juvenile death sentences are in direct contravention of the Islamic Republic of Iran’s international obligations and commitments".
Turning to individual cases, Parliament condemns the execution of Mohammad Hassanzadeh, who was under the age of 18 when executed, and urges the authorities to halt the executions of Mr Behnoud Shojaee, Mr Mohammad Fedaei, Mr Saeed Jazee, Mr Behnam Zaare and all other juvenile offenders sentenced to death.
The members of the newly elected Majlis are called upon "speedily to pass the pending reform of the Iranian penal code, with the aim, notably, of abolishing stoning and executions of child offenders, to move towards a moratorium on the death penalty and to bring Iranian legislation into line with international human rights obligations". The resolution also "calls for the decriminalisation of same-sex relations in Iran".
Lastly, Member States are urged "to suspend the expulsion to Iran of persons who are threatened with execution or torture".
