It's the world's most ambitious multilingual online TV service with programmes in over 20 EU languages on the people, the debates, the big issues, the latest news, life behind the scenes and with special programmes for young people.
From 17 September, anyone with broadband internet access can see more of the Parliament through constantly updated programmes and live coverage. The "father" of the EuroparlTV project, EP Vice President for Information and Communication Policy Alejo Vidal-Quadras explains more about what some have dubbed Europe's C-Span. He says EuroparlTV will bridge the communication gap between the EU institutions and citizens.
Is this channel aimed at the general public?
"We are not launching a general TV channel with films, documentaries, reality shows and football," it's for those affected by or interested in EP decisions said Mr Vidal-Quadras. That means those in political and government spheres, but also lobbyists, experts and students. He expects up to 20-40 million viewers (the sort of audience UK TV soap Eastenders gets on a good night) for hot debates that directly affect Europeans, for example debates on roaming or Georgia or a speech by one of the celebrities who regularly visit the Parliament.
Mr Vidal-Quadras sees most people tuning into "Your Voice", which will feature user-generated content, general interest programmes and where the public will have a say.
Aim to improve understanding
How does Mr Vidal-Quadras react to sceptics who fear that EuroparlTV might undermine independent coverage of Parliament or operate as a propaganda tool? He acknowledges that there were doubters in Parliament, but said that as MEPs have come to understand the project, the voices have mainly died down.
EuroparlTV is based on freedom of opinion and expression and will cover open debates featuring different political opinions, so far from reducing independent coverage of Parliament, it should give journalists and citizens fresh opportunities to see and understand what is happening, he added.
Launched Wednesday 17 September
EuroparlTV was officially launched on Wednesday by EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering. Greek Socialist Katerina Batzeli, who worked on the project was at the launch with Mr Vidal-Quadras, along with journalists and bloggers. Click below to find out more and to watch.
