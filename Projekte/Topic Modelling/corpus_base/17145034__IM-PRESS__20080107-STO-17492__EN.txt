Georgia's President Mikhail Saakashvili
The recent election in Georgia saw incumbent president Mikhail Saakashvili returned to office. However, turmoil ahead of the poll and opposition demonstrations had raised fears over the stability of the country. A team of 7 MEPs were in Georgia for the 5 January poll. They reported that the election met international standards. We spoke to delegation leader, French Green Marie Anne Isler Béguin.
As chair of the European Parliament's observer mission in Georgia, how would you characterize the presidential elections on January 5?
The procedures in place were in line with international standards, although they were far from perfect. According to the testimony of international observers, there were no major irregularities. There were some irregularities, but no systematic effort to commit deliberate fraud. But we made our report and now we want to see if the authorities and the opposition will follow the rules of democracy. I had a guarantee from the Georgian authorities that the procedures will be followed. Despite the calamitous campaign and the recent turmoil of the country, the united opposition gained 25% of the vote, a first for Georgia. It was also the first time that there was real political choice for the presidential elections and that people were able to vote freely. It is a step forward in Georgian maturity, now let's hope for maturity among the political parties as well. What are the implications of these elections for the wider region and for the European Union? The elections were a major challenge for Georgia. On the one hand, it was necessary to improve the economic and social situation of Georgia. But on the other side, Georgia is very fragile situation with two separatist regions, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The person who takes over will have the considerable responsibility of bringing stability to the Caucasus and coming to terms with Russia. The EU is very much present with technical assistance and support for economic and social reforms and so on, but when it comes to conflicts we are not policy makers, simply facilitators of dialogue. Georgia is in the process of a huge strategic shift, which includes important energy issues, so if it chooses to turn to Europe, for example by joining the Council of Europe, which is the antechamber to the EU, we must be ready to respond to this request. During his visit to the European Parliament in November 2006, Mikhail Saakashvili spoke of the accession of Georgia to the EU as a "long-term objective". What are the factors that will determine future relations between Georgia and the EU? The 3 countries of the South Caucasus (Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia) turned to the west when they came out of the Soviet empire, because they feel European, and have a European culture. So now the problem is us, because we do not know what we want to do in the EU. In contrast, they have understood: they see that EU public opinion has found it hard to come to terms with the accession of 10 countries. That is why the Georgians are more reserved now, they know they are very far from becoming candidate members.
They have made enormous sacrifices, they have put everything in place to prepare (in the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy), to achieve prosperity as in the West. They told me: "If this is not for our generation, it will be for the generation after." So I hope that the EU will not leave these three countries orphaned.
