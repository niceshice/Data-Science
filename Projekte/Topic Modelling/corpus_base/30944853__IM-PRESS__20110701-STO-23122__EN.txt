LUX Prize embodies EP commitment to culture, cinema
The LUX Prize was established in 2007 as a tangible symbol of the Parliament’s commitment to European cinema and its creative endeavours. It is awarded annually based on voting by MEPs .
The films cover a range of issues - individual, historical and social - but they all look into the lives of Europeans, their convictions and doubts, their quest for identity. Previous winners were "Auf der anderen Seite" in 2007, "Le silence de Lorna" in 2008 and "Welcome" in 2009.
The winner will receive financial support from the Parliament to subtitle the film into the 23 European Union official languages, including an adaptation for visually or hearing-impaired people and to produce a 35 mm print or a digital cinema package for each member state.
