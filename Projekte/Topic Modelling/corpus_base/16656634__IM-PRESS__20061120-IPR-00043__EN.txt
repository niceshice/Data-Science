The budgetary conciliation meeting held on 21 November ended in stalemate. No global agreement could be found at this stage on the 2007 budget. The Parliament and Council delegations decided to suspend talks, as differences persisted over the method of cooperation between Council and Parliament as regards Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) actions.
In its first reading, Parliament had cut appropriations for CFSP actions by 50%, using the money thus freed to finance other lines under Heading 4, "the EU as a global partner". The EP reaffirmed its desire to be informed proactively on CFSP actions, as agreed with Council in a November 2002 joint declaration . This reaffirmation reflected the EP's concern that the Council has not adequately explained the rationale for the forthcoming CFSP mission in Kosovo, notably in view of the significant costs that it is likely to entail. Shortly after the negotiations were adjourned, Budgets Committee chair Janusz Lewandowski (EPP-ED, PL) underlined the need to "make the utmost efforts to strike a deal in the coming weeks". Given that t he 12-hour negotiation failed to deliver a global deal on the 2007 budget, other items on the agenda also await final agreement : the level of payment appropriations for 2007, staff needs, as well as a broad agreement on the Financial Regulation of the European Communities.
Negotiations will resume on 28 November. Parliament's second reading of the 2007 Budget is still expected to take place on 14 December.
