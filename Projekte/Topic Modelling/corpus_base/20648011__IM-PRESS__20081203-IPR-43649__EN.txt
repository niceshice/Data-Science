As part of a series of measures to help prevent VAT fraud, Parliament is backing a plan to accelerate the collection and exchange of data on intra-Community transactions, by having companies make monthly electronic statements of their data, as opposed to quarterly statements, often on paper, and imposing a one-month, rather than three month, deadline on Member States to share this information.
Parliament adopted on two reports from José-Manuel Garcia Margallo (EPP-ED, ES) covering different aspects of the proposals. While supporting the changes, MEPs adopted amendments to clarify some procedural aspects, and ensure Member States publicise and share best practice.
They reports also make clear that the Commission should review the administrative burden of these arrangements after two years.
As usual with taxation policy, Parliament’s role is consultative and if the changes are to be adopted there will need to be unanimity in the Council.
