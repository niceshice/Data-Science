58% of all dangerous goods travel by road
Next time you are on a motorway or at a large railway station have a look at the amount of frieght on the move. The sheer amount is impressive - a sign of free moving trade creating jobs you might tell yourself. However, 8% of all freight is in fact dangerous goods such as fuel and gases. At present a patchwork of rules covers safety measures. A report debated by MEPs on Tuesday supports a European Commission plan to draw them all together into a single piece of EU law.
Some of the goods carried around Europe each year include flammable liquids, gases and corrosive substances such as sulphuric acid. The list can also include infectious diseases and radioactive material although these are moved in lower quantities. Each year it is estimated that 110 billion tonnes is transported around the EU. Of this 58% is by road, 25% by rail and 17% by inland waterways.
Rapporteur wants 6 current rules merged
The risk of the cargo being in a collision and a subsequent spillage are real and present dangers. In 2005 there were 74 accidents involving rail travel, with 31 resulting in spillages. In Spain in 1978 214 people were killed when a lorry carrying gas was involved in a collision and exploded.
Parliament's rapporteur on the subject Boguslaw Liberadzki is worried about the danger this traffic poses to the public. Ahead of the debate, the Polish Socialist MEP pointed out that people can be at risk if the proper means of transport are not used and if training for operators and drivers is not to the highest levels.
His report on dangerous goods - (which is at the 1st reading stage of a proposed Parliament and Council directive) - was backed by Parliament's Transport Committee in August. It calls for the existing 4 EU directives and 2 decisions that cover this area to be merged and simplified. It also wants the rules to be extended to inland waterways which lie outside current rules. The measures would bring EU law up to current international rules.
New rules under UN umbrella
Mr Liberadzki said the "target of the proposed directive is to limit the risks of transport of dangerous goods for possible negative impacts on the environment. It is not an extra law and regulation, but a unification of several binding Conventions under the umbrella of the UN".
However, the report is careful to state that each of the 27 EU members should continue to preserve the right to regulate or prohibit the transport of dangerous goods across its territory for reasons such as national security or environmental protection. It also says that countries can have more stringent rules if they wish. In the Netherlands for example, drivers who transport dangerous goods must have special training.
The rapporteur is realistic about what can be achived. "This will not eliminate risks but will limit risks." The House votes on the report on Wednesday.
