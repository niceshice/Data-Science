Saving the food aid scheme for deprived EU citizens
2012-02-09 - 14:22
Parliament is set to save the food aid scheme for needy EU citizens. If on Wednesday MEPs endorse a compromise reached with the Council, the scheme will run until the end of 2013, with an annual budget ceiling of €500 million. The scheme for distributing free food to the EU's most deprived citizens, set up in 1987 under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), was threatened when the EU Court of Justice ruled in April 2011 that the scheme could no longer purchase food supplies on the open market and must rely solely on food from (shrinking) intervention stocks.
To avoid a sharp cutback in food aid at a time when the number of needy EU citizens is rising, Parliament called in a July 2011 resolution for a solution to save the scheme.
A proposed update of the regulation to this end was blocked in the Council until November 2011, when Germany agreed to back its continuation, with proper funding, until the end of 2013.
The scheme now provides food aid for 18 million people living in poverty in 20 EU Member States.

Budgets in order but more effort needed on growth and employment
2012-02-09 - 14:22
To achieve deeper economic coordination, Member States will need to act decisively on reform recommendations, and be seen to do so, says Parliament's response to the Commission's annual growth survey and employment guidelines. The three resolutions to be voted on Wednesday also call for more effort on growth, employment and poverty. MEPs will also discuss growth and employment in the services sector during Commission question time on Tuesday morning.
The annual growth survey resolution says banks should be made to lend more to the real economy and calls for legislative proposals on bank crisis management before the summer.
It also asks the Commission to shed more light on what Member States are doing and not doing to implement the reform recommendations they receive.
Employment and social aspects
All the resolutions say that budgetary, growth and employment measures must be taken together. The one dealing with social and employment issues calls on the European Council to ensure that fiscal consolidation does not increase poverty or hamper efforts to tackle unemployment.
MEPs also say that Member States' commitments set out in the national reform programmes are insufficient to achieve the Europe 2020 targets for employment, education and poverty reduction.

Redirecting EU funds to help create jobs for young people
2012-02-09 - 14:22
On Monday MEPs will quiz the Commission on its plan to use up to €82 billion in EU structural funds not yet allocated to specific projects to help small firms and combat youth unemployment. MEPs will ask how the Commission arrived at the figure of €82 billion, how it plans to redirect structural funds for 2012 and 2013 that have not yet been allocated in a legally binding way and how it plans to deal with Member States unwilling to shift money within the funds.
They will also ask about the impact of increasing the share of regional development project costs paid by the EU, as agreed by Parliament last December, on the take-up of EU funds by countries hardest hit by the crisis.

What next for Eurobonds?
2012-02-09 - 14:22
On Tuesday MEPs will quiz the Commission on the progress of its green paper on Eurobonds and replies so far. Eurobonds could become a source of stability for the Eurozone in the medium term, but other instruments are needed to meet its short-term needs, says the draft resolution to be voted on Wednesday. The draft resolution calls on the Commission rapidly to propose ways to tackle the current crisis, including a European debt redemption pact, and stresses the need to manage sovereign debt issuance jointly.
The prerequisites for Eurobonds are to reduce potential moral hazard, make the system attractive for countries with the highest credit ratings as well as heavily indebted ones, increase competitiveness, and introduce enforceable debt reduction systems, along with stronger fiscal coordination.

Boosting dairy farmers' bargaining power
2012-02-09 - 14:22
Boosting dairy farmers' bargaining power to ensure they get fair prices for raw milk and helping them prepare for the end of milk quotas in 2015 are the key aims of draft legislation to be debated on Tuesday and voted on Wednesday. The new rules, already provisionally agreed with the Council, would enable producers' organisations to negotiate raw milk prices for farmers they represent, introduce a supply management regime for certain geographically-protected quality cheeses and give Member States additional tools to protect dairy farmers.

Fisheries policy: Parliament wants its say
2012-02-09 - 14:22
On Tuesday MEPs will ask the Commission and Council how they plan to resolve deadlock among Member States over long-term management plans for western Atlantic horse mackerel and Bay of Biscay anchovy stocks. These plans were approved by Parliament in 2010, but have yet to be put into practice. MEPs will also ask the Commission and the Council why they decided on technical measures governing the 2012 fishing effort in EU waters, such as permitted gear and restricted fishing areas and periods, without properly consulting Parliament, as required by the treaties.
Finally, MEPs will ask how the Commission and the Council plan to ensure that the common fisheries policy takes account of public goods provided by the fishing industry, such as creating jobs for coastal communities and sustaining their traditional cultures.
Procedure: oral questions to Council and Commission

Should the EU open its markets wider for Morocco?
2012-02-09 - 14:22
MEPs will have their final say Thursday on whether to make it easier for Morocco to sell its farm and fisheries products in the EU. The draft deal would immediately liberalize trade for 45% of EU exports to Morocco and 55% of EU imports from Morocco. Rapporteur José Bové (Greens/EFA, FR), who opposes the deal, says it would make it harder for southern European farmers to compete and, contrary to its stated aims, harm Morocco's environmental, social and political sustainability.
On the same day, Parliament also votes on another proposal that could mark another step forward in EU-Morocco relations — a recommendation by Annemie Neyts-Uyttebroeck (ALDE, BE), to enable Morocco to take part in some EU programmes and lay down general principles for its participation.

Eliminating hidden bank charges on cross-border payments
2012-02-09 - 14:22
Hidden bank charges on cross-border payments should be eliminated by new EU rules to be voted on Tuesday. Ensuring that banks compete fairly to supply these services, and accelerating their delivery, could save up to €123 billion within six years for clients, banks, and businesses. Banks must ensure that their payment schemes (credit transfers and direct debits) comply with the Single Euro Payment Area (SEPA) Regulation by 1 February 2014.
Procedure: ordinary legislative procedure, 1st reading agreement
Debate: Monday 13 February
Vote: Tuesday 14 February
Press conference: Tuesday 14 February at 15.30h

Bank deposit guarantee schemes: MEPs aim to break deadlock
2012-02-09 - 14:22
Struggling banks must be made to hand back a portion of a depositor's money within five working days of his request, says a draft resolution to be voted on Thursday. The draft rejects the Member States' argument that deposit guarantee pots should be filled only after separate legislation on bank crisis management is finalised, on the grounds that this could push the deadline for funding guarantee schemes too far into the future. As Parliament's talks with Member States on legislation for a stronger deposit guarantee system have stalled, MEPs are likely to vote to move to a second reading, so as to set the procedural clock ticking and thus build pressure to reach a deal.
The draft says the rule that depositors must be able to obtain €5,000 within five working days should take effect by 2017, riskier banks must contribute more to deposit guarantee funds than stable ones, and deposit guarantee funds must reach their target fund level within 15 years of the legislation's entry into force.

Ensuring blind people's access to books
2012-02-09 - 14:22
MEPs will ask the Commission about adopting a legally-binding international treaty to make it legal for visually-impaired people and specialist bodies to create accessible copies of published works. The Commission would prefer stakeholder agreements within the EU and a voluntary recommendation at international level, but the European blind community deems both these ideas insufficient. Only 5% of books are currently accessible to the blind in richer countries, and fewer than 1% in poorer ones. A May 2011 European Parliament resolution called on the Commission to work "actively and positively within the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) to agree on a "binding legal norm", based on a treaty proposal drafted by the World Blind Union and tabled at WIPO in 2009.
Procedure: oral question with debate and resolution
Debate: Wednesday 15 February
Vote: Thursday 16 February Oral question by the Petitions Committee on blind persons' access to books Resolution on "unlocking the potential of cultural and creative industries" - 12.05.2011
