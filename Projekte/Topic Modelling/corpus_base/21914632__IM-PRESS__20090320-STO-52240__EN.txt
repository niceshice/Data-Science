A picture of a jerry can, a battery and a plant The costs of fossil fuels are increasing and global warming is accelerating. With oil reserves shrinking and the environment becoming more polluted, Europe is looking away from fossil fuels and towards things such as biofuels, electricity or hydrogen. Recently, the MEPs maintained the 2020 target for renewables to account for at least 10% of energy use in road transport. Is this feasible? Is it enough, both for the environment and for your pockets? Have a say by voting in the June elections!
More renewable fuel in transport
In December 2008, MEPs decided as part of the EU's climate change package, that by 2020, 10% of fuel used in road transport should be from renewable sources. "Second-generation" biofuels and renewable electricity consumed by electric cars will be better promoted as new, more sustainable alternatives.
Biofuels: for or against
Biofuels are increasingly used in Europe in cars.
The advantages are:
domestic biofuel production could reduce dependency on foreign imported oil
less pollution, as biofuels emit a smaller amount of CO2
The disadvantages are:
possible food shortages, as land is used for fuel not food
intensive cultures for biofuels may add to the release of nitrous oxide - a potent greenhouse gas
clearing land for cultures of plants for biofuels lead to deforestation and destruction of biodiversity
cause food prices to rise
Last year, as EU leaders set a target of 10% of transport fuel to be provided by biofuels by 2020, the MEPs asked for an urgent review of EU biofuels policy, underlining that that developing and implementing biofuel strategies should safeguard against any negative environmental, social and economic impact.
Hydrogen cars need hydrogen filling stations
Hydrogen is considered as a clean way of powering vehicles as it doesn't emit greenhouse gases. But hydrogen power can be more or less clean depending on the source from which the hydrogen is obtained.
Last Autumn the EP adopted a report that called for the hydrogen fuel to be produced in a sustainable manner as far as possible from renewable energies. The MEPs also highlighted in the report the necessity for a hydrogen filling station network to be established so the introduction of the hydrogen-powered vehicles can be successful.
Carbon-free cars for a healthier environment
In December 2008, EP adopted, within the EU's climate change package, emission performance standards for new passenger cars. MEPs agreed on a target of 120g of CO2/km for the whole car industry by 2012, compared to the current levels of 160g/km. Manufacturers will have to pay fines if they produce cars that emit more CO2.
The reduction in emissions should be achieved through more efficient engines, improvements in tyres, minimum efficiency requirements for air conditioning systems and more fuel-efficient driving. Moreover, the design and development research into more efficient cars could create more jobs and improve the global market position of European carmakers.
Much has been done, but much remains to be done. More choices will need to be made. The European Parliament elections offer you your chance to help set the direction of European policies. What do you want your MEPs to do? What laws and action do you want to see at the European level? Have your say!
Cars in Europe
220 million cars on Europe's roads
Cars account for 12% of the EU emissions of CO2
Average levels of CO2 emissions per car are 160g per kilometre
