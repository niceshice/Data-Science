Tajani pledges support for small and medium size business
Antonio Tajani faced three hours of questions from the Industry, Research and Energy Committee in Strasbourg Monday evening.
He told MEPs that the relaunch of industry in Europe should be done within the framework of the Commission's "2020" jobs and growth strategy (the successor to the Lisbon strategy).
Turning to small and medium size businesses across Europe he said he would push for the implementation of the "SME Business Act" and guarantee that 30 billion euro allocated by the European Investment Bank "will really go to SMEs". He also promised to act to cut red tape.
Referring to the relationship between industry and environment Mr Tajani called for a "mutually convenient marriage" between the two for a more sustainable growth: "The fight against climate change is a economic and ethical task" he told MEPs. He pointed out that the EU's rule for environmental and social standards are stricter than many others.
Mr Tajani also called for a focus on implementation of the REACH chemical safety legislation in line with the deadline of 2012, enhancing women's entrepreneurship and supporting innovation.
Maroš Šefčovič: citizens' initiative a priority
Speaking to the Constitutional Affairs Committee former Slovak diplomat Maroš Šefčovič outlined his priorities for the post of inter-institutional relations and administration. He said that implementation of the Lisbon treaty, the creation of the citizens initiative, better cooperation between EU institutions and increased transparency were his imperatives.
Taking questions from MEPs Mr Šefčovič on how the citizens' initiative (where 1 million people can call for a change in EU law) and would work in practice he said his department aim to present plans in spring so that people could start using it by December this year.
He was also asked about his position on whether he would support dropping European Parliament sessions in Strasbourg and keeping them in Brussels. Šefčovič replied that the role of the Commission is "guardian of the EU treaties" and at present the treaties say the seat of the parliament is Strasbourg.
He was also challenged on alleged remarks he had make in 2005 saying that Roma were "exploiters of the Slovak welfare system". Mr Šefčovič did not remember the exact quote and said it had been taken out of context: "I did not mean to offend anybody. If I caused offence, I really regret it." He went on to point to the work he had done with the Roma community and NGO's since that time.
Asked about reform to voting for the European Parliament he said that he supported transnational lists and 2-day elections in May instead of four days in June as is the practice now.
