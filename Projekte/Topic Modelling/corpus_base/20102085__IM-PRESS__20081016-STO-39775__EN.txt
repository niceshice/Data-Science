The pen is mightier than the sword. Cartoonist Ali Dilem "Defend the defenders" "60 years of marriage. I'll read you the Declaration" "Africans speak - better to talk about torture than under torture" "Human Rights - we're hungry!" The cartoons were projected at the conference "Human Rights - put that down, I think you're getting on someone's nerves!" "A journalist? Where?" "So, to sum up, we've got work to do!" Cartoonists Ali Dilem and Plantu cast their eye over proceedings Human rights need more than declarations, they also require people like community activists, journalists, lawyers and trade unionists to defend them. On 8-9 October human rights activists were centre stage as parliament hosted an international conference: "Defenders take the floor" to hear about these experiences.
As well as debates, the conference featured illustrations on human rights issues from Jean Plantu, a French cartoonist famous for sketches in France's "Le Monde" newspaper. Also present was Algerian cartoonist Ali Dilem who has faced jailed and heavy fines in his native country for drawing attention to abuses of human rights. This slideshow takes you into the issues through the sketches of both men. Those who make UN "declaration a reality"
In the words of UN special representative on human rights Margaret Sekaggya the aim of the conference was to honour those who "in their daily work make the declaration a reality".
Organised as part of the celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it brought together representatives from the EU and the UN.
Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering described the 1948 Declaration as "a major victory of our civilisation". The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navanethem Pillay, stressed the role women's rights activists and those who advocate migrants' rights.
Europe's Justice Commissioner Jacques Barrot said the EU would spend €16 million to help human rights activists over the next two years.
