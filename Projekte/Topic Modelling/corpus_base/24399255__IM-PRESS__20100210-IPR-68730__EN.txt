MEPs are deeply concerned about the long-standing and growing presence of al-Qaeda, and the deteriorating security, social and economic problems in Yemen, which they think could destabilise neighbouring countries.
In a resolution approved by show of hands on Wednesday, Parliament called for an international drive to prevent the current crisis escalating, and to help build a unified, stable and democratic Yemen.
MEPs wanted to see an immediate ceasefire and a halt to violence in the country, and called on the Yemeni authorities to step up their efforts to ensure the release of six European hostages being held on its territory.
Parliament urged the Yemeni government to reinforce its political and economic reform process, and stressed that counter-terrorism measures must not be misused against political opponents. Elections should be held in 2011, says the resolution.
MEPs want the EU to assist the US and Yemen "in repatriating or resettling Yemenis held without charge at Guantanamo, including the 40 Yemenis that the US Administration had already cleared for release".
Finally, MEPs insisted that the EU should help to improve Yemen's security and political situation and implement a special assistance programme for the country.
