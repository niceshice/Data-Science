The Foreign Affairs Committee selected a shortlist of three candidates for this year's Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. The three selected candidates are (in alphabetical order): Hauwa IBRAHIM, a female Nigerian lawyer who defends women accused of adultery and young people convicted under Sharia law; Ladies in White, a group of women who fight for the rights of political prisoners in Cuba; and Reporters without Borders.
The Conference of Presidents will select the winner on 27 October and the prize will then be awarded at a ceremony at Parliament's December plenary session.
The European Parliament has each year since 1988 awarded the Sakharov Prize to individuals or organisations who have made an important contribution to the fight for human rights in their country. Named in honour of the Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov, the prize gives recognition to people who have fought against oppression and injustice. The prize money for the award is € 50,000.
