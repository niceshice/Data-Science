Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs
In June 2006 media reports revealed the existence of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program, put in place by the US administration, whcih has allowed US authorities to access all the financial data stored by SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications. The information stored by SWIFT to whcih the US authorities have had access, acting in the name of the fight against terrorism, potentially concerns hundreds of thousands of EU citizens. It has been reported that some central banks knew of this programme and have been kept informed by SWIFT. Parliament adopted a resolution on the issue in July. This included a call for a hearing to be held, with the aim of ascertaining the legal framework for this data transfer under US, EU and Member States' laws and to find out what information different bodies may have had at various times. This would be a first step in assessing whether data protection rules have been complied with and whether there may be some gaps in those rules.
Participants include:
Blanche Couteaux (General Counsel) and Francis Venbever (Chief Financial Officer) of SWIFT Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank
Peter Praet, Director of the National Bank of Belgium, with Joseph de Wolf (Head of Legal Department) and Johan Pissens (Head of Oversight Department)

In Dublin MEPs are due to meet Irish Equitable Life policyholders, Enterprise Minister Michéal MARTIN (tbc), financial services regulators and others. The inquiry was set up after the EP received two petitions from Equitable Life policyholders alleging that the UK regulatory authorities had failed to supervise the company adequately as required by EU insurance directives. British Liberal MEP Diana WALLIS (ALDE, UK), who is drafting the committee's report, has said "The starting point for this report has been a disastrous personal event for thousands of EU citizens: the loss of their pension investments."
