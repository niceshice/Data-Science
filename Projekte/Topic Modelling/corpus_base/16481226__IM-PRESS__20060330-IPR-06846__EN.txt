MEPs voted to approve the use of the so-called urgency procedure for a Commission proposal that would create a legal base for compensating farmers who have suffered from the sudden decrease in consumer demand for eggs and poultry.
The Parliament accepted the procedure unanimously. The subject will be debated on Wednesday night in Strasbourg, in the presence of Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel. The deadline for tabling amendments to the proposal is set for 10 am on Wednesday, with the final vote taking place on Thursday.
With the recent spread of avian influenza throughout the European Union, consumer demand for eggs and poultry meat has declined sharply. In some countries, (such as Italy), this decrease has reached up to 70%, drastically lowering poultry farmers' incomes. Currently, the Commission can only offer EU aid to those farmers directly affected by bird flu, such as through compensation for culling stocks, or by paying for losses incurred due to restrictions on the circulation of products because of measures to combat the disease.
The Commission has proposed to change this regulation by allowing compensation for "serious market disturbances directly attributed to a loss in consumer confidence due to public health, or animal health risks". The proposed support measures would be co-financed by the EU at the level of 50%.
