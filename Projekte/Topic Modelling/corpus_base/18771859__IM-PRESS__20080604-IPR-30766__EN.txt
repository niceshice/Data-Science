Parliament adopted a legislative report on common rules for access to the market for coach and bus which would allow drivers of tourist coaches from 1 January 2009 to work up to 12 consecutive days under certain strict conditions. The conditions on the 12-day rule were put forward by the European Parliament after reaching agreement with the social partners. The report was adopted with 587 votes in favour 54 against and 6 abstentions.
MEPs point out that the aim of the legislation, among others, is to encourage coach tours specifically for tourists on low incomes and promote tourism in the regions there is a need to re-introduce the 12-day rule for round trips by coach.
The House saw an amendment tabled by EPP-ED, PES, and ALDE adopted, which incorporates the agreement with the social partners into the new legislation. The agreement contains a range of joint requirements that would have to be observed by any driver carrying out an occasional international transport service that involves use of the 12-day derogation. It contains a complete set of joint requirements that would have to be observed by any driver that involves use of the 12 day derogation.
Parliament make it clear that in the case of driving that takes place during the entire period from 22:00-06:00, the vehicle shall be double manned throughout or the driving period.
Parliament also says that Member States may refrain from applying the authorisation procedure to cross-border regular services not extending more than 50 km beyond the border. They should inform the Commission and neighbouring countries thereof.
On Wednesday 22 May 2008 in Strasbourg, Parliament decided to postpone the vote on this report until today in order to reach an agreement with the social partners.
Entry into force 1 January 2009
The legislation will enter into force on 1 January 2009, provided that the Council of Transport Ministers agrees with the EP proposals at its next meeting on 13 June.
