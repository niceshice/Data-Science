Financial supervision: the final vote
2010-09-16 - 17:07
Four new EU authorities as leaders in financial supervision as of January 2011 Substantial changes to the financial supervision model proposed by Council The EP first called for a revamp of financial supervision in Europe in 2000 On Wednesday in Strasbourg MEPs will be asked to approve a deal with Council on the EU's financial supervision package, which will reshape the financial regulation landscape in Europe. Three new European authorities will be set up to supervise the worlds of banking, financial markets, and insurance and pensions. A fourth body will monitor and warn of any build-up of risk in the economy.
The supervision package, designed as the overarching framework for the rest of the EU's financial regulation reform, is the fruit of tough negotiations between MEPs and Member States. The deal agreed by the two sides produced a decisive shift away from the status quo favoured by some capitals towards a new regime characterised by authorities with real power at the EU level. The MEPs at the centre of the talks argue that this is the only model able to ensure the success of a single market in financial services and at the same time provide a shield against future financial crises.

MEPs press for more flexibility on 2007-2013 budget rules
2010-09-16 - 17:07
Parliament's Budgets Committee wants the EU to have more flexible budget rules so that it can respond better to new responsibilities generated by the Lisbon Treaty such as the new External Action Service or unforeseen events like the current financial crisis. MEPs believe the existing budget rules are too rigid to allow money to be switched when priorities change.
As a result of the Lisbon Treaty, the EU has to adapt its budget rules for the period 2007-2013. But the EP Budgets Committee is dissatisfied with the Council's proposals, which it says make only a very small technical adjustment to the budget rules, are far out of line with the new realities and do not allow Parliament to play its rightful political role. The Budgets Committee is calling for changes before Parliament gives its consent to the revised financial framework, so that MEPs can fulfil their new responsibilities and ensure the EU's priorities are implemented.

Joint EU response to future gas supply crises
2010-09-16 - 17:07
Gas supply crises in Europe are expected to be better managed and disruption in household gas supplies avoided, thanks to a new law on better EU-wide co-ordination of supplies and gas interconnection plans. The legislation has been agreed by MEPs and the Council and now requires the endorsement of the full Parliament.
Under the law - which was prompted by the 2008 and 2009 Russian gas supply crises - in the event of extremely low temperatures European gas companies would be required to ensure supplies to householders in the following cases:
- extreme temperatures during a seven-day peak period;
- any period of at least 30 days of exceptionally high demand;
- at least 30 days in the event of infrastructure disruption under average winter conditions.
Preventive measures
Member States would also need to ensure that even if their biggest gas infrastructure fails, the remaining network is capable of meeting total daily gas demand on a day of "exceptionally high demand" (which, statistically, happens once every 20 years).
National authorities will have four years to comply with this supply standard but the new cross-border interconnections among EU countries will have to be in place within three years of the regulation's entry into force.
Emergency response
If, despite these preventive measures, an emergency were to happen due to a serious disruption or exceptionally high demand, the Member State concerned would activate a national emergency response. The three main crisis levels are "early warning", "alert" and "emergency". In an emergency, the plans must ensure that cross-border access to storage facilities and the flow of gas across borders are maintained.
The European Commission would be the body responsible for declaring a "Union emergency" or a regional emergency, at the request of at least two Member States who have declared national emergencies. During a Union emergency, the Commission would ensure a smooth flow of information as well as coordinating national measures and any joint action with non-EU countries.

Independence of air accident inquiries to be reinforced
2010-09-16 - 17:07
As air traffic volumes grow, accident prevention measures need to improve too. A new EU law to ensure the independence of air accident inquiries will be scrutinised by MEPs in Strasbourg. Under the legislation, which has been agreed with Council but still requires the backing of the full Parliament, safety investigations of aircraft accidents will have to be conducted free of any pressure from regulatory or judicial authorities. The law will allow the judicial authorities to access air safety investigation data only in exceptional cases, so that the people concerned could testify without any fear of being punished.
EU airlines, as well as non-EU airlines departing from an EU airport, will be obliged to produce a list of all those on board an aircraft following an accident. Thanks to an amendment by Parliament, this must be done within two hours of the accident. Their names can only be made public after the families of the passengers have been informed by the authorities and only if they do not object. Furthermore, the list of dangerous goods onboard the aircraft will have to be released by the airline immediately after the accident.
Airlines will also be required to provide passengers with the means to indicate a contact person in case of an accident. "This information may be used only in the event of an accident" and it "may not be used for commercial purposes", says the law.
Each Member State is to set up a civil aviation accident emergency plan and ensure that all its airlines have a plan to provide assistance to victims of accidents and their relatives. To enhance cooperation between Member States, a new European Network of Civil Aviation Safety Investigation Authorities will be set up, with an advisory role.

Better monitoring of medicines to ensure greater safety
2010-09-16 - 17:07
People with medical conditions are set to be better protected and informed about the use and any undesirable side effects of medicines, under an EU law that comes before Parliament for approval in Strasbourg. Under the legislation, national and European medicines web-portals will be set up to give patients more information on medicinal products and any proven side effects. The national websites will be linked to the European portal and will have to include assessments and summaries of product characteristics and patient information leaflets. The web-portals and patient information leaflets will also give information on how to report suspected adverse reactions, for example via the national portals.
New medicines or medicinal products with a new active substance which still need to undergo additional monitoring will in future be identified by a black symbol with the statement “This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring”, together with an explanatory sentence.
Single reception point for information
The database "Eudravigilance" will be the single reception point for all pharmacovigilance information coming from the pharmaceutical companies and national authorities. Besides the Member States, the Agency and the Commission, the database will be accessible to an "appropriate extent" to other pharmaceutical companies, health-care professionals and the wider public, with personal data protection being guaranteed.
This legislation has been agreed between Council and Parliament negotiators but still needs to be approved by the full Parliament in Strasbourg.

Controlling pests without risk to public health
2010-09-16 - 17:07
Call for wider ban on harmful substances Centralised approval procedure to cut red tape and delays Parliament will vote in Strasbourg on safety rules governing pest control products designed to eliminate bacteria in the water supply, slugs in the garden and other pests. The EU rules on 'biocides' (covering these products outside the field of agriculture) are being updated to strengthen health and environmental protection, while streamlining the approval process for companies to market their products.
Certain harmful substances, such as those known to cause cancer. are already banned from biocidal products in the EU. Parliament's Environment Committee is recommending that "persistent, bioaccumulative or toxic" substances should also be restricted. However, products should not be withdrawn if public health could not be safeguarded through other means.
Products treated with biocides (such as furniture sprayed with fungicide) will now also be included under the new rules. MEPs may also call for special safety checks and labelling for products that contain nanoparticles.
Parliament will give its verdict on which biocidal products should be subject to authorisation under a new, centralised EU procedure designed to increase efficiency and consistency in such decisions. MEPs will also reach a position on the fees companies should pay and the deadlines they can expect for a scientific evaluation of their products. To avoid duplication of tests on animals, companies will be required to share data in exchange for fair compensation.

Deal with Pakistan on return of illegal immigrants
2010-09-16 - 17:07
A new agreement with Pakistan on the readmission by that country of individuals illegally living in the EU will be put to a vote by MEPs on Tuesday. This contentious accord, on which Parliament has a right of veto, seeks to combat clandestine immigration by making it easier to return illegal immigrants to their country of origin.
According to EC estimates, around 13,000 Pakistani citizens were caught in an irregular residence situation in the EU up to 2008. The Commission has been negotiating with Pakistan for eight years on a readmission agreement as part of broader cooperation with that country on immigration.
The Civil Liberties Committee's recommendation, drafted by Csaba Sógor (EPP, RO), proposes that the agreement be approved. The Foreign Affairs Committee has taken the same view. Rapporteur Sógor added, however, that in applying the agreement Member States must adhere to their obligations under international law, such as the non-refoulement principle (by which refugees must not be returned to places where their lives could be threatened). Otherwise "they will be held liable for expulsions before their national courts", he said.
A minority opinion tabled by the S&D, Greens/EFA and GUE/NGL groups has been annexed to the report, calling for the rejection of the agreement, as Pakistan "does not comply with relevant human rights standards" and has not signed the 1951 Geneva Convention. It also "contains numerous loopholes and ambiguities", the signatories say.
The three groups have also tabled an oral question to the Commission on the lack of a more general evaluation of the impact of readmission agreements with third countries, especially the human rights implications.
In addition, the ALDE group has tabled an oral question asking the Commission to provide Parliament with guarantees that human rights will be respected and to ensure the transparency of the negotiations.

A European "trust mark" for e-traders
2010-09-16 - 17:07
The internet is the fastest growing channel for retail sales, yet only one in three consumers would consider shopping online from another EU country. The Internal Market Committee has set out proposals to encourage cross-border e-trading and build consumer confidence. A European "trust mark" to guarantee the reliability and quality of goods placed on the cross-border electronic market is among proposals that MEPs believe would boost confidence and thereby unlock the growth potential of this sector.

Banning imports made in Chinese labour camps
2010-09-16 - 17:07
Parliament will discuss how to stop imports into the EU of products made by prisoners in Chinese labour camps. MEPs will also ask the Commission how it intends to raise this issue in talks with China. Laogai is a system of forced labour prisons in China that has been condemned by MEPs in several reports and resolutions. Most Laogai camps, some 500 of them, are also economic undertakings with commercial company names. The Unites States has banned the products of such companies from its market. However, the EU does not yet have equivalent legislation.

Call to make EU-Turkey customs union work better
2010-09-16 - 17:07
MEPs press Ankara to apply customs union to Cyprus in full . . Trade ties between the EU and Turkey need to improve, argues a draft resolution by the International Trade Committee, which also criticises Ankara for its stance on Cyprus.
The mechanisms of the EU-Turkey customs union must be made fully functional, bureaucracy simplified and remaining tariff and non-tariff barriers removed, says the non-legislative resolution. Ankara needs to meet its obligations arising from the customs union with the EU, including with Cyprus, otherwise Turkey's EU accession process could be hampered, warn MEPs.
All unnecessary barriers to EU-Turkey trade, such as non-recognition of certification, duplicative testing, multiple inspections, technical regulations and standards should be removed, says the resolution. It also urges Turkey to avoid discriminating against foreign firms by giving a 15% price advantage to Turkish bidders for public contracts. Counterfeit products, including pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, are seen as another major problem in trade relations between the two sides.
Customs union must include Cyprus
Lastly, MEPs deplore Turkey's failure, for the fifth consecutive year, to implement the additional protocol on the application of the EC-Turkey Association Agreement to all countries, including Cyprus. They stress that failure to do so fully "may further seriously affect the negotiating process" for Turkey's EU membership bid.

Congo: human rights violations in the spotlight
2010-09-16 - 17:07
. MEPs will discuss a recent UN draft report that documents the worst human rights violations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 1993 and 2003.
The UN report - to be made public on 1 October - provides details on the years following the Rwandan genocide: the widespread attacks against ethnic Hutus by Tutsi Rwandan forces and their Congolese allies in Eastern DRC, which, if proved in a court, would amount to genocide.

Disaster prevention: "holistic approach" needed
2010-09-16 - 17:07
. Natural and man-made disasters in the EU can only be prevented with adequate funding, new laws on forestry protection, fire prevention and water scarcity, together with a balanced agriculture policy, says a draft resolution tabled by the Environment Committee.
The resolution lists prevention measures that should receive priority support from the EU, for example re-naturalising river beds, reforestation and maintaining major infrastructure such as dams, fuel pipelines and communication facilities.

No compromise on aviation emission trading
2010-09-16 - 17:07
. Efforts by the USA and others to undermine the 2008 EU law on greenhouse emission allowance trading should be resisted, according to oral questions to be debated by Parliament this week.
Under the 2008 EU law, the aviation industry will from 2012 be included in the EU greenhouse gas emission allowance trading scheme. This law also covers non-EU airlines in Europe and flights to third countries. However, the USA and other countries plan to push for an agreement at the next meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) this month, saying that any such scheme should be subject to mutual recognition.
MEPs will ask the Council and Commission to ensure that EU Member States have a joint stance at the ICAO meeting and that no compromises are accepted on this issue.
