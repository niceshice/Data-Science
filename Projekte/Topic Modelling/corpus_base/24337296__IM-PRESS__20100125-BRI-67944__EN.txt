Parliament votes on the new Commission
MEPs vote on the election of the European Commission on Tuesday afternoon. They may elect or reject the new College of Commissioners, which will hold office for the next five years. Parliament will also vote on a resolution on a new cooperation agreement between the two institutions and on resolutions by the political groups setting out their views of the Commission.
EU membership candidates: keep on reforming to stay on track
Parliament is expected to give a positive overall assessment of last year's efforts by Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to qualify for EU membership. It is also expected to underline the limited progress Turkey has made towards meeting the "Copenhagen" EU eligibility criteria, in resolutions to be debated and approved on Wednesday (10 February).
SWIFT: Parliament to vote on interim accord
Next Thursday in Strasbourg MEPs will have the final say on the provisional nine-month agreement signed by EU government ministers on the transfer of bank data to the United States for counter-terrorism purposes. A rejection by MEPs - as recommended on 4 February by the EP Civil Liberties Committee - would render the agreement legally void.
Use of body scanners for security in airports
Plans to use body scanners in airport security checks, following the December 2009 failed bomb attack on a flight to Detroit, will be debated by MEPs with the Council and Commission on Tuesday afternoon. An impact evaluation report on body scanners is to be published by the Commission in the coming weeks.
Resolutions on Haiti, Iran and Yemen
On Wednesday (10 February) Parliament will adopt resolutions on Haiti, Iran and Yemen following debates at its January plenary session in Strasbourg on developments in these countries.
Marginalised communities could get EU regional funds for housing
Poor communities could get EU regional funding in all Member States for renovation or replacement of their houses, according to a regulation to be put to the vote on Wednesday.
Gender equality: fighting domestic violence and ensuring the right to paternity leave
Parliament will debate and vote on the annual report on equality between women and men in the European Union for 2009. Gender equality should be mainstreamed into all policy areas, say MEPs, to improve the lot of women and remedy the effects of the financial, economic and social crisis on their personal lives and position in the labour market.
Resettlement of Guantánamo detainees
Since the Guantánamo Bay prison has not been closed as originally scheduled on 22 January by the US administration, MEPs, Council and the Commission will discuss possible cooperation with the US for resettling prisoners.
Preventing needle-stick injuries in the health sector
Parliament will vote on an agreement between the European social partners to prevent needle-stick injuries in hospitals, one of the most widespread and serious risks to health workers across the EU.
Copenhagen climate change summit
MEPs will vote on a resolution on the outcome of the December 2009 climate change summit in Copenhagen. In a debate on 20 January, they said the agreement reached there was weak and a huge disappointment. MEPs stressed that EU needs to do more and speak with one voice. Some also said that UN negotiating methods should be revised.
On-line gambling: restrictions may be justified
MEPs want to know how the Commission plans to respond to a recent European Court of Justice decision upholding the right of the Portuguese authorities to ban a foreign on-line gambling site, given that the Commission itself has brought infringement proceedings against many EU Member States for failing to respect the free movement of services.
Ukraine after the presidential elections
The situation in Ukraine following the second round of presidential elections on 7 February will be the subject of a debate in Strasbourg on Wednesday. Parliament will vote on a resolution at its February II plenary session (25 February).
A ban on trade in blue fin tuna and polar bears?
Parliament will vote on a resolution calling on the European Commission and EU Member States to back a ban on international trade in endangered animals or their products, such as blue fin tuna and polar bears, and to maintain an existing ban on trade in African elephants.
Situation of Opel in Europe
Following a Commission statement, MEPs will debate the situation of Opel in Europe, in particular in the light of the closure of the company's Antwerp plant, announced on 21 January. 20100125BRI67944 Draft agenda - 8-11 February 2010 EuroparlTV - watch live broadcasts from Strasbourg plenary

Parliament votes on the new Commission
2010-02-04 - 17:34
MEPs vote on the election of the European Commission on Tuesday afternoon. They may elect or reject the new College of Commissioners, which will hold office for the next five years. Parliament will also vote on a resolution on a new cooperation agreement between the two institutions and on resolutions by the political groups setting out their views of the Commission. The vote on the election of the Commission is a single vote on the whole College of Commissioners. It is a roll call vote and the election or rejection is by a simple majority of the votes cast. If Parliament approves the Commission, the European Council will still need to appoint the Commission by qualified majority. This may happen, using a written procedure, on the day of the parliamentary vote. In that case, the new Commission could take office on 10 February.
The five-year mandate of the current Barroso I Commission - which was voted into office in November 2004 by 449 votes to 149, with 82 abstentions - ended on 31 October 2009 but it has since continued in a caretaker role. Commission President-elect José Manuel Barroso will now present his new College of Commissioners and their programme to the Parliament and this will be followed by a debate with MEPs.
MEPs will also vote on a resolution on the new Framework Agreement outlining the forms of cooperation between the two institutions. This agreement, which is updated every five years, defines the political responsibilities of each institution towards the other and lays down rules on the flow of information between them. It also aims to improve the planning and coordination of the legislative procedures of the two institutions.
In addition, the EP political group leaders will present the viewpoints of their groups concerning the Commission's programme and its priorities for the next five years. The House will then vote on resolutions by the political groups summing up these positions.

EU membership candidates: keep on reforming to stay on track
2010-02-04 - 17:34
Parliament is expected to give a positive overall assessment of last year's efforts by Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to qualify for EU membership. It is also expected to underline the limited progress Turkey has made towards meeting the "Copenhagen" EU eligibility criteria, in resolutions to be debated and approved on Wednesday. Issues such as the rule of law, freedom of expression, good neighbourly relations, treatment of ethnic minorities and the fight against corruption and organised crime must still be addressed by Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Turkey, say the draft resolutions.
Croatia
Accession negotiations with Croatia can be concluded in 2010 and Croatia's successful accession would give "positive impetus" to the process of integrating the rest of the Western Balkans region within Europe, says the text drafted by Hannes Swoboda (S&D, AT). MEPs are nonetheless concerned that public support for membership is diminishing in Croatia and say the Council should decide "as soon as possible" to open the "Judiciary and Fundamental Rights" chapter of the negotiations. Out of the 35 chapters, 28 have been started and 17 have been provisionally completed.
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
Foreign Affairs Committee MEPs, who expect negotiations with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia "to begin in the near future", ask the Council to confirm, at its March 2010 summit, that it accepts the Commission's recommendation to open negotiations. They back the Greek government's suggestion of a "symbolic and motivational target date of 2014", for the EU accession of Western Balkans countries, says the resolution by Zoran Thaler (S&D, SL).
Turkey
Progress on reforms remained limited in 2009, says the resolution drafted by Ria Oomen-Ruijten (EPP, NL). MEPs also deplore the non-implementation of the Additional Protocol to the EC-Turkey Association Agreement for the "fourth consecutive year". Failure to open its ports and airports to Cyprus "may seriously affect the process of negotiations", they warn. The Turkish Government should contribute "in concrete terms" to the comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus issue. By starting the withdrawal of its forces from the northern part of the island and addressing the issue of settlements of Turkish citizens, Turkey would help "facilitate a suitable climate for negotiations", say MEPs.
Finally, MEPs regret the Constitutional Court's decisions to close the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP), and to annul the legislation limiting the jurisdiction of military courts. They say these are "a serious setback in Turkey's reform efforts" and therefore ask that the Constitution be reformed.

SWIFT: Parliament to vote on interim accord
2010-02-04 - 17:34
Next Thursday in Strasbourg MEPs will have the final say on the provisional nine-month agreement signed by EU government ministers on the transfer of bank data to the United States for counter-terrorism purposes. A rejection by MEPs - as recommended on 4 February by the EP Civil Liberties Committee - would render the agreement legally void. The interim agreement, which entered into force on 1 February, is regarded as controversial in Parliament on privacy grounds. Many MEPs have also questioned whether it is necessary or proportionate, since other legal instruments allow data to be exchanged with the United States.
If the full Parliament backs the recommendation of the Civil Liberties Committee drafted by Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert (ALDE, NL), it will be making use for the first time of a new power conferred upon it by the Lisbon Treaty to veto international agreements. Procedure: Consent

Use of body scanners for security in airports
2010-02-04 - 17:34
Plans to use body scanners in airport security checks, following the December 2009 failed bomb attack on a flight to Detroit, will be debated by MEPs with the Council and Commission on Tuesday afternoon. An impact evaluation report on body scanners is to be published by the Commission in the coming weeks. The study, requested by Parliament in a resolution of 23 October 2008, is to evaluate the devices for effectiveness, impact on health and fundamental rights.

Resolutions on Haiti, Iran and Yemen
2010-02-04 - 17:34
On Wednesday Parliament will adopt resolutions on Haiti, Iran and Yemen following debates at its January plenary session in Strasbourg on developments in these countries. Haiti
In January's plenary debate, MEPs urged the EU to deliver on its aid pledges as soon as possible and to help reconstruction efforts in the long run. They also called for better co-ordination and visibility of EU efforts on the ground. Some even suggested creating a European Civil Protection Force. In a later debate with Commissioner Karel de Gucht, Development Committee MEPs said the big challenges now were the Haitian government's lack of co-ordination capacity, logistical bottlenecks (restricted landing and unloading capacity at Port-au-Prince airport) and sheltering homeless people, especially during the coming rainy season.
Iran
MEPs will vote on a resolution on Iran, dealing with the protests that followed the June 2009 presidential election, Tehran's uranium enrichment programme and Iran's cancellation of an EP delegation visit to Tehran, which was to have taken place early in January.
Yemen
Yemen's deteriorating economic and security conditions and the rise of Al-Qaeda are highlighted in various draft resolutions being put together by Parliament's political groups. Parliament is likely to call for an immediate ceasefire, measures to prevent the escalation of conflict and for free elections to be held in 2011. MEPs will also demand the release of six European hostages being held in Yemen. Debate: 19.01.2010
Vote: 10.02.2010 Committee press release: "Commissioner De Gucht briefs MEPs on Haiti", 25.01.2010 EU fact sheet on Haiti Watch the debate on Haiti, Iran and Yemen - Strasbourg, 19.01.2010 Foreign Affairs Council Conclusions on Haiti, Yemen and Iran, 25.01.2010 Council conclusions on Yemen, 27.01.2010 EU relations with Yemen EU relations with Iran Press release on cancellation of EP visit to Tehran, 4.01.2010

Marginalised communities could get EU regional funds for housing
2010-02-04 - 17:34
Poor communities could get EU regional funding in all Member States for renovation or replacement of their houses, according to a regulation to be put to the vote on Wednesday. Until now only urban housing improvements in the 12 countries that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007 were eligible for European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) money. The approval of the amended regulation, the text of which has already been agreed between Parliament and Council, would entitle all 27 Member States to use the ERDF funds, in addition to other sources, to renovate the existing houses of their marginalised communities or to replace them with new ones, irrespective of where they are located (i.e. whether urban or rural areas).
The law will focus on all "marginalised communities", among them the Roma, which is currently the largest poverty-affected social group in Europe. Last year the EU amended the Regional Development Funds regulation to allow it to finance energy-efficiency measures in housing.

Gender equality: fighting domestic violence and ensuring the right to paternity leave
2010-02-04 - 17:34
Parliament will debate and vote on the annual report on equality between women and men in the European Union for 2009. Gender equality should be mainstreamed into all policy areas, say MEPs, to improve the lot of women and remedy the effects of the financial, economic and social crisis on their personal lives and position in the labour market. "Binding targets" are needed to ensure equal representation of women and men in in corporate, administrative and political positions of responsibility, says the draft report by the Women's Rights Committee, which adds that combating violence against women, a Spanish Presidency priority, is a prerequisite for equality.
The committee's draft report urges the European Commission to propose a revision of existing legislation on equal pay (the resolution notes that gender pay gaps averaged 14%-17% in 2009), and calls on the EU to make 22 February "International Equal Pay Day".
It also says women must have control of their sexual and reproductive rights, notably through easy access to contraception and abortion, and free of charge access to consultation on abortion.
Paternity leave should become an EU-wide entitlement, it adds. Procedure: own-initiative

Resettlement of Guantánamo detainees
2010-02-04 - 17:34
Since the Guantánamo Bay prison has not been closed as originally scheduled on 22 January by the US administration, MEPs, Council and the Commission will discuss possible cooperation with the US for resettling prisoners. After requests from the US, seven EU Member States have accepted former prisoners from Guantánamo: France, Portugal, Ireland, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Italy and Hungary.
In February last year, the European Parliament adopted a resolution saying that "EU Member States bear a share of moral responsibility for detentions in Guantanamo", as an inquiry conducted by Parliament had found that EU governments had been involved in extraordinary renditions to that prison. MEPs welcomed the "big step forward" taken by US President Barack Obama when ordering the closure of the centre but pointed out then that "ambiguities persist as to the limited maintenance of rendition schemes and of secret detention facilities". This time no resolution will be adopted. Debate: 09.02.2010 Press release on the resolution adopted in February 2009

Preventing needle-stick injuries in the health sector
2010-02-04 - 17:34
Parliament will vote on an agreement between the European social partners to prevent needle-stick injuries in hospitals, one of the most widespread and serious risks to health workers across the EU. Needle-stick injuries in hospitals can result in the transmission of more than 20 life-threatening viruses, including Hepatitis B, C and HIV. In the EU, there are more than one million needle-stick injuries every year, states a resolution drafted by Elisabeth Lynne (ALDE, UK) and adopted by the Employment Committee by 44 votes to 1.
Parliament has been calling since July 2006 for legislation to protect Europe's healthcare workers from potentially dangerous infections due to injuries with needles and other sharp medical instruments.
"The framework agreement between the Commission and European social partners will represent an important contribution to the protection of health and safety of workers active in the hospital sector", states the draft resolution to be put to the vote in plenary on Wednesday. "However, Member States and social partners should be free to adopt additional measures which are more favourable to workers", it adds.

Copenhagen climate change summit
2010-02-04 - 17:34
MEPs will vote on a resolution on the outcome of the December 2009 climate change summit in Copenhagen. In a debate on 20 January, they said the agreement reached there was weak and a huge disappointment. MEPs stressed that EU needs to do more and speak with one voice. Some also said that UN negotiating methods should be revised. On 28 January the EU lent its formal support to the Copenhagen Accord on climate change and tabled its emission reduction target commitments. It formally stated its unilateral commitment to reduce EU emissions by 20% from 1990 levels and offered to increase this cut to 30%, provided other major emitters agree to take on their fair share of a global reduction effort. Under the Accord, formal pledges by each country participating in the summit had to be made by 31 January 2010.
EU heads of state and government will assess the post-Copenhagen situation at an informal European Council on 11 February. Debate: 20.01.2010

Situation of Opel in Europe
2010-02-04 - 17:34
Following a Commission statement, MEPs will debate the situation of Opel in Europe, in particular in the light of the closure of the company's Antwerp plant, announced on 21 January. The announced closure of the Belgian factory, scheduled to take place by summer 2010, directly affects 2600 jobs. To ensure its survival, Opel is planning in the longer term to reduce its production capacity by 20% and its staff by 8300, including around 4000 in Germany.
Opel, a European subsidiary of General Motors, has its main production centres in Germany, Belgium, Spain, Poland and the UK. Commission statement - GM/Opel: current developments (without resolution)
Debate: 08.02.2010

Small business start-ups by the unemployed: deal agreed on funding
2010-02-04 - 17:34
The microfinance facility designed to help Europe's unemployed start up small businesses will be partly financed by the Progress programme and by unallocated margins in the EU budget, under a political agreement reached between MEPs and the Spanish Presidency on Thursday evening. The informal compromise negotiated by Employment and Social Affairs Committee MEPs with the Spanish Presidency still needs to be backed by the whole Parliament and the Council of Ministers.
In December, the Parliament approved the creation of a "European Progress Microfinance Facility" to make it easier for people who have lost or risk losing their jobs to get credit to start up their own businesses. MEPs agreed to make €100 million available for the facility over four years.
However, the Commission had proposed that the facility be funded from the Progress programme, which is also targeted at the most vulnerable groups, while MEPs in the Employment and Social Affairs Committee wanted fresh money.
Under the compromise, €60 million will come from the Progress programme and €40 million from unallocated margins in the EU budget. For 2010, Parliament and Council have already agreed to release €25 million from the 2010 EU budget. Procedure: first reading
Vote: 11.02.2010 Report on establishing a Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity - Progress Financing microfinance: MEP Kinga Göncz explains - Committee press release 14.12.2009 Debate in plenary 14.12.2009
