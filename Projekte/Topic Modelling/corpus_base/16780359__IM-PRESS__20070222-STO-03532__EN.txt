European football: beautiful for fans and shareholders alike
Europe must act to ensure that the "essence" of football is not hijacked by "fraudulent practices and obscure investors" according to a report MEPs will consider in their March Plenary session. It says that football cannot operate under the usual rules of market competition as football clubs need rivals of a similar level to offer fans exciting games. The role that sport in general can play in education will be discussed at a Hearing in Parliament's Culture Committee on Wednesday.
European Clubs with global appeal
The report comes as football at the highest level continues to grow in popularity and wealth. Revenue from TV deals and commercial franchises have made some of Europe's clubs hugely wealthy - Real Madrid of Spain had a turnover of 292.2 million euros in the last financial year for example. The growth in popularity of European clubs in Asia - particularly after the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea - has opened up lucrative new TV and merchandising markets for the big clubs.
This level of income allows clubs to buy the best (in terms of ability) and most commercially friendly players. This in turn increases their dominance over the smaller clubs.
500,000 football clubs in Europe
Although many of the most famous names grab the headlines, they make up just a small fraction of the 500,000 football clubs in Europe. The role that smaller clubs play in society is a key concern for UEFA - the sports governing body in Europe. As UEFA's spokesman Jonathan Hill put it: "Europeâ€™s...clubs are not factories or service providers operating in a translational market for goods and services; they are teams of athletes, linked to their community."
In line with encouraging this link to the community, UEFA has already introduced rules to ensure that clubs who play in the prestigious and lucrative "Champions League" have a minimum number of players who they trained themselves rather than bought. Playing in European competition now requires a club to have a licence - dependent on several legal and financial criteria to try and prevent fraud.
Clubs must "fulfil the social and educational role"
The report - drawn up by Ivo Belet of the European People's Party - is to be considered by MEPs in March. It supports an independent supervisory body that would monitor the financial activities of clubs. It also wants the European Commission to draw up guidelines on the amount of subsidies and (state aid) that clubs can receive. This would allow them to "know what kind of public support is acceptable and legitimate in order to fulfil the social and educational role played by football", according to the report.
Bosman ruling: changing the rules
The European Union has no specific legal or administrative competence over the rules of football; although aspects of the game and the way clubs conduct business has come before the European Court of Justice. The most famous case was the "Bosman ruling" of 1995 which concerned free movement of EU workers - a core principle of the EU.
The ruling opened up the European transfer market by making it impossible for clubs to demand transfer fees for players who had reached the end of their contracts. This effectively made them free agents.
The Judges also ruled that quotas for international players in a domestic team (you could only have 3 at one stage) were illegal. An example of how much this has changed the nature of football is that big clubs sometimes field teams that do not have any players from the country where the club is based, let alone the local area.
An ongoing case at the European Court concerns the case of Belgian club Sporting Charleroi who are in effect contesting the right of FIFA (the international governing body of football) to force clubs to make their players available for international duty. They are suing FIFA claiming 600,000 euros in reparation after one of their players was injured while playing for his country. A ruling against FIFA could have serious implications for the standard of international football.
