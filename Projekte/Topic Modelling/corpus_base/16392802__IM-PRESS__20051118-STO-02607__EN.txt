Opening port services to greater competition will be discussed this week
After spending much of last week deliberating over chemical regulation during the Plenary Session in Strasbourg, MEPs will reconvene in one of the parliament's 20 specialised committees this week in Brussels. The Civil Liberties Committee will be searching for an agreement on proposed EU legislation that would require telecoms companies to retain data on telephone and email traffic as part of the fight against terrorism.
In the Transport Committee MEPs will be considering a controversial piece of legislation relating to opening up services at Europe's ports to greater competition. After several months of debate on the Services Directive the Internal Market Committee will vote on a first reading on proposals to liberalise services in the single market. A compromise package could smooth the path of the vote on Tuesday.
The week ahead is notable for two high profile visitors to the Parliament; On Monday the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee will have one of their regular question and answer sessions with the chairman of the European Central Bank, Jean Claude Trichet, on the state of Europe's monetary policy. (You can watch this event with webstreaming on "EP live".)
Beate Winkler - head of the EU Agency charged with monitoring racism and discrimination in Europe, will meet with MEPs from both the Employment and Civil Liberties committees to discuss the problem. She will also present the final part of a report into trends and developments in this area.
The European Union's relations with other parts of the world will also be in the spotlight this week: In Edinburgh a delegation of MEPs will be participating in the joint EU-Africa, Caribbean and Pacific Parliamentary assembly which will discuss aid, trade and other issues between these regions. A series of events will also mark the 10th anniversary of the Euro-Mediterranean Process which covers political and economic cooperation between states in this region.
