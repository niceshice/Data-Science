Andrew BOREHAM BXL (+32) 2 28 42319 STR (+33) 3 881 74005 PORT (+32) 498 98 34 01 EMAIL press-en@europarl.europa.eu EU efforts to defuse the economic crisis and progress towards ending the war in Libya were highlighted by Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek at the opening of this week's plenary session in Strasbourg. Mr Buzek also marked the tenth anniversary of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, and condemned the 2 July extremist attack on the house of UK MEP Sajjad Karim.
On the economic crisis, Mr Buzek noted that further to constant exchanges among Europe's economic and political leaders over the summer, Commission President Jos√© Manuel Barroso would soon table fresh proposals, and that Euro-group President Jean-Claude Juncker would address the house later in September.
On Libya, he welcomed the prospect of an end to fighting and stressed Parliament's wish to help the people of Libya to rebuild their country
Sajjad Karim
Mr Buzek strongly condemned the 2 July attacks by a 30-strong extremist group carrying anti-Islamic placards on the house of MEP Sajjad Karim (ECR, UK). "Such threats to the freedom of speech of individual Members of Parliament are unacceptable. Mr Karim has been given a mandate in a democratic election by British citizens. Any attack on him and on his family is an attack on democracy and against his electorate", he said.
10th anniversary of 9/11
"The war against terrorism is still on", 10 years after the 11 September 2001 attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon had taken the lives of almost 3,000 innocent people from 70 nations, noted Mr Buzek.
"Success will come when we change the thinking of those who have no respect for life" he added, stressing the duty of Europe's politicians to deliver to future generations a Europe of security and peace.
Resignations and new arrivals
Mr Buzek announced the resignations of Eva-Britt Svensson (as of 1 September) and Dirk Sterckx (as of 7 September). Mr Sterckx is to be replaced by Philippe De Backer (ALDE, BE).
Luigi de Magistris, whose seat had been declared vacant, is to be replaced by Andrea Zanoni (ALDE, IT).
Mr Buzek also welcomed new members Franck Proust (EPP, FR), Dimitrios Droutsas (S&D, EL), and Tarja Cronberg (Greens/EFA, FI).
Agenda changes
It was agreed that a resolution on Libya would be put to the vote on Thursday 15 September, not at the September II session as originally planned. The change was moved by the EPP group, and approved with 131 votes in favour and 95 against.
