18.4 million people in the EU suffer serious depression every year
A strategy to fight mental health problems in Europe, ways of combining social welfare protection with economic growth and an Association Agreement between the EU and Albania were just three issues MEPs endorsed on Wednesday.
Mental Health - "defeat of stigma" should be at the heart of any policy
Parliament strongly backed a report by British Conservative MEP John Bowis calling for EU-wide legislation on mental health that would "defend the civil and fundamental rights" of sufferers and would be drawn up in partnership with them, their families, carers and NGO's. The report also backs measures to, if possible, take people out of mental institutions.
MEPs voted to widen the original definition of "key target groups" in the European Commission's Green Paper on mental health to include those with severe mental illness, long term and terminal illness, the disabled, prisoners, ethnic groups, those sleeping rough, migrants, the unemployed and those with job insecurity. The original mentioned only children, employees, older people and the disadvantaged. A gender element was also included as mental health issues can affect men and woman differently. The importance of this issue reflects the fact that 18.4 million people in the EU suffer serious depression each year with 58,000 people committing suicide.
European social model - combining economic growth and social solidarity
MEPs approved a report that spells out ways the EU can maintain its "social model" of high social standards and economic growth in the face of globalisation, demographic change and the information technology revolution. To deal with these challenges, it calls for reform of economic policies and social systems across the Union.
In particular, policies that will boost employment - specifically among woman and the young - are advocated. The importance of research and development is also highlighted. Reform should also ensure that national social systems are financially healthy to provide continued social support. An economic and social framework at a EU level should be established to allow members to implement reform at a national level.
Albania - Parliament backs closer links with EU
MEPs voted for closer economic and political ties between the EU and Albania through a "Stabilisation and Association Agreement". MEPS said that while Albania has progressed it still has a lot of work to do. Problems include the electoral system, the lack of “a stable and transparent legal environment”, corruption, low level of implementation of laws and organised crime. Some MEPs questioned the level of media freedom in the country.
