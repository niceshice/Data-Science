To mark 50 years since the birth in 1957 of what is now the EU of 27 member countries, the European Parliament has launched the Lux Prize - the European Parliament Film Prize. Each year the prize will single out a film which illustrates European values and the diversity of European cultures or contributes to the debate on European integration. The Parliament will then pay to subtitle and produce prints of the winning film in all 23 of the EU's official languages to facilitate its distribution.
The three films in competition
Three full-length films from the last twelve months are in competition for the prize. The three films are:
• Cristian Mungiu's Palme d'Or winner "4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days" from Romania;
• Fatih Akin's "The Edge of Heaven" from Germany/Turkey;
• Manoel de Oliveira's "Belle toujours," a Portuguese/French co-production.
The competing films will be screened nine times between 1-18 October 2007 in Brussels, at the European Parliament, in a specially created 90 seat cinema.
The jury: MEPs
All 785 MEPs are invited to see the competing films. Only those MEPs who have seen all three films will be eligible to vote, and the Prize will be awarded to the film which receives the largest number of votes. Subject to space, the screenings will also be open to all film enthusiasts.
The three films were chosen following a selection process by a 17-member jury appointed by the Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education and representing the cream of the EU film industry: producers, distributors, theatre directors, festival directors, critics.
The Lux Prize will be awarded by the President of the European Parliament, Hans Gert Pöttering on 24 October during the plenary session in Strasbourg. A special trophy inspired by the Tower of Babel will be presented to the winner.
