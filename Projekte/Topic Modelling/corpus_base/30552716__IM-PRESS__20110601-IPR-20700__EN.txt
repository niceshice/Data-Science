Opening this week's Strasbourg plenary session, EP President Jerzy Buzek first welcomed President Rahmon of Tajikistan, who was on an official visit to the European Parliament. He then recalled that June 4th was the 22nd anniversary of the first partially-free elections in Poland but also of the Tiananmen Square Massacre in China. Later Mr Buzek made the opening statement in a debate to commemorate the deportations carried out by the Soviet authorities from the Baltic States in 1941.
Mr Rahmon and Mr Buzek had discussed bilateral relations and the need to carry out reforms in Tajikistan, the House heard.
Turning to the two major events of June 4th 1989, Mr Buzek recalled that the authorities of the People's Republic of China had "brutally cracked down on protesters in Tiananmen Square". On the same day Poland had held the first partly free, general elections in Central and Eastern Europe. At the polls, victory had gone overwhelmingly to the democratic opposition candidates.
70th anniversary of mass deportations from the Baltic States
A short debate, with speeches by EP political group speakers, was then held to mark the 70th anniversary this month of the mass deportations by the Soviet authorities from the Baltic States, which had been occupied since 1940.
Launching the debate, President Buzek said the deportations were intended "to deprive the nations of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania of their social and political elites". It was our duty today, he stressed, "to cherish the memory" of these hundreds of thousands of victims of Soviet terror in the Baltic States. Nevertheless, added the President, the suffering of the peoples of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia had given them the determination and strength to push half a century later for independence and to return to a united Europe.
Two MEPs change groups
The President announced that David Campbell-Bannerman (UK) had left the EFD group to join the ECR group. Theodoros Skylakakis (EL) had left the EPP to join the ALDE group.
