2006-01-25 - 15:05
Election day appears to have started well, according to Edward McMillan Scott and Pasqualina Napoletano, Chairman and Vice-chair of the largest delegation of elected observers – 27 MEPs – in the West Bank and Gaza for the legislative elections.
They have made the following statement:
“As voting continues in the Palestinian elections, the first informal impressions of the European Parliament observation delegation are that – much as in last year’s presidential election – the voting process appears to be going well. The enthusiasm of the Palestinian voters is evident – if sometimes exaggerated in the presence of supporters outside polling stations.”
The EP delegation will make a formal statement at a press conference tomorrow, Thursday 26 January, at 1pm at theAmbassador Hotel, Nablus Road, Jerusalem.
