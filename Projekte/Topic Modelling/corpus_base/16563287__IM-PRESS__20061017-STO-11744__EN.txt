50th anniversary logo to be translated into all EU languages
On 25 March 2007, the European Union will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the signing of its founding Treaty of Rome. To mark the occasion, a competition was organised by the EU institutions for art students and young designers, the object being to create a logo that captures the spirit of EU cooperation and the future direction of the Union. The initiative attracted entries from more than 1700 young designers.
A jury co-chaired by EP vice-president Alejo Vidal-Quadras and Commissioner Margot Wallstrom chose the winning logo and two runners up.
"Different types of letters, characters and colours symbolise the differences in the EU, but I wanted to show in spite of that, we can coexist in harmony," said art student Szymon Skrzypczak described his winning entry.
According to Mr Vidal-Quadras "the success of this logo competition throughout Europe demonstrates that we were right to put our confidence in young people to help us design the Europe of tomorrow."
The winning logo will be translated into all EU official languages, respecting the same lettering and each language's orthography. It will be used by the European Parliament and all other EU institutions for events during 2007.
