Pesticides safety was debated by MEPs
October's Strasbourg Plenary session of the European Parliament opened with its President Hans-Gert Pöttering welcoming agreement on a new Reform Treaty. The deal expands the role of the elected body and sets the number of MEPs at 751 from 2009. Later Members debated three reports on proposed legislation on pesticides aimed at modernising protection against them. Monday also saw debates on conventional energy sources and energy technology as well as the level of CO2 emissions from cars.
Reform Treaty welcomed
President Pöttering used his opening remarks to tell MEPs that he personally considered the outcome of the Lisbon Summit extremely positive. He noted that the new Treaty would give the Parliament legislative powers equal to the Council of Ministers in many areas. He also confirmed that the Parliament would have 751 MEPs from 2009 will all having full voting rights.
Mr Pöttering announced that prior to the signing of the Treaty on 13 December the European Parliament would hold a session where the Charter of Fundamental Rights will be formally proclaimed in Strasbourg.
Pesticides - new package debated
Proposals for modernising the scrutiny of pesticides were debated on Monday. Debated was an "approval system” for new pesticides, a political strategy and a directive on their use.
The debate was closely watched by representatives of the farming, chemicals and environmentalists.
During the discussion one of the MEPs who drafted the report, German Green MEP Hiltrud Breyer said that according to opinion polls "consumers' first worries are pesticides". She went on to say that "each year in Europe more than 200.000 tons of pesticides are produced, i.e. 25% worldwide for only 4% of agricultural land".
German EPP-ED Member Christa Klass told the House that "different rules in the EU do not only mean different security standards but they are also confusing and they distort competition". The vote on pesticides (Parliament has an equal say on legislation with the Council) takes place on Tuesday 23 October.
The Portuguese Presidency of the EU hopes to get an agreement between Member States at the Agriculture Council meeting on 26 November.
Conventional energy, CO2 emissions
Later on Monday evening, Parliament debated a report on conventional energy sources and energy technology. The need to produce and use energy more safely, efficiently and sustainably across the Union is underlined in an own-initiative report proposed by Parliament's Industry Committee.
MEPs also debated a non-binding report from British Liberal MEP Chris Davies saying that CO2 emissions from cars should be capped at an average of 120g/km from 2012. Mr Davies believes the industry's voluntary commitment to reduce them is not working. About 19% of the EU's CO2 emissions come from passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. The vote takes place on Wednesday.
