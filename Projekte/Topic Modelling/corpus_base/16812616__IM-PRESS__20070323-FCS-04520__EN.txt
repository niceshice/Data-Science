Football - Europe's favourite sport
Football, the most popular sport in Europe, has evolved considerably over the past 20 years. Football is now a billion Euro business, focused primarily on a few clubs and star players. The EU has also contributed to the change in the face of football. The Parliament has just adopted two reports on the sport, giving us an excuse (if we needed one) to look more deeply into the subject.
What’s behind the showcase? Is football still a sport like others, despite the violence and corruption scandals that mar it on occasion? What has been the impact of the EU on football, and what does the Parliament propose for the future of professional football and security in stadiums? In the focus we also speak to UEFA President and French football legend Michel Platini and Real Madrid President Ramón Calderón about the current state of the game.

Football hearing told of the forgotten players
A recent hearing in "sport and education" was told of the sorry stories that can affect young men who are lured to Europe with promises of wealth and fame, only for the dream to become a nightmare. The hearing was told that this is the latest human trafficking issue that allows unscrupulous agents to take advantage of promising young men. Often failure to get a contract with a club leads to loss of a visa and residence permit, leaving people in dire straits.
FIFA - the world's governing body on football - has strict rules on the transfer of players. Under 18s are not allowed to be transferred unless their parents are with them for example. Nevertheless, with many coming from the poorest parts of Africa, the lure of large salaries and transfer fees for young players and their African clubs can prove irresistible the hearing on 28 February was told. Players can get "involved in delinquency" if they fail Jean-Claude Mbvoumin is from the NGO "Culture Foot Solidaire" and is an ex-professional footballer from Cameroun. He told the hearing that trafficking of young players "come mainly" from Africa as "African players are the cheapest in economical terms". He went on to say that "clubs buy them to resell them afterwards" and if players "don't prove to be special their contracts are not renewed". The result can be that "they get involved in delinquency" and don't want to go back home after failing. In Europe France is the "first destination for African players". Last season in the French league 48% of players were foreigners and their average age was 18,6. UEFA and FIFA are aware of this problem: Lars-Christer Olsson chief executive of UEFA the European governing body said the situation was "alarming" and that "Bringing young children from Africa and South America into Europe is a major problem, and we have to address it". He said that "proper rules and regulations on agents would help." French Socialist MEP Guy Bono has drafted a report on the issues which will be voted on by the Plenary in March. He talked of the "clandestine immigration" and that many people were bound for "training camps" in Europe. Football about people not profits In 2005 an Independent European Sport Review was initiated which called for greater cooperation between "the immigration and national labour inspection services, in particular, to examine the issuance of short term visas and related international transfer certificates to deter “trafficking” of young players”. Guy Bono would like to see that clubs ensure that young players return safely home if their career does not take off in Europe. As Jean-Claude Mbvoumin said, "football is not only about money and TV rights; there are more important things, like these young people".
European football: sport or business?
Europe must act to ensure that the "essence" of football is not hijacked by "fraudulent practices and obscure investors" according to a report MEPs will consider in their March Plenary session. It says that football cannot operate under the usual rules of market competition as football clubs need rivals of a similar level to offer fans exciting games. The role that sport in general can play in education will be discussed at a Hearing in Parliament's Culture Committee on Wednesday.
European Clubs with global appeal The report comes as football at the highest level continues to grow in popularity and wealth. Revenue from TV deals and commercial franchises have made some of Europe's clubs hugely wealthy - Real Madrid of Spain had a turnover of 292.2 million euros in the last financial year for example. The growth in popularity of European clubs in Asia - particularly after the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea - has opened up lucrative new TV and merchandising markets for the big clubs. This level of income allows clubs to buy the best (in terms of ability) and most commercially friendly players. This in turn increases their dominance over the smaller clubs. 500,000 football clubs in Europe Although many of the most famous names grab the headlines, they make up just a small fraction of the 500,000 football clubs in Europe. The role that smaller clubs play in society is a key concern for UEFA - the sports governing body in Europe. As UEFA's spokesman Jonathan Hill put it: "Europe’s...clubs are not factories or service providers operating in a translational market for goods and services; they are teams of athletes, linked to their community." In line with encouraging this link to the community, UEFA has already introduced rules to ensure that clubs who play in the prestigious and lucrative "Champions League" have a minimum number of players who they trained themselves rather than bought. Playing in European competition now requires a club to have a licence - dependent on several legal and financial criteria to try and prevent fraud. Clubs must "fulfil the social and educational role" The report - drawn up by Ivo Belet of the European People's Party - is to be considered by MEPs in March. It supports an independent supervisory body that would monitor the financial activities of clubs. It also wants the European Commission to draw up guidelines on the amount of subsidies and (state aid) that clubs can receive. This would allow them to "know what kind of public support is acceptable and legitimate in order to fulfil the social and educational role played by football", according to the report. Bosman ruling: changing the rules The European Union has no specific legal or administrative competence over the rules of football; although aspects of the game and the way clubs conduct business has come before the European Court of Justice. The most famous case was the "Bosman ruling" of 1995 which concerned free movement of EU workers - a core principle of the EU. The ruling opened up the European transfer market by making it impossible for clubs to demand transfer fees for players who had reached the end of their contracts. This effectively made them free agents. The Judges also ruled that quotas for international players in a domestic team (you could only have 3 at one stage) were illegal. An example of how much this has changed the nature of football is that big clubs sometimes field teams that do not have any players from the country where the club is based, let alone the local area. An ongoing case at the European Court concerns the case of Belgian club Sporting Charleroi who are in effect contesting the right of FIFA (the international governing body of football) to force clubs to make their players available for international duty. They are suing FIFA claiming 600,000 euros in reparation after one of their players was injured while playing for his country. A ruling against FIFA could have serious implications for the standard of international football. Parliament's Culture and Education Committee
Football: stamp out the violence
Violence at Champions League game between Inter and AC Milan, April 2005 Football - the beautiful game - but all too often marred by hooliganism and racism. Last week in Italy all football games were suspended after the death of a policeman following riots after a Catania-Palermo match. By coincidence the Parliament's Civil Liberties Committee debated a report on security at matches last week. It concerns European cooperation on the use of personal data on football supporters considered to be a "risk".
The decision in Italy to suspend matches came amid claims that only 6 of the 31 main stadiums met safety standards. This prompted the government not to let people into the stadiums before improvements are made. Heysel: tragic night prompts action Violence has been a feature of the game almost since it became professionally organised in the 19th century. However, it was the Heysel stadium disaster in 1985 that really brought home to Europe the danger of hooliganism. The European Cup final between Liverpool and Juventus that year saw 39, mainly Italian supporters, die after rioting in the stadium before the match. Liverpool was banned from European football for five years and serious steps were taken to tackle hooliganism. The man who scored the winning goals was Michel Platini - recently elected Chairman of European football's governing body UEFA. He has pledged put the fight against racism and violence in football at the top of his agenda, Information key to identifying fans who pose "risk" The tragedy of Heysel prompted the Council of Europe to adopt a "European Convention on Spectator Violence". In 1996 the European Parliament adopted a report on hooliganism written by Claudia Roth. The report advocated banning alcohol at matches, separating supporters, controlling ticket sales and safer stadiums. In 2002 EU governments established a network of "national football information points". The aim was to increase police cooperation - particularly when it came to international matches. All of these points had to provide "risk assessment" when either their national team or clubs played abroad. This cooperation was important in the lead up to the European Championships in Portugal in 2004. Racism: MEPs want clubs to face sanctions Violence and racism often go hand in hand. In March last year 424 MEPs signed a written declaration on racism. It called on clubs and national football associations to face serious sporting sanctions if their supporters committed racist acts. As well as personal data on potential hooligans - the report in the Civil Liberties Committee (drafted by Italian MEP Giusto Catania) also wants the data to be protected. The Committee are hoping to organise a public hearing on football in the near future. EU promoting the prevention of violence
European football under the floodlights
Football - a game enjoyed on every continent on the world but whose wealthiest clubs are to be found in Europe. At all levels of the game there is a certain tension between the sporting and business aspects of the game. These tensions become more apparent the larger and more profitable the football club. This week in Parliament MEPs will consider two reports that deal with the legal regulation and security aspects of the game.
The infusion of huge amounts of money into clubs, players and agents has led inevitably to some public scandal and debate. Allegations of bribes and match fixing has brought some of the most famous clubs in the sport into disrepute. TV revenue a key area A key source of revenue is the TV rights, both nationally and internationally. How the large clubs divide the money and how much they receive is one of the most pressing questions football faces. The lucrative UEFA "Champions League" generates large TV, sponsorship and ticket revenue for clubs involved. In turn this increases their advantage over smaller domestic rivals. For years the spectre of a break-away European "super-league" of the continents biggest clubs has been a real possibility. The existence of the "G14" - a lobby group of 18 large clubs has only added to speculation over their intentions. The smaller football clubs feel that present arrangements suit the larger clubs but a report currently being considered by MEPs calls for "fairer distribution" of revenue. "Football is a game before a product" How the football calendar is decided and who holds the legal rights to the matches (clubs or national associations) are just some of the issues that the Parliament's rapporteur Ivo Belet would like to see clarified. His report on these and other aspects of the game is being considered by the Culture Committee this week. It will be voted on by the full Parliament in March in its Plenary session. Also this week a report on "security in football" by Italian MEP Giusto Catania will be considered by Parliament's Civil Liberties Committee. A European Commission White Paper on sport is also expected out later this year. The election of French football legend Michel Platini as President of UEFA - Europe's governing body - has brought these questions to a head. When elected he said that "football is a game before a product" and has pledged to defend it against overwhelming domination by business. He also called for "Europe's political authorities...to provide sport with a protective legal framework". Platini would also like fairer distribution of Champions League places to allow teams from Eastern Europe greater access. "Social significance of sport" recognised In 1995 the famous "Bosman ruling" by the European Court of Justice made it much easier for foreign players to play around Europe. Two years after that the Treaty of Amsterdam recognised the "social significant of sport". In any football dispute it is the referee who ultimately decides, British MEP and referee Christopher Heaton-Harris says that all levels of the game be considered: "it is absolutely essential that we, as politicians, do not only concentrate on the top level of football. Football is a social and cultural phenomenon, and remains a huge part of many local communities throughout Europe". This is the first in a series of forthcoming articles looking at football in Europe - the economic impact of the sport, the distribution of TV rights and a look at young footballers.
TV rights in football: will fans pay the price?
Football Clubs in Europe should show solidarity with each other when it comes to selling TV rights - that's the message contained in a report to be debated by MEPs on Wednesday. By "joint selling" their TV rights a league or championship can protect itself and its fans says the report. However, it calls for a "public debate" on how football is watched as "the broadcasting of sports... is increasing taking place on pay channels thus becoming inaccessible to a number of consumers".
The report has been prepared by Belgian People's Party MEP Ivo Belet and the debate on Wednesday is likely to touch upon how fans watch football matches in the future. The number of football channels is increasing - some clubs like Manchester United have their own channel - but is this good for fans? Recent developments suggest that the days of football on TV for free may be ending. This is reflected in the amount that TV bidders will pay for the right to screen a first rank tournament - for example the TV rights for the European "Champions League" for 2006-2009 went for €647 million. With that kind of investment those who pay for them expect a return on their investment via pay-to-watch TV. Individual vs Joint selling of TV rights At present there are two ways of selling TV rights for football in the EU. The first is "individual selling" where single clubs conclude deals with TV broadcasters. Spanish Team Real Madrid have a €1.1 billion deal with "Mediapro" to televise their matches until the end of the 2013 season. Naturally, this guarantees Real a cash flow that other teams in the Spanish League can only dream about. In turn this allows them to buy the world's best players and so continue their domination of the domestic league. Ivo Belet believes that such individual selling of TV rights "threatens completely to destroy the competitive balance" in football. The second way of selling football rights is "joint selling" where Clubs in an Association gather together to sign one large single contract with a single broadcaster in one country. In January this year England's "Premier League" did just that with 81 broadcasters in 208 countries. That will net them €950 million from foreign revenue and €420 million from domestic sources. Although this has been criticised by some as a "monopoly practices" this is an approach the Belet report favours. Moreover, in a recent case the European Commission ruled that this practice is not contrary to the EU's Competition law. Last year an "Independent European Sport Review" concluded that "central marketing (collective selling) of rights by the football authorities at European level is essential to ensure that solidarity nurtures the different levels of the pyramid, not least the grassroots". TV online and on the phone The rapid advance of technology has led to the internet and mobile phones being used to watch football. During the last World Cup in Germany 2.5 million people in the UK followed the matches on the internet. This is particularly so if games are shown during the day and people are at work with access to a computer. However, controlling access can be a problem: UEFA - the governing body of European football is currently locked in a dispute with web TV stations in China and India over copyright issues. For mobile phones, a recent study indicated that mobile television could have 100 million subscribers in Europe by 2010. Clearly, the way football is watched will continue to evolve.

Interview with UEFA President Michel Platini
UEFA President Michel Platini Football legend and recently elected President of UEFA Michel Platini joined MEPs on 5 June at an exhibition entitled "Only a game?" We caught up with him and asked him a few questions about the current state of European football and its future prospects.
Football - can it still be a 'school of values' for all?
For me it is a game and a great school of values. A lot depends on us and on political representatives to take the right lead.
Being in Brussels today must remind you of the Heysel stadium disaster - how can we prevent future tragedies? (In 1985 Platini scored the only goal in the final of the European Cup held in the Heysel stadium in Brussels. Prior to the kick-off 39 mainly Juventus fans died in rioting for which Liverpool supporters were later blamed).
For many years nothing similar has ever happened again in Europe. Nowadays countries, football clubs and UEFA have built new stadiums and improve them, providing them with a completely new security level. That is why it is very unlikely that something similar will happen again today.
A recent report by MEPs called on UEFA to look at ways of making revenue streams from the Champions league more balanced (larger countries receive more at present). What is UEFA doing about the situation?
First of all, I would like to say I fully share the EP's concerns. Anyway, this is mainly a Spanish problem; it is for Spain to solve this problem. As UEFA concerns, we can not do anything at national association level since there is subsidiarity in force.
Have you ever thought of creating a sort of European football team?
We have organised several friendship games at European level, such as Manchester against Europe-11 but I hope there will never be a European squad! I believe in national associations and in the national character of clubs....but if there will be a football team that officially represents Europe, means that there will not be anymore France, Italy or England playing - it's unconceivable!

Real Madrid President Ramón Calderón opens exhibition
clockwise from bottom left: Calderón, Trophies, Pöttering, Breitner A corner of the European Parliament in Brussels is this month given over to an exhibition by Real Madrid Football club. As winners of European club football's highest prize on a record 9 times - often with foreign players they can claim a "European dimension" of their own. At the opening of the exhibition on 7 June we caught up with the Club's President Ramón Calderón and former player Paul Breitner. They spoke to us about the big issues in European football today.
Questions to Ramón Calderón
Why have you chosen the European Parliament to hold this exhibition?
This is a place that represents 500 million Europeans and where important decisions are taken. EU politics are managed here. Therefore I thought it was very appropriate to have the opportunity to come here and have a meeting with the Commissioner for Sports, Ján Figeľ , and with Hans-Gert Pöttering, the President of the Parliament. I also thought to be appropriate to create this "Association of Friends of Real Madrid", which is a very beautiful idea. I also wanted to inaugurate this exhibition that allows people to know a bit more a club that has won more titles that any other team ever.
Commissioner Figeľ said that football helps to unite people in Europe. What can an institution like the EP do to promote this role?
The Parliament always tries to find solutions to unite people and to achieve harmony. Although it is true that it doesn't have any competences in the sports field, it does have it in the sports marketing. But I think that all of us together can help to demonstrate that football must be used to unite and not to divide people.
At Real Madrid, we consider that sport values translated to every day life allow a better society: sacrifice, spirit, effort, respect for your opponent, solidarity, knowing how to win and to lose. These are all of sport's good values to use in life and to achieve more democratic, free and better nations.
Real Madrid is part of the G-14, the group of the most important football clubs in Europe. The EP recently approved a report about the future of the professional football in Europe, mentioning the disadvantage smaller clubs face compared to bigger ones. Do you think that this elite group increases this imbalance?
At Real Madrid we don't agree with many things happening at the G-14 because we are not a mercantile society but a non-profit sport association. Therefore our goal it is not to speculate or earn money. In fact, Real Madrid has a foundation that assigns €6 million to help disabled children, ill people and immigrants. We consider that it is necessary that football supports all those having difficulties.
One of the problems in football is the occasional bouts of violence in stadiums. If you were a MEP, what would you propose to solve this problem?
I think this is not just a problem of football but a problem of society. When a spectator goes to a football match, is the same person that before could have also assaulted his wife or fought in a bar with another customer. It is not a peculiar problem of football, but when 80,000 people meet in stadiums violence can emerge in a more explosive way. It is necessary to make society aware of this problem, using dialogue and harmony.
Questions to Paul Breitner
MEPs have raised concerns the conditions of some young players from poor countries being brought to Europe. How can we ensure there are no abuses?
The problem has not changed in the last 30-40 years when I started as a professional footballer. The only difference today is that clubs contract young players at a very early stage, already those who are 11, 12 or 13 years old. I think this is not a club responsibility but of family and parents.
As a player did you ever dream of playing in a team representing Europe?
In the European Parliament MEPs talk about integration and try to solve these problems. We experienced this in Madrid, already 40 years ago we faced this reality when the first foreign players arrived. We already lived a Europe of various nationalities united in one club. Having a single European club is only a dream, it is not possible.
