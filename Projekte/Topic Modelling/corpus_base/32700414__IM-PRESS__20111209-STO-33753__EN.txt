EP President Jerzy Buzek arrives at the EU Summit of the 8-9 of December 2011 ©Council of the European Union President Jerzy Buzek today reacted to the decisions taken by European leaders on Thursday night: "Our problem is not primarily a problem of Treaties. It is a problem of economic governance in some countries and a problem of trust among us. Markets do not trust countries. Citizens do not trust politicians. Countries do not trust each other.
Addressing EU leaders, he went on: "The European Parliament strongly believes that all solutions should be within the EU framework, now or in the nearest possible future. We are against any creation of new divisions among Member States. We can not accept that one or two countries that have doubts about integration will draw us into a permanent division."
Parliament will debate the new plans to tighten controls over Eurozone countries' finances on Tuesday next week (13 December). European Council President Herman Van Rompuy and Commission President José Manuel Barroso will be present.
