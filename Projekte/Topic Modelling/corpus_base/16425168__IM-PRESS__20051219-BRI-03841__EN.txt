Briefing: Strasbourg plenary - 16-19 January 2006
2006-01-11 - 00:01
MEPs will be gathering in Strasbourg for the first session of 2006 to deal with issues ranging from bathing water standards to the possible liberalisation of port services. They will also debate the programme of the Austrian presidency with Chancellor Wolfgang SCHÜSSEL .
The session opens on Monday with a Commission statement on homophobia in Europe, with reports on EU citizenship and the trafficking of women and children also on the agenda. MEPs will then have their first opportunity formally to react to December's WTO ministerial conference, as they debate a Commission statement on the subject.
Tuesday sees the first reading debate on the Commission's latest plans to liberalise port services in Europe - the last attempt was thrown out by MEPs and the issue remains highly controversial. Introducing greater openness to the EU's environmental activity by applying the Aarhus Convention comes to second reading, while the results of two (third reading) conciliation agreements with Council come to their final vote - the issues concerned are the handling of mining waste and bathing water standards.
On Wednesday, Austrian Federal Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel, the new President-in-Office of the Council, will set out his agenda for the next six months to MEPs. One of the Austrian Presidency's aims is to move towards agreement on the future of the EU constitution project, and MEPs will be debating just that when they consider an own initiative report - by Johannes VOGGENHUBER (Greens/EFA, AT) and Andrew DUFF (ALDE, UK) - giving Parliament's assessment of how the debate should be taken forward. Wednesday will also see a debate on the report from Charles TANNOCK (EPP-ED, UK) on the European neighbourhood policy.
Thursday's sitting opens with a debate on the Lisbon Strategy from a gender perspective, followed by an oral question to the Commission on disability and development issues. The session will close, as usual, with three short debates on current human rights issues from around the world.
A number of other issues are likely to be added to the agenda. The Conference of Presidents is due to present proposals for the composition and terms of reference for two special parliamentary committees - one a committee of inquiry to examine the Equitable Life affair, the other a temporary committee to look into claims that the CIA has illegally held prisoners in EU countries - both need the approval of the plenary to be set up. MEPs will also get the chance to vote on a resolution on the European Council's proposals for the next Financial Perspective.
Finally, Commission and Council statements on security of energy supply are likely to be added to Wednesday's agenda. The online version of the Briefing will, as usual, be updated when more details are available.
Changes to the Agenda
The mandate of the committee of inquiry into Equitable Life and for the temporary committee on the CIA will be voted on Wednesday. The vote on the composition of these two committees is scheduled for Thursday.
The vote on the port services report is scheduled for Wednesday.
The vote on the resolution on the financial perspective is also scheduled for Wednesday.
The report by Esko Seppanen on the Maldives will be taken without debate, voted on Tuesday.
The three reports on sugar by Jean-Claude Fruteau will be voted on Thursday.
On Thursday at 9.30 there will be a debate on the situation in the Middle East.
The three debates and resolutions on human rights on Thursday will be:
Peru - the extradition of former President Fujimori
Egypt - violence against Sudanese refugees
Cambodia - political repression.

MEPs call for a Constitution for 2009
2006-01-11 - 00:01
MEPs are to debate a call from the Constitutional Affairs Committee for the EU to have a Constitution in place by 2009 to ensure the Union can function effectively and democratically. This comes in an own-initiative report which also argued that no further enlargement, after the accession of Romania and Bulgaria, can be allowed without a new constitutional settlement.
The full plenary session now gets to have its say on the report, drawn up by Andrew DUFF (ALDE, UK) and Johannes VOGGENHUBER (Greens/EFA, DE), after four months of debate within the committee following the French and Dutch " no" votes. It calls for the launch of a Europe-wide debate to find a solution to the deadlock. Responding to the decision by the European Council in June 2005 to set in train a period of dialogue or reflection, the report stresses the need to involve all European citizens in the process of building Europe's future. MEPs in the committee also criticised the Council and Commission for failing to ensure that the reflection period has a clear focus. The report's proposal is designed to see that the new debate delivers tangible results.
Comprehensive institutional reform is seen as necessary to ensure that an enlarged EU functions properly, since the Nice Treaty is inappropriate for the continuation of the integration process. MEPs in the committee criticised the suggestion that a core group of Member States could start implementing reforms, leaving the other countries behind.
Format for the new public debate
The report says that, to increase public participation, the proposed European debate should be guided by common topics and have clear political goals. The committee wants Parliament to play a leading role in the debate. As part of the process, the report calls for a number of conferences and meetings to be held as a way of advancing the debate on the future of the EU. These would be known as Parliamentary Forums and Citizens' Forums.
Under the committee's proposed schedule, the Parliamentary Forums, a series of conferences between national parliaments and the EP, would be held in Spring 2006. These events would also provide an opportunity to hear reports from the French and Dutch parliaments about their suggestions for a way forward.
At the same time, to ensure public participation, the Constitutional Affairs Committee wants Member States to hold a large number of Citizens Forums, i.e. public meetings and media debates at national and local level. The two co-rapporteurs stressed that all these debates should be structured around specific topics to deliver clear results. They should involve political parties, employers' and employees' representatives, civil society, the academic community and the media.
According to the committee, the public is concerned more about the context, i.e. the EU's political role and policies, than the constitutional text itself. MEPs believe the main issues on which the debate should focus are: the integration process, the EU's global role, the European social and economic model, and security and justice. Different outcomes of the debate are envisaged in the report, from abandoning the constitutional project to continuing with ratification, from seeking to clarify the present text to complete re-drafting. Nevertheless, Members agreed that it is important not to pre-empt the outcome of such a debate.
Lastly, after taking into account the results of the debate, a clear decision on the way forward should be taken by second half of 2007. If it is decided to revise the text extensively, MEPs say the current Constitution could still serve as basis. The committee will monitor the whole process and summarise the proposals put forward during the debates in a series of 'European Papers' .

Uncertain fate for Port Services liberalisation plan
2006-01-11 - 00:01
The Transport Committee was unable to reach a decision on the new port services directive. An attempt to throw out the directive completely was narrowly defeated, as was a compromise seeking to approve the directive albeit in modified form.
Market access to port services is a contentious issue within the Parliament. Two years ago, a majority of MEPs rejected at the final stage the outcome of the Parliament-Council conciliation negotiations on the first port services directive. The Commission then brought forward a new draft directive which has now come before Parliament.
Advocates of liberalising port services say there is a need for greater competition in this sector to promote growth and job creation, while opponents believe there would be a risk of massive job losses and deteriorating working conditions.
In the vote in committee, MEPs first voted by 26 votes to 22 with one abstention against amendments aimed at rejecting outright the Commission's draft directive. These amendments were tabled by the PES, Greens/EFA, GUE/NGL and IND/DEM groups, British EPP-ED Members and Parliament's Industry and Social Affairs committees.
However, in the vote on the overall report by Georg JARZEMBOWSKI (EPP-ED, DE), although most compromise amendments were adopted, the final report was rejected by 24 votes to 23. A key point of the compromise package was that it sought to exempt pilotage services from liberalisation.
In the final vote, a legislative resolution was adopted which for the moment leaves the Commission's proposal unchanged.
The ball is now in the court of the full Parliament. MEPs will have to take a decision at the plenary session when compromise and other amendments are likely to be retabled. The outcome of the vote in plenary cannot be predicted, with MEPs in favour and those against the Commission proposals both claiming that they had a fair chance of achieving a majority in Strasbourg.

External aviation policy
2006-01-11 - 00:01
Saïd El Khadraoui (PES, BE) for the Transport Committee, will be presenting a non-binding report on external aviation policy. The report calls for the adoption of new and ambitious agreements between the Community and third countries as well as for balanced agreements in terms of market access. The agreements might also include issues such as cabotage, rights of establishment, ownership and control and state aid, but only on a basis of strict reciprocity.
As regards the environment, the report recognises that the aviation sector has several negative environmental effects (such as noise) and is a significant contributor to climate change. However, MEPs in the committee recognise that airports and air carriers " have already made, and will continue to make, significant efforts to reduce and avoid noise and emission pollution ."

Committee against air service agreement with Russia
2006-01-11 - 00:01
The European Parliament's Transport Committee is recommending sending a clear message to Russia regarding a future air service agreement. In a report by Roberts Zīle (UEN, LV), MEPs in the committee insist that no agreement should be concluded without "the immediate and complete abolition of Russian overflight charges". A comprehensive aviation agreement between the European Union and China, however, is considered desirable.
The Committee regards the charges imposed by Russia for flights over its territory a " violation of international law ". Russia is the only country in the world where such payments are made. The annual cost of these fees for European carriers in 2003 amount to €250 million. MEPs in the committee also underline that those overflight charges have not been used for the promised improvement of air traffic control management but rather to subsidise its own airline. This is " in breach of competition law " and no comprehensive agreement should therefore be concluded without the immediate and complete abolition of Russian overflight charges.
Also, the Transport Committee calls on the Commission not to conclude an agreement on the Russian Federation's accession to the World Trade Organisation while Russia continues to charge for Siberian overflights.
MEPs in the committee also oppose the Commission's approach to modernise the charging system by 2013 and to ensure that charges applied after the transition period will be transparent, cost-based and not lead to discrimination between airlines. The committee, in contrast, insists that " no modified charging scheme should be agreed to replace the current overflight charging regime "
With regard to a future air service agreement with China, one of the most important aviation markets with massive annual growth rates, MEPs in the committee are in favour of a comprehensive aviation agreement. Additionally, they call on the Council to extend the Commission's negotiating mandate to cover the provision of the necessary infrastructure in Chinese airports and air traffic control over Chinese airspace. Both are " inadequate at present and pose an obstacle to the development of aviation relations " Rapporteur Roberts Zīle UEN LV A6-0375/2005 Relations with the Russian Federation and China in the field of air transport Procedure : Own-initiative

Launch of the Austrian Presidency Programme
2006-01-11 - 00:01
Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel will explain the programme of the Austrian Presidency followed by a debate with MEPs. Commission President José Manuel Barroso will also contribute to the debate. Austria takes over the EU Presidency until 30 June 2006 following on from the UK. Finland will take over the Presidency for the second half of the year.
Austria will have to steer a difficult course through negotiations with the European Parliament over the future funding of the EU, now it has taken over the presidency of the Union. The country has said it will focus on boosting employment and economic growth during its six-month EU presidency, but it will also have to win agreement on the budget deal approved by Heads of State in December, which has been criticised by most of the political groups.
The Parliament will seek to have the EU budget increased in the areas it sees as pivotal for the future of Europe. It wants increased spending on research and development and is firmly against any cuts in spending on education and culture. Austria aims to reach an accord by March.
Austria has said that it wants strong cooperation with Parliament and other EU countries to " enhance overall effectiveness and continuity " and has said that relations with Parliament will play a " key role " during the presidency. A group of MEPs met with Austrian ministers in Vienna on December 19 to discuss ways of increasing cooperation between Parliament and the presidency.
Some of the items on the agenda over the next 6 months
The country aims to use its chairmanship of the EU to boost the " Lisbon Strategy " which is supposed to rejuvenate Europe's economy by 2010. Other key objectives on the Austrian agenda will be developing the " specifically European social model " and efforts to " rebuild confidence in the European project among EU citizens ."
Other issues include workers in transition: the transitional period for introducing freedom of movement for workers from the " new " Member States in some of the " old " EU Member States will be reviewed. The countries concerned must declare by 1 May 2006 if they wish to continue to control access to their labour markets for a further three years.
The Working Time Directive: the Austrians have said that they will " endeavour to conclude negotiations " in 2006, which will be the " European year of workers' mobility ." Austria will also continue the focus on climate change, which was a key point under the UK presidency.

European Neighbourhood Policy: a tool for promoting democracy
2006-01-11 - 00:01
Parliament is to debate a call for the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) to be used as a strong tool for consolidating democracy and the rule of law in the EU's neighbouring countries and promoting democratisation in non-democratic countries such as Belarus. The European Commission should give vigorous support to democratic forces in neighbouring countries, in particular by providing access to independent media and information.
In a report by Charles TANNOCK (EPP-ED, UK) which is now going to the full Parliament, members of the Foreign Affairs Committee call for clear priorities and evaluation criteria. If countries violate international and European standards of respect for human rights and democracy, the EU should be ready to restrict or suspend aid and even to cancel agreements, says the report.
MEPs in the committee welcome the idea of providing European neighbourhood agreements at the end of the ENP process, adding that such agreements can encourage step-by-step progress towards full access to the internal market, participation in the European security and defence policy and close cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs. However, they say the ENP should not only strengthen ties between the EU and the neighbouring countries but also promote regional integration between these countries.
The committee believes the EU should leave its door open to membership for Ukraine and Moldova. It also proposes a European stability pact for the Southern Caucasus, modelled on the EU stability pact for South-eastern Europe.
Other points mentioned in the report are an improvement in energy network links as benefiting both the EU and its partner countries; an increase in trade and tourism, which will mean enhancing transport networks and will probably improve links between the partner countries; cooperation in environmental matters, such as water management, waste management, air pollution and combating desertification; and cooperation on legal and illegal immigration.
The European Neighbourhood Policy covers Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Moldova, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia, Ukraine and the Palestinian Authority.

Rafik Hariri assassination: move to freeze suspects' assets
2006-01-11 - 00:01
MEPs are set to adopt a Council regulation to freeze the funds and economic resources of a list of persons suspected of involvement in the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri. The Civil Liberties Committee will be voting on a report on the subject at a meeting on Monday 16 January, with the report then being put to the vote in plenary either on Wednesday or Thursday.
The purpose of the Regulation is to impose specific restrictive measures against designated persons suspected of involvement in the planning, sponsoring, organising or perpetrating of the assassination of Hariri. This is in line with measures taken by the United Nations Security Council, which in October 2005 decided to launch an international independent investigation commission looking into the February 2005 bombing that killed the former Lebanese Prime Minister and 22 others.
The freezing of funds and economic resources falls within the scope of the EU Treaty and the measures are similar to those imposed on persons and entities associated with Osama bin Laden, the Al-Qaida network, the Taliban and those covered by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Last time the European Parliament adopted a similar consultation procedure was to freeze the assets of weapon dealers in Sudan and Congo (June 2005).
In the case of Hariri's murder suspects, the list of persons and entities concerned is not specified at this stage and will be subsequently established by Council. Debate : 17.01.2006

Parliament to debate outcome of WTO conference
2006-01-11 - 00:01
MEPs will get their first opportunity to officially react to the agreement reached at the WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong in December 2005, as the Chair of the International Trade Committee, Enrique Baron Crespo (PES, ES) puts an oral question to the Commission on the subject, simply asking the Commission to comment on the outcome and the next steps in world trade negotiations.
Enrique Barón Crespo also chaired the delegation of MEPs who were in Hong Kong for the Ministerial Conference. They also took part in the Parliamentary Conference on the WTO, which is jointly organised by the European Parliament and the Inter-Parliamentary Union, bringing together around 400 parliamentarians from around the world with the aim of providing parliamentary scrutiny of the WTO process.
Speaking at the end of the WTO meeting on 18 December, Mr Barón Crespo gave his initial reaction: "I believe the results of the WTO ministerial conference in Hong Kong, while limited by their great complexity, are only a step, but one which reflects our priorities. There is still a long way to go but these agreements keep alive the hope of achieving the EU's fundamental priority objectives."
It is planned that an own-initiative report on the conference will be drawn up by the International Trade Committee. Rapporteur Enrique Barón Crespo PES ES Oral question to the Commission

Extending public access to EU environment policy making
2006-01-11 - 00:01
The EU is in the process of improving public participation in its environmental policies by applying the Aarhus Convention to its internal functioning. Parliament is now due to vote on this change at second reading, with the Environment Committee urging a number of changes to the approach taken by ministers in the Council.
The Aarhus Convention was concluded in 1998 by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. It deals with access to information, public participation in decision making and access to justice in environmental matters. In a report by Eija-Riitta KORHOLA (EPP-ED, FI), MEPs in the Environment Committee propose 27 changes to the Council's common position, which had taken on board only a few of the amendments made by Parliament at first reading. At this second reading stage, amendments require 367 votes in favour to be adopted by the plenary - that is half of the total number of MEPs.
Among the amendments proposed by the committee on access to information is a broadening of the scope to include policies aimed at promoting sustainable developments and plans funded by the EU, as well as the plans and programmes drawn up by the Commission. The committee also wants to include banking activities, and to reduce the number of exceptions to the new openness rules. They say information compiled by private companies on behalf of the EU institutions should also be included.
When it comes to public participation, the committee wants to include EU policy making as well as the development of plans and programmes, which are already mentioned, with deadlines for participating in consultation exercises to be increased from four to at least eight weeks.
On access to justice, among other points, the committee again wants to extend the deadline by which requests can be made for decisions or actions of Community institutions to be reviewed.
If Parliament adopts amendments which are not acceptable to the Council, the two institutions will have to meet in the Conciliation Committee to try to find a common text.

Call for more action on sustainable development
2006-01-11 - 00:01
The European Union launched its Sustainable Development Strategy (SDS) at the European Council in Gothenburg in 2001. This strategy has to be reviewed every five years. Parliament is now giving its contribution to the review process, in reaction to a Commission communication, in the form of a report by Anne FERREIRA (PES, FR) for the Environment Committee which now goes to the plenary session.
Even if there has been some progress over the first five years - an emissions trading system for CO2, reform of the agricultural and fisheries policies, reinforcement of the rural development policy - a new impetus is now needed. Members of the Environment Committee regret that most of the orientations contained in the Commission communication fail to respond to the magnitude of the challenges.
The report underlines the worsening of unsustainable trends in a number of fields where improvements are needed: pollution-generating misuse of natural resources, loss of biodiversity and worsening of climate change, among others. For instance, there is a risk that the Union will not attain the Kyoto Protocol objectives for 2012, thanks to the absence of suitable measures to curb the rise in road transport. The committee is also concerned at the large and rapid increase in air transport and polluting emissions in that sector unless swift action is taken. This is why MEPs in the committee suggest the creation of pilot trading scheme for aviation emissions for the period 2008-2012, covering all flights to and from any EU airport.
The report asks the Commission to reinforce its action in many fields among which:
- transfer of a large proportion of road transport to more environmentally friendly modes of transport;
- promotion of the use of biofuels;
- reversal by 2010 of the current loss of biodiversity;
- reduction at source of the production of waste;
- promotion of sustainable town planning;
- increase of resource and energy efficiency;
- reinforcement of the environmental and social aspects of the impact assessments for all its legislative proposals;

Climate change after the Montreal Conference
2006-01-11 - 00:01
MEPs will debate the issue of climate change following the statement by European Commissioner Stavros DIMAS at the conclusion of the Montreal Summit. " I am proud of the outcome of the Montreal Conference. Montreal is a watershed in the fight against climate change. More than 180 countries accepted sometimes difficult compromises to launch a stronger and forward-looking global effort to fight climate change. This inspiring collaboration and readiness to accommodate each other’s concerns is in line with the gravity of the threat and the need for all nations to close ranks and tackle climate change together.
Many developed countries, including the European Union, will take on new commitments when the current emission targets under the Kyoto Protocol expire in 2012. This is giving the Protocol a future. It reassures developing countries that the transfer of clean technologies will continue. It also reassures business that investment in clean technologies will remain worthwhile, and it gives researchers a sense that the demand for new low-carbon technologies will continue to rise.
Developing countries will actively participate in the search for means to combat climate change. The EU will support them, never forgetting that the fight against climate change must also address poverty and development. Building these bridges is key to the EU’s efforts.
We have agreed on the details of a five-year programme on adaptation which will identify vulnerabilities while developing and implementing measures to adapt to the inevitable effects of climate change. We have adopted the Marrakech Accords including the compliance mechanism, which will make the Protocol fully operational. And finally, we have also agreed to strengthen and streamline the Clean Development Mechanism, which allows for the transfer of advanced technologies to the developing world. More than 8 million US$ have been immediately pledged to this end. All this amounts to an enormous achievement we can be proud of, though it should not render us complacent. There is still a hard road in front of us and the harsh realities of coping with climate change.
Europe has led, and will continue to lead, the endeavour to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Its cohesion and collective force is remarkable. We are set to meet our reduction target for 2008-2012. The EU will continue to take the initiative in drawing more countries into the process launched in Montreal. This is just the end of the beginning ."
Parliament adopted a resolution on climate change on 16 November 2005. The House called on the Commission to propose legislation to abolish all subsidies and instead to put in place a positive incentive structure for the enhanced use of energy-efficient, low-carbon and carbon-free technologies and called for the pro-active use of public procurement within the EU to help bring down the costs for such technologies. Moreover, it asked, in addition to focusing the Seventh Framework Programme on research in areas relating to climate change mitigation, for a Crash Programme - similar to the US Apollo Programme in the 1960s - to promote research and innovation in support of sustainable energy and land-use management.

Stricter control of mining waste - conciliation to be approved
2006-01-11 - 00:01
Jonas Sjöstedt (GUE/NGL, SE) will be recommending that Parliament approve the conciliation agreement on mining waste. With over 400 million tonnes of waste per year, the European mining industry accounts for around 30% of all waste generated in the EU. Following an agreement reached in conciliation between the European Parliament and the Council, this waste will soon be managed according to rules laid down in a new European directive.
Mining waste is often produced in large quantities and storing it can be hazardous, either because of the sometimes defective techniques used or because it can contain polluting substances such as heavy metals or cyanide. The EU directive was drafted in the wake of the accident in 2000 at Baia Mare in Romania, where quantities of waste water spilled into a river, taking with them 120 tonnes of cyanide. The pollution spread as far as Hungary and into the Danube. In 1998 a similar accident spilled heavy metals in Andalusia. Other disasters, involving landslides, have occurred in Italy in 1985 (268 dead) and Wales in 1966 (144 dead).
The European Parliament had to go to conciliation, the last stage of the codecision procedure, to make the Council accept its main demands. On 29 November the EP delegation to the conciliation committee unanimously approved a deal reached by its negotiators with the Council. The permanent representatives of the Member States had approved the deal on 23 November. If the full Parliament approves this new text, the Member States will then have two years to enact the directive in national law.
Parliament's rapporteur Jonas SJÖSTEDT (GUE/NGL, SE) welcomed the outcome of the conciliation talks: " The new legislation imposes much tougher requirements on several EU Member States and applicant states. Dangerous tailings dams with high concentrations of cyanide, such as in the accident in Baia Mare in Romania, will no longer be allowed. The industry will have to restore the sites of mining activities and provide financial guarantees that they can do this ." He added: " With the new directive it will be possible to reduce leaks, not least into water, both from mines in use today and from old closed-down sites ".
Dagmar ROTH-BEHRENDT (PES, DE), chair of the EP delegation and vice-president of Parliament, said: " The agreement reached includes a clear guarantee from Bulgaria and Romania that they are ready to take over this part of the body of Community law (the acquis) in the environmental field. The accident a few days ago involving a spillage of cyanide into the Cisla river in Romania underlines the importance - especially in the accession states - of this piece of legislation ."
This accident, which was far less serious than that of 2000, happened on 26 November. It is the third of its kind in five years in the same region of Romania with potentially harmful consequences reaching as far as Hungary. MEPs therefore welcomed the fact that the agreement includes a joint statement by Bulgaria and Romania in which these two candidate countries undertake to meet the deadlines laid down for the implementation of the new EU legislation.
Tougher rules on financial guarantees
Thanks to MEPs, the financial guarantees will have to cover not only the waste facility itself but also the land affected by the waste facility; funds must be readily available at any given time for the rehabilitation of the land affected by the waste facility; and the size of the guarantee must be periodically adjusted in accordance with any rehabilitation work needing to be carried out as described in the waste management plan.
Operators must respect the principle of sustainable development. Several aspects of waste management have been tightened up, in particular where the operator places the waste back in excavation voids in order to restore the site. This type of rehabilitation must adhere to strict rules to prevent any contamination of soil and water. In addition, controls, maintenance and corrective measures must be carried out by the operator, who must for example collect and process contaminated water and leachate.
Parliament successfully pushed for the Member States to be required to compile inventories of closed sites, even abandoned ones, so as to identify those most dangerous to the environment and health. These inventories of " historic " waste now included in the legislation will provide a basis for defining measures to be taken in future.

Conciliation agreement on bathing water
2006-01-11 - 00:01
Jules Maaten (ALDE, NL) will be recommending that Parliament approve the conciliation agreement on bathing water. For years the European Union has struggled to replace its existing directive on bathing water, which dates from 1976. An agreement was reached between MEPs and representatives of the Member States in a conciliation meeting in October.
The provisions of the old directive and the parameters it required to be measured had been overtaken by scientific developments. But the European Parliament and the Council, in their efforts to strike a balance between health standards and the need to avoid administrative and financial burdens, had stuck to their different positions at the end of the second reading of the co-decision procedure. This meant conciliation was needed, i.e. direct negotiations between 25 Council representatives and 25 MEPs. The two sides had a maximum of six weeks to reach a deal but they achieved an agreement at the first meeting of the official negotiations.
Jules MAATEN (ALDE, NL), rapporteur for the Environment Committee on this directive, believes the new legislation brings three key improvements: " Firstly, this new directive will be less bureaucratic than the last one ". he says. " From now on, instead of 19 parameters for analysis, of which many had become obsolete or unnecessary, inspections will focus on the two parameters most important for health. Secondly, we have achieved a major reduction in the risks to the health of bathers. At present a swimmer on average runs a 12% risk of falling ill " (chiefly digestive or respiratory ailments). " This average will fall to 7.5% and the cost of achieving this will be acceptable. Lastly, information for the public will be greatly improved. Currently, when anyone manages to find information on the internet it is usually already a year old. Information will henceforth be provided almost instantly. It will be easier to find on the internet and will also be available and visible at bathing sites ".
Antonios TRAKATELLIS (EPP-ED, EL), Vice-President of the EP and head of the Parliament delegation in the negotiations with the Council, said " this, the first conciliation embarked upon and completed since the elections, has been a great success. The starting positions of Parliament and Council were far apart. But we worked in a highly constructive spirit on both sides and the European Commission played a key facilitating role. This is thus a victory as much for the citizens of Europe as for their shared Institutions. My medical background was also of help in convincing the Council to raise the quality standards. The outcome of our work is a directive which is far better than the last one and will protect the health of our fellow citizens far more ."
Final obstacles removed
The main obstacle in the final round of talks was the question of the standards to be applied to a new category of intermediate quality - known as " sufficient quality " - which would be lower than " excellent quality " and " good quality ". Parliament had accepted this new suggestion from the Council provided the standard required was raised. The negotiations produced an agreement on tougher reference values than those proposed by the Council, both for inland waters and coastal waters. From now on, in the " sufficient " category, the parameters for intestinal enterococchi will be 330 (inland waters) and 185 (coastal waters), measured at 90 percentiles. The values for the bacterium Escherichia coli were not changed. Overall, this represents a reduction in health risks to bathers from 12% to around 8%.
Once MEPs had obtained satisfaction on tightening up the standards, their demand to make this category a transitional one was no longer necessary. The report to be submitted later by the Commission to Parliament has been brought forward from 2018 to 2008 and, at the insistence of MEPs, will have to include an analysis of viruses. On the basis of this report, the Commission will have to review the directive by 2020. At that point it is envisaged that the " sufficient " category may disappear.
During the negotiations, Parliament also obtained a commitment from the Member States that constantly updated information should be provided to bathers. New standard signs will be devised in the near future and must be placed at all bathing sites to indicate the quality of the water. The findings of regular tests will also be made available swiftly, in particular on the Internet.
The directive is scheduled to be implemented within two years after it has entered into force, namely at the start of 2008. Rapporteur Jules Maaten ALDE NL A6-0415/2005 Pollution, public health: quality of bathing water Procedure : Codecision (3rd reading)

Sugar reform: MEPs to seek more moderate price cuts
2006-01-11 - 00:01
Sugar prices should be reduced by no more than 30% and flanking measures should be introduced to help producers cope with the impact of change. These are the key points of reports from the Agriculture Committee on the planned reform of the European Community sugar regime, which now go to the full Parliament for debate.
The three reports by Jean-Claude FRUTEAU (PES, FR) constitute Parliament's response to the reform of the sugar sector proposed by the European Commission in June. The committee called for a reduction of 30% in the price of white sugar, to be staggered over four years. This compares to the Commission's proposal for a bigger and sharper cut of 39% over just two years. EU Agriculture Ministers have already agreed on a reduction which was less radical (36% for white sugar) but still greater than the Agriculture Committee wants.
MEPs share the view of the Council that, to prevent disruption to the industry, the intervention mechanism should be preserved throughout the period of the reform. They believe the restructuring fund (which pays for partial closure of factories eligible for aid plus support for sugar beet producers) should be more flexible. A fixed percentage of the fund should be reserved for beet producers, says the Agriculture Committee. As regards support for switching to different crops, MEPs propose aid of €80 per hectare for " energy crops " but with a maximum of 2200 hectares eligible for such aid.
The committee also thinks, like the Council, that provision should be made to control imports into Europe of sugar from the less developed countries. Measures to safeguard the Community market will be triggered if year-on-year imports from a country benefiting from the " Everything but Arms " initiative increase substantially, depending on the production and consumption of the importing country.
The demands of the ACP countries (African-Caribbean-Pacific), which enjoy privileged access to the European market and hence expect to be hardest hit by the reform, are partly taken into account. The prices paid to these countries will remain unchanged for two years. Transitional aid of €40 million from the EU budget is also proposed for the ACP countries affected by the reform.
As with most aspects of agricultural policy, these measures come under the consultation procedure, so the final decision will be made by the Council once Parliament has adopted its position.

European citizenship
Third country nationals should have vote in local and European elections
2006-01-11 - 00:01
Citizens of non-EU countries who have been legally resident in an EU country for more than five years should be able to vote in local and European elections, according to a non-binding report from Parliament's Civil Liberties Committee. The full Parliament is now due to debate the own-initiative report by Giusto CATANIA (GUE/NGL, IT), which also says that EU citizens should be able to vote in national elections in Member States other than their own, provided they are resident there.
The report aims to be Parliament's response to the Commission's Fourth Report on EU Citizenship. Noting that EU citizenship is acquired alongside citizenship of an EU Member State, the committee sees merit in the idea of greater coordination of the requirements of the different Member States for people wishing to acquire their nationality, with the ultimate goal of a system of EU citizenship based on residence. On the other hand, the MEPs are clear that this is a matter for the Member States to decide.
The report also addresses other aspects of EU citizenship, seeking to find ways to make the rights and duties that come with it more clear: one suggestion is to have a direct link between some aspects of the tax system and the financing of the EU budget, without increasing the overall tax burden. At any rate, Member States should make clear to their citizens the proportion of their taxes contributed to the EU budget.
Among other ideas, the committee also wants to reinforce the common European aspect of European Parliament elections, with standardised electoral procedures opening the possibility of candidates being elected via transnational lists from European level political parties.

Strategies to prevent trafficking in women and children
2006-01-11 - 00:01
Trafficking in women and children is a growing world-wide problem which needs to be tackled on a global, EU and national level. Christa Prets (PSE, AT), for the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, is putting forward a report proposing strategies to tackle this dreadful problem, including measures to deal with the supply and demand sides as well as the traffickers.
The report calls on the Member States, especially Germany, to take appropriate measures in the course of the World Cup football tournament in 2006 to prevent trafficking of women and forced prostitution.
Women and children are particularly vulnerable to this modern form of slavery. Of the estimated 600,000 to 800,000 men, women and children trafficked across international borders each year approximately 80 percent are women and girls and up to 50 percent are minors (according to the 2005 Trafficking in Persons Report by the US Department of State office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons).
Successful strategies need to deal with the main causes of trafficking. It is however not possible to address the prevention of trafficking through individual action by each Member State, notes the committee. Instead it suggests a holistic and integrated multidisciplinary approach at EU and international level. The committee also calls for research, at national and European level, into the underlying causes, particularly of trafficking in women and children for sexual exploitation, i.e. what factors place people at risk and what factors affect demand for sexual services and sexual exploitation of women and children.
Prevention also means looking at the " triangle of trafficking ": victim, trafficker and client. The committee suggests practical actions, such as awareness raising campaigns to inform of the dangers and educate the vulnerable members of society in the countries of origin, to alert the public about the problem and reduce demand in the countries of destination. Another measure could be national and international telephone help-lines. MEPs in the committee also highlight the need to tackle the tendency to use new technologies, in particular the Internet, for sexual exploitation.
To take action against traffickers, the committee calls on the Member States to implement and enforce legislation that would strengthen the prosecution and punishment of traffickers, both natural and legal persons, their accomplices, persons encouraging, arranging or using sexual services from minors and persons attempting to institute such activities and to prosecute the laundering of the proceeds of trafficking.
MEP in the committee say a " right of residence " for victims after the traffickers have been tried, which now exists only in Belgium and Italy, could encourage victims to give statements and help secure the conviction of offenders. And the giving of anonymous statements must be allowed in the context of investigations into trafficking.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
The future of the Lisbon Strategy from a gender perspective
2006-01-11 - 00:01
Edite Estrela (PSE, PT) for the Women's Rights Committee will be putting forward a non-binding report on the future of the Lisbon strategy from a gender perspective. In March 2000, the Lisbon European Council launched a strategy designed to make the EU "the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world." The report discusses the various initiatives of the Lisbon Strategy with attention paid to their impact on women and gender equality.
The report considers the continuing disparity between men and women's rights within the employment domain, particularly concerning wage gaps, access to employment and access to lifelong learning. Indeed, with regard to remuneration it states that " in the enlarged European Union the average pay gap is 15% but can be as much as 33% in some countries ." It calls on Member States to make the reduction of the wage-gap an " absolute priority on their political agenda ." The report also notes the relevance of flexible working hours in encouraging women to work and in promoting social inclusion. It embraces the use of teleworking and the provision of affordable day care for children in view of the quantified objectives established by the Barcelona European Council for 2010. It further advises that Member States need to continue the modernisation of their respective social protection systems in order to ensure that women enjoy the same pension rights as men and are employed to the same degree.
The report reiterates the necessity of making lifelong learning part of the core of the Lisbon Strategy and emphasises the importance of training women in new technologies. It notes that " the education and training systems in most European countries have an extremely low percentage of women studying the new information and communication technologies (less than 20%) ." It asserts that women's participation in lifelong learning is an essential precondition for the realisation of the Lisbon Strategy's objectives.
The report laments the fact that the realisation of the Lisbon Strategy goals has primarily been pursued through collaboration between governments and not through regional, local, educational and social cooperation. Furthermore, it encourages the involvement of the European Parliament in the evaluation of the Lisbon Strategy in terms of gender. It considers any objectives of the Lisbon Strategies as unrealisable in the absence of policies that ensure equal opportunity, and thus commends the introduction of new guidelines intended to help implement such policies.

Esko Seppänen (GUE/NGL, FI) for the Budgets Committee will be putting forward a report on the inclusion of the Maldives in the list of countries covered, following the Indian Ocean tsunamis of December 2004.
The list of countries covered which, at present, does not include the Maldives, a country severely affected by the Indian Ocean tsunamis of December 2004. This proposal would add the Maldives to the countries covered by the fund, thereby allowing the European Investment Bank to lend to the Maldives under the coverage of a Community guarantee. The proposal has no implication for the Community budget.

Industry
The European Charter for Small Enterprises
2006-01-11 - 00:01
Dominique Vlasto (EPP-ED, FR) for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy will be tabling a non-binding report on assessing the implementation of the European Charter for Small Enterprises The charter, which was approved by European leaders in June 2000, promotes small enterprises. It applies to EU candidate countries as well as to Member States, a detail which is welcomed by the Committee. The members of the Committee also welcome the Commission's readiness to make EU programmes more accessible to SMEs as they recognise small enterprises to be one of the major forces in social and regional development in Europe. Furthermore the Commission's progress in terms of improving the quality of the regulatory framework for businesses is commended by the Committee.
The committee considers that there has been inconsistent progress in the area of entrepreneurship, and that the domain of small businesses' professional organisations needs to be strengthened. They recommend a further development of 'business support networks' , the involvement of small business representatives in the decision-making process and structural reforms in each country. The committee calls for a modernisation of the charter by the Commission in view of the priorities of the Lisbon Strategy.
The committee also point out improvements that need to be made by the Commission in terms of financial policy. The committee draws attention to continuing fiscal impediments and accordingly advises an increase in funding, a provision of investment incentives and a strengthening of financial instruments in order to support small businesses.
MEPs in the committee comment on the unnecessarily complicated style of the Commission's annual report and deemed it to be lacking in detail, its analysis to be inadequate and void of recommendations for future action. Despite these criticisms, the committee makes clear its desire for the Commission's annual report to remain the " key instrument for monitoring the development in the field of entrepreneurship ."

Constitutional affairs
Setting up of two parliamentary committees
2006-01-11 - 00:01
On Thursday 12 January, the Conference of Presidents (made up of EP President Josep BORRELL and the leaders of Parliament's political groups) is due to decide on the terms of reference and composition of two special parliamentary committees.
The first, a Committee of Inquiry (under rule 176 of the Rules of Procedure), is due to consider issues surrounding the Equitable Life case in the UK, in which a million people suffered a catastrophic fall in the value of their retirement savings and investments.
The second, a Temporary Committee (under rule 175), will examine the alleged use by the CIA of European countries for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners.
In each case, the final decision on the setting up of the committee is for the plenary session. These items are therefore likely to be added to the agenda after the Conference of Presidents meeting.
