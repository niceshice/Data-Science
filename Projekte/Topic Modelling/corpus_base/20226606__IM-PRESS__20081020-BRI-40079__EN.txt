Coordinated European action needed to tackle financial crisis says the European Parliament
What the EU need, MEPs say, is a coordinated response on a range of fronts in order to tackle the financial crisis and limit its impact on economic growth, jobs and small businesses. In a resolution adopted on the recent EU summit (15-16 October), they call for measures to improve financial supervision and look at issues from climate change to the Caucasus. MEPs debated the EU response to world crises with French president Sarkozy and European Commission president Barroso on Tuesday, 21 October 2008.
MEPs approved new EU trade Commissioner Catherine Ashton (UK)
Baroness Catherine Ashton (UK) was approved by the European Parliament as the new EU Trade Commissioner replacing outgoing Commissioner Peter Mandelson following his appointment to the British government. Parliament's vote was 538 in favour to 40 against and 63 abstentions. Baroness Ashton faced a hearing at the European Parliament on Monday (20 October).
European Parliament ensures temporary agency workers gain equal rights - UK workers after 12 weeks
The European Parliament adopted a directive on temporary agency work which enables temporary workers to be treated equally, from day one, with those of the employer company. However, following agreement reached in May this year between the social partners in the UK, agency workers will get the same pay and conditions as permanent staff after being employed for 12 weeks. This is the final stage in the process and Member States have a maximum of three years to transpose the directive. Under the proposed deal, Britain's 1.3 million agency workers will get the same pay and conditions as permanent staff after being employed for 12 weeks.
A safer Internet for children
MEPs adopted a report on a proposal to ensure better protection for children against these dangers backing the latest "Safer Internet" programme for 2009 -2013. The proposal seeks to introduce a new "Safer Internet" programme to run from 2009 to 2013, following on from the success of the current programme (2005-2008). The aim is to anticipate discernable trends in the online environment. With a budget of €55 million, the programme will combat illegal content, promote a safer online environment, raise public awareness and establish a "knowledge base" for research purposes. Parliament is working on this legislation in co-decision with the Council of Ministers.
Divorce for international couples: MEPs back bid to clarify the legal options
Parliament backed, by an overwhelming majority (522-89, with 35 abstentions), a proposed Regulation seeking to reduce the number of disputes about the country in which divorce proceedings should take place. The proposal does not create a standard EU-wide divorce system, but it does attempt to help the 170,000 couples affected to choose which country's law will apply for their divorce. The UK has opted out of this legislation and Ireland has also not indicated that it will take part.
Body scanners at airports: MEPs say that fundamental rights under threat
In adopting a resolution on the impact of security measures and body scanners on human rights, privacy, personal dignity and data protection, MEPs believe that this draft measure could exceed the implementing powers as the measures foreseen cannot be considered mere technical measures related to security, but have a serious impact on the fundamental rights of citizens. MEPs consider that the conditions for a decision have not yet been met, given that essential information is still lacking.
Alliance of Civilisations: Jorge Sampaio addresses MEPs
Building bridges and altering misguided perceptions of other cultures are crucial in a globalised world, according Jorge Sampaio , UN High Representative for the Alliance of Civilizations and a former President of Portugal, who addressed a formal sitting of the the European Parliament in Strasbourg plenary on Wednesday (22 October) on the subject of cultural diversity, in a speech given as part of the EP's series of guest speeches for Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
MEPs agree common charge system for EU airports
Common principles for levying charges at Community airports are set out in a second-reading report adopted by the European Parliament on a directive to prevent individual airports abusing a dominant position on the market. MEPs want the rules to apply to airports with an annual throughput of over five million passengers per year, whereas the Commission had proposed one million.
MEPs adopt first reading position on EU budget for 2009 at €136 billion
The European Parliament adopted the 2009 draft budget substantially higher than that adopted by Council in its July first reading. Commitments are set at €136 bn (1.04 % of GNI), payments are €124.5 bn (equivalent of 0.959% of EU GNI). Council had adopted a draft budget of 133.9bn in commitments and €114.9 bn in payments. With this vote, Parliament has stayed within the margins of the Financial Perspective.
Challenges to collective agreements in the EU
With the adoption of an own-initiative report on challenges to collective agreements in the EU, MEPs reacted to the recent Laval, Viking, Rüffert and Luxembourg rulings of the European Court of Justice. The freedom to provide services is one of the cornerstones of the European project but this should be balanced against fundamental rights and the social objectives anchored in the treaties, say MEPs.
Belgian film 'Le Silence de Lorna' winner of the EP LUX Prize for cinema
The film 'Le Silence de Lorna', by the Belgian directors Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne , is the winner of the European Parliament Cinema Prize LUX 2008. EP President, Hans-Gert Pöttering handed over the trophy to Luc Dardennne in a ceremony in front of MEPs and representatives of the three competing films in the final. The aim of the LUX Prize is to facilitate the circulation of European films within Europe. In awarding the prize, Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering said: "The European Parliament has always recognised the pivotal role culture plays in our society and the award of the second LUX Prize reflects this. One of the objectives of the prize is to experience cultural and language differences within the EU. With this year's winner, a major social issue affecting Europe can be brought to cinemas in all European countries."
Timeshares: Parliament and Council agree new rules
The timeshare holiday rights of some 1.5 million European families will soon be better protected, as MEPs endorsed a compromise reached between Parliament and Council on the new Timeshare Directive. The directive seeks to enhance consumer confidence and legal clarity, which are essential to the growth of this sector, via simplified EU-wide rules. The resolution was adopted with 674 votes in favour, 16 against and 10 abstentions.
Deal on the marketing authorisations for medicinal products
Parliament adopted a report on a first-reading agreement concerning a Commission proposal to harmonise the regulatory system used to change marketing authorisations for medicinal products (changes subsequent to the placing on the market, such as change in the production process, change in the packaging or change in the address of the manufacturer, update of patient information leaflet). The deal ensures that all medicinal products placed on the Community market - including those authorised at purely national level - are subject to the same criteria for the approval and administrative handling of changes, regardless of the procedure under which those medicines have been authorised (national or EU procedure).
MEPs back new Erasmus Mundus Programme for student mobility and university exchanges
MEPs gave the green light to a second funding period for the EU's Erasmus Mundus Programme, which aims to promote the EU as a centre of academic excellence. In backing the estimated budget of €950million for the 2009-2013 period of the new programme, Parliament adopted changes to some of the criteria for obtaining funding, with a view to simplifying visa applications for participants from non-EU countries and ensuring a balance in terms of students' gender and country of origin. Following the vote on 21 October and agreement with the Council of Ministers, the new Programme should be able to begin as planned at the start of 2009. In the debate preceding the vote, Commissioner Figel said: "As soon as the legislative procedure is finalised, we will launch our call for proposals, in order to ensure the smooth continuation of existing courses and the selection of new programmes".
Deal on the promotion of clean road transport vehicles
Parliament adopted a first-reading agreement with Council on the promotion of clean road transport vehicles. The most important point of the deal is that the directive stays mandatory, but that Member States are given some flexibility. The aim of the directive is to promote and stipulate the market for clean and efficient vehicles to prompt industry to develop and invest in environmentally-friendly vehicles. The proposal concerns the promotion of clean and energy-efficient road transport by obliging public authorities and certain operators to consider not only the cost, but the environmental impact, of the vehicles that they plan to purchase.
Cod stocks recovery plan: MEPs call for an end to all discards
In their response to the European Commission's latest cod recovery plan, MEPs called for all cod caught to be landed, rather than discarded, so as to enable proper scientific evaluation of stocks. They also agreed to the inclusion of the Celtic Sea (south of the Irish Sea) in the cod recovery plan. In a second vote, on fishing in outermost regions of the EU, MEPs propose extending until 2011 the deadline for fishing vessels receiving national state aid to enter the fishing fleet.
Ombudsman's activities calls for more initiatives to raise citizens' awareness
The European Parliament adopted a report on the 2007 annual report of the European Ombudsman's activities. Nikiforos Diamandouros , the European Ombudsman from April 1, 2003 took part in the debate preceding the vote. The report calls for all EU institutions and bodies to be given the necessary budgetary and human resources to ensure that citizens receive prompt and substantive responses to their enquiries, complaints and petitions.
Questions raised about agreement with Australia on passenger name records
The European Parliament adapted a report criticising the Council for concluding an agreement with Australia on the processing and transfer of passenger name records (PNR) without consulting or even informing the European Parliament. MEPs are concerned about the consequences of the agreement for EU citizens' right to data protection. The report was adopted with 610 votes in favour, 29 against and 47 abstentions.
Vietnam: MEPs want progress on human rights before cooperation agreement is signed
In a resolution on EU-Vietnam relations, Parliament calls for Vietnam to be pressed to observe human rights and various key freedoms before a new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with the EU is finalised. According to the resolution, which was adopted by 479 votes to 21 with 4 abstentions, freedom of assembly and of the press as well as internet access are severely restricted in Vietnam, while religious groups and ethnic minorities - such as Catholics, Buddhists and the Montagnard and Khmer minorities - suffer discrimination and persecution.
Parliament gives its assent to agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina
MEPs gave their assent to the conclusion of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). In a resolution adopted on 23 October, MEPs point out the issues where Bosnian authorities need to make progress: reform of the state, return of refugees, non-discriminatory access to education and future constitutional structure. MEPs are also in favour of strengthening the EU Special Representative's role.
Parliament recognises Ukrainian famine of 1930s as crime against humanity
In a resolution on the commemoration of the Holodomor, the artificial famine in Ukraine in 1932-1933, MEPs describe it as "an appalling crime against the Ukrainian people, and against humanity". According to the resolution, the Holodomor famine of 1932-1933, which caused the deaths of millions of Ukrainians, "was cynically and cruelly planned by Stalin's regime in order to force through the Soviet Union's policy of collectivisation of agriculture against the will of the rural population in Ukraine".
Parliament adopts resolution on maritime piracy - legally incontrovertible rules of engagement needed
In adopting a resolution on sea piracy, the European Parliament expresses its serious concern about the growing number of maritime piracy cases, in particular in the seas off Somalia and the Horn of Africa. Criminal assaults against Community fishing, merchant and passenger vessels have increased in number and frequency. MEPs call on the Council and Member States to adopt clear and legally incontrovertible rules of engagement for the naval forces engaged in those operations.
Human rights: political rights abuses in Venezuela, massacres in Congo, oppression in Burma
In three resolutions on democracy and human rights adopted at the end of Strasbourg plenary session, the European Parliament condemns the use of intimidation and electoral manipulation in the run-up to elections in Venezuela, voices dismay at the renewed fighting in eastern Congo and calls on ASEM states at their summit this week to press the Burmese regime to release all political prisoners. 20081020BRI40079 Texts adopted - 20-23 October 2008 Draft agenda for 17-20 November 2008 will be available here

Coordinated European action needed to tackle financial crisis says the European Parliament
2008-10-27 - 13:43
What the EU need, MEPs say, is a coordinated response on a range of fronts in order to tackle the financial crisis and limit its impact on economic growth, jobs and small businesses. In a resolution on the recent EU summit (15-16 October), they call for measures to improve financial supervision and look at issues from climate change to the Caucasus. The resolution was adopted with 499 votes in favour, 130 against and 67 abstentions. Parliament stresses the importance of a coordinated macroeconomic response to resuscitate global growth, without undermining the principles of the stability and growth pact. MEPs also want to see coordinated action to restore confidence in the financial markets.
Financial market crisis and the real economy
The crisis, says the resolution, has implications beyond financial markets: for business viability, jobs, personal finance and SMEs. Parliament stresses the paramount importance of ongoing access to credit for citizens and SMEs and of investments in EU infrastructure to avoid a dramatic downturn in growth and employment.
It therefore supports measures to return liquidity to the markets, and the rapid reaction of the Commission in applying state aid rules on measures taken to rescue financial institutions. When public money is spent in this way, say MEPs, it must be accompanied by public oversight, improvements in governance, limitations on remuneration, strong accountability to public authorities and investment strategies for the real economy.
MEPs welcome the setting up by the Commission of a high-level group to consider the future supervisory architecture for EU financial services, but they criticise the lack of Parliamentary involvement in the Commission's "financial crisis cell".
Better supervisory structure for the future
Looking beyond the immediate crisis, MEPs reiterate their calls on the Commission to propose measures to strengthen the EU regulatory and supervisory framework and EU-level crisis management, including on banks, credit rating agencies, securitisation, hedge funds, leverage, transparency, winding-up rules, clearing for over-the-counter markets and crisis prevention.
The Lamfalussy process should be strengthened, including colleges of supervisors for cross-border institutions and a clearer role and legal status for the Level 3 committees (which bring together all the Member States' banking, securities and insurance supervisors). Parliament also wants to see proposals drawn up for effective cross-border crisis management.
Lisbon, climate change, energy, Caucasus conflicts
The resolution also considers other issues arising from the European Council meeting last week. Among other points:
Parliament reiterates its respect for the result of the Irish referendum on the Lisbon treaty, and for the results of other countries' ratification procedures, and hopes a solution can be found which is acceptable to all before the European elections in June 2009;
MEPs say the financial crisis should not call into question the EU's post-2012 climate targets, though measures taken to meet them should be evaluated with competitiveness in mind;
Parliament calls for Commission and Council to pursue the establishment of a common European external policy on energy, and for a stronger political commitment to a low carbon economy;
MEPs stress that there cannot be a military solution to the conflicts in the Caucasus, condemn all those who resorted to force to change the situation in the Georgian breakaway territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and recall Russia's "disproportionate military action." They call on Russia to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia.
MEPs debate EU response to world crises with French president Sarkozy
Tuesday, 21 October 2008
At a debate with MEPs on the EU summit of 15-16 October, EU President-in-Office Sarkozy said the Russo-Georgian war and the financial crisis had strengthened the case for a united European response to major world problems. He rejected any idea that the EU should backtrack on its climate change commitments because of the crisis. While the main EP political groups broadly supported him, some felt the roots of the financial crisis went back a long way and queried the role of unbridled free markets.
Introducing the debate, the President of Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering , said that in the recent crises, Europe under the leadership of President Sarkozy had shown its ability to take coordinated, collective action. Without such action - and without the existence of the euro - "we would have been in a disastrous situation".
Georgia
The first subject considered by President Sarkozy , speaking on behalf of the European Council, was the Russo-Georgian war. While regarding the Russian reaction as "disproportionate", he also stressed it was a "reaction" to a previous "inappropriate" action. He then described the peace-making efforts carried out by himself on behalf of the EU. The Americans had thought "dialogue with the Russians is pointless" but in his view this was folly, since "Europe does not want another Cold War". He emphasised "it is Europe that has brought about peace", adding "it is a long time since Europe has played this sort of role in this kind of conflict".
World financial crisis: how to prevent a recurrence
Turning next to the world financial situation, Mr Sarkozy said "what was a serious crisis became a systemic crisis" with the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Moreover, the solutions now being found - in which Europe had taken the lead - simply amounted to "crisis management".
A key point was "how can we prevent a recurrence?". He had proposed to the UN General Assembly the creation of a "new global financial system" or "new Bretton Woods". The aim must be to "overhaul capitalism", not "by questioning the idea of a market economy" but observing certain principles: no bank working with state money must work with tax havens, all financial institutions must be subject to financial regulation, traders' bonus structures must not push them to take undue risks, and the monetary system must be rethought. The USA and the EU had proposed a series of "summits on global governance", starting in November, involving first the G8 and then adding the G5, at which, he stressed, "Europe must speak with one voice".
Elsewhere in his speech, Mr Sarkozy returned to the financial crisis, saying it was undoubtedly now leading to an economic crisis and this too would require a "united European response". Among ideas he floated were measures to ensure that "European companies are not bought up by non-European capital while their stock exchange values are low" and the creation of sovereign wealth funds by each EU country. At a later point in the debate he pointed the finger at hedge funds and questioned the competence and independence of ratings agencies, pointing out that the latter were mainly US-based and perhaps Europe needed its own ratings agencies.
He also believed that "the eurozone cannot continue without clear economic governance". The European Central Bank must be independent but must be able to hold discussions with "an economic government" at head of state/government level.
No backsliding on energy/climate change
Mr Sarkozy's next topic was the future of the EU's energy and climate package. He rejected any idea "that the world should do less to combat climate change because of the financial crisis", saying "Europe must set an example" to the world. He recognised the difficulty some European countries were facing, especially those that are 95% dependent on coal, but some flexible solution must be found. Referring to the 20/20/20 targets, he described "respect for the climate change objectives" and "respect for the timetable" as essential.
Turning to the EU Immigration Pact, the French president said this was "a great example of European democracy" as, despite initial differences, the EU had agreed on a joint policy.
Lisbon Treaty
Lastly, the president argued that the recent crises with Georgia and the financial markets showed that "it would be a major mistake not to proceed with institutional reform" since Europe often needs "a powerful, rapid and united response", something which was difficult, for example, with the EU's six-month rotating presidency. The French presidency was thus looking to a roadmap to find a solution by December to the question of Irish ratification of the Lisbon Treaty. Concluding, he said "the world needs a Europe that speaks with a strong voice" and expressed appreciation to the EP for its "solidarity" in helping to create this sense of unity.
Commission President Barroso
President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso said Mr Sarkozy's handling of the crisis had shown him as "dynamic as only he can be" and welcomed the fact that Europe was now working hand in hand with the US. He said "the EU should mould a global response with it values and interests".
He outlined a number of practical steps. He said the Commission would be looking at executive pay and derivatives. The feasibility of pan-Europe financial regulation would also be under review. He also signalled his forthcoming visit to China for talks saying: "The goal should be to devise a system of global financial governance adapted to the challenges of the 21 st century – in terms of efficiency, transparency and representation."
Turning to the so called "real economy", he said that Europe faced a "serious economic slowdown" with jobs, incomes and order books affected. He went on to say: " There is no national road out of this crisis...we will swim or sink together. We must not give in to siren calls for protection. We must not turn our backs on globalisation or put our single market at risk."
He said that "European citizens need support - especially the vulnerable". To deal with the slowdown he called for "smart support" that would hit two targets at once. For example: "Helping the construction industry...but doing this by promoting an energy-efficient housing stock....Helping key industries like cars...but preparing them for tomorrow's markets of clean cars."
He told MEPs that there is "no national route out of this crisis" and that in Europe "we swim or sink together". He said that: "Europe shows its true colours in a crisis - in Georgia we stopped a war whilst with the financial crisis we are dealing with it."
He went on to say that: "There is no magic bullet to turn around the EU economy. What we have to do is take every option, explore every potential way in which EU policy can help Member States to seize every opportunity to put Europe on the road to growth. That is our task in the coming weeks. And it is a task I want to tackle together with the European Parliament." He finished by saying that it was: "The kind of occasion where the crisis calls into question old certainties and minds are more open to change."
Later, speaking after the main group speakers, Mr Barroso said that analysis compiled by the Commission showed the crisis was triggered "by sectors that were not regulated in US". On climate change he said that with the financial crisis it would be "dramatically bad" if the EU backtracked on the 20/20/20 emission formula agreed last. He said that "the world - not just Europeans, are looking to us".
Political group speakers
For the EPP-ED group, Joseph DAUL (FR) believed that Europe working together had twice over the summer helped show the way through major crises: Georgia and the financial markets. President Sarkozy had worked tirelessly and shown the value of the EU Presidency and the role for Europe on the world stage.
Parliament had already done key work on the financial situation with recommendations on regulation and surveillance, reform and an end to golden parachutes. He said, "It is in economic crises that we develop rules for the future. Free markets have to be accompanied by rules and regulations If they existed previously they were not properly applied"
Mr Daul did not want to see the efforts of the little people in Europe wiped out. SMEs need support and we need to guarantee the social market and solidarity. He asked for all to ratify the Lisbon Treaty as soon as possible so that Europe could run more smoothly. He concluded that ahead we face many major issues together: climate, energy, defence. For the sake of future generations, he stressed that we need to work on the basis of a Social Market economy model to solve them.
For the Socialist group, Martin SCHULZ (DE) was impressed by the recent resolute action of both President Sarkozy and Barroso. However, he felt we need to make full use of the current crisis to make sure we never again suffer such a disaster in the financial markets which has triggered a disaster in the real economy. We need new rules by the end of the year for banks' private equity.
Mr Schulz noted that in this debate Messrs Sarkozy, Daul, Barroso all spoke the language of true European Social Democracy." I am glad you have finally arrived, however late" he said. Mr Schulz was concerned about the situation of the ordinary citizen, the taxpayer, the small business in this crisis. We need to boost purchasing power to revive the Single Market and we need to cover the risks for the ordinary citizen not just the big fish.
He was delighted everyone was now singing from the same hymn sheet of social democracy but warned this was the time also to remember the long-term issue of climate change which would remain after the credit crunch had subsided. We should all be working towards sustainability. Finally, in this crisis he emphasised that we must not forget rights and keep the question of fundamental values on the agenda.
"Thank you for these warm and encouraging words about working hand in hand", said Graham Watson (UK), for the ALDE group, "but why do the Council conclusions refer only to the Commission and the Council? Why, for example, under climate change, is there no reference to the Parliament?" "You will need the EP", he predicted, pointing to some Member States' behind-the-scenes attempts to "unpick" agreements on CO 2 emission targets for new cars (2012) and emission sharing (2013).
"Since the Berlin wall fell, 50 million people have been lifted out of poverty, but today we are seeing what happens when markets lack transparency", said Mr Watson, welcoming the fact that co-ordinated measures had alleviated the immediate pressures. He stressed that the EU must play a leading role in applying such remedies internationally - working with the US if possible, and without it if necessary.
Mr Watson nonetheless regretted that the summit had failed to produce plans for an effective supervisory regime, such as a European financial services authority. "Supervision is still the missing piece of the jigsaw", he said. Finally, Mr Watson acknowledged that Mr Sarkozy's role as a "man of action" in managing the crises underlined the EU's need for a permanent President.
"Energy and willpower are required in politics, and are good for Europe", agreed Daniel Cohn-Bendit (Greens/EFA, DE), for his group. He stressed that all the crises - financial, environmental and hunger worldwide - are interdependent, and must be tackled together.
"These crises did not start in July or August, but years ago", he said in a reference to Mr Sarkozy's speech. "It was calls for unbridled growth and the rejection of financial market regulation a year ago that led us into these crises", he said, urging Europe's leaders to be "more self-critical". What Europe needs is a "social and environmental market", which entails "rethinking the way we manufacture, and the way we live".
"The German car industry already has money in tax havens, and does not need more", said Mr Cohn-Bendit, in a reference to car industry "climate change waivers" (which, he said, had been backed by both right and left wingers). He urged Mr Sarkozy to press for tax havens to be obliged to declare the country of origin of these funds. Finally, subjecting climate change proposals to unanimity in the Council "will put you at the mercy of countries that are backsliders" in December, he warned Mr Sarkozy.
For the UEN group, Cristiana MUSCARDINI (IT) said she agreed 100% with the statements and proposals made by French President Nicholas Sarkozy and thanked the Council for the immigration pact and the asylum pact, "common sectors which are important to us all". However, she called on certain "Commissioners, including competition Commissioners "to do the right thing". The statement on heating oil has not reassured the markets and, he said, and "we need more on financial derivatives, which have laid low some European States."
Mrs Muscardini said a united, if not equal, Europe, would help to pinpoint strategies to solve the crisis, which she called "systemic" and "in order to combat a systemic crisis we need a new system". She called on Nicholas Sarkozy to recast global capitalism and maybe even go further to make sure that "market freedom is not untrammelled liberalism". She added that the European Central Bank "could have done more" to help banks that have and are "failing".
Francis WURTZ (FR), on behalf of the GUE/NGL group, warned that the "worst is still to come" of this "multidimensional crisis of such scale and seriousness". The dimensions may be "unfathomable", but the crisis still needs to be debated. The "shock" of this crisis is being felt everywhere and "we have a drop in public expenditure and plans for privatising public services are ahead," he said.
Mr Wurtz continued, "We need to be held accountable to our citizens", adding that this cannot be avoided, by introducing regulation or "doing away with golden handshakes". He pointed to the fact that 2% of monetary transactions were for services and production, while the remaining 98% went on finance. "We must attack the roots of this evil" and we need a "new Bretton Woods".
According to Nigel FARAGE (UK) of the Independence and Democracy group, when President Sarkozy went to Georgia he was "not acting for the EU" as "there had been no meeting". "You did it as the President of France". As regards the financial crisis, "I'm glad the Irish and the Greeks did their own thing", he said, before adding "I haven't heard anyone say that this crisis is a failure of regulation. We haven't had a lack of regulation, we have a blizzard of regulation and this has not protected a single investor. We need to rethink what we have been doing. We need to act in our national interest. The Swiss can and they have the adaptability, to weather the financial crisis better than EU states."
The speaker from the non-aligned MEPs, Bruno GOLLNISCH (FR), said "We are looking at part of things here but we are quiet on the causes. No one saw this coming …. apart from a few economists and Jean Marie Le Pen's voice crying in the wilderness." In his view, "We need unfettered freeing up and decoupling of the financial side of things and the real economy, which is now declining." Turning to foreign affairs, he said "You don't see that Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence paved the way to South Ossetia." His final comment was "You have to have a radical break with the global system and the movement of goods has to be rethought."
British and Irish speakers
Linda McAVAN (PES, UK) said it was not time to abandon climate change ambitions, adding that the socialists want "a credible agreement that balances environment, jobs and competitiveness" by Christmas and in time for international talks. "Let's have the political courage," she said.
Avril DOYLE (EPP-ED, IE) said that Europe's leaders had "committed themselves to reducing greenhouse gases by 20%". Now, in order to secure an agreement at Copenhagen, "we will have to make a clear and unambiguous statement", she added. "There should be no delay and we cannot pay the higher price in the future" or, as President Sarkozy said, we will miss our date with history.
Giles CHICHESTER (EPP-ED, UK) told the House "It would not be far fetched to liken the crisis to a hurricane. Once the wind abates there is an illusion of calm but the devastation takes years to clear up." He continued, "tackling change is a long-term matter and there is no silver bullet". Moreover, "Over-regulation could precipitate something much worse, a re-run of the 1930's slump". "Let us not kill off the goose that lays the golden egg", he concluded.
John BOWIS (EPP-ED, UK) agreed with President Sarkozy that the climate change package "is so important that we cannot simply lose it under the pretext of a financial crisis". However, he went on "we will need reassurances for the countries which have real problems, as Poland does with coal" and "we must also be very clear that our support for biofuels in transport is dependent on the development of fuels from sustainable sources".

Employment policy
European Parliament ensures temporary agency workers gain equal rights - UK workers after 12 weeks
2008-10-27 - 13:43
The European Parliament adopted a directive on temporary agency work which enables temporary workers to be treated equally, from day one, with those of the employer company. However, following the agreement reached in May this year between the social partners in the UK, agency workers will get the same pay and conditions as permanent staff after being employed for 12 weeks. This is the final stage in the process and Member States have a maximum of three years to transpose the directive. The agreement in the UK means the Parliament can adopt the directive after being blocked in Council since 2002.
UK position - 12 week rule
Under the proposed deal, Britain's 1.3 million agency workers will get the same pay and conditions as permanent staff after being employed for 12 weeks. The revised wording of the Agency Workers Directive allows the UK to implement the agreement between CBI and TUC, which means that an agency worker is entitled to equal treatment (at least the basic working and employment conditions that would apply to the worker concerned if they had been recruited directly to occupy the same job) after 12 weeks in a given job.
In the UK - pay covered but not occupational social security schemes.
According to the agreement between the CBI, TUC and the UK government, equal treatment will be defined to mean at least the basic working and employment conditions that would apply to the workers concerned if they had been recruited directly by that undertaking to occupy the same job. It will not cover occupational social security schemes.
Harlem Désir (PES, FR) rapporteur said: " Agency workers count for about 3 million employees in the EU and a turnover of some 75 billion euros. This directive shows the possibility of achieving social legislation when the expectations for a social Europe are strong."
UK speakers in the debate on Monday 20 October in Strasbourg
On behalf of the Greens/EFA Group, Jean LAMBERT (UK) welcomed the agreement, saying she looked forward to its rapid implementation because it is a "step forward to a social Europe". "I think it is very important that in the current climate we are actually making progress on workers’ rights."
Speaking for the IND/DEM Group, Derek Roland CLARK (UK) wondered why the report , which had been "batted to and fro between the Commission and the Council" for six years, was being passed to the Parliament like a "hot potato" when "it is a bad move". "It will not help in these times of rising unemployment," he said, because paying inexperienced workers the same as skilled staff "discourages employee loyalty."
Roger HELMER (NI, UK) agreed, saying "this is a bad piece of legislation". He considered its main effect to be to "deny thousands upon thousands of people the right to work at all". "It makes our labour markets less competitive and less flexible. It damages our economies at the very time we can least afford to have them damaged," he said, later adding, "You could not ask for a clearer example of the way the EU subverts democracy in Member States."
Philip BUSHILL-MATTHEWS (EPP-ED, UK) first congratulated the rapporteur on the brevity of his report before thanking him on "using the argument of consensus" from stakeholders to get it through. "I think there is a moral for us as politicians here that, when the stakeholders themselves say that this is what they want, I do think we have a responsibility to try and facilitate that wherever possible." Mr Bushill-Matthews went on to thank the Minister for his reminder that the "Council put together this common position", adding that the message of this dossier is "let us move on".
Richard HOWITT (PES; UK) said he was "delighted" to have voted on, supported and campaigned for this directive, which was a "key priority for the Labour Government", for three reasons. Firstly, "temporary agency workers are vulnerable workers" and "they want better". Second, "abuses" by unregulated agencies" will end, and finally, "we have a social partnership agreement, rarely seen in Britain, between the British TUC and the Confederation of British Industry (CBI)".
Agreement after six years
Parliament's first-reading amendments (report by Ieke van den Burg (PES, NL) sought in particular equal treatment in the "essential conditions" of work and employment, i.e. working hours, overtime, breaks, pay, etc. (Article 3 of the Common Position).
The 2002 proposal for a directive, tabled in the context of the Lisbon jobs and growth strategy, established the principle of non-discrimination between temporary workers and those of the employer company, for temporary workers hired for more than six weeks. An exception to this principle was provided for in the case of collective agreements.
MEPs won an undertaking that equal treatment must apply from the first day. Furthermore, any exceptions to this principle will be limited, and must be governed by agreements between the social partners, collective negotiations or agreements reached by the social partners at national level.
EP amendments on health, safety and hygiene at work were not deemed "essential conditions", but these are already governed by Council Directive 91/383/EEC of 25 June 1991, stressed rapporteur Harlem Désir (PES, FR).
In adopting this report, the Employment and Social Affairs Committee expressed the wish that this six-year old proposal for a directive should enter into force without further delay.
Common position of the Council
The common position includes a majority of the amendments (26 in total) resulting from Parliament's first reading of the Commission's proposal.
The general structure of the common position is in line with the general structure of the Commission's amended proposal. Specifically, the Council accepted an amendment to the title of the Directive, three amendments to the recitals as well as a number of amendments to the following articles: Article 1 on the scope, Article 2 on the aim of the Directive, Article 3 on definitions, Article 4 on the review of restrictions and prohibitions, Article 5 on the principle of equal treatment, Article 6 on access to employment, collective facilities and vocational training and Article 7 on the representation of temporary agency workers.
The main differences from the Commission's amended proposal are as follows:
Review of restrictions and prohibitions on the use of temporary workers (Article 4): while essentially following the spirit of the Parliament's amendment, the Council added a new paragraph concerning the review of agreements negotiated by the social partners. The Council considered that, in order to respect their autonomy, the social partners should themselves review whether the restrictions and prohibitions negotiated by them were justifiable on the grounds set out in the first paragraph of Article 4. The Council did not consider it necessary to retain an explicit reference to the discontinuation of unjustified restrictions and prohibitions.
Principle of equal treatment (Article 5): while generally following the Commission's amended proposal, the Council modified the text. The Council also considered that the principle of equal treatment from day one should be the general rule. Any treatment of temporary agency workers differing from that principle should be agreed by the social partners, either through collective bargaining or through social partner agreements concluded at national level. In the light of the modifications made to the text, a specific exemption for short-term contracts (six weeks or shorter), as envisaged in the Commission's amended proposal, was therefore no longer considered necessary or appropriate.
The common position reflects those of the Parliament's amendments which stress the importance of the role of social partners in negotiating arrangements on working and employment conditions. It also echoes the Parliament's concerns in relation to the prevention of misuse.
Penalties (Article 10): the common position includes a new paragraph concerning measures the Member States are expected to take in order to ensure compliance with the Directive by temporary work agencies and user undertakings.
Implementation (Article 11): the Council considered that the Member States would need three years to implement the Directive, while the Commission had proposed a two-year implementation period.
In addition, a number of recitals have been updated and modified, in order both to explain the modifications introduced by the Council to the Commission's amended proposal and to describe developments since the amended proposal was published in 2002. For example, references to the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy, in 2005, and to the agreed common principles of flexicurity, endorsed by the European Council in December 2007, were included in the recitals.
Entry into force
Member States must adopt and publish the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by three years after the entry into force, or must ensure that the social partners introduce the necessary provisions by way of an agreement, whereby the Member States must make all the necessary arrangements to enable them to guarantee at any time that the objectives of this Directive are being attained.

Challenges to collective agreements in the EU
2008-10-27 - 13:43
With the adoption of an own-initiative report on challenges to collective agreements in the EU, MEPs reacted to the recent Laval, Viking, Rüffert and Luxembourg rulings of the European Court of Justice. The freedom to provide services is one of the cornerstones of the European project but this should be balanced against fundamental rights and the social objectives anchored in the treaties, say MEPs. The freedom to provide services is one of the cornerstones of the European project, however, this should be balanced against fundamental rights and the social objectives set out in the Treaties and against the right of the public and social partners to ensure non-discrimination, states the report by Jan Andersson (PES, SV), adopted by 474 votes for, 106 against and 93 abstentions.
MEPs call on the Commission to prepare the necessary legislative proposals which would assist in preventing conflicting interpretation in the future.
Posting of workers directive
The Posting of workers directive (PWD) allows public authorities and social partners to lay down terms and conditions of employment which are more favourable to workers according to the different traditions in the Member States, MEPs pointed out.
The legal basis of the PWD could however be broadened to include a reference to the free movement of workers. It could also be partially reviewed with specific regard to the issues of applicable working conditions. However, any review of that directive should be done after a thorough analysis at national level of the actual challenges to the different models of collective agreement, added the report.
Proportionality principle
MEPs also question the introduction of a "proportionality principle" to the right to take collective actions against firms that use the right of establishment or the right to provide services across borders while deliberately undercutting terms and conditions of employment.
Letter-box companies
Lastly, the Member States and the Commission are asked to adopt measures to combat "letterbox-companies" which are not engaged in any genuine and effective business in the country of establishment but have been created to circumvent the full application of rules and regulations in the host country, especially on wages and working conditions.
Background
In the Viking case, the Viking company wanted to re-flag a vessel from Finland to Estonia to avoid the constraints of Finnish collective bargaining agreements. In the Laval case, a Swedish trade union tried, through collective action, to force a Latvian service provider to sign a collective agreement when performing services in Sweden. In two judgments handed down in December 2007, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in favour of Viking and Laval, which had complained, respectively, of violations of the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services.
In April 2008, the ECJ delivered its verdict in the Rüffert case, which concerns the right of public authorities, when awarding contracts for work, to demand that tendering companies commit themselves to pay wages that are in line with rates already agreed through collective bargaining in the place where the work is carried out, or whether this could be outlawed as a restriction on the freedom to provide services under Article 49 of the Treaty.
In the Luxembourg case, the ECJ ruled in favour of the European Commission, which accused Luxembourg of transposing the 1996 PWD too restrictively into Luxembourg law. Challenges to collective agreements in the EU Text adopted by the EP will be available here (click on 22 October)

A safer Internet for children
2008-10-27 - 13:43
Children and teenagers are keen Internet users - 12 to 15-year-olds spend at least three hours a day in front of the screen - but are not always aware of the dangers: not just sites showing child pornography or violence, but also the risk of bullying or grooming. MEPs adopted a report on a proposal to ensure better protection for children against these dangers backing the latest "Safer Internet" programme for 2009 -2013. The proposal seeks to introduce a new "Safer Internet" programme to run from 2009 to 2013, following on from the success of the current programme (2005-2008). The aim is to anticipate discernable trends in the online environment. With a budget of €55 million, the programme will combat illegal content, promote a safer online environment, raise public awareness and establish a "knowledge base" for research purposes. Parliament is working on this legislation in co-decision with the Council of Ministers.
The programme will provide:
- national contact points for reporting illegal content and harmful conduct;
- involvement of children and young people in initiatives to create a safer online environment;
- greater public awareness (information campaigns, exchange of best practice);
- a knowledge base, bringing together researchers engaged in child safety online.
The report drafted by Roberta Angelilli (UEN, IT), supports the Commission proposal with a number of amendments including greater emphasis on combating new developments such as the electronic harassment and psychological manipulation of children and the showing of physical and/or psychological aggression. The House sugggests setting up a common "child-safe" label for webpages, as well as information packages for teachers, carers and parents.
MEPs also say hotlines should be available for reporting illegal online content, and filters should be set up to prevent offending content from passing through on-line technologies. In addition, they wish to facilitate information exchange between Member States, since illegal content can be uploaded in one country and viewed in another.
The report was adopted with 672 votes in favour, 9 against and 19 abstentions. Text, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 22 October)

Divorce for international couples: MEPs back bid to clarify the legal options
2008-10-27 - 13:43
Parliament backed, by an overwhelming majority (522-89, with 35 abstentions), a proposed Regulation seeking to reduce the number of disputes about the country in which divorce proceedings should take place. The proposal does not create a standard EU-wide divorce system, but it does attempt to help the 170,000 couples affected to choose which country's law will apply for their divorce. The UK has opted out of this legislation and Ireland has also not indicated that it will take part. The aim of the draft Regulation is to allow couples to choose the Member State where they wish to divorce, if they have defined links with it, such as it being their country of residence or of nationality, or where the divorce application is lodged. MEPs suggest adding the country where the marriage took place, subject to the chosen legal system being in conformity with fundamental rights. Information to couples The proposal provides for the two parties to be informed of their rights, to prevent the choice of law applicable creating a disadvantage for either member of a couple. However, MEPs are proposing amendments emphasising the need to inform couples of the practical repercussions of their choices, and seeking to ensure that they receive full, reliable information before signing any act. For this purpose, they suggest the creation of an information system on the internet. What happens next? The UK has opted out of this legislation. Moreover, for it to come into force, it still requires the unanimous approval of the other 26 Member States. At this stage, nine countries (France, Italy, Spain, Romania, Austria, Hungary, Greece, Slovenia and Luxembourg) have agreed to use the so-called "enhanced cooperation" method, which would enable them to proceed on their own.

Questions raised about agreement with Australia on passenger name records
2008-10-27 - 13:43
The European Parliament adapted a report criticising the Council for concluding an agreement with Australia on the processing and transfer of passenger name records (PNR) without consulting or even informing the European Parliament. MEPs are concerned about the consequences of the agreement for EU citizens' right to data protection. The report was adopted with 610 votes in favour, 29 against and 47 abstentions. In its recommendation, by Sophie In 't Veld (ALDE, NL), the House says the procedure followed for the conclusion of the agreement lacks democratic legitimacy, as at no stage was there any meaningful democratic scrutiny or parliamentary approval. Despite repeated requests, Parliament has at no point been informed or consulted. The House questions the legal base chosen by the Council for the agreement and says Parliament "reserves its right to intervene before the Court of Justice". Data protection The text "welcomes the fact that the Australian Privacy Act applies unabridged to EU citizens, but is concerned about any exceptions and exemptions that may leave EU citizens with incomplete legal protection". Indeed, the European Parliament points out that the agreement covers "a wide range of purposes", "making it impossible to establish if the measures are justified and proportional". As a result, the agreement "could fail to meet EU and international data protection standards". Parliament also believes that "an exchange of diplomatic notes is an unacceptable method for amending the list of departments and agencies that may have access to PNR data". Lastly, the recommendation reminds the Council that "in the event of entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon all the PNR agreements should be reviewed by associating the European Parliament on a fair basis".

Body scanners at airports: MEPs say that fundamental rights under threat
2008-10-27 - 13:43
In adopting a resolution on the impact of security measures and body scanners on human rights, privacy, personal dignity and data protection, MEPs believe that this draft measure could exceed the implementing powers as the measures foreseen cannot be considered mere technical measures related to security, but have a serious impact on the fundamental rights of citizens. MEPs consider that the conditions for a decision have not yet been met, given that essential information is still lacking. Virtual strip search
Parliament points out that the Commission has proposed a draft Commission regulation supplementing the common basic standards on civil aviation security, which inserts among the permitted methods for screening of passengers in EU airports 'body scanners', i.e. machines producing scanned images of persons as if they were naked, equivalent to a virtual strip search.
The resolution was adopted with 361 votes in favour, 16 against and 181 abstentions.
The House also says that a European framework to guarantee the rights of European passengers, in the event of body scanners being used, is essential to prevent each airport from applying different regulations and the decision of the Commission to phase out the ban on liquids by April 2010 at the latest is a positive step forward .
In the debate in Strasbourg on 21 October, Philip Bradbourn (EPP-ED, UK, West Midlands, Conservative) said: "this technology has the potential – and, I stress, the potential – to force air passengers to undergo what could be seen as undignifying treatment, and this is certainly not a small technical step. We have already seen, with the liquids rules, that the precedent is being set for extra security measures to become the norm in airports. However inconvenient these liquids rules are to passengers, it is certainly not an invasion of privacy.
Other major concerns I have are with the storage of data. As I understand, storing of images is not the initial intention, but this is not to say that it is not possible to do so. Therefore, could the Commission outline what events could lead to the storing of this data, how it would be protected, and whether (and how) it could be ruled today that this possibility would not be used, so that it could be ruled out completely, thereby greatly alleviating many of the concerns of law-abiding passengers?"
MEPs ask the Commission to:
- carry out a fundamental rights impact assessment;
- consult the EDPS, the Article 29 Working Party and the FRA;
- carry out a scientific and medical assessment of the possible health impact of such technologies;
- carry out an economic, commercial and cost-benefit impact assessment;
The House considers that that all aviation security measures, including use of body scanners, should respect the principle of proportionality as justified and necessary in a democratic society, and therefore asks relevant authorities, as a matter of urgency, to urgently deliver an opinion on body scanners by the beginning of November 2008.
Parliament reserves the right to verify the compatibility of such measures with human rights and fundamental freedoms with the EU legal services, and to take the necessary follow-up actions.

Alliance of Civilisations: Jorge Sampaio addresses MEPs
2008-10-27 - 13:43
Building bridges and altering misguided perceptions of other cultures are crucial in a globalised world, according to Jorge Sampaio, UN High Representative for the Alliance of Civilizations and a former President of Portugal. He addressed a formal sitting of the EP on 22 October on the subject of cultural diversity, in a speech given as part of the EP's series of guest speeches for Year of Intercultural Dialogue. In his introduction, the President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering , stressed the shared outlook between the UN Alliance of Civilisations and the EP, with their emphasis on the importance of cultural interaction, and argued that there was a need in the modern world for practical not just symbolic steps on this front, such as the many projects the EP had supported in the context of Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
Message from UN Secretary General
At the start of his address, Mr Sampaio read out a short statement on behalf of the UN Secretary General, which said that, "like many other regions of the world, Europe faces multiple challenges in promoting intercultural dialogue. Migration, economic uncertainty and political tensions are putting strains on relations between different cultural, ethnic and religious groups. But it is precisely in your region, where constructive contacts over the centuries have allowed humanity to take major leaps forward, that opportunities for reconciliation and cooperation exist." Ultimately, "Cross-cultural tolerance, dialogue, respect and understanding must be pillars of the better world we are trying to build."
Alliance of Civilisations: a response to global challenge of cultural diversity
In his own speech, Mr Sampaio described the Alliance of Civilisations as a response to a modern global challenge - linked to globalisation, increased migration and 9/11 - namely "the huge - ethnic, cultural and religious - diversity of our societies and of the increasing difficulties we experience in living together".
He spoke of "the worsening divides of all types, the erosion of social cohesion and the widening rifts between societies" and of "a widespread malaise that has been expressed in increased tensions" among communities, in "mutual distrust, in polarized perceptions and world views, in intractable identity-based conflicts, and in the rise of extremism".
In his view, even serious crises such as the current financial and economic turmoil must not deflect us from handling these "in-depth problems".
Against this background, the AoC's main task had been defined as the promotion of "glocal deliverables", i.e. projects underpinned by a global approach but implemented at local level. An example was the already agreed "Action Plan on cooperation between the European Union and the Alliance of Civilizations". He also backed President Pöttering's call for the work of Year of Intercultural Dialogue to continue beyond the end of 2008, and described the Union for the Mediterranean as another area where the Alliance is keen to collaborate.
Integration of minorities, notably Muslims, and the question of Europe's identity
Turning to the big issues, he said these were "how to integrate minorities, all minorities, but the Muslims of Europe in particular? How to develop our relationship with the Mediterranean? Where to draw the lines of the European project? How to enhance European foreign policy to project what we consider universal values to the world?"
However, he chose to focus on the most pressing intercultural question of the day, "the issue of Muslim minorities in Europe".
He asked "Why there is growing anxiety about the integration of Muslims in Europe? Because it is a demographic issue? Yes, of course! Because of the integration issue? No doubt about that! In my view, the presence of Muslims in Europe is not a question of Islam and the West, but an acute problem of integration." The question was one of Europe's identity.
Mr Sampaio argued that to cope with the integration of Muslims in our European societies we need new policies at all levels, from "democratic governance of cultural diversity" to education on human rights, citizenship and religions and beliefs.
'No' to the 'clash of civilisations': vast majority everywhere rejects extremism
He went on: "the current international difficulties and the increasing anxiety we all feel in living together in mutual respect have encouraged the misguided view that cultures are set on an unavoidable collision course leading to a clash of civilizations". However, he stressed that "the vast majority of peoples reject extremism in any society and support respect for religious and cultural diversity".
Remedies: 'mind shift among divided communities' and protection of basic rights
In conclusion, Mr Sampaio described two developments required to tackle the problems he had set out. First, there was a need to generate "a mind shift among divided communities". Secondly, to develop "democratic governance of cultural diversity". In the European Union this implies creating a collective identity among its citizens, he believed. And this is why "cultural diversity should go hand in hand with protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, equal opportunities for all, economic solidarity and social cohesion".

Vietnam: MEPs want progress on human rights before cooperation agreement is signed

In a resolution on EU-Vietnam relations, Parliament calls for Vietnam to be pressed to observe human rights and various key freedoms before a new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with the EU is finalised. According to the resolution, which was adopted by 479 votes to 21 with 4 abstentions, freedom of assembly and of the press as well as internet access are severely restricted in Vietnam, while religious groups and ethnic minorities - such as Catholics, Buddhists and the Montagnard and Khmer minorities - suffer discrimination and persecution. Better implementation of human rights under existing accord needed Looking, firstly, to the current EU-Vietnam cooperation agreement, Parliament stresses that "the human rights dialogue between the European Union and Vietnam must lead to tangible improvements in Vietnam" and "asks the Council and the Commission to reassess cooperation policy with Vietnam, bearing in mind Article 1 of the 1995 Cooperation Agreement, which states that cooperation is based on respect for democratic principles and fundamental rights". It calls on the Commission "to establish clear benchmarks for the evaluation of the current development projects in Vietnam in order to ensure their compliance with the human rights and democracy clause". New agreement not to be finalised until rights violations stop Secondly, MEPs urge the Commission and the Council, in the current negotiations for a new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, "to raise with the Vietnamese side the need to stop the current systematic violation of democracy and human rights before the finalisation of the agreement". In particular, Parliament, which has a consultative role in the conclusion of the new agreement, wants Vietnam to be asked: - to cooperate actively with UN human rights mechanisms, by inviting the Special Rapporteur on Religious Intolerance to visit Vietnam; - to release all people imprisoned or detained for the peaceful expression of political or religious beliefs; - to allow independent religious organisations to freely conduct religious activities without government interference; - to repeal provisions in Vietnamese law that criminalise dissent and certain religious activities on the basis of imprecisely defined ‘national security’ crimes; - to end the Vietnamese Government’s censorship and control over the domestic media.

Parliament gives its assent to agreement with Bosnia
2008-10-27 - 13:43
MEPs gave their assent to the conclusion of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). In a resolution adopted on 23 October, MEPs point out the issues where Bosnian authorities need to make progress: reform of the state, return of refugees, non-discriminatory access to education and future constitutional structure. MEPs are also in favour of strengthening the EU Special Representative's role. MEPs welcome the agreement which has the potential to boost BiH's economy but remind political leaders that this can be achieved only if they pursue with determination reforms at all levels - state, entity and local. This should be done with a view to modernising the country and making it more efficient and compatible with EU standards. BiH should abolish all unnecessary legal and administrative barriers and streamline its administrative structures, according to the resolution. MEPs have reaffirmed that the membership prospect of BiH as a single state, and not for its entities, which do not enjoy autonomous sovereignty. Disarmament Calls on the Commission to guarantee EU funding for the UN programme on disarmament so that the destruction of the surplus weapons, military equipment and ammunition of the BiH armed forces can continue under UN supervision. Situation of refugees The report drafted by Doris PACK (EPP-ED, DE) is concerned by the lack of progress in refugees' and IDPs' returns, for example in the region of Posavina, located in the Republika Srpska. Local authorities should be more involved and adequate housing, infrastructure and employment in the areas of origin needs to be provided. Education Serious efforts need to be undertaken in order to overcome the segregationist structures currently operating in the country, according to MEPs, since this is key to promoting employability but is also instrumental in achieving reconciliation. Future constitutional set-up MEPs are of the view that the debate on the future constitutional set-up of BiH must be led by the Bosnian Parliament. Any constitutional settlement must be the product of voluntary agreement between the different political parties in BiH. The international community and the EUSR must play a facilitator's role. MEPs are in favour of strengthening the EU Special Representative's role when the Office of the High Representative is closed down, but remind that this can only happen when all the conditions set by the International Community are fulfilled. MEPs are in favour of closing down the Office of the High Representative. Stabilisation and Association Agreements The SAA with BiH has been signed in June 2008. SAAs are the first step towards accession to the European Union, provided that the Copenhagen criteria are fulfilled. The EU Summit in Thessaloniki (June 2003) reaffirmed the prospect of EU membership for the countries of the Western Balkans. The resolution was adopted with 567 votes in favour, 21 against and 5 abstentions. Text, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 23 October)

Parliament recognises Ukrainian famine of 1930s as crime against humanity
2008-10-27 - 13:43
In a resolution on the commemoration of the Holodomor, the artificial famine in Ukraine in 1932-1933, MEPs describe it as "an appalling crime against the Ukrainian people, and against humanity". According to the resolution, the Holodomor famine of 1932-1933, which caused the deaths of millions of Ukrainians, "was cynically and cruelly planned by Stalin's regime in order to force through the Soviet Union's policy of collectivisation of agriculture against the will of the rural population in Ukraine". MEPs believe that "recalling crimes against humanity in European history should help to prevent similar crimes in the future" and they stress that "European integration has been based on a readiness to come to terms with the 20th century's tragic history and that this reconciliation with a difficult history does not denote any sense of collective guilt, but forms a stable basis for the construction of a common European future founded on common values". The resolution therefore makes a "declaration to the people of Ukraine and in particular to the remaining survivors of the Holodomor and the families and relatives of the victims". It "recognises the Holodomor (the artificial famine of 1932-1933 in Ukraine) as an appalling crime against the Ukrainian people, and against humanity". The text then "strongly condemns these acts, directed against the Ukrainian peasantry, and marked by mass annihilation and violations of human rights and freedoms". It also "expresses its sympathy with the Ukrainian people, which suffered this tragedy, and pays its respects to those who died as a consequence of the artificial famine of 1932-1933". Lastly, the resolution "calls on the countries which emerged following the break-up of the Soviet Union to open up their archives on the Holodomor in Ukraine of 1932-1933 to comprehensive scrutiny so that all the causes and consequences can be revealed and fully investigated".

Transport
MEPs agree common charge system for EU airports
2008-10-27 - 13:43
Common principles for levying charges at Community airports are set out in a second-reading report adopted by the European Parliament on a directive to prevent individual airports abusing a dominant position on the market. MEPs want the rules to apply to airports with an annual throughput of over five million passengers per year, whereas the Commission had proposed one million. Safeguarding consumer interests
At Parliament's request, the proposal also provides for mechanisms for consulting airport users, and for resolving disputes between users and airports. MEPs say these are necessary to establish a level playing field for economic operators and ultimately also to safeguard consumer interests.
Small airports exempted
MEPs say (and the Council agrees) that applying the rules to smaller airports, with under one million passengers a year, would have imposed administrative and bureaucratic burdens, to no great effect, on airports that are not in competition due to geographic and structural factors. However, the Directive will apply to the largest airport in each Member State, irrespective of passenger numbers.
Clear, objective criteria
The European Parliament also saw to it that any differentiation in airports' charges will have to be based on transparent and objective criteria. The Council Common Position, published on 23 June, also makes it clear that there should be a national independent supervisory body, rather than merely regional ones, which is also in line with Parliament's position. The House also won a tighter definition of an "airport network", which means one that is operated by the same management body.
Disadvantaged and outermost regions
Transport Ministers also accept that incentives should be permitted for new routes to disadvantaged and outermost regions and that uniform charging systems may be applied by management bodies serving the same network only on the basis of transparent criteria.
Disabled and reduced-mobility passenger charges excluded
In addition to the above, charges for the provision of services to disabled and reduced-mobility passengers mobility will be excluded from the scope of the Directive.
Amendments to the Common Position
The Council had already given a formal written commitment to accept a further series of parliamentary amendments if tabled at the second reading. These amendments deal with pre-financing of airport investments and link pre-financing to ICAO policies and the need for safeguards. Firm deadlines for the publication of decisions on charges are also laid down in the proposal.
EU airports possibly covered by the Directive on airport charges
Scope of the Directive : Annual traffic over 5 million passenger movements and the airport with the highest passenger movement in each Member State. Based on 2007 figures, 69 airports in the EU would fall under the scope of the Directive. They are listed, hereunder in alphabetical order.

Budget
MEPs adopt first reading position on EU budget for 2009 at €136 billion
2008-10-27 - 13:43
The European Parliament adopted the 2009 draft budget substantially higher than that adopted by Council in its July first reading. Commitments are set at €136 bn (1.04 % of GNI), payments are €124.5bn (equivalent of 0.959% of EU GNI). Council had adopted a draft budget of 133.9bn in commitments and €114.9bn in payments. With this vote, Parliament has stayed within the margins of the Financial Perspective. According to the EU's commitments, the fight against climate change, the EU's social dimension and security questions are Parliament's priorities for 2009. External relations stay, as usual, a baffling problem because this budget heading has been under funded ever since the current financial perspective was adopted. The gap between the forecasts of financial needs ("commitments") and programmed expenditure ("payments") entered in the draft 2009 budget by the Council has never been so wide as this year. MEPs believe that the Council's cuts had made it impossible to meet the EU's commitments and decided to diminish this disparity.
Heading 1a & 1b "Sustainable growth"
The EP is seeking to expand the budget for the EU's social and employment dimension, i.e. the policy goals mainly included in Headings 1a (Competitiveness) and 1b (Cohesion). This includes the European Social Fund (which MEPs believe should get over €135m extra for convergence, employment and growth), the Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund. A package of measures is targeted at small and medium-sized firms.
MEPs also propose an increase in the payments for the programme to improve the financial environment for SMEs. In addition, they wish to launch pilot projects such as the Erasmus programme for entrepreneurs or measures to aid SMEs to seize opportunities to internationalise their activity.
Heading 2 "Natural resources"
The EP calls for the re-establishment of the figures in the PDB for CAP spending, reduced after Council's cut. Parliament is also concerned with the fall in real terms of spending on rural development, despite the need to restructure the rural economy. MEPs want to increase by over €2bn the total spending on certain budget headings for EU measures against climate change. In many cases, it means taking greater account of climate change in existing programmes, such as rural development, transport, research and the environment. For example, MEPs wish to virtually double the payments for the LIFE+ programme. MEPs also call for a new budget line for climate change in Heading 2 to make the budget more transparent and comprehensible. This would allow measures to combat climate change and the funding allocated to this area to be grouped together. In addition to these transferred amounts, MEPs wish to allocate €20m extra to this new heading.
Heading 3 "Justice and Home Affairs"
Given the urgency of immigration matters, the Parliament proposes an increase for the agency managing EU external borders (Frontex plus €10 million in commitments and payments to a total of €55 million but 5 million are put in reserve). This extra money should be devoted to enable Frontex to sustain the comitment to permanent missions at the Southern EU borders.
The EP suggests as well as to increase the funds for external borders, to refugee Fund and emergency measures in the event of mass influxes of refugees.
MEPs consider that there is no justification for the Council's cuts in credits aiming to finance Schengen Information System (SIS II) and visas information system and propose to reinstate the PDB amounts.
Heading 4 "the EU as a global partner"
The EP wants to keep the amounts for European security and defence policy laid down in the Commission's PDB. It would also preserve the EU funding for Palestine proposed in the PDB and increased by the Commission in its amending letter (€300m in commitments and €280m in payments). Funding for aid to Kosovo, financed from several different headings, is also the same as the amount proposed by the Commission. Aid for reconstruction in Afghanistan (€160m in commitments and €150 in payments) also remains at the same level as in the PDB.
Parliament has stayed within the ceiling of heading 4. However, the experience of past years clearly shows that these figures are not enough. MEPs therefore wish to persuade the Council to grant more money to external policy. The money needed could be found by, for example, using the flexibility mechanism or emergency aid. This will be a crucial issue at the negotiations on 21 November. An amendment adopted by the Budgets Committee groups together all the policy priorities for which the budget does not cover the extra funding demanded by MEPs (which would exceed the allowed ceilings of €390m). It includes new objectives which have recently emerged: food aid for developing countries and reconstruction aid for Georgia. MEPs included the amount needed in 2009 for food aid accordingly to the EC proposal (€250m under the 2009 budget).
Turning to the commitments given by Member States on reconstruction aid for Georgia, MEPs adopted a number of amendments to take account of the situation in that country in existing programmes and policies [Am 997, 1000, 1026] as stability instrument, European Neighborhood Policy or humanitarian aid. However, Parliament cannot allocate directly funding for the reconstruction of Georgia while there is no legal basis. MEPs therefore decided to create a special budget line for aid to Georgia but without granting it any funding, pending the outcome of the donors' conference
Heading 5 "administration "
On the question of the posts at the Commission, for which Council had proposed a major cut, Parliament has reinstated the initial funding put forward by the Commission in its pre-draft budget. 50m go in the reserve, though, which will be released if a number of conditions are fulfilled. One of these conditions features a "screening" of administrative needs to be done by the Commission as well as a redeployment plan.
Other institutions
The so-called "other institutions", for which Mr Janusz Lewandowski (PPE-DE, PL) is the rapporteur, deal among others, with Parliament's budget for next year. The EP's draft budget set a level of 1.530 millions in commitments and payments. It represents 19.67 % of heading 5, then only a minimal increase in comparison with the previous budget. This increase is justified by the entry into force of the statute for Members of the EP as well as introduction of unified transparent regulations for employment of parliamentary assistants in Brussels and Strasbourg.
Next steps
The next key step now sees Parliament and Council engaged in the second conciliation on 21 November, aiming to strike an agreement before the second-reading. The 2009 Budget should be approved and signed in December in Strasbourg.

Belgian film 'Le Silence de Lorna' winner of the EP LUX Prize for cinema
2008-10-27 - 13:43
The film 'Le Silence de Lorna', by the Belgian directors Jean-Pierre and Luc DARDENNE, is the winner of the European Parliament Cinema Prize LUX 2008. EP President, Hans-Gert Pöttering handed over the trophy to Luc Dardennne in a ceremony in front of MEPs and representatives of the three competing films in the final. The aim of the LUX Prize is to facilitate the circulation of European films within Europe. Awarding the prize, Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering said: "The European Parliament has always recognised the pivotal role culture plays in our society and the award of the second LUX Prize reflects this. One of the objectives of the prize is to experience cultural and language differences within the EU. With this year's winner, a major social issue affecting Europe can be brought to cinemas in all European countries."
Director Luc Dardenne said, on receiving the prize: "We don't see enough of each other's films in different countries of the European Union. I think this prize is the first step in remedying this problem."
Aim of the LUX Prize
The aim of the LUX Prize, awarded for the first time in 2007, is to break down the language barriers that prevent European films from circulating in the EU and give a boost to cinematic work within the EU. The winner of the LUX Prize will have his film subtitled in the Union's 23 languages and one copy will be produced per Member State in 35mm format. The Prize also covers an adaptation for the deaf and hard of hearing, and eventually an adaptation for blind and visual impaired-people.
The competition
'Le Silence de Lorna' was selected by the MEPs who could vote for three films in competition; 'Le Silence de Lorna' (Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne) 'Delta' (Kornél MUNDRUCZÓ) and 'Obcan Havel' (Miroslav JANEK and Pavel KOUTECKÝ)
The three films were part on an official selection of 10 films, selected by a 17-strong independent panel drawn from the highest level of the cinema profession: producers, distributors, cinema operators, festival directors, critics, etc.
In order to be eligible, the film should illustrate the universality of European values and/or the diversity of European culture and/or bringing insights into the debate on the process of building Europe. The films have been shown in the European Parliament in Brussels from 15 September-17 October 2008.
The LUX Prize was awarded for the first time in 2007 to the Turkish-German co production "On the Edge of Heaven" ( "Auf der anderen Seite" ).

Consumers
Timeshares: Parliament and Council agree new rules
2008-10-27 - 13:43
The timeshare holiday rights of some 1.5 million European families will soon be better protected, as MEPs endorsed a compromise reached between Parliament and Council on the new Timeshare Directive. The directive seeks to enhance consumer confidence and legal clarity, which are essential to the growth of this sector, via simplified EU-wide rules. The resolution was adopted with 674 votes in favour, 16 against and 10 abstentions. Timeshare deals, which allow buyers to occupy holiday accommodation for specific periods in alternation with others, have won millions of takers worldwide since the 1970s. They are often sold as a cost-effective alternative to renting, hotels or a second residence. According to the Organisation for Timeshare in Europe, in 2001 there were 1.452 holiday centres in 25 European countries, 1.4 million families using this kind of accommodation and 200,000 Europeans employed in the sector, with sales totalling €2.3 billion per year. Most timeshare holidaymakers are from Germany or the UK, where most of the agencies are located, while most of the holiday centres are located in Spain, Italy, France and Portugal. Why a new directive? Since 1994, an EU directive has helped to harmonise timeshare rules across the EU, but litigation between operators and holidaymakers is still frequent, notably over conditions and quality of service. Furthermore, new holiday products and services, similar to timeshare but not covered by the directive, have emerged. These include new types of holiday clubs giving holidaymakers reductions in the cost of their stays if they take out a subscription. Some of these new contracts clearly circumvent consumer protection rules. The revised draft directive, which supplements the general rules introduced by the recent directive on unfair commercial practices, will cover both timeshare packages and new products that so far have escaped any legislation. Consumers will be better protected by rules that clearly state their rights, and will find it easier to go to court. Honest operators will no longer have to face unfair competition from fraudsters. Content of the new directive The directive lays down new rules on the right of withdrawal, choice of contract language, pre-contractual information and a ban on taking deposits during the cooling-off period. The directive's scope is also broader than the old legislation. "Long-term holiday products" (holiday clubs), which were less common at the time the original directive was adopted, will fall within its ambit, as will re-sales and exchanges of timeshares. It will cover not just traditional property timeshares but also boats, caravans and cruise ships marketed under timeshare or holiday club contracts. The legislation applies to contracts for "more than one period of occupation" of the accommodation (i.e. repeated visits) concluded for a period of more than one year (previously three years). Any ancillary contracts will be cancelled if the consumer withdraws from the main contract. A key point introduced by MEPs is a provision for staggered payments for holiday clubs: buyers will pay equal yearly instalments rather than a lump sum up-front. MEPs also successfully defended the 14-day cooling-off period granted to buyers after signing a timeshare contract, as proposed by the Commission, against Council's wish to shorten it to 10 days. Lastly, Member States will have to encourage the creation of effective out-of-court complaints and redress procedures for settling consumer disputes and must encourage traders to inform consumers of such procedures. British speakers in the debate held in Strasbourg on 22 October Malcolm Harbour (EPP-ED, UK) said: "If you look at the advertising clause it is now clearly spelt out that any promotional activity in relation to a timeshare or holiday club has to be clearly shown and designated in advertising as such. Also, the standardised information that we have asked to be available has to be available at all times at any sort of promotional event, so there can be no question of people being misled by some attractive trip, visit or offer. It has to be absolutely clear what it is they are talking about, and that it should not be sold as an investment. Overall, this is a major advance in consumer protection. I fully commend it and I am sure that it will get the overwhelming support of the House today." Arlene McCarthy (PES, UK) said: "This timeshare law is long overdue. With this law, consumers must be given the key information on the standard information sheet – including all fees and charges – and, if the company fails to provide it, the law extends the right of withdrawal to three months. Failure to inform the consumer of the right of withdrawal extends the right of withdrawal to one year. These really are good rights for consumers. They will turn our traders into responsible traders and we will have informed and protected consumers, which means we can drive out of the market the dodgy dealers and the scam merchants. " Philip Bradbourn (EPP-ED, UK) said: "Extending the scope to cover holiday clubs and other similar products is a great step forward in protecting the consumer from what had previously been an easy target for the unscrupulous tout. This directive certainly shows that the EU is taking steps to stay ahead of the game. I have to admit, however, that I am disappointed that Parliament had to give way on a provision calling for cooling-off periods of 21 days in order to reach agreement with the Council. However, this is not to say that the improvements made had no effect on the current directive and, in fact, it is to be welcomed that no upfront payments have to be made until the end of the cooling-off period."

Deal on the marketing authorisations for medicinal products
2008-10-27 - 13:43
Parliament adopted a report on a first-reading agreement concerning a Commission proposal to harmonise the regulatory system used to change marketing authorisations for medicinal products (changes subsequent to the placing on the market, such as change in the production process, change in the packaging or change in the address of the manufacturer, update of patient information leaflet). The deal ensures that all medicinal products placed on the Community market - including those authorised at purely national level - are subject to the same criteria for the approval and administrative handling of changes, regardless of the procedure under which those medicines have been authorised (national or EU procedure). All operators within the European Community will thus be subject to the same rules for the approval, administrative treatment and supervision of changes to medicinal products, thereby eliminating, and diverging, redundant and contradicting requirements. A compromise at first reading has been agreed with Council taking on board many of the demands of the Environment Committee. Within the European Community, medicinal products are regulated throughout their entire lifetime. Changes subsequent to their placing on the market, are governed either by national provisions or by Community rules: "Variations Regulations". However, the current Variations Regulations do not apply to changes to marketing authorisations for medicinal products which have been granted at a national level by a Member State competent authority under a national procedure. In the absence of Community harmonisation, changes affecting purely national authorisations are therefore subject to national rules, which differ quite substantially. The objective of the proposal is, therefore, to empower the Commission to extend the scope of the corresponding Variations Regulation to ensure that all medicinal products placed on the Community market -including those authorised at purely national level - are subject to the same criteria for the approval and administrative handling of changes, regardless of the procedure under which those medicines have been authorised. - In certain cases MEPs want to give Member States the possibility to continue to apply national provisions - MEPs want to extend the possibility of submitting a single application in certain cases - MEPs want to prolong the transition period from 12 month to 18 month after entry into force. The report was adopted with 675 votes in favour, 21 against and 8 abstentions. Text, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 22 October)

MEPs back new Erasmus Mundus Programme for student mobility and university exchanges
2008-10-27 - 13:43
MEPs gave the green light to a second funding period for the EU's Erasmus Mundus Programme, which aims to promote the EU as a centre of academic excellence. In backing the estimated budget of €950million for the 2009-2013 period of the new programme, Parliament adopted changes to some of the criteria for obtaining funding, with a view to simplifying visa applications for participants from non-EU countries and ensuring a balance in terms of students' gender and country of origin. Parliament's rapporteur Marielle de Sarnez (ALDE, FR) said, during Monday evening's (20 October) debate in Strasbourg: "It is a good programme, and considering the difficult times we are going through, this is giving a positive image of Europe in the rest of the world." She underlined the importance of ensuring a balanced participation in both gender and the countries the students come from. For the moment, she pointed out, there is a majority of students coming from Asia, and more should be done to ensure that more students from other parts of the world participate.
Following today's vote and agreement with the Council of Ministers, the new Programme should be able to begin as planned at the start of 2009. In the debate on Monday evening, Commissioner Figel said: "As soon as the legislative procedure is finalised, we will launch our call for proposals, in order to ensure the smooth continuation of existing courses and the selection of new programmes".
European students also to gain scholarships
The Erasmus Mundus programme seeks to attract the best-qualified students and academics from non-EU countries by offering high-quality masters or doctoral programmes created by consortia of universities from at least three different countries. The programme also seeks to create partnerships between universities within and beyond Europe, as well as promoting European higher education internationally. Students from non-EU countries can obtain scholarships for Masters or doctorate programmes offered by the participating universities. For the first time in the new funding stream from 2009, European students will also be able to apply for scholarships to participate in Erasmus Mundus Masters programmes, though the majority of scholarships will still go to students and academics from countries outside the EU.
MEPs suggest simplified visa procedures
To facilitate exchanges within the programme, the European Parliament adopted amendments to the programme encouraging Member States to consider simplifying their visa procedures. MEPs also stressed that students should be informed of their initial study destination as soon as the decision has been taken so they have the time to obtain visas.
Linguistic diversity and access for all
As linguistic diversity is a high priority for the Community in higher education, MEPs have insisted that the Masters and doctoral programmes should provide for the use of at least two EU languages, and the students should be offered language preparation. MEPs also wish to facilitate access to the programme in accordance with the principle of equal opportunities and non-discrimination and to ensure a balanced participation, in terms of both gender and the countries of origin of those participating.
Background notes
In the previous Erasmus Mundus programme (2004-8), 4424 scholarships were granted to students from outside the EU; 323 universities took part, 265 of them in Europe.
The funding of the first Erasmus Mundus Programme amounted to €230m - the 2009-2013 programme will have €980m. (The classic Erasmus programme - for academic mobility within the EU - has a budget for 2007-2013 of € 3,114 million.)

Deal on the promotion of clean road transport vehicles
2008-10-27 - 13:43
Parliament adopted a first-reading agreement with Council on the promotion of clean road transport vehicles. The most important point of the deal is that the directive stays mandatory, but that Member States are given some flexibility. The aim of the directive is to promote and stipulate the market for clean and efficient vehicles to prompt industry to develop and invest in environmentally-friendly vehicles. The proposal concerns the promotion of clean and energy-efficient road transport by obliging public authorities and certain operators to consider not only the cost, but the environmental impact, of the vehicles that they plan to purchase.
Mandatory requirement to take into account lifetime energy and environmental impacts when purchasing road transport vehicles
The compromise would require all contracting authorities and entities and certain operators to consider not only the purchase price of vehicles but also their lifetime energy and environmental impacts (including energy consumption, CO2 emissions and emissions of certain pollutants (including NOx, NMHC and particulate matter)), when purchasing road transport vehicles.
MEPs managed to keep this requirement mandatory but inserted certain flexibility in the directive giving Member states different options to fulfil the requirement. If a procurement procedure is applied, the environmental impacts shall be used as award criteria and the operational lifetime costs for energy consumption, CO2 emissions and pollutants emissions shall be monetised and calculates following a methodology specifies in the directive.
Scope
The directive covers not only public procurers but also road transport vehicles purchased by contracting authorities and contracting entities irrespective whether they are public or private. It furthermore covers the purchase of road transport vehicles used for performing public passenger transports under an public service contract, giving the Member States the freedom to exclude minor purchases with a view to avoiding unnecessary administrative burden.
Member States, furthermore, have the possibility to exempt vehicles designed and constructed for special use (vehicles designed and constructed for use principally on construction sites or in quarries, port or airport facilities, armed services, civil defence, fire services and forces responsible for maintaining public order; and mobile machinery).
Exchange of best practices
The Commission shall facilitate and structure the exchange of knowledge and best practices between Member States for promoting the purchase of clean and energy efficient vehicles Support for through facilitating and structuring.
Figures
Given that the total annual vehicle procurement by public authorities in the EU is estimated at 110,000 passenger cars, 110,000 light commercial vehicles, 35,000 lorries and 17,000 buses for the EU, the new directive is expected to ensure a sufficiently substantial demand for clean and energy-efficient vehicles to prompt industry to develop and invest in environmentally-friendly vehicles
Date for entry into force and transposition in national law.
Member States must transpose the directive 18 months after entry into force into national law. Entry into force is on the 20th day after publication.
Background
In June 2006, the Environment Committee rejected a similar Commission proposal. The new proposal incorporates several of the committee's requests, e.g. on the proposal's scope, technology neutrality and the inclusion of CO2 emissions.
The resolution was adopted with 641 votes in favour, 37 against and 24 abstentions. Text, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 22 October)

Fisheries
Cod stocks recovery plan: MEPs call for an end to all discards
2008-10-27 - 13:43
In their response to the European Commission's latest cod recovery plan, MEPs called for all cod caught to be landed, rather than discarded, so as to enable proper scientific evaluation of stocks. They also agreed to the inclusion of the Celtic Sea (south of the Irish Sea) in the cod recovery plan. In a second vote, on fishing in outermost regions of the EU, MEPs propose extending until 2011 the deadline for fishing vessels receiving national state aid to enter the fishing fleet. Rapporteur on cod stock recovery, Niels Busk (ALDE, DK) emphasised that the purpose of the proposed changes in the cod recovery plan is to see cod stocks restored within five to ten years. In Monday evening's debate, he spoke of the problem of illegal fishing: "It is a disgrace to the fishing stock, it is a disgrace to the fishing industry, it is an outrage against society as a whole, and the European Parliament has emphasised this time and time again."
Commissioner Borg said that he would shortly be following up with a proposal for a European regulation on reducing discards.
Among the proposals made by the European Parliament in its response to the cod recovery plan:
All cod caught to be landed, rather than discarded, so as to ensure proper scientific evaluation of stocks;
Member States as well as fishermen themselves should be encouraged to bring in measures to reduce fish mortality and discards;
The 15% +/- margin for Total Allowable Catch, established the previous year, should be generally applicable;
2004-2006 should be used as reference years, rather than 2005-2007, to ensure the highest quality and reliability of data;
Cod killed by seals, and the impact of climate change are mentioned as 'other relevant sources of cod mortality'.
Debate - Monday, 20 October
During Monday's debate, Jim Allister (NI, UK) suggested: "Increase the Total Allowable Catches, and I believe you will correspondingly reduce the discards and swell the food supply, without depleting the biomass more than we do at present through discards. That, I believe, is the way to go, along with cod avoidance plans, and then some sense might come to this policy."
Struan Stevenson (EPP-ED, UK) acknowledged that climate change had caused the North Sea to warm up by 1.5 degrees with the result that cod had moved further north. "All the tough management plans that we want to introduce will not make any difference," he said. He also raised the issue of grey seals in the North Sea and their impact on cod populations.
Avril Doyle (EPP-ED, IE) referred to an Irish proposal for a pilot project to be run in 2009 on reducing cod discards in the Nephrops fishery. She also asked for clarification on whether the Celtic Sea would be included in the recovery plan, to which Commissioner Borg replied that although the cod stock in the Celtic Sea is in better shape than other areas, 'it is still in very bad shape' and would be included.
Kathy Sinnott (IND/DEM, IE) reminded the Commissioner that cod used to be the most common fish in Irish waters and on Irish tables. "Discards," she said, "are more than a waste and a contradiction. They are an abomination."
The European Parliament is consulted on proposals in the area of fisheries policy, but the final say lies with the Council of Ministers.
Background note
The cod recovery plan, established in 2004, aims to ensure the reconstitution of cod stocks within a ten-year period to precautionary levels advised by scientists. The cod stocks covered by this plan were those in the North Sea, Kattegat and Skaggerak, the Eastern Channel , the Irish Sea and West of Scotland. Recent scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) has indicated that the reductions in cod catches arising from the collective effect of total allowable landings (TACs), technical measures and complementary effort management measures have been far from sufficient to reduce fishing mortality to levels required to allow the cod stocks to rebuild. None of the four cod stocks covered by the recovery plan show clear signs of recovery, although Committee MEPs say that stocks in the North and Celtic Seas are showing some signs of improvement. Fishery resources: recovery of cod stocks (amend. Regulations (EC) No 423/2008 and (EEC) No 2847/93) Outermost regions: management of fishing fleets (amend. Regulation (EC) No 639/2004) Texts, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 21 October)

Ombudsman
Annual report on European Ombudsman's activities calls for more initiatives to raise citizens' awareness
2008-10-27 - 13:43
The European Parliament adopted a report on the 2007 annual report of the European Ombudsman's activities. Nikiforos Diamandouros, the European Ombudsman from April 1, 2003 took part in the debate preceding the vote. The report calls for all EU institutions and bodies to be given the necessary budgetary and human resources to ensure that citizens receive prompt and substantive responses to their enquiries, complaints and petitions. Citizens need more information
The report stresses the need to further enhance the public profile of the Ombudsman. Although the number of inadmissible complaints received by the Ombudsman was lower in 2007 than in 2006, the report calls for a further reduction in the number of complaints which do not fall within the Ombudsman's remit. It considers that high-quality information may help and suggests that a common website be put in place to assist citizens.
Similarly, the report welcomes the development of an interactive manual which helps citizens identify the most suitable forum for resolving their problems. This is in recognition of the fact that citizens are not always able to distinguish between institutions when it comes to filing a complaint or petition.
More on responsibilities of Ombudsman and EU institutions
With regard to complaints that do not fall within the Ombudsman's terms of reference, Mr Diamandouros was asked to commit himself to directly forwarding each complaint to the national or regional ombudsman concerned.
With regard to the Commission, the report calls on the Ombudsman to ensure that the it makes proper use of its discretionary powers to initiate infringement proceedings, while taking scrupulous care to avoid delays or unjustifiable failure to take prompt action, which are incompatible with the Commission's powers to oversee the application of EU law.
It also repeats its call for all EU institutions and bodies to adopt a common approach with regard to the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour. The Code, which is addressed to European citizens and civil servants, informs citizens of good administration procedures and advises civil servants on what principles to observe in their activities.
In general, the report considers that Mr Diamandouros has "continued to exercise his powers in an active and balanced way".
Parliament considers that the term 'maladministration' should be broadly interpreted so as to include not only administrative acts which infringe rules or principles laid down by the Treaties or by secondary legislation but also, for example, cases where the administrative authorities themselves have assumed certain obligations through, for instance, the adoption of a code of good administrative behaviour or where approved policies or declarations of a political nature have given rise to legitimate and reasonable expectations among citizens.
The House supports the Ombudsman's efforts to promote good administration through additional remarks and suggestions to institutions and bodies even when he has not found any instance of maladministration during his inquiries, but nevertheless considers that improvements are needed in light of the objective of developing a citizen-friendly and service-minded culture within the EU's administration.

Parliament adopts resolution on maritime piracy - legally incontrovertible rules of engagement needed
2008-10-27 - 13:43
In adopting a resolution on sea piracy, the European Parliament expresses its serious concern about the growing number of maritime piracy cases, in particular in the seas off Somalia and the Horn of Africa. Criminal assaults against Community fishing, merchant and passenger vessels have increased in number and frequency. MEPs call on the Council and Member States to adopt clear and legally incontrovertible rules of engagement for the naval forces engaged in those operations.
Commission figures show that the year 2007 saw an alarming increase of 17%, totalling 282 cases. Ten vessels and more than 200 seafarers are reported to be still in the hands of pirates and, also in 2007, 20 crew members were killed. An increase of piracy acts was also reported from other parts of the world, such as the Mozambique Channel, some areas off the coast of India and the Caribbean, as well as in the Nigeria Gulf. (Commission).
Members welcome in principle the Council Joint Action, which establishes a military coordination action named EU NAVCO, but regret the lack of consultation by the Council of the European Parliament on the decision to launch this operation and to provide information to the EP about the scope of this action and the exact tasks that the "EU coordination cell" in the Council will undertake in support of EU NAVCO.
MEPs call on the Council and Member States to explain the objectives of the EU military naval operation within the framework of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1816(2008) to suppress armed robbery and piracy off the coasts of Somalia. The House acknowledges that UNSC 1816(2008) and 1838 were drafted under Chapter VII of the UN Charter as the only way to legitimise the use of force but stresses that under no circumstances should acts of piracy as well as acts against piracy be considered acts of war.
Rules of engagement
Council and Member States are also invited to adopt clear and legally incontrovertible rules of engagement for the naval forces engaged in those operations.
Council should clearly distinguish between this mandate and the anti-piracy tasks performed by its Member States within the framework of Operation Enduring Freedom-Horn of Africa, aimed at countering terrorist activities. Members request clear guidelines for detention and prosecution of captured pirates and call on the Council to avoid any involvement of EU NAVCO in the on-going conflict in Somalia. There should be effective coordination with other vessels in the region, especially those of the USA and Russia.
Parliament welcomes the Commission's intention to improve coordination with the European agencies responsible for maritime surveillance, underlining in particular the prevention of illegal activities with a special focus on international waters. It urges the Council not to equate the challenge of terrorism with the issues of illegal immigration and human and drug trafficking.
The Commission is called on to set up a Community system for mutual cooperation that would allow the vessels flying the flag of a Member State deployed in international waters to protect fishing and merchant vessels from other Member States, at the earliest possible opportunity.
The House regrets that the action taken by the Council does not concern the fishing areas in the region and calls for swift action to be taken into that effect. Council should do everything to dismantle the organised criminal networks that reap the profits of these acts of piracy. Finally, it hopes that the Commission and the UN do not neglect the path of political cooperation and normalisation with the states of the region concerned, in order to enable them to better prevent and combat crime at sea and its many root causes.
This resolution is a follow-up of the plenary debate on sea piracy held on 23 September 2008 in Brussels and was tabled by Paolo Costa (ALDE, IT), Chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism.

Human rights
Human rights: political rights abuses in Venezuela, massacres in Congo, oppression in Burma
2008-10-27 - 13:43
In three resolutions on democracy and human rights adopted at the end of this week's Strasbourg plenary session, the European Parliament condemns the use of intimidation and electoral manipulation in the run-up to elections in Venezuela, voices dismay at the renewed fighting in eastern Congo and calls on ASEM states at their summit this week to press the Burmese regime to release all political prisoners. Intimidation of opposition candidates in Venezuela
In the run-up to Venezuela's regional and local elections in November 2008, Parliament, in a resolution adopted by 51 votes to 1, "expresses concern about the list of electoral disqualifications" issued by the authorities, pointing to a "long series of measures taken by the government with a view to intimidating opposition members, dissidents and international observers in the country".
These measures include lists of citizens, known as the Tascón list, Maisanta list and Russian list, to "deprive citizens of their right to hold public office and of access to administrative services and procedures". The political use of such lists "is restricting the civil and political rights of opponents of the current Venezuelan Government", say MEPs.
The resolution also condemns the murder of Mr Julio Soto, the student leader of the Copei party and President of the Students Union at Zulia State University. Parliament calls on the Venezuelan authorities to "clear up" this crime, which was "committed under strange circumstances" and to bring the perpetrators and those responsible to justice.
Expulsion of Human Rights Watch is a "serious precedent"
The EP regards the recent expulsion of two senior officials of Human Rights Watch, Mr José Miguel Vivanco and Mr Daniel Wilkinson, as "an extremely serious precedent as regards respect for freedom of expression and the right to criticise".
The resolution concludes by demanding that the Chávez government "put an end to all such practices and foster a more participative democracy in Venezuela, in full compliance with the principles laid down in the 1999 constitution".
* * *
Renewed fighting in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
Parliament is "extremely concerned" about the renewed fighting between the Congolese Army and resurgent militias in North Kivu and the previously pacified region of Ituri, and expresses its "deep outrage at the massacres, crimes against humanity and acts of sexual violence against women and girls which have been continuing for too many years in the eastern provinces of the DRC".
In spite of the Goma peace accord signed on 23 January 2008 between the Congolese Government and 22 armed groups, there have since been "massacres, rapes of young girls, mothers and grandmothers, forced recruitments of civilians and child soldiers and a host of other acts of violence and serious human rights abuses in the eastern DRC". According to UNHCR reports, the renewed fighting in North Kivu and Ituri has led to a high number of casualties and more than 150,000 displaced persons.
Overall, the conflict affecting the DRC has claimed the lives of 5 400 000 people since 1998 and is still causing, either directly or indirectly, approximately 1500 deaths each day.
The EP demands that the Congrès National pour la Défense du Peuple (CNDP - National Congress for the Defence of the People) returns "immediately and unconditionally to the peace process to which it committed itself in Goma in January 2008".
Condemning the use of rape as a weapon of war, the EP stresses the importance of "access to health services in conflict situations and refugee camps".
Call for urgent measures by the international community
Parliament calls on the international community and the UN Security Council "as a matter of urgency" to "take all measures capable of genuinely preventing any further attacks on the civilian population of the eastern provinces of the DRC" and to strengthen MONUC, the largest UN peacekeeping mission, "by providing appropriate materials and staff to enable it to fulfil its mandate".
Parliament also urges that the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court investigate atrocity crimes committed in the Kivus and Ituri since June 2003.
EU action
Turning to measures the EU might take, the resolution calls on the Council and every EU Member State to provide special aid to the populations of the eastern DRC, and asks that the Council and Commission "implement with immediate effect large-scale medical assistance and reintegration programmes for the civilian populations in the eastern DRC".
It also asks for the effective establishment of monitoring mechanisms, such as the Kimberley process for the certification of the origin of natural resources imported into the EU market.
* * *
Torture of political dissidents and ethnic cleansing in Burma
In the resolution on Burma adopted unanimously (68 votes in favour), MEPs demand that the military government of Burma immediately release all political prisoners and put an end to the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been under house arrest for more than 13 years. They also call on the ASEM states, meeting at their summit on 24 and 25 October, to press the Burmese authorities on these matters.
The resolutions says that this coming 24 October 2008 "marks the 13th anniversary of the unjust incarceration as a political prisoner of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, General Secretary of the National League for Democracy" and that "an additional 2120 individuals continue to face imprisonment in atrocious conditions merely for expressing the wish to bring democracy to Burma".
ASEM urged to appeal to Burmese authorities
One day before the 13th anniversary of Aung San Suu Kyi's captivity, Parliament insists on her immediate release, and urges ASEM states (leaders of European and Asian countries will convene at the ASEM Summit meeting in China on 24 and 25 October 2008) "to jointly appeal to the Burmese military authorities to release all political prisoners".
The EP also condemns the "arbitrary charges behind the arrests of many dissidents and "the widespread use of torture and hard labour". It demands that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) be allowed to resume visits in light of the "systematic denial of medical treatment to political prisoners". In the aftermath of the Saffron Revolution of September 2007, the number of political prisoners has increased from 1300 to 2000.
Ethnic cleansing
Parliament strongly condemns the ethnic cleansing directed against the Karen minority, including those seeking refuge in neighbouring Thailand, and calls on the international community to "exert stronger pressure on the junta to stop military actions against civilians and to increase humanitarian assistance to affected populations".
Proposed action by EU Commission and Council
With respect to the United Nations' admission that "a percentage of all humanitarian aid remitted to Burma is falling victim to state-sponsored exchange rate abuse", the EP calls on the Commission to explain "what action it intends to take".
Lastly, the resolution calls on the EU Council to use its meeting on 11-12 December 2008 to review Council Regulation 194/2008 of 25 February 2008 renewing and strengthening the restrictive measures in respect of Burma, "to broaden targeted sanctions to include access to international banking services for companies, conglomerates and businesses owned by or closely linked to the Burmese military, to halt all imports of Burmese manufactured clothing, and to terminate access by selected generals and their families to business opportunities, health care, consumer purchases, and foreign education". Adopted texts will appear (click on 23 October 2008)
