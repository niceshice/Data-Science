EP vice presidents Anni Podimata and MOthmar Karas greeting Jaqueline Lemos and Chander Lall Parlamentarium, the EP's new visitors centre, confirmed its position as a popular attraction when it welcomed its 100,000th visitor on 21 March 2012. Rated one of the top things to do in Brussels by travel website Tripadvisor, the centre has proved a big hit with visitors ever since it first opened its doors five months ago. The free centre, which is open seven days a week, offers a chance to learn in an interactive way about the EP in 23 languages.
Its international appeal was highlighted on 21 March when the honour of 100,000th visitor was shared by Jacqueline Lemos, from Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, and Chander Lall, from New Delhi in India. They were in Brussels for a conference but did not want to leave without visiting the European Parliament.
Mr Lall was full of praise for Parlamentarium: "I would love to come back and spend more time here and really get into it. It really tickled my interest to know more."
At Parlamentarium visitors can use interactive multimedia tools to see how laws and policy decisions are shaped in the European Parliament and other EU institutions.
