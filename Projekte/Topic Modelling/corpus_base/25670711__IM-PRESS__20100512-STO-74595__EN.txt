Safer and quicker organ donations 14 weeks' maternity leave The May Strasbourg sitting of the European Parliament saw MEPs back 14 weeks maternity leave for the self employed and agree that the European Asylum Support Office should be set up in Malta. The week also saw calls for more coordination of organ transplants and donation across Europe and initiatives to tackle youth unemployment. How to govern the euro amid uncertainty and speeding up farm payments also featured. Finally the "Made in" logo should be compulsory say MEPs.
Reinforcing economic governance
In the main debate of the week MEPs discussed how to improve the economic governance of the European Union. Longer-term structural reform of pensions, health systems and labour markets and closer coordination of economic policies were some of the solutions put forward. The debate came against the backdrop of the economic and financial crisis.
Safer and quicker organ donations
On Wednesday MEPs backed common quality and safety standards that would facilitate organ donation, transplantation and exchanges among EU countries. About 60,000 patients are now on waiting lists in the Union - and every day 12 people die while on a list.
European Asylum Support Office set up
A European Asylum Support Office to enable Europe to deal with the increasing numbers of refugees heading into the continent was given a green light. In addition, in a bid to encourage the resettlement of refugees there is also a plan for countries to receive €6,000 per person for the first year, €5,000 in the second year and €4,000 thereafter. The money is supposed to help pay for the care of those seeking asylum.
14 weeks' maternity leave
On Tuesday a majority of MEPs voted that women who are self employed should be entitled to 14 weeks maternity leave. The right should also apply to the wives/partners of those who are self employed.
Farm payments made easier
In the run up to reform of Europe's common farm policy in 2013, MEPs voted to make farmers' lives easier by creating a single payment system, simplifying rules on electronic identification of animals and creating a helpdesk phone line for farmers in each EU Member State.
Steps to tackle Europe's unemployed young
With unemployment among young people now standing at double the rate for the overall working population, MEPs adopted a report focusing on the development of a European Youth Strategy for the next 10 years. The emphasis will be on linking higher education with the labour market more effectively.
"Made in" labels should be compulsory, say MEPs
The only way to ensure that consumers are not deceived by labels implying clothes are made in the EU when they are not is to make "made in" labels mandatory, MEPs decided on Tuesday. The "made in" label is currently voluntary in the EU.
Lorry drivers and rest periods
Lorry drivers who break rules on working time, rest periods or working conditions should pay clear and comparable penalties across the EU, says a resolution adopted by Parliament on Tuesday. Fines for exceeding the daily driving time by more than two hours are currently 10 times higher in Spain (€4,600) than in Greece (€400).
Farm aid for Europe's remote regions
Parliament backed measures aimed at helping Europe's remote regions in times of economic distress. The Spanish Canaries, Portugal's Madeira and Açores are affected by this particular measure.
Better relations with Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia
MEPs backed a resolution reaffirming the need for the EU to develop a strategy for the South Caucasus. A region geographically located in one of the most strategic places in Europe, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia are surrounded by powerful neighbours such as Russia, Turkey and Iran.
EU accession to Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, International Criminal Court (Rome Statute)
The European Union is required by the Lisbon Treaty to join the European Convention on Human Rights, thus allowing citizens to sue the EU and its institutions for the violation of human rights, at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The EP adopted a report on the subject.
Thailand in spotlight in Thursday's human rights debate
MEPs condemned the fact that real bullets were used against the red shirt protesters in Thailand and called for the restoration of media freedoms and urged all parties to engage in a constructive dialogue and seek reconciliation. President Jerzy Buzek sent his condolences to the families of the victims and expressed his sorrow at the death of the Italian journalist Fabio Polenghi.
