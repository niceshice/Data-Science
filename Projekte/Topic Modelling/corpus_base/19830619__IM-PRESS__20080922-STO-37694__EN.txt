Bartholomew I addresses MEPs MEPs called for measures to deal with high energy prices when they met Wednesday. They called on Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs and French Minister for environment and energy Jean-Louis Borloo to come up with measures to make oil markets more transparent and to break the link between oil and gas prices and high energy prices.
In recent months oil prices have risen sharply, unleashing protests by truckers, farmers, fishermen and others and they look set to stay high in the medium and long term.
Austrian socialist Hannes Swoboda raised the point of concern to many, "what is Europe doing? I want the Council and Commission to take more action to fight energy poverty." The Commissioner said the EU is on the right track. "We need to encourage reforms throughout the energy sector. Energy efficiency and renewables are our main lines." He added, "there is a clear need for short term action for vulnerable households."
British Conservative Giles Chichester was more sanguine. "Clearly oil price rises are serious, but let us remember the lessons that we learned from the 1970s...higher prices will encourage more exploration and the development of resources. "
Also on Wednesday....
In a speech to MEPs, Orthodox Christian leader Bartholomew I , the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, espoused environmental causes, championed Turkish accession to the EU and underlined the need for inter-religious understanding and respect for minorities. "We are all brothers and sisters with one heavenly Father and on this beautiful planet, which we are all responsible for, there is room for everyone."
The EP adopted the maritime package, reinstating parliamentary amendments not accepted by Council on flag state obligations and civil liability. Negotiations between MEPs and national ministers to find an agreement must now continue.
MEPs approved measures providing more access to telecoms services, more information for consumers and stronger data protection . The package now goes back to EU ministers.
