15:00 18:30 Brussels, ASP 5G3 Gender Mainstreaming in the use of Structural Funding The Committee on Regional Development
Equal opportunities for men and women not only improve the equity and efficiency of public spending, but can also boost local economic competitiveness. A European Parliament study to be presented at this hearing assesses how far gender mainstreaming was taken into account in Structural Funds programming for 2000-2006. A key finding is that better results are achieved upstream in the policy process, rather than downstream, at implementation level. Whilst much has been done to create the right conditions for successful gender mainstreaming in 2007-2013, more could be done to translate objectives into practice.
