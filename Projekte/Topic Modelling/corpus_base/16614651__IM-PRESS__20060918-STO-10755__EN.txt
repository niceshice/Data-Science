Citizen's Forums: Many people want to have their say
After the French and Dutch "No" votes to the EU Constitution, a "period of reflection" was called for in which the public and political leaders would listen and talk to one another about the future direction of the European Union. As part of this, the European Parliament launched a series of "Citizens' Focus" around Europe where MEPs meet the public face-to-face to discuss the issues that matter to the people. In September a new round starts following the success of those held in spring.
The idea of the citizen's forums is allow the public and their elected representatives (locally, nationally and European level) to come together to discuss local issues - and put them in a wider European context. It provides a good opportunity for voicing people's expectations of the European Union.
In September and October there will be 9 citizens' forums held around the European Union organised by the European Parliament's local Information Offices.
Czech Republic:
Taking into account people's concerns in the region, the main topics will be: Schengen border controls, monetary union, trans-border co-operation, student and worker mobility and social measures for disabled and old people. Rokycany 20/9/2006, Horažďovice 22/9/2006, Nýrany 6/10/2006, Karlovy Vary 9/10/2006
Italy:
Milan: The major topic of the event is to discuss the question: “What will happen after the reflection period?” 07/10/2006
France:
Lyon: The debates will focus on local concerns and look at the results of the previous citizen's forum held in France earlier in the year. 12/10/2006
Slovenia:
Ljubljana:
A three day "e-Citizens Forum" will be organised where MEPs and citizens will have an online discussion. The e-forum will be focused on the European Social Model, addressing special topics which are of interest to students, like employment and the mobility of students and workers. 17-19/10/2006. Nova Gorica/Gorizia: In Nova Gorica/Gorizia the accent will be on the "Euro" and Schengen zone. This is particularly relevant as the area was divided between Yugoslavia and Italy after the Second World War. 27/10/2006
Portugal:
Faro (Algarve): A Citizens' Forum event has been scheduled for sometime in October. The date and topics to be discussed will be available later.
