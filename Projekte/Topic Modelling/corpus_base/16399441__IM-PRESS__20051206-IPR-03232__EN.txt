Financial Perspective: President Borrell sounds a warning
Budget
2005-12-06 - 19:00
EP President Josep Borrell has spoken of his deep reservations about the British presidency's draft compromise on the next Financial Perspective for 2007-13.
This proposal "differs radically from the position adopted by the EP in its plenary vote," says Josep Borrell. "I do not think Parliament will be able to accept it." Mr Borrell advises the Member States "not to waste too much time on a proposal which have no chance of working". There can be no doubt about the determination of the European institutions to reach an ambitious financing deal for 2007-13: "If the Commission and Parliament see this agreement as unacceptable, then it is still born."
Parliament reached its position on the next Financial Perspective last June, with the adoption of a report by Reimer Böge (EPP-ED, DE) which sets out a total of €974 billion in commitment appropriations for 2007-13. The British presidency's compromise proposal is considerably lower, setting the limit at €847 billion.
The Financial Perspective system is not set out in the existing treaties - instead it is based on an insterinstitutional agreement between the Parliament, Commission and Council. The disagreement of any one of the three would prevent the establishment of this financial framework.
A further report from Mr Böge, adopted by Parliament on 1 December, confirms Parliament's intention to defend its position regarding the figures. The final compromise, according to this report, must also take on board qualitative aspects, such as a reform of the own resources system, improvements in budgetary management and a new "flexibility instrument."
Parliament will deal with this issue during its plenary session in Strasbourg next week, in both the debates on the 2006 budget (Tuesday morning) and on the preparation for the European Council (Wednesday morning).
