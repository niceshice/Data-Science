The European Parliament will once again mark "Earth Hour" by switching off lights in all its buildings for this Saturday 26 March from 20.30h to 21.30h. "Earth Hour" is a global environmental initiative, begun in Sydney in 2007, to raise awareness of the need to take act on climate change.
On this occasion President Buzek said: "The Earth is one of our most precious treasures. It shelters us every single day. It is our responsibility to respect and protect the Earth and the environment. (...) Switching off the lights for one hour is only one small step to take. Being mindful about it and taking the right measures every single day is already a big leap forward".
Earth Hour is a global WWF initiative to fight climate change. Individuals, businesses, governments and communities are invited to turn out their lights for one hour on Saturday March 26 from 20.30h to 21.30h to show their support.
In 2010, 128 countries and territories joined in Earth Hour. This year, over 130 countries and territories worldwide have said they will take part.
