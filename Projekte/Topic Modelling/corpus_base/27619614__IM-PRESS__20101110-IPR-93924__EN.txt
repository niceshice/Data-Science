Ensuring solidarity between generations
Employment policy
Plenary sittings
2010-11-11 - 13:13
MEPs called for measures to improve job prospects for young and old, and so reduce the costs of funding social security and pensions, in a resolution passed on Thursday.
Steadily increasing longevity and low birth rates may place a heavy burden on rising generations, says the resolution on "the demographic challenge and solidarity between generations" drafted by Thomas Mann (EPP, DE) and approved with 440 votes in favour, 122 against and 43 abstentions.
Access to employment should be at the core of policy-making between generations, as younger and older people face higher levels of unemployment, it adds.
European Youth Guarantee
MEPs called on the Council and the Commission to devise practical measures - one of which should be a "European Youth Guarantee"- to ensure that after a maximum of four months' unemployment, young people are offered a job, an apprenticeship, additional training or combined work and training.
"Fifty-plus" employment pact initiative
The text also proposes that the Commission and Member States take "a fifty-plus employment pact initiative" to increase the share of workforce aged over 50 to 55%, eliminate early retirement incentives, combat aged-based discrimination and to develop incentives and opportunities for workers over the age of 60 to pass on their knowledge and experience.
New anti-discrimination rules
A majority of MEPs also called for new anti-discrimination legislation on access to goods and services, "as many older people face discrimination when trying to purchase insurance, holidays or car rentals". This call was not backed by the rapporteur, who believes that no new anti-discrimination legislation is needed and tabled an alternative resolution.
Active ageing
MEPs also called on the Commission to develop a proposal to make 2012 "the European Year of Active ageing and Solidarity between generations", which will highlight the contribution of older people to society.
