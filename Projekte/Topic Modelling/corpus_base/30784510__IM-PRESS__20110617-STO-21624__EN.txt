Food labelling, GMOs on July plenary agenda Â©Belga/PHOTOPQR/J.Frey It was a real food day in Parliament 21 June: the Agriculture Committee approved a report on food quality, regional food was being promoted and MEPs discussed the forthcoming July plenary votes on food labelling and GMOs during a seminar. For the first time during a press event, MEPs fielded questions not just from journalists but also from our readers on Faceboook and Twitter.
What was on the plate during food day?
The Agriculture Committee voted to make quality labels easier for producers to register to help the EU compete with third countries. In an effort to streamline the process, the European Commission must respond to a request for registration within 6 months. In addition food producer groups will be better able to protect and promote proprietary products. The report should come to the plenary at the end of September.
Parliament promoted a number of regional products on Tuesday, including Di Bufala Campana mozzarella, Auvergne blue cheese and Ardennes ham, with chefs from the EP's canteen demonstrating how to prepare them.
Food labelling
During a seminar on food labelling, MEPs answered questions from our Facebook fans and Twitter followers. Our readers were mostly concerned about food safety and clear labelling .
Ania asked how an ideal label would look. "We will not be able to achieve it as the ideal label is different for each consumer," Swedish Green Carl Schlyter said, but it should help consumers make informed choices and avoid fake food, for example strawberry yogurt that contains no strawberries.
Dutch Liberal Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy agreed labels should be clear and should provide information about issues that impact health like fat and salt. However, British Conservative Struan Stevenson thinks some MEPs want too much information and he simply want them to be clear and straightforward.
In answer to a question from Izabela about learning to read labels, British Socialist Glenis Willmott said education has to start early, in school. German Christian Democrat Renate Sommer said we should also ensure the elderly are educated in how to read labels.
On the threat from imported food , for example from China or the US, Mr Schlyter noted that the EU has an early warning system. "When one country discovers something dangerous in imported food it has to inform others". Third countries must meet EU standards if they want to sell food here, Ms Sommer added.
