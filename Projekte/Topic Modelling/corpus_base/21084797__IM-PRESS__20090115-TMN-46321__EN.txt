Cheaper roaming rates across the EU
The high prices charged for using a mobile phone abroad were not justified, according to MEPs. A new regulation adopted by the European Parliament introduced a Eurotariff, capping roaming charges at maximum €0.46 per minute for making calls and €0.22 per minute for receiving calls (excluding VAT). Before, a roaming call cost the user an average of €1.15 per minute. The caps will be further reduced during the summer of 2009 to €0.43 and €0.19 respectively.
Regulation adopted by EP: 23.5.2007
Operators have had to offer the Eurotariff since 30.7.2007
The regulation expires: 30.6.2010 (but proposals have been tabled for new tariffs after that date) 23.05.07 - MEPs deliver on cheaper roaming: calling rates to drop by the summer holidays
Air fares must include all charges
Passengers can now see at a glance what they have to pay for a flight ticket thanks to a Regulation adopted by the European Parliament. Advertisements must indicate the final price of plane tickets, including all taxes, fees and charges added to the basic ticket price. This applies also to internet bookings. Any optional price supplements must be communicated in a clear way at the start of the booking process.

Compensation in the event of delays on international services will be 25% of the fare for a delay of at least 60 minutes and 50% for a delay of 120 minutes or more. MEPs insisted that the Regulation cover domestic journeys as well as international ones, though Member States can delay introducing this for up to 15 years.

Improving toy safety in Europe

Warnings must be in language understandable to consumers and be visible at the point of sale, including for on line sales.

Cross-border consumer credit simpler
A new directive approved by the EP aims to facilitate access to consumer credit in other Member States. For loans between €200 and €75,000, banks will have to provide standard information which can be compared with other offers, including on the right to pay off early.
