Bridging the cultural divide
Culture
2008-12-11 - 11:00
In a global melting pot, how we relate to one another's culture is an issue of the greatest importance. It involves a level of understanding of different cultures, languages and faiths. This year is the European Year of intercultural dialogue and the European Parliament and its President are determined to draw attention to the need for a bridge between different cultures. African week (8-12 September) in the Parliament which brought politics and culture from Africa to Brussels.
This focus draws attention to some of the people who have visited the Parliament to talk about intercultural dialogue as well as President Pöttering's thoughts on the subject. We also have a musical angle as Dani Klein, lead singer of Vaya con Dios spoke to us about the plight of the Roma people.

Pöttering talks about dialogue between cultures
Hans-Gert Pöttering and the "Flame of Peace" Just prior to last Christmas we interviewed Hans-Gert Pöttering on his thoughts about the forthcoming year and what he thought would be its main priorities. He has put the theme at the centre of his mandate as President and has invited several key-note speakers to address the European Parliament. Below are a sample of the questions we put to him, the link below contains the full interview.
2008 is the year of Intercultural Dialogue. You have said this is central to your mandate. Why is this theme so important for you? Understanding between cultures is crucial for world peace. In particular, relations between the Western world and the Arab and Islamic world will be decisive for the 21st century. It is my deep belief that terrorism should not have the chance to take root. Some terrorists claim that they use force because Islam teaches them to do so. This is not acceptable, for Islam is in itself a peaceful religion. I never forget the speech to the European Parliament made by the late Egyptian leader Anwar Al Sadat, in which he powerfully made that point: that real Islam is a religion of peace. We must take our opportunity to connect with people of good will in the Islamic world. If we do, the "clash of civilisations" some predict cannot happen. It is thus our responsibility to develop this dialogue, which must however be based on mutual tolerance and truth. It cannot be a one-way street. Sometimes there seems little cause for hope. Are you optimistic that things can really change for the better? Have you ever seen a pessimist win through in the end? We have to be optimistic. As a Christian, I say hope and optimism are part of our lives. You can only be successful and achieve your goals if you believe in them. Take the European integration process. I have had the privilege to be in the European Parliament since 1979. At that time many people would never have thought that Europe would be reunited, that we would have a strong European Parliament, a strong European currency - yet we have achieved all this. Not in one week, but through hard work, good will and the cooperation of others. So I am optimistic that we will be successful as far as the dialogue of cultures is concerned.

Indian guru Satguru Baba Ji on spirituality and politics
Indian guru brings enlightenment The European Parliament has received its fair share of religious leaders and on 26 September it was the turn of Indian spiritual leader Satguru Baba Hardev Ji. He leads the Sant Nirankari Mission, a spiritual movement dedicated to human welfare and promoting the idea of universal brotherhood. The mission has over 2000 centres worldwide and millions of followers.
Satguru Baba Ji was invited by the chair of the India Delegation, Neena Gill and met with EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering in the context of next year's European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. Following the meeting, Mr Pöttering said, "I am convinced that religious leaders dedicated to peaceful and tolerant co-existence can make an enormous contribution to our societies. I particularly welcome the initiative of Satguru Baba Ji's movement in promoting interfaith dialogue in South Asia. His method of bringing leaders of different religions together to discuss the role of spirituality in promoting universal human values is something which we have mirrored within the EU." "The spiritual side of politics" We talked with Satguru Baba Hardev Ji in Strasbourg about knowledge, spirituality and the peaceful coexistence of people and cultures: Your Holiness, you have just met Hans-Gert Pöttering. What value is there in meetings between spiritual leaders and political leaders? What message did you wish to convey to him? Principally we were discussing the principles and values of the Nirankari Mission. We focus on human beings, whether they live in Europe or in India. And so we are bringing about awareness, that as mankind we have to peacefully coexist. Since politicians run governments and institutions, they have a very big role to play. Their role is not just managing the affairs of countries, but also incorporating a human touch. We were discussing the spiritual side of politics and ways to bring about harmony between human beings. Next year is the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. Looking at today's Europe, and drawing on your experience, how can our different ethnic, cultural and religious groups live harmoniously together? It is love and compassion that brings us closer...you are using 23 languages in the European Parliament...There are differences and that is diversity. Like you, we say that there is "unity in diversity". The right thing is to work on it. When different cultures meet they should flourish together. In a garden, a rose does not tell a tulip: "you do not exist". Many say that there is a crisis of spirituality in Europe, associated with a decline in attendance at traditional churches. In your view, does this make it harder or easier to achieve a peaceful multicultural society? It makes things a bit more difficult. People give more importance to materialistic achievements. They visit traditional places of worship less. But religion in its true sense is the religion of humanity, love and compassion. A poet in India once wrote: "One does not need religious places as such, because one can worship God by loving mankind." We have to ask ourselves: do we love and have compassion for others, are we humble, are we able to help others not out of greed or selfishness but out of love and selflessness? You teach that to gain knowledge, people must ask for it. In the EU we often talk about life-long learning. What should people do to stay open to knowledge? Learning...should be an ongoing process that continues until the last breath. True knowledge is beneficial to oneself and to mankind. It allows the establishment of a good and harmonious environment. People in Europe should remain open-minded and open-hearted. That was the basis for past developments. Although there are so many countries in Europe now they are joined together and have the European Parliament. And this humane touch is important for ordinary people. We are one family. Brothers can argue over property but finally we have to adopt this brother-brother relationship.
Syria's Grand Mufti on civilisation and morality
Ahmad Badr al-din Hassoun with Bishop Antoine Odo "All cultures flow into one recipient that forms human civilisation." These are the words of the Grand Mufti of Syria, Ahmad Badr al-din Hassoun, when he spoke to us during his visit to the European Parliament in Strasbourg. He was invited by EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering to the first plenary session of 2008 to mark the year of intercultural dialogue. In his speech he praised the "the culture of mankind". In an interview, Dr Hassoun expanded on his spiritual message.
Dr Hassoun, Syria's senior Sunni Muslim cleric, came to the Parliament with a delegation of representatives of other faiths. One of the Christian Bishops who accompanied him was Antoine Odo, President of the Chaldean Bishops of Syria. Bishop Odo was kind enough to act as an interpreter from Arabic to French for our interview. Dr Hassoun, yesterday you told MEPs that mankind shared one civilisation. What does that mean in terms of how political leaders should behave as they try to deal with the world's conflicts? Yesterday I said there is one civilisation and many cultures. Civilisation is like a huge vessel into which all cultures flow. Culture may be, say, French or German, but all cultures flow into one recipient which forms human civilisation. But spiritual culture, be it, say, Christian or Muslim, gives humanity its moral dimension. Human civilisation is based on morality and reason. Reason builds the material part of life, and morality builds love between us and binds man to man as brothers, culturally and spiritually. A call to safeguard and protect culture In a world which has become a small village we may benefit from all cultures and gather them together in one civilisation for the good of all. Once, a person could only hear a preacher or a sermon in his own place of worship. Today it is possible to receive thousands of TV channels, each one delivering a culture. Our children are able to hear the whole world. We cannot deny them from being universal in their culture, but at the same time one must defend one's own identity so as to protect the beauty of the world. Here the dialogue of cultures becomes a route of happiness for man, a road which takes us away from conflict. Hence we cannot make war for one civilisation or one culture but we will help each other to build the civilisation of the world. The Holy Land is holy to three major religions, all of which affirm their love of peace. Yet peace in the Holy Land seems unattainable. How do you explain this? The problem is not one caused by men or religions but by politicians who have misinterpreted the religious texts: the Bible, the Torah and the Koran. It is man who is sacred; not any piece of land, any church, the Wall of Lamentations or any mosque. In the Torah, Koran and the Bible we read that the finger of a little child is more sacred than the entire earth. This child is the work of God; he who destroys that attacks God. Destroy all the religious buildings, we can rebuild them! Destroy a creature of God, who can give him life again? Holy message "transformed" The prophets came for man, and the angelic missions are for man . What is so strange is that we have transformed the holy message to justify killing man. We have said there is a holy people, and an unholy people; a holy place and an unholy place. God alone is holy. If one destroys a work of Michelangelo what will we think of him - ignorant, violent, animal like without respect for human values? But if one destroys the creature God himself created? Those who build landmines and weapons of mass destruction are the enemies of human civilisation, because they kill man. I think perhaps Alfred Nobel tried to redeem some of the evil caused by his invention of dynamite by creating the Nobel Prize. Tell us about your role in encouraging the peaceful coexistence of religious communities When I was appointed the Grand Mufti of Syria, people thought I was only Mufti of the Muslims. However, after my first speech, transmitted via radio and TV, I became Mufti of the Muslims, Christians, secularists and all citizens of my country. I don't limit myself to one community. I asked all spiritual leaders to be fathers to every Syrian citizen without closing themselves to their own community. I am trying to spread this approach all over the Arabic and Muslim world and then to the whole world. Spiritual leaders ought to be universal, not limited to their community or confession. The Pope is not only responsible for the Catholics but for all mankind, a Mufti is not only responsible for Muslims but for the whole world.
Film season at the EP
Wednesday sees the start of a series of films being screened at the European Parliament that aim to explore cultural differences across Europe. The films will form part of the European Year of intercultural dialogue and feature productions from 14 countries. The European Union National Institutes for Culture (EUNIC) championed the idea of such a film festival. The Institutes has members from 22 countries.
Speaking ahead of the first film EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering said the Parliament had decided to back the initiative to "support projects undertaken by civil society which contribute to the dialogue of cultures".
Slovene films opens festival
The first film to be filmed is "Express, Express" by Slovenian director Igor Stek. The film follows a character, who, mourning the loss of his father, takes endless train rides in search of himself and with no clear direction. The film recounts his emotional journey and the people he meets.
A Slovenian film was chosen for the first showing as the country currently holds the rotating Presidency of the European Union. People who are guests of the cultural institutes from around Europe and all of those who have access to the Parliament can watch the films.
The Parliament inaugurated its own "Prix Lux" film prize in 2007 aimed at showcasing the European film industry.

Vaya con Dios - singing to defend the Roma
Dani Klein - lead singer of Vaya con Dios "Just a friend of mine" was a huge hit for Belgian group Vaya con Dios in 1986. In the last 20 years the group - led by singer Dani Klein - have toured the world. On 7 April they came to the European Parliament to raise the plight of the Roma in Europe on International Roma day. We caught up with Dani Klein just after her rehearsal.
How did you become aware of the situation of the Roma? My group gives concerts in Eastern countries where there are a lot of Roma. When I sing "Djelem djelem" - the Roma hymn - people are very enthusiastic and identify with the song. But they often adopt a rather discriminatory personal attitude to the Roma...I find that a bit repellent, on the one hand we appropriate Roma culture and take the best parts of it, and on the other hand we discriminate against it. I don't have a political message, just that we must respect each other. You defend a more positive approach to the Roma, by underlining in particular their contribution to European culture? Yes, because gypsy music has contributed to art in general. I am not a classical music specialist, but Brahms would not be Brahms had not gypsy music existed, and that is the case with many traditional types of music. Their music, their language, their traditions contribute to the wealth of European culture. The Roma are somehow unyielding and resistant to changing their ways, they want to travel, and they are not sedentary. I admire them, because they resist the efforts to change them. At present, many Roma in Brussels are seen, in particular at red traffic lights. Many people say to me, "I do not give, it's easy to live like that". I think that it's very difficult to live like that! Is there anyone who would choose to breathe in carbon dioxide all day for 15 or 20 cents and a scornful glance? This is not a good approach. We must look at the positive. Can Europe contribute anything to changing this approach? I do not know what the powers Europe has, I am not political. But if it has means, yes. The initial aim of the EU was that France and Germany would no longer fight. If Europe's ambition is peace, that should certainly help in making the Roma accepted as part of Europe, but with their special characteristics. As an artist, when do you decide to get involved with causes like the Roma? I engage when I find the causes are just - to support the values of liberty and respect for others. Among musicians, racism is less palpable than in other milieus. To be an artist, is to be marginal. Artists are also disliked to a certain extent in society and fight to find ways to express themselves. Artists are sustained by all the influences that touch them - our music is fed by different music. The fact that we are marginalised brings us close to other communities on the margin of society. Art has always broken taboos and opened minds and spirits.

Pöttering in Qatar fro talks
President Pöttering and the Emir of Qatar, Doha 13 April During the 2008 European Year of Intercultural Dialogue one of the European Parliament's key aims is to promote dialogue especially with Arab and Islamic countries. It was in this context that EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering made his first visit to a Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) this weekend. While in Qatar he gave a keynote speech to 8th Doha Forum on Democracy Development and Free Trade.
In his speech he spoke about drawing the GCC into the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, which brings together European parliamentarians and members of parliament from countries around the Mediterranean basin. "I believe that you are definitely the 'next step' in our neighbourhood! Not only because of geographic and geostrategic considerations, but mainly because of the strong convergences that we have set into motion." He will propose that two MPs from GCC countries be included as observers to the Euromed assembly. Mr Pöttering said the partnership between the EU and GCC is "a key element in ensuring sustained regional geopolitical stability", adding that the EU and Qatar "ought to be partners, partners in dialogue in order to overcome misperceptions and ignorance that far too often engender clashes, violence and extremism ." During his visit to Qatar, Mr Pöttering discussed energy, the Middle East peace process, Iran and regional stability and religion and tolerance with government officials including the Emir of Qatar.

Young Israelis, Palestinians and Europeans meet at EP
Young Israeli, Palestinian and Europeans Identity and politics in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute is one of the most contentious in this most difficult of disputes. Over the last few days 21 young people from both sides have been joined by young Europeans to discuss the issues at stake. The talks have been taking place at the European Parliament in Brussels under the aegis of President Hans-Gert Pöttering. The week also sees a group of MEPs in Israel and Palestine as part of continuing attempts to foster dialogue and understanding between the two sides.

Hauwa Ibrahim: "The EU can be torchlight "
Hauwa Ibrahim at the European Parliament in Brussels, 12 June The aspirations of young people in Africa were discussed on 12 June when the EP hosted a seminar on International Day of African Youth. It drew together speakers who addressed the problems that young people face. Chaired by Italian Parliament vice-president Luisa Morgantini (GUE/NGL), the event was held under the patronage of EP President Pöttering. Nigerian lawyer Hauwa Ibrahim, winner of Parliament's 2005 Sakharov prize was one of the speakers. We later put a few questions to her.
What do young Africans really want? What are their hopes and aspirations?
Young Africans want to contribute to peace, freedom and human dignity. They want the opportunity to be and to use their minds creatively. They want the opportunity not to think about what they are eating tomorrow, to be free of things that slow them down - like poverty. They want the opportunity to make a positive change for their society, for their countries and for the world.
What can the EU and the EP do to help young Africans?
It's such an honour that the EP organises a day such as an International Day for African youth! A huge statement has been made: "We can give you a voice, we can give you opportunity. We'll bring you here to see what we have done differently and how you can go and make a difference in your place". We hope that the EU and the EP especially will not look at Africa as a unit, but as a huge continent. When you see an entity with a huge problem, you should take it piece by piece; solve one problem after the other.
One of the issues that we are facing in my country (Nigeria) is that government policies have not been consistent. The EU and the EP can help, since they are institutions that make policies. I suggest that the EU takes the time to visit the continent once in a quarter to have the sense of what is reality. We have infrastructures that are absolutely inadequate.
For example, you have a school that used to have 500 or 600 students, and they now have more than 1000 in less than 10 years, while facilities have not been expanded. This affects the morale of the teachers and of the students. Another issue is the training of teachers, who need to be more motivated. The EU could invite teachers to see how classrooms, books and laboratories are here or train them in sciences, mathematics and so on. The EU can be the torchlight to show us how to get there.
Is Europe a model for African youth? Can it offer hope and if so in what way?
Absolutely! You have passed through so much as a region! The way you (Europe) have overcome the problems, what you have done and how you can think about the future and plan for today are lessons that we could learn from you. This beautiful Parliament is fascinating. How did you come to this end? We may not get there but maybe the new generation will.
What difference did your winning the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought make in Nigeria and in Africa?
It made a huge, huge difference. It gave me a louder voice, credibility and above all a global stage and recognition. Since my passion is education, we created a charity, "Foundation for Literacy", with the money that I got with the Sakharov prize. And the funds have multiplied, because other people decided to give more money. We put it in a bank and we got (5%) interest. With the 5% we sent 32 children back to school, elementary school but also to university.
Moreover, while I was teaching law in Abuja University, I noticed that there were about 3000 students there who only had 200 useful law books. The government wanted to remove our accreditation as we didn't meet the standards. At about that time I got the Sakharov prize. I was invited in Minnesota to give a speech and I told them about our lack of books. They decided to give us 8000 new books. I used part of the money I got with the Sakharov prize to ship the books from America to Nigeria. So I can say that the EP saved the ability of Abuja University to award degrees that have international recognition.
In the context of the EU importing natural resources like wood from Africa, overfishing and immigrants leaving Africa for the EU, what can Europe do to help Africa?
There are issues about politics and there are issues about economy. The fundamental human rights should lie between the two. If you go to a virgin land in Africa and pick something, or remove their fish, what do you give them in return? Do you want to completely remove their fish? And leave them with nothing? Is that your ultimate objective? I think we should temper economy with humanity. We should temper globalisation with dignity. What we want is a world that is free of terrors, secure. And we do not want to create the opposite through our policies. Whether you are taking the wood or the fish, remember to temper global politics with humanity, dignity and respect for human life.
The event was held as part of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. Hauwa Ibrahim was awarded the prize in recognition of her stand in defending Nigerian women who face being stoned to death for adultery and young people who face amputation for theft under Islamic Sharia law.

UN's Asma Jahangir speaks of need for understanding between religions
Asma Jahangir on religious tolerance: "Europe has a leading role to play" Pakistani lawyer Asma Jahangir is the UN's Special Rapporteur on the Freedom of Religion or Belief. On 18 June she spoke to a plenary sitting of the European parliament where she delivered a call for great understanding between religions. Whilst in Strasbourg we caught up with her and asked her about the role. She speaks of the need to get people to interact naturally with one another and believes that the "dignity of human beings must lie at the centre of all freedoms".
Ms Jahangir, the term "intercultural dialogue" has a somewhat academic ring. What does it mean in practice and why should it matter for ordinary people?
I believe that we should not have just an academic approach to it, but an activist one. Intercultural dialogue is all about opening up spaces for a variety of diverse voices to be heard and diverse ways of living. It is not just about talking but also about interaction, it is creating an environment where you naturally interact with each other, rather than putting different races and religions in different "ghettos".
What can institutions such as the EU and the UN actually do to broaden intercultural dialogue (including between religions) and enhance religious tolerance in the world?
When people feel that they will not be heard or understood, they resort to violence. In this sense, interaction is very important in order to prevent violence. Europe, as well as the global community, should also give a very clear message that violence cannot be given impunity - especially to those governments inclined to give impunity to violence committed "in the name of religion". Europe has a leading role to play, as it is a largely democratic region and can thus show us how you can deepen democracy by being truly pluralistic.
What is the most important factor in promoting intercultural dialogue: education, family, international organisations or the media? Are than any other factors not mentioned?
They are all equally important. The media have played an important role and have very rarely had a negative role. Culture is another way of promoting intercultural dialogue. I talked this morning about how films in India have done a great service for public education on communal harmony. Education is also very important, because it is through education that people form their personalities. So is family: it is not just about upbringing, but about preventing families and communities from putting restrictions, beyond a certain level of which you cannot have exchanges.
For example, arranged marriages still exist and are often a taboo, even in many so-called civilised societies. It is also important that politicians are open and talk openly about things. The dignity of human beings must lie at the centre of all freedoms - whether it is religions freedom, freedom of expression or freedom from being exploited.
Today you cited former UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali: "We are, at one and the same time, the same and different". In what ways are we the same? How can the ordinary European citizens do to improve cultural understanding?
I worked in the past with one of the most underprivileged sections in the society and for them their dignity is as important as the dignity of anyone else who is more privileged. If you humiliate someone - regardless of colour or religion- the kind of feeling they have is universal. So in that way we are all the same. However, we can be different in our beliefs, our approaches to life and our spiritual ideas. So we are the same in many respects, but also different.
Europe is a very privileged region and citizens have a lot of skills. The citizens have first of all to be the leaders of their political leadership rather than the other way round. Ordinary citizens are the ones that should be showing the direction, bringing forward the right role models even if it means taking unpopular stands. It is more possible for citizens in Europe to do it than elsewhere.
It is sometimes said that conflict is interesting while harmony is boring. How can the media be persuaded to pay attention to intercultural dialogue as well as to religious violence?
The media will bring to the people what the people want to see. If there is a conflict in dialogue, the media will pick it up. If it is a boring dialogue or a dialogue where people are batting each other's back, the media is not likely to pick it up. When people have done creative work, the media has in general picked it up. Films have been made on even very small local movements that have done heroic work.
So you are optimistic about the future?
I am optimistic because wherever I have been I have seen that the vast majority of people are willing to live in diversity. It is often a minority that has taken all the others hostage. Therefore I think that when governments and public opinion makers make strategies, they have to give voice to that majority that is against violence, against discrimination and against religious persecution.

Dalai Lama at the EP - see the photos
The Dalai Lama spoke to MEPs Thursday about the importance of happiness and universal human values. The Buddhist spiritual leader also touched on the plight of Tibet.
In the last event of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue at the parliament, the 14th Dalai Lama, speaking without notes, said that his main concern is to promote human values and religious harmony. Welcoming him to the Parliament, President Hans-Gert Pöttering said, "Your non-violent approach provides an extraordinary example of committed and peaceful campaigning for a worthy cause".

Jonathan Sacks: "Make heroes of the moderates"
Sacks; "Someone who negates my very existence...cannot be a partner in dialogue" Jonathan Sacks, Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the British Commonwealth, visited the European Parliament on Wednesday as part of events celebrating the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. After addressing MEPs, he talked to us in an exclusive interview about hope and humour and said "the issue is how do we talk to the moderates so that we can isolate the extremists?"
Europe and America offer slightly different models for multi-racial, multi-religious societies. What can they learn from each other? Americans have always had to integrate newcomers, so the concept of "covenant" has always been part of the political culture of the United States. But the concept came from the political culture of Europe after the Reformation, which drew strongly on the Hebrew Bible. I suggest that Europe needs to go back to that concept, which has the power to unite different groups across differences of culture. It says: "we the people come together" - it's a very inclusive form of political identity. If you want to build a society, you must include everyone as a builder. If you contribute to something, you belong to it. So the US got this idea from Europe. They borrowed it and they kept on using it while Europe forgot all about it. It was born in the 17th century when European nations had to find a way of uniting themselves. Other ways are not good. The romantic reaction against rationalism in the 19th century created nation states predicated on race. If you predicate your nation on race, or religion, you have an exclusive nation. We know where that led: two World Wars and the Holocaust, so we can never go down that road again. You have yourself met radical Islamists, but can you talk to anyone? The condition for being able to talk to somebody is that they recognise your right to speak, that you are a partner in dialogue. Someone who negates my very existence, or my identity, or my right to have rights, cannot be a partner in dialogue. So the issue is not how do we talk to the extremists, the issue is how do we talk to the moderates so that we can isolate the extremists. Europe must empower the moderates, so as to marginalise the extremists. That is a political challenge, because unfortunately the media empower extremists. If you hijack an oil tanker, or explode something, or kill people, you get publicity. So the very structure of the media presents extremists as a role model for disaffected young people. They become heroes. And then young people say: "oh, I want to be like that". And, my goodness, unless there's a counter-force, then everyone is in trouble. So don't talk to the extremists, make heroes of the moderates. Thinking of the Middle East... Shouldn't religions be a tool for understanding, rather than a reason for fighting? Religion is like the weather. Sometimes it is sunny and you love the weather and other times it's cold and wet and you can't stand the weather. There is no such thing as religion without good elements and bad elements. In ages of rapid change, destabilisation, uncertainty and fear, people turn to those offering them certainty, and they are always the extremists. For them the world is simple: we are right, they are wrong. Where you have political turbulence and religious extremism, the real heroes are the people who oppose the extremists within their religion. Some have been assassinated for it, some excommunicated. You need courage to stand up against the extremists. There are amongst the Israelis and Palestinians, religious leaders very much in favour of peace and of recognising the genuine religiosity of the other side. Looking at history, is there really hope that different religions can coexist in peace? People confuse optimism and hope, and there is a difference. Optimism is the belief that things are going to get better. Hope is the belief that if we work hard enough we may be able to make things better. Optimism is a passive virtue, hope is active. One needs no courage to be an optimist, just a certain naivety. But it needs a great deal of courage to have hope. Knowing what our people have lived through over 3000-plus years, no Jew who knows Jewish history can be an optimist; but no Jew can ever give up hope. The national anthem of Israel means "hope". Our task as religious leaders is to be agents of hope in a world close to despair. It takes tenacity and even courage to keep hoping, but the alternative is not to be contemplated; the politics of despair are always dangerous politics. Are jokes part of hope? Absolutely! Humour is the first cousin of hope. I even suggested to President Pöttering that after the European Year for Intercultural Dialogue he might try a European Year of Humour. I was only joking!

Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew: "The planet is our common home, Christians and non-Christians"
Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew Patriarch Bartholomew came to Parliament yesterday (24 September) with a message of peaceful and fruitful coexistence: between religion and politics, between Christians and Muslims. We are all "children of the same God", he said. When we spoke to him after his speech, he emphasised that there is "room for everyone" in Europe, including Turkey, with coexistence producing "mutual enrichment".
Today you, as a religious leader, have addressed a political institution. How do you see the interrelation between religion and politics at the European level today?
Religion and politics coexist, because they both serve man, they both exist for man. A politician cannot hide his faith, his religion, as these are part of his personal make-up and part of the way he does his job. European culture too is based on Christian faith, on the lessons of the Gospel - but this does not imply we should exclude non-Christians from Europe. The coexistence of Christians and non-Christians means mutual enrichment.
You have made dialogue between religions a priority. How would you describe current relations between Christians and Muslims in Europe?
The presence of several million Muslims in Europe today is simply a reality. We Christians, the majority, as well as those in the minority, must aspire to live in harmony as children of the same God. No minority, including Muslims, should live separately: they should be a full part of the society that welcomed them, and gain from the majority the best it has to offer.
European society is open. Mosques have been founded in many European cities (including at the heart of Catholicism in Rome) and it is natural it should be so. In Athens too there should be a mosque for Muslims to pray when they want to. But this must work both ways. It is unfair for example that it is not possible to establish a Christian church in Saudi Arabia. In Constantinople we are a very small Christian minority, but we are Turkish citizens and, as a minority, entirely fulfil our obligations to the state. But we do not always receive equal treatment with majority Muslims. It saddens us to feel somehow second-class citizens.
You have been called the "Green Patriarch" for supporting environmental issues. Why have you backed such causes?
I inherited this interest in ecology from my predecessor, the late Patriarch Dimitrios, who established 1 September as a day of prayer for the protection of the environment. This is an urgent and critical issue in all corners of the globe. Every day we hear about the devastation caused by hurricanes, floods and climate change in general.
I was in New Orleans to see the destruction wrought by Katrina. You have to see it with your own eyes to absorb the magnitude of the disaster. The church has a duty to do something. It must raise awareness among people, particularly the young, because the future of the planet is in their hands.
Environmental issues affect us all - Christians and non-Christians - because the planet is our common home, our "oikos". The word "ecology" derives from "oikos", Greek for "home". When the hurricane hits, it does not make distinctions...
We organize symposia on average every two years, to which we invite not only Christians but also people from other religions and specialities (biologists, environmentalists, clergy, etc). We are attempting to stimulate dialogue between science and religion. There are practical results. Recently, for example, in the Amazon, we saw with our own eyes how forests are felled to grow soya. An Anglican bishop from Liverpool was there; he was very moved, angry about what was going on and, when he returned to his diocese in Liverpool, he persuaded the local authorities to forbid ships carrying soya from Brazil from docking there. The forests of Brazil generate vast quantities of oxygen and thus affect not only Brazil but the whole planet.
You have a very particular perspective both on inter-religious dialogue and on relations between Turkey and its neighbours. Do you think these are factors that will influence the ongoing accession negotiations between Turkey and the EU?
Turkey has good relations with all its neighbours, including Greece, Bulgaria and Romania, three Orthodox countries and now members of the EU. These relations will help Turkey in its accession negotiations, but will also benefit the peoples of the wider neighbourhood, who instead of killing each other and spending billions on armaments, can learn to coexist peacefully and to use their money for public works, education and so on, rather than for weapons.
Many say that Turkey, as an almost entirely a Muslim country, has no place in Europe. We believe that the difference of religion should not be an obstacle. If Turkey fulfils all the criteria for candidate countries, it can be accepted to the EU even if its population is Muslim. This is a different world, but it can coexist with the Christian world, as it has happened many times in the past and in many places across the globe. In Europe there is room for everyone, as long as we adapt and avoid living in ghettos.

Wole Soyinka - Africa's first literary laureate
Wole Soyinka: "every culture has its priorities" African week has brought many prominent people to the European Parliament this week. One of them is Wole Soyinka, a Nigerian writer, poet, playwright and the first African winner of the Nobel prize for literature in 1986. On Thursday, in talks with MEPs, he spoke passionately about the need for human rights violators to face justice. Whilst at the EP we caught up with him and asked him his views on cooperation between cultures.
Wole Soyinka has been imprisoned several times in Nigeria for his mediation during the civil war and later criticism of the military and government. All his poetry and plays seem to deal with corruption, tyranny and the cult of personality in African dictatorships. Wole Soyinka, on Thursday you were on the panel for the closing session on intercultural dialogue. What issues should people be talking about concerning intercultural dialogue? "For me it's a human phenomenon - what we're talking about is how to practicalise and enhance this kind of dialogue. The international community has reached the level now that the notion of a hierarchy of cultures has been eroded. Nowadays the recognition of cultures that are unknown or strange is far more advanced and there is far more dissemination of cultural phenomena. So what it means is that the mechanisms of cultural exchange need to be enhanced". Your work has dealt with many political themes in Africa - corruption, abuse of power and so forth. What role should the poet and playwright play in society - in Africa and in Europe? "Again we come to this cultural interaction and obviously every culture has its priorities. I have always taken the position that somehow political concerns have a way of occupying the proper space within cultural programmes. People constantly ask the question "what is the place of the individual in the community". I believe that the socio-political element of culture, whether it is the poetry of the African continent or the Soviet Union, finds its own way. It's like water - it finds its own level". You spoke earlier about "mechanisms of exchange" between cultures, what do you mean exactly? "To give you examples, the British Council and the Alliance Française from time to time send theatre groups to Africa for performances and workshop - to Nigeria for example. Then Nigerian groups can go abroad and introduce to the audiences theatrical idioms that they have never encountered before. One only has to be part of this to see how much enriching it is that they spread their horizons". The other example is the phenomenon of the internationalisation of local festivals. One example is the festival at my University which is called "Masks, Masquerades and Marionettes". It was an opportunity to introduce Nigerians to the mask traditions of the rest of the world. We invited Japan, China, and the Scandinavian countries. Many Nigerians do not know that so called "masking" is a tradition of these countries - they always thought it was from Africa. It was doubly useful for Nigerians because there is this religious fundamentalism which is warping the cultural understanding and the horizons of people. Many Christians and Muslims (in Nigeria) still believe that masks are a sign of fetishism, paganism, barbarism - including students. How do you feel to be at the European Parliament during Africa week? How do I feel? This is my old stomping ground! When we were in trouble I used to visit MEPs and talk to them. When things seem to be stabilised in our country and I received an invitation, it was an opportunity to come here and say thanks for your assistance during the last dictatorship. I'm usually invited during crises for Nigeria - and we're hoping never to have to come back under those circumstances. I'm quite happy to pass through...
