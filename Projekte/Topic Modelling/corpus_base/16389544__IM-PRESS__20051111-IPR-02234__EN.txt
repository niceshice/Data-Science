In recent years, eel stocks in Europe have declined rapidly, to the extent that some are concerned they may become extinct if action is not taken urgently to reverse the trend.
In an own initiative report adopted by Parliament, MEPs call for the Member States to draw up national management plans for eel stocks as soon as possible and for the Commission to undertake a range of research projects to study the problem.
MEPs also want the Commission to adjust the policy on catches and exports of eel in such a way that enough glass eels are available for natural migration and enough are available at a reasonable price for restocking natural eel habitats.
