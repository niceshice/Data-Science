A MEP casts his vote during the last EP presidential election On 17 and 18 January, MEPs will elect a new president, 14 vice-presidents and 5 quaestors. Three candidates have put their names forward for the top job: German Socialist Martin Schulz, British Liberal Diana Wallis and British Conservative Nirj Deva. Before voting commences here's how it works.
Why are there elections?
The EP is elected for five years, but the term of office for president, vice-presidents, quaestors and committee chairs is two and a half years, so it's all change at mid-term.
Who can stand as a candidate for president?
Any MEP can stand if they are backed by a political group or a minimum of 40 MEPs.
How does the presidential election work?
Election is by secret ballot. MEPs mark their preferred candidate on a ballot paper and place the vote in a ballot box, overseen by eight tellers chosen from among MEPs.
A candidate getting an absolute majority of the votes cast (50% + 1) is elected. Blank or spoiled ballot papers are not counted.
If there is no winner after the first ballot , the same candidates or new candidates can be nominated for a second round of voting under the same conditions. This can be repeated a third time if necessary.
If no-one is elected at the third ballot, the two highest scoring candidates go to a fourth ballot , where the winner is decided by simple majority. If there is a tie, the older candidate is declared the winner.
What does the President do?
The president oversees all the EP's work, its governing bodies and plenary debates. He or she represents the parliament in all legal affairs and external relations and at the start of every European Council summit sets out the EP's point of view about the items on the agenda.
The president signs the EU budget into law and co-signs legislation with the president of the Council.
What about the election of vice-presidents?
The 14 vice-presidents are nominated in the same way as the president and are elected by secret ballot after the presidential vote. All candidates are on a single voting paper. In the first round, candidates getting an absolute majority of votes cast, up to 14, are elected. If posts are still empty a second round of voting will be held and then a third, after which a relative majority is enough.
If only 14 candidates are nominated they will be elected by acclamation and a vote held to determine the order of precedence.
Who are the quaestors and what do they do?
The five quaestors are elected in a similar way to the vice-presidents. They are responsible for administrative and financial matters directly affecting MEPs.
