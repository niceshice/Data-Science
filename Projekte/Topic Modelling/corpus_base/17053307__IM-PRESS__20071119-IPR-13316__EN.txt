Geert Dancet, nominee for the post of Executive Director of the European Chemicals Agency in Helsinki, took part in a hearing before the Environment Committee on Wednesday. During the hearing, Mr Dancet, whose formal appointment is scheduled for a month from now, stressed his personal independence and that of the Agency. He promised MEPs he would keep the committee informed about the Agency's work on a regular basis.
After the hearing, the MEPs who coordinate their political groups within the committee decided to support the appointment of Mr Dancet, expressing the hope that the future relationship between the committee and the agency will be built on mutual trust. A letter of evaluation will now be sent to the Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering so that he can transmit the EP assessment to the Chairman of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) Management Board, Jukka Malm.
Mr Dancet was chosen on 17 October 2007 by the Management Board of ECHA as the candidate for the position of the Executive Director. He has served as ECHA’s interim Executive Director since 1 June 2007, the date of entry into force of the regulation on the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemical substances (REACH). The ECHA, which started its work on the same day, will manage these processes to ensure consistency across the European Union.
