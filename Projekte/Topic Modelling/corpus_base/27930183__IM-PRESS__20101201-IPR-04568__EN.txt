In their first discussion on the 2009 budget discharge, MEPs pressed for simplified procedures for managing EU funds, a public register of beneficiaries, stricter sanctions against mismanagement, improved recovery of incorrectly spent funds and more political accountability of Member States for spending by national administrations.
Despite the downward trend in errors, MEPs remain critical of the implementation of the EU budget, for which the European Commission is responsible. On Tuesday and Wednesday Budget Control Committee MEPs questioned the commissioners responsible for the lion's share of EU spending, Johannes Hahn (regional development), László Andor (social inclusion and employment) and Dacien Cioloş (Agriculture) in the context of the budget discharge procedure for 2009.
Parliament's rapporteur for the 2009 discharge, Mr Jorgo Chatzimarkakis (ALDE, DE), welcomed the reduction in errors, but added that "I hope this is structural and not coincidence". He advocated a "system change" so as "to make more effective use of the EU budget in the interest of the European taxpayers."
Declarations of assurance
Given that almost 80% of the EU budget is spent through national administrations, Member States' declarations of assurance that EU funds have been correctly spent should be signed by their finance ministers, said Mr Chatzimarkakis. At present, this is the practice in only four Member States. "Finance ministers have to take responsibility. Correct or incorrect use of funds should be a discussion topic in the ECOFIN Council", he added.
Furthermore, budgeting rules should be simplified "so that nobody can hide behind the complexity of the procedures", he added. Many errors identified by the Court of Auditors relate to non-compliance with procurement rules or financing of ineligible costs.
Sanctions
All three commissioners said they were stepping up their use of sanctions to persuade Member States to improve supervison of spending. "We interrupted payments 43 times in 2009. If, within six months, there was no solution for the problem, we blocked the payments completely", said Mr Hahn.
Mr Cioloş confirmed that in the case of Greece, sanctions had worked. "They came with an action plan and the system improved. However, one should separate two issues: the quality of the supervisory system and the way the system is being used", he said.
Simplification of the rules is unlikely to happen before 2013, when the new multi-annual financial framework (MFF) will be put in place, said commissioners Andor and Cioloş. In agriculture, many errors relate to complex definitions in the procedures. "We will introduce new definitions in the new Common Agricultural Policy", Mr Cioloş promised.
Ingeborg Grässle (EPP, DE) called for more transparency on beneficiaries: "would it be possible to have a public register, showing all the beneficiaries of public money coming from the EU budget?", she asked. Mr Cioloş agreed with the idea, but pointed out that there would be problems where the beneficiary is a real person, rather than a legal one.
Derek Vaughan (S&D, UK) and Peter Skinner (S&D, UK) criticised the use of structural funds for relocating companies within the EU. They referred to Twinings, a British tea manufacturer which is using €12 million in EU grants to move part of its operations from the UK to Poland. Jean-Pierre Audy (EPP, FR) agreed that by financing such operations, "we are financing our own impopularity."
Budget Control Committee Chairman Mr De Magistris (ALDE, IT), expressed worries about organised crime infiltrating public procurement procedures, as allegedly is the case in Abruzzi.
The next budget discharge hearing will be on 13 January 2011 with Commissioner Piebalgs (Development).
Background
The European Parliament is the EU budget discharge authority. Following the audit and finalisation of the annual accounts, Parliament will - on a recommendation by the Council of Ministers - decide whether or not to grant discharge to the Commission and other EU bodies for their spending in 2009.
The discharge for budget implementation is the decision by which the European Parliament "releases" the Commission from its responsibility for management of a given budget by marking the end of that budget's existence.
In the chair: Luigi de MAGISTRIS (ALDE, IT)
