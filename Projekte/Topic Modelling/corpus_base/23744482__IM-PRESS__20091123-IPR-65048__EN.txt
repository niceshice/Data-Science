The sale and use of pesticides needs to be monitored more strictly as part of EU plans to ensure they are used more safely. To this end, Parliament on Tuesday adopted new rules for the dissemination of statistics on the sale and use of pesticides.
The vote (581 in favour, 19 against, 3 abstentions) was on a third-reading agreement reached between Parliament and EU government representatives.
It includes compromises on the thorniest issues, such as the scope of the regulation: it will be restricted to plant protection products and include non-agricultural uses. The law will lay down rules on the frequency and format of data collection and the requirement to report data periodically. It also complements other legislation on pesticides agreed at the end of last year.
