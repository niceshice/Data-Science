Microcredit: MEPs say it should be widely available
EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering announced that the written declaration on microcredit has been adopted. It calls on the Commission and the Council to lend greater support to microcredit projects and to bolster programmes to help women. The written declaration calls for human and financial resources to be allocated to microcredit projects in the developing countries and in the Mediterranean.
The declaration requests the Commission and the Council to recognise the importance of microcredit in the context of the Barcelona Process and in the neighbourhood and development policies.
More than half of the total of number of MEPs have now signed the declaration (424 out of 785) which means that it becomes an official position of the European Parliament. The declaration was put forward by Jamila MADEIRA (PES, PT), Ana Maria GOMES (PES, PT), Anna ZÁBORSKÁ (EPP-ED, SK), Luisa MORGANTINI (GUE/NGL, IT) and Miguel Angel MARTÍNEZ MARTÍNEZ (PES, ES).
MEPs point out that microcredit represents a method of lending small amounts that can be accessed by disadvantaged persons and that microcredit has permitted the extremely successful development of self-help employment projects, while also enabling the improvement of living conditions, and is also an important vehicle for the empowerment of women.
Finally, the House says that microcredit is a key tool for the combating of poverty and an instrument for achieving the Millennium Goals.
