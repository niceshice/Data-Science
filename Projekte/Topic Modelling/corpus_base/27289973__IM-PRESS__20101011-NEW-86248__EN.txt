2011 budget: MEPs seek talks on new sources of funding
2010-10-15 - 15:22
MEPs are set to call for more investment in research, innovation, education, energy and support for Palestine, but are expected to keep a restrictive overall spending level, when they vote on next year's EU budget on Wednesday. They also wish to open talks on the current long-term budget framework and new ways of funding the budget. This year is the first in which Parliament has a full say on the whole EU budget, including farm spending, under the new Lisbon Treaty rules. New responsibilities, including the EU External Action Service, need to be funded. MEPs also want to increase funding for competitiveness, to help the EU to emerge from the crisis.
Given the current pressures on Member States' national budgets, Budgets Committee MEPs refrained from seeking any major increases in the overall level of the EU budget compared to the European Commission's initial proposal and - for the first time in 20 years - approved a proposed budget within the limits of the long-term budget framework (known as the "financial perspective").
The Budgets Committee is proposing an overall budget of €130.14 billion in payments and €142.65 billion in commitments, compared with the Commission's initial proposals of €130.14bn and €142.57bn respectively. The Council is seeking to cut these figures to €126.53bn and €141.78bn.
New sources of funding
The Budgets Committee also wants to open negotiations on new sources of budget funding, including transferring unspent money to future budgets instead of returning it to Member States. The intention is to open negotiations as early as this year on the budget for the years after 2011.
MEPs also reiterated their demand for a revision of the current financial perspective, on the basis of the mid-term review to be presented by the Commission on Tuesday 19 October.
As in previous years, there are two budget rapporteurs: Sidonia Jędrzejewska (EPP, PL) is responsible for the European Commission budget, including the EU's operational spending, while Helga Trüpel (Greens/EFA, DE) is leading Parliament's work on the other institutions' budgets.

20 weeks' maternity leave on full pay?
2010-10-15 - 15:22
A proposal by the Women's Rights Committee to extend minimum maternity leave in the EU from 14 to 20 weeks, with full pay, will be put to a plenary vote in Strasbourg on Wednesday. MEPs also want to introduce a right for fathers to take at least two weeks of paid paternity leave. Existing EU law on maternity leave is being revised as part of the "work-life balance" package. The European Commission has proposed extending minimum maternity leave from 14 to 18 weeks but the Women's Rights Committee voted to extend it to 20 weeks. However, MEPs backed the Commission's proposal that out of the total maternity leave, 6 weeks should be taken after childbirth.
The committee took these decisions when it amended the draft legislation in a report by Edite Estrela (S&D, PT) on 23 February 2010 that was adopted by 19 votes to 13, with 1 abstention.
Workers on maternity leave must be paid their full salary, which must be 100% of their last monthly salary or their average monthly salary, says the committee. In its draft law, the Commission recommended the principle of full payment but did not go as far as making this mandatory, saying instead that it should not be below the rate of sick-leave payments.
Paternity leave
Another committee amendment would require Member States to give fathers the right to fully paid paternity leave of at least two weeks within the period of maternity leave. Committee MEPs who opposed this provision argue that paternity leave lies outside the scope of this legislation, which covers the "health and safety of pregnant women".
Employment rights
The Committee also adopted amendments to ban the dismissal of pregnant workers from the beginning of a pregnancy to at least 6 months following the end of the maternity leave. It also said that women must be entitled to return to their jobs or to "equivalent posts", i.e. a position with the same pay, professional category and duties as before maternity leave.
Impact assessment
The Women's Rights Committee and the Employment and Social Affairs Committee asked for an impact assessment of the "substantive amendments" adopted, to determine the economic and social costs and benefits. This was done in line with the Council/Parliament/Commission inter-institutional agreement on better lawmaking and the guidelines of Parliament's Conference of Committee Chairs. This impact assessment will serve as input for the vote in plenary.
Monday's joint debate on working conditions for women includes a second topic: MEPs will discuss a resolution by Britta Thomsen (S&D, DK) on women workers with precarious employment conditions.

EEAS: accountability and balanced recruitment
2010-10-15 - 15:22
The European External Action Service (EEAS) will move a step closer to starting work if MEPs in Strasbourg adopt the amendments needed to the EU budget and staff rules and also modify the 2010 budget. On Monday, before the plenary vote, the Legal Affairs Committee will meet to decide its position on matters such as recruitment, independence and geographical and gender balance in the new service.
Several legislative changes are needed before the EEAS can be launched, including amendments to budgetary and staff rules. First, MEPs must vote to modify the EU's own budget rules - the "financial regulation". During negotiations with Council and Commission, the Parliament delegation - led by Ingeborg Gräßle (EPP, DE) and Crescenzio Rivellini (EPP, IT) - successfully pushed for greater transparency and budgetary control by MEPs over the service. EEAS expenditure will need a budgetary discharge from Parliament and the Commission will have to provide MEPs with detailed information about that spending. Heads of EU Delegations will have to follow special budget courses.
To enable the EEAS to get started this year, MEPs also have to vote to modify the 2010 budget, on the basis of a report drafted by Roberto Gualtieri (S&D, IT) and László Surján (EPP, HU).
Staff rules: geographical and gender balance needed
On Monday evening, the Legal Affairs Committee will vote on proposals by Bernhard Rapkay (S&D, DE) to modify the Staff Regulations. During debates in committee, MEPs emphasised that all appointments in the EEAS, including for Heads of Delegations, should be based on merit and ensure geographical and gender balance. The need to guarantee the loyalty and independence of all EEAS staff regardless of origin was also underlined.
In the compromise amendments to be put to the vote on Monday, MEPs say the EEAS should be composed of "staff of the highest standard of ability, efficiency and integrity, recruited on the broadest possible geographical basis from among nationals of Member States of the Union". Staff of the EEAS must comprise an "appropriate and meaningful presence of nationals from all the Member States" and the High Representative must promote equal opportunities for the under-represented gender in certain job categories.

Late payments: 30 days to pay a bill
2010-10-15 - 15:22
A perennial problem facing small companies is the late payment of their bills. For over a year the European Parliament has pushed to ensure stricter, clear-cut rules on payment periods to improve business solvency and boost innovation and jobs. The House will be asked on Wednesday to endorse a deal reached with the Council setting down a standard 30-day deadline for payment. The basic deadline for both public and private sectors to pay bills for goods or services will now be 30 days unless another date is fixed in the contract.
However, Member States may lay down a standard deadline of up to 60 days for public bodies that provide health care. Otherwise, public authorities can only extend the deadline to 60 days if "objectively justified", and can never go beyond 60 days.
Contracts between private sector businesses can establish deadlines beyond 60 days, if "expressly agreed" and not "grossly unfair".
Parliament negotiators pushed to avoid loopholes and to ensure that any derogation from the general deadline is only accepted under special circumstances. They especially fought hard to ensure that public authorities can never delay their payments beyond 60 days. MEPs also won important concessions on the verification period and the interest rate payable if payments are made late.
In the present economic crisis late payments for goods or services can mean the difference between staying in business and going bankrupt, especially for Europe's many small and medium-sized companies which are particularly vulnerable to late payments from customers.
Member States will have two years to implement the new measures.

Mid-term review by President Jerzy Buzek
2010-10-15 - 15:22
As he reaches the mid-way point of his two-and-a-half-year term of office (July 2009-January 2012), Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek will review progress made on the priorities he outlined at the start of his mandate. His assessment will be delivered at a formal sitting of the House on Wednesday at noon. Key issues for Mr Buzek have included building a European energy community, reforming global governance, advancing democracy and human rights and modernising and financing EU policies for 2013. Other important areas have been tackling the economic and financial crisis, strengthening EU neighbourhood policy, maximising Europe's influence in a multi-polar world, building a parliamentary Europe and promoting a citizen's Europe. President Buzek will continue to work on these priorities, focusing on the debate over the EU budget, which is becoming increasingly important for the European Parliament.

The financial crisis and beyond
2010-10-15 - 15:22
The current financial turmoil will once again come under the spotlight next week when Parliament votes on two non-legislative reports suggesting what lessons can be learnt from the crisis. The recent turbulence has laid bare the limits of self-regulation, says Parliament's Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis (CRIS) in its mid-term report, drafted by Pervenche Bérès (S&D, FR). It calls for strong pan-European and global regulation and supervisory systems that leave no financial market, instrument or institution "off the record book". The Commission is asked to make full use of its right of initiative and to pay special attention to energy efficiency projects to ensure resources needed for future growth.
A report by the Economics Committee on improving economic governance, drafted by Diogo Feio (EPP, PT) broadly backs the Commission's legislative proposals but goes further on a permanent European monetary fund, the creation of European bonds and the need to tackle budget surpluses as well as deficits. An increased role for the European Parliament in the national budget vetting procedure is also envisaged.

An EU-wide minimum income to combat poverty
2010-10-15 - 15:22
With the annual UN Eradication of Poverty Day taking place on 17 October, and 2010 designated as European Year against Poverty, MEPs will debate and vote on a resolution calling for an EU-wide minimum income. Introducing minimum income schemes in all EU Member States would be the most effective way to combat poverty, to guarantee an adequate standard of living and to foster social integration, says the resolution drafted for the Employment and Social Affairs Committee by Portuguese MEP Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL). A minimum income should be pitched at 60% of the median income of the country concerned, states the resolution, which calls on the Commission to present "an initiative" in this area.
However, a call for an EU framework law on a minimum income was not supported by the committee when it adopted its draft resolution on 23 June.
MEPs will also discuss with the Commission and Council the outcome of the UN Summit on the Millennium Development Goals (New York, 20-22 September), where a global action plan was adopted to achieve the eight anti-poverty goals by their 2015 target date. In addition to this, $40 billion have been pledged for the next five years as a major push to accelerate progress on women’s and children’s health.

Fisheries in the North Atlantic
2010-10-15 - 15:22
Two international agreements on fishing in the North Atlantic come before Parliament for a vote in Strasbourg next week. When Parliament votes on the amended convention on the Northwest Atlantic fisheries region, it will be making the first use of its power, acquired under the Lisbon Treaty, to approve or reject an international fisheries agreement concluded by the EU. MEPs will also be voting on the transposition into EU rules of a fisheries accord on control and enforcement measures in the North-East Atlantic.
Northwest Atlantic
First, Parliament will vote on whether to approve changes to the convention on co-operation in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) area, which encompasses a large portion of the Atlantic, including areas near the USA, Canada, Greenland and St Pierre et Miquelon (France). The aim is to modernise the organisation and streamline its procedures. Parliament's report on this issue was drafted by Jarosław Wałęsa (EPP, PL). The EP Fisheries Committee is recommending that Parliament give its consent to this multilateral agreement.

MEPs will then vote on rules transposing into EU law the new control and enforcement scheme of the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC), designed to monitor vessels engaged in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. To speed up adoption of the rules, MEPs negotiated a compromise with the Council on 15 September. Parliament's report on this topic was drafted by Carmen Fraga Estévez (EPP, ES).

Country of origin markings to help EU consumers
2010-10-15 - 15:22
Parliament will vote in Strasbourg on new rules designed to ensure that goods imported from outside the EU clearly state their country of origin. National country-of-origin rules exist in some Member States but there are currently no EU-wide rules.
The International Trade Committee says goods should clearly state their country of origin, to help consumers make informed choices and to protect them against possible health risks, counterfeiting and unfair competition.
MEPs will debate the proposed legislation on Wednesday night and then vote on Thursday. Under the proposed new rules, "country-of-origin" markings will have to appear on a wide range of products such as textile, footwear, glassware and pharmaceutical products, tools, screws, taps and furniture. The new law will apply only to goods destined for final consumers.
The rules will not apply to goods from the European Union, Turkey, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein.
Under the Commission proposal, the words "made in", together with the country of origin, must be stated "in a language that is easily understood by consumers in the Member State where the goods are to be marketed". Trade Committee MEPs inserted an amendment to allow the use of English, as a possible alternative, anywhere in the EU. MEPs also insisted that the Commission must propose minimum common standards for penalties, to ensure that the rules are applied uniformly in all Member States.

Protecting Europe's seas and coastal regions
2010-10-15 - 15:22
EU Member States should do more to protect their marine environment, says a draft resolution by the Transport Committee to be put to the vote on Thursday. Separately, MEPs are calling for steps to be taken to halt losses of shipping containers at sea. Noting the disastrous consequences of the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, the draft resolution urges that a European strategy be devised for tackling and preventing oil spills.
A separate issue, highlighted by an oral question to the Commission, is the need to prevent losses of shipping containers at sea. More than 2000 shipping containers are lost overboard in EU waters each year. Losses can be stemmed, says the oral question, by improving container lashing and ensuring that all containers are weighed in port and correctly stowed before vessels head out to sea. The use of automatically activated beacons to aid container location should be investigated and the legal compensation regime updated.

Suspending import barriers to help Pakistan
2010-10-15 - 15:22
MEPs will discuss with the Commission plans to temporarily open up the EU market to textile and clothing imports from Pakistan, despite fears of the adverse effect this could have on European industry and jobs. A temporary suspension of import duty would provide an additional boost for Pakistan on top of the EU humanitarian aid earmarked for the country following the disastrous floods in August this year.

Parliament and Commission: an enhanced relationship
2010-10-15 - 15:22
Relations between MEPs and the Commission will be strengthened if the full Parliament backs the new framework agreement on co-operation between the two institutions. The revised accord reflects Parliament's new powers introduced by the Lisbon Treaty. The agreement between the two institutions brings major improvements in legislative procedure and planning, parliamentary scrutiny, the EU's international relations, obligations to provide information and the Commission's presence in Parliament.
Parliament will vote on two reports, one on the framework agreement itself and the other on changes needed in Parliament's internal rules of procedure.
Relations between the EP and the Commission are governed by a framework agreement which is reviewed every five years. The current update reflects the new interinstitutional balance under the Lisbon Treaty, with the establishment of Parliament and Council as equal arms of legislative and budgetary authority. If endorsed by Parliament, it will take effect immediately.

Parliamentary scrutiny of EU external co-operation
2010-10-15 - 15:22
Parliament will vote on a proposal to give MEPs a power of scrutiny over how the European Commission finances projects intended to promote stability in non-EU countries, improve cooperation with developing and other countries and promote democracy and human rights. MEPs say that foreign policy strategies and external relations projects stretching over several years must be adopted by means of "delegated acts", which would give the European Parliament a de facto veto, as it can require the Commission to change its proposals.
The proposal for Parliament to have the power of scrutiny is among the amendments tabled by EP committees to a planned overhaul of the EU's external co-operation instruments.
Parliament will be voting at first reading on a total of five reports: two on the financing instrument for development cooperation, drafted by Gay Mitchell (EPP, IE) and Charles Goerens (ALDE, LU); one on the promotion of human rights and democracy, drafted by Barbara Lochbihler (Greens/EFA, DE) and Kinga Gal (EPP, HU); and two on the instrument for stability and the financing instrument for co-operation with industrialised countries, drafted by Franziska Brantner (Greens/EFA, DE), and Helmut Scholz (GUE/NGL, DE) respectively.

Anti-counterfeiting accord under the spotlight
2010-10-15 - 15:22
Parliament will hold a debate on Wednesday evening on the controversial new multilateral Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), after the consolidated draft text of the accord was released on 6 October. ACTA is a planned new multilateral agreement between the EU and other countries such as the US, Canada, Japan, Australia and Mexico aimed at combating infringements of intellectual property rights, for example the piracy of music, films and clothing.
Parliament adopted a resolution last March calling for the negotiations to be transparent. MEPs demanded then that no personal searches should be conducted at EU borders and that the agreement should not introduce any kind of "three strikes" internet disconnection as a penalty for three online copyright infringements.
In a written declaration signed by a majority of MEPs by September this year, Parliament also stressed that the agreement should not impose any harmonisation of EU copyright, patent or trademark law nor weaken fundamental rights such as freedom of expression and the right to privacy. Furthermore, ACTA should not harm global access to legal, affordable and safe medicines, emphasised MEPs.

Relations with Ukraine and Moldova
2010-10-15 - 15:22
Catherine Ashton, the EU Foreign Policy High Representative, will update MEPs on the state of play in EU-Ukraine relations following the latest round of talks on a free trade agreement last week. Ukraine's ambitions for EU membership, its recent constitutional changes and allegations that media freedom has come under pressure in the country will probably be among issues mentioned in a resolution to be voted on Thursday.
A separate debate and resolution will be devoted to Moldova, also on Thursday. Among the main topics for discussion: Moldova's upcoming elections, negotiations to sign an Association Agreement with the EU and the country's ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court last Wednesday (13 October), which will commit the country to international justice and to cooperate to end impunity for genocides, crimes against humanity or war crimes.
In May and August this year Parliament gave its green light to grant a €500 million EU loan to Ukraine and €90 million to crisis-hit Moldova.
