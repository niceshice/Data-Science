2007-01-11 - 15:28
The 1 January 2007 marks the midway point of the sixth European parliamentary term. During the January plenary session in Strasbourg, MEPs will elect a new European Parliament President and 14 Vice-Presidents for the remaining two and half years. Outgoing European Parliament President Josep Borrell Fontelles will also make his last address to the House as President. The midway point in this parliamentary term is a timely opportunity to give an overview of the legislature so far.
The European Parliament changed dramatically in 2004. Following the historic enlargement of the EU from 15 to 25 Member States on 1 May 2004, European Parliament elections were held in June 2004 in all 25 Member States. The number of MEPs increased from 626 to 732. As a consequence, the number of official working languages increased from 11 to 20 with a mind-boggling possible 380 different language combinations for interpretation. From 1 January 2007, the number of MEPs rises temporarily to 785 with the addition of 35 Romanian 18 Bulgarian MEPs. After the European elections in 2009, the total number reduces to 736 MEPs. Also from 1 January 2007, the number of official languages rises from 20 to 23 with the addition of Romanian, Bulgarian and Irish.
One of Parliament's first duties after the 2004 European elections was to vote on the new European Commission, made up of 25 Commissioners. MEPs proved decisive with the House rejecting the first Italian candidate Rocco Buttiglione, before the House finally voted in favour of José Manuel Barroso's team in November 2004. In May 2005, Parliament also had to face the "no" votes on the Constitution in France and the Netherlands, MEPs had voted 500 votes to 137 with 40 abstentions in favour of the Constitutional Treaty in January 2005.
From a legislative point of view, Parliament's position on the much debated Services Directive which aims to facilitate the provision of cross-border services by removing obstacles to the free movement of services in the internal was taken up by EU government and eventually adopted by MEPs in November 2006. In December 2006, the European Parliament adopted the compromise it negotiated with Council on the new regulation for chemicals, REACH, which will oblige producers to register all those chemical substances produced or imported above a total quantity of 1 tonne per year. Registration will affect about 30,000 substances.
As for Parliament budgetary powers, in May 2006, Parliament adopted a report on the EU financial perspective for 2007-2013. After two years of hard negotiations with the EU Council of Ministers, the European Parliament managed to obtain €4 billion more than the EU Member States had originally been prepared to spend. MEPs had long sought to increase the EU budget substantially, to match the EU's growing ambitions. However, faced with the inflexibility of some Member States and the risk of a major crisis if the financial perspectives were not adopted on schedule, they opted for a "realistic" agreement, focusing their efforts on those policy areas that they deemed most important.
Below are selected headlines showing the European Parliament in action, exercising its supervisory, legislative and budgetary powers during the plenary sessions held in Strasbourg and Brussels.

No directive on software patents
(Vote: 06.07.2005 )
There will not be any EU legislation on the computer-implemented invention. Parliament rejected, by 648 votes to 14 with 18 abstentions, the so-called software patent directive, putting an end to a passionate three year debate.
Before the vote, rapporteur Michel ROCARD (PES, FR) said Parliament was split fifty-fifty on the issue and all political groups decided to reject the text rather than risk a result they could not accept. He added: "There is collective anger throughout the Parliament because of the way the directive was handled by the Commission and the Council," recalling the contested approval of the common position. He said the vote is a clear invitation to the Commission and the Council to show full respect to the EP in future. He concluded that "this legislation is not mature for adoption."

(13.12.2006)
Parliament adopted the compromise it negotiated with Council on the new regulation for chemicals, REACH, which will oblige producers to register all those chemical substances produced or imported above a total quantity of 1 tonne per year.

When no alternative exists, producers will have to present a research plan aimed at finding one. The compromise package agreed with the Council and tabled by 4 political groups (EPP-ED, PES, ALDE and UEN), was approved with 529 in favour, 98 against and 24 abstentions.

Less Fluorinated-gases in European atmosphere
(06.04.2006)
Fluorinated gases are not the solution! Used since the 1990s to replace ozone-depleting CFCs they are found mostly in refrigeration and air-conditioning systems, but also in windows, fire extinguishers, insulating foam or even sport shoes. But they have now also been incriminated in global warming. The European Parliament adopted two new laws to reduce, or prohibit, their use. This should help Member States to meet their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.

Better coordination will reduce the risk of floods
(13.6.2006 - First reading)

While emphasising the environmental impact of floods, the law leaves it up to Member States to develop specific measures for special areas.

PEACE Programme for Ireland set to be extended

(05.09.2006) first reading
Parliament adopted a first-reading report on the successful EU programme seeking to combat and prevent violence against children, young people and women: Daphne. The Parliament calls for a budget of €125 million for 2007-2013 as compared to €116.85 million in the Commission's proposal. MEPs also want to include domestic violence, genital mutilation and protection of victims as objectives of the programme.
Initially the Commission proposed a single programme covering "Daphne" and "Drugs and Prevention and information". In May 2006, the Commission presented a modified proposal taking into account the Parliament's request to split the two programmes. The report was adopted with 552 votes in favour 51 against with 64 abstentions.
