Animal welfare was the subject of a resolution by MEPs
Thursday's plenary saw MEPs approve measures that will widen animal welfare measures in the EU to include non-farm animals and introduce "animal friendly" labelling. They also voted on a resolution to postpone EU involvement in a patent scheme. Patents are a key way of protecting the fruits of innovation and stimulating economies across the European Union.
The resolution on animal welfare passed overwhelmingly by MEPs calls for: animal friendly labelling of products, a more proactive approach by the EU on animal welfare in World Trade Organisation talks and, finally, a ban on seal and other "cruel" products. MEPs also called upon countries to ban dog and cock fighting - although a measure to extend this to bull fighting was voted down.
The resolution also called for a ban on the importation, exportation, trading and processing of dog and cat fur. The resolution was based on a report by German Christian Democrat Elisabeth Jeggle.
Patents: the key to innovation
Translating new ideas into new products is key to boosting Europe's economy. A part of this is the protection of new ideas and products - so that the inventor can reap the benefits. While there may be consensus on this, there is still disagreement on how best to protect patents in Europe.
Thursday, MEPs approved a resolution postponing EU membership of the European Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA) - a course of action advocated by the European Commission. Joining the EPLA would lead to the creation of a court with jurisdiction over all patents in the EU. MEPs do not reject membership, but have reservations over the present text, - in particular the lack of democratic control over procedures to grant a patent. Members see the best way forward as the creation of a "Community Patent".
EU fundamental rights agency postponed
MEPs voted to postpone a final vote on two reports on the EU fundamental rights agency, to be based in Vienna. Members wanted the scope of the new body to be extended to intergovernmental cooperation in policing, justice and immigration and counter terrorism. Postponing the vote will allow the European Commission and Council to consult and reach a comprise. MEPs support the establishment of the agency but would like to see greater parliamentary involvement in it. In particular, MEPs want parliament to be consulted on the proposed 5-year framework of the agency and the appointment of its director.
