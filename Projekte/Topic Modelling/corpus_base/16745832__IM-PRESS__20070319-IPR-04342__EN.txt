50th anniversary of EU - 25 March 2007 50 years since the Treaty of Rome
The UK was not there at the birth and for a good portion of our membership we have been infamously semi-detached. Are people in a mood to celebrate 50 years? If not celebrate exactly then we are seriously taking the opportunity to reflect and look forward.
In London, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Belfast and elsewhere over the past few weeks leading up to 25 March you could have gone along to events day and night reflecting, analysing and trying to determine where we go from here. They have focussed on issues of environment, business, culture, philosophy, foreign affairs and football. What sort of Europe has the EU created? How do we fit in?
We are seeing the first ever London Festival of Europe - a gathering of philosophers, artists and thinkers from across the world in some of London's most important cultural institutions to throw open the possibility of public debate on the many and varied European questions. Whilst some debates remain more academic and conceptual it feels now, maybe for the first time, that discussions of what affects all Europeans directly is really happening. The borderless Europe we have created throws up questions such as immigration, diversity in religion and culture, international crime. How will a single market with goods transported vast distances accommodate itself to the new global environmental requirements? Such issues have a widespread appeal and importance in each and every EU country and across borders. These are issues everyone is talking about.
Throughout the year, the UK Office of the European Parliament is using the 50th celebrations to encourage people to look at how our lives have changed in the past 50 years and what role the EU has played in reflecting and cementing these changes. On 21 March in collaboration with the European Commission and the Romanian Cultural Institute we are holding an evening of poetry readings with poems from all 27 Member States mirroring decade by decade political and personal changes. The event will be webcast to allow a larger audience to listen in. In two new websites the Office is looking at key issues affecting people's lives then and now: echoes of 1957, showcasing new ideas and ways of talking about Europe, and taking the opportunity to interview key individuals in different sectors who explain how the EU has changed lives and how EU law has underpinned developments.
On 19 March in the EP Office in Scotland Geoff Hoon MP, Minister for Europe gave a speech " Fifty Years on - where does the EU go now?". On 25 March, there will be a roundtable on "50 Years in the European Union - France, Germany and Italy". It is hosted by the Italian Cultural Institute of Scotland and co-organised by EP and EC Edinburgh with the Consul General of Germany.
The UK Office is also focussing on long-term education. In addition to the recently produced teaching resource: the European Parliament what's that ? - the first dedicated pack of resources for teachers which fits into the national curriculum, 21 March will see the launch of an e-project for schools " Learning Together" This is the flagship 50th anniversary project of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to be rolled out throughout the year to schools . The UK Office is on the steering committee.
Giving people a platform and a venue to come together on a large-scale and talk about EU issues in common is another aim of the 50th anniversary year. The UK session of the EU Citizens Consultations happens in York on 24-25 March with the participation of three UK MEPs: Diana Wallis ( ALDE, Liberal Democrat, Yorkshire), John Bowis (Conservative, London, EPP-ED) and Linda McAvan (Labour, PES, Yorkshire) On 9 March the UK Office organised a Citizens Forum in Cardiff .
