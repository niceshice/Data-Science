Dairy quotas: MEPs favour 2% voluntary increase

The European Parliament believes the dairy quotas of the Member States should be increased on a voluntary basis by 2% from 1 April 2008, with a mechanism for "balancing out" between states that exceed their quotas and those that under-use them, to avoid penalising any state that has a surplus. This should provide a solution to growing demand on world markets, while taking account of differing situations among EU producers.
To meet rising demand on European and world markets, the Commission recently proposed increasing dairy production quotas by 2% in all Member States from 1 April 2008, which would represent a potential of 2.84 million additional tonnes for the year 2008/2009 over the current total of 145.7 million tonnes.
During the debate ahead of the vote, a majority of MEPs backed the principle of an increase to enable the dairy sector to take advantage of new opportunities on world markets, notably those arising from Asia's economic growth. Others, including rapporteur Elisabeth Jeggle (EPP-ED, DE), feared that a uniform increase of 2% would result in lower prices paid to producers who are already in difficulty, in a context where quotas are under-used in many regions. However, a consensus had been reached in the Agriculture Committee in February.
Parliament's compromise
The compromise endorsed in today's plenary session, in Mrs Jeggle's consultation report adopted by 531 votes in favour 104 against and 22 abstentions, consists of allowing Member States to increase their production quotas by 2% on 1 April if they so wish. However, for the year 2008/2009, levies on surpluses would only have to be paid if there were still a surplus at European level after a process of balancing out between states that had exceeded their quotas and those that had under-used them.
"Our responsibility goes beyond the mere market liberalisation", stressed Mrs Jeggle during the debate.
A broader discussion with a view to a "soft landing" for the quota system - which expires in 2015 - is under way in the debate on the "CAP health check" (see our press release on this topic, also to be published today).
