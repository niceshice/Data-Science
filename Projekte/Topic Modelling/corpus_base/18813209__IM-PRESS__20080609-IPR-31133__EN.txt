Several political groups, backing the compromise negotiated with the Council, withdrew their request that it be put to a block vote in plenary session on 18 June, as envisaged before the meeting on Monday. This request would have entailed referring the matter to the Constitutional Affairs Committee for an interpretation of the Rules of procedure, thus delaying the vote.
On Monday 9 June, the EPP-ED, ALDE and UEN groups, which support the 4 June compromise on the return directive, had asked in the Civil Liberties Committee that Rule 154 be applied at the time of the plenary vote.
Applying this article would have made it possible to vote on the content of the compromise in a single amendment at next week's plenary session. "We must move forward. For three years, we have been negotiating and it is time to assume our responsibilities", declared Jeanine Hennis Plasschaert (ALDE, NL).
However, the PES, GUE/NGL and Greens/EFA groups opposed this request, on the grounds that such a practice could set a precedent and weaken Parliament: "we are in co-decision. By voting on the basis of this rule, we would be moving towards an assent procedure", said Javier Moreno Sanchez (PES, ES).
Civil Liberties Committee Chairman Gérard Deprez (ALDE, BE), pointed out that Rule 201 stipulates that in the event of doubt about the procedure, the Constitutional Affairs Committee must be consulted.
After a suspension of the session, the EPP-ED group withdrew its request, which means that next week's plenary vote will be taken using the normal procedure and not a "block" vote.
