European Parliament's Lux Prize
The European Parliament has just made its first major foray in the glamorous world of showbusiness with the awarding of the very first Lux Prize for cinema. Turkish-German production Auf der anderen Seite (the Edge of heaven) by Fatih Akin was chosen by MEPs from a short list of three.
After an Oscar-style ceremony complete with sealed envelope containing the winner's name, EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering presented the prize to the film's producer Klaus Maeck in the Parliament's debating chamber in Strasbourg.
As well as a standing ovation from the assembled MEPs, the winner gets a trophy and the film will be subtitled in all 23 official European Union languages.

Edge of Heaven takes inaugural European Parliament LUX prize
And the winner is… A film about human relationships between German and Turkish people has won the first European Parliament "LUX" cinema prize. MEPs voted Fatih Akin's "Auf der Anderen Seite" (Edge of Heaven) their favourite film from a shortlist of 3 on Wednesday 24 October. EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering presented the prize in the hemicycle debating chamber. In Strasbourg to collect the prize was the film's producer Klaus Maeck. We caught up with him to get his thoughts on the film and the prize.
Death, love, hope, fear For those who have yet to see it, a brief synopsis of the film follows. Despite the misgivings of his son Nejat, Ali, a widower, decides to move in with Yeter, a prostitute who shares his Turkish origin. Nejat, warms to Yeter when he realises that she sends most of what she earns to her daughter in Turkey to pay for her university education. Yeter’s accidental death drives a wedge between father and son. Nejat goes to Istanbul to search for Ayten, unaware that the 20-year-old political activist, has fled to Germany to escape the Turkish police. In Hamburg Ayten becomes friendly with Lotte, a German student, who invites her to stay, despite the qualms of her mother Susanne. Ayten is arrested and put in detention, and ultimately deported to Turkey, where she is sent to prison. Lotte decides to go to Turkey, where her efforts to secure Ayten’s release run into a brick wall of bureaucracy. She meets Nejat and they become flat-mates. A tragic event prompts Susanne to travel to Istanbul to continue her daughter’s quest. As he grows closer to Susanne, Nejat feels the need to be reconciled with his father, who now lives in Turkey, by the Black Sea. We spoke briefly to producer Klaus Maeck: For those who have not seen the film, could you explain its main message? The main message of the film is death, reconciliation and then forgiveness. It's because the protagonist learns from those who died how to live How can the LUX Prize help European film makers? I have great respect for this prize. In Europe we don't hear much regarding art and culture from Parliaments. It's great that it will be in 23 languages and that it will reach a wider audience - which will enhance integration in Europe. Your film raises issues of nationality and identity: what do you think Europeans can learn this? When we were filming in Turkey, Turkish film makers, artists and actors - they don't think much in terms of borders and the accession of Turkey to the EU. They think more in terms of humans travelling and building relationships. What is your favourite film? It's a film from the 1970's called "Themroc" with Michel Piccoli - who in fact happens to be here in the Parliament today. ("Themroc is a 1973 film which has no dialogue and examines the power of authority, sexuality and the limitations of modern society). So could we assume you are a pro-European? Yes I am indeed. It's a very good idea the subtitling my film in 23 languages - as it allows it to reach more people around Europe. Press release about the release of the Lux prize EP Culture Committee
Leading Director Cédric Klapisch warns of "crisis" for European film
This week saw European "Cultural Diversity Days" at the European Parliament focusing on the European film industry and its contribution to society. The event brought together renowned film directors like Cédric Klapisch ("L'auberge Espagnole") and Radu Mihaileanu ("Go, See, and Become") with MEPs and people from the film business. They had gathered to discuss the role of the industry and the competition it faces from American films. During his visit, Cédric Klapisch spoke to us.
Do you think European cinema is going through a crisis? Yes it is. A lot of European cinematography has disappeared. Films used to be richer some 20-30-50 years ago. We are doing badly simply because many films don't see the light of day anymore. In my childhood we would go to watch Bergman, Fellini, Swedish or Italian films. Today a 15-year-old can't do that. The reasons are twofold: American hegemony and the lack of circulation of European films. It is tragic to see that Eastern Europe, for example, has lost its cinematography because film makers have simply fled to the US where the money is. Why do you support public funding rather than the rule of the market? In fact, I am totally against both extremes: against public funding and against letting the market rule. In France we have a unique system where there are funds to support French cinema and there is a whole series of aid to encourage budding film makers. For example, part of the profits from a successful film will go to support film-making in general. A cinema which hosts successful films will have to give part of its profit to the film industry too. Hence not all financial aid is public but it grants more freedom to the film industry. So you think the French system could be a model for Europe? Indeed. European cinematography is going through a crisis because it does not try to safeguard itself. If we consider recent successful European films like "Amélie", "La vie des Autres" and "Les Choristes" then I think that we must be more confident in European artistic logic and trust - the European way of seeing things. The two faces of cinema - industrial and artistic or niche films can coexist. Some people like Almodóvar manage to combine these two sides. Almodóvar helps me understand Spain, Fellini - Italy, Kusturica – countries of former Yugoslavia and Forman the Czech Republic: they talk about things that cannot be said in another way. You have warned that European film will deteriorate over the next three years. Why? Due to the digital revolution. I am looking at the political side of things because I am concerned for young film makers. Creativity is not being helped in Europe. If one doesn't help people create, creativity will be lost. It is not easy today for a young film maker to launch into the market but I want to do it for them because if no one had helped me I would not be where I am today.
LUX Prize: EP commits itself to Culture
Eighty years ago to the day, the first full-length movie with synchronized sound was released. Today, the "seventh art" is arguably the first, with film central to cultural identity and experience across the planet. In recognition of this, the European Parliament has created the LUX Prize. From 800 European films released between 1 May 2006 and 1 June 2007, three were short-listed for the Prize, awarded 24 October. MEPs chose the winner.
This is the first year of the prize. The winner received a trophy and financial aid to subtitle the film into all 23 EU official languages. The original version of the winning film will be adapted to people with special needs and if the film is already being screened across Europe, money will be made available to put the film on DVD. The short-listed films were:
German-Turkish Auf der anderen Seite (the Edge of heaven) by Fatih Akin Romanian "4 luni, 3 septamini si 2 zile" (4 Months, 3 Weeks, 2 Days) by Cristian Mungiu Franco-Portuguese film honouring Bunuel "Belle toujours" by Manoel de Oliveira
The EU as a cultural project EP Vice-President Gérard Onesta is the driving force behind the prize. He sees Europe as a cultural project, with the European Parliament playing an essential part. "Fifty years ago Monnet is often quoted as saying: 'If we had to do everything again, we would have to start with culture.'" "The EU is mostly associated with technocracy. We want an intimate Europe, one close to the citizen," said Mr Onesta. The US understood this a century ago with Hollywood, but it is more difficult in Europe because of linguistic barriers and national markets. The prize aims to bring Europe closer to the citizens via cinema and to make high quality non-elitist films for the public. To be eligible a film must represent at least one of the following criteria:
universality of Europe's values
Europe's cultural diversity
the debate on the integration of Europe Why Prix Lux? Lux means light in Latin. The trophy represents a positive version of the tower of Babel, like the European Parliament, a symbol of linguistic and cultural diversity, said Mr Onesta. More about the Lux prize Audio, 30:03
Parliament's new film prize to boost European cinema
And the winner is... European cinema! A film about two students dealing with unwanted pregnancy in Communist Romania received the prestigious Palme d'Or award at Cannes. Although many European films are being produced this boost will still be welcome. One barrier European cinema faces in reaching a wide audience is the diversity of European languages and the cost of subtitles and dubbing. A new film award by the European Parliament will from this autumn offer the winner the chance to subtitle their film in the EU's 23 languages.
Directed by Cristian Mungiu "4 months, 3 weeks and 2 days" is the first Romanian film ever to receive the coveted award. It is one of 862 films produced in the EU in 2006 - a substantial increase from the previous year. Figures from across the Union show cinema attendances continue to rise, but the well financed and marketed Hollywood films produced in English continue to dominate. European films gained just 27% of the market share in the cinema last year. As well as problems on the "domestic" European market films often struggle to make any impact at all on US audiences. "Prix LUX" - films we can all understand The Parliament's new film prize "Prix LUX" (Lux is "light" in Latin) will allow the winning film will to be subtitled into the EU's 23 official languages. The man who has championed the idea is French Green MEP Gérard Onesta who believes that subtitling will remove linguistic barriers and allow widespread distribution of films. "It will prove that diversity is not an obstacle but an opportunity" he told us. European success stories One recent success in the US was the German film "The Lives of the others" by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck which received an Oscar for best foreign language film. This film was financed by the EU's cinema programme "MEDIA". The "Queen" directed by Stephen Frears was another example of a European film doing well at the US box office. Gérard Onesta was in Cannes recently for Europe Day on 25 May. He commented that the European film industry was "fragile" given its fragmentation in different languages and states. Cannes - 11 MEDIA funded films nominated At the recent Cannes film festival a total of 11 films nominated were funded by the MEDIA programme. Two of them were honoured in their respective categories: "The Edge of Heaven" by Fatih Akin which won best screenplay and “Persepolis” by Marjane Satrapi which won the Jury Prize. The aim of MEDIA is to support Europe's audiovisual industry. It supports the development and distribution of thousands of films as well as training activities, festivals and promotion projects throughout the continent. In October last year MEPs - as part of the EU's budget for 2007-2013, approved 755 million in funding for MEDIA over that period. On past form, more films supported in this way should receive Cannes nominations. The only question that remains about the Parliament's new film prize is this; can its seat in Strasbourg and offices in Brussels and Luxembourg match the glamour of Cannes?!
