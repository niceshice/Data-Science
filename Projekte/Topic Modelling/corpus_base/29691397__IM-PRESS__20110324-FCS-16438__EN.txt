Lampedusa crisis: how to cope with migrants from North Africa?
A stronger EU response is needed to the wave of migrants fleeing unrest in North Africa to the Italian island of Lampedusa, MEPs will tell the European Commission in a debate on Monday. 15,000 North African migrants are said to have arrived there since the start of the crisis. A resolution on ways to cope with migrants fleeing conflict areas will be put to a vote on Tuesday.

Give EU political parties common legal, fiscal status - Giannakou
Report calls for higher cap on donations European political groups do exist but they are simply umbrella organisations for national parties and don't have any direct contact with the electorate. MEPs on the Constitutional Affairs Committee want that to change. A first step to having EU political groups that represent European interests is a European statute giving them a common legal and fiscal status, says Marietta Giannakou , who is drafting Parliament's report on the rules and funding of European parties.
There are 13 European political parties, 10 of which receive funding from the EP. MEPs are calling for greater flexibility and transparency in funding. They want EU funding to rise to 90% from 85% and want the cap on donations to rise to €25,000 a year from €12,000, but also want penalties for infringements. Ms Giannakou explained more about the report.
How do you propose to move to genuine transnational "Europarties" competing in pan-European elections?
We are asking the Commission to create a specific statute for a European party. The EU has its own legal personality and we have the same goal for EU-level political parties. At the moment they are merely international NGOs, mostly registered in Belgium. This is unacceptable.
We have to distinguish between the creation of a European political party and its eligibility for funding. The statute will define rules on the recognition of EU-wide parties. In order to receive funding they must include at least one MEP.
We might have transnational lists in the future, but the report on electoral reform hasn't been voted on yet and the political groups have different positions on this particular issue.
Wouldn't the growing influence of EU-level parties mean that more decision-making shifts to Brussels, which would have an impact on democracy?
The statute will provide rules on internal party democracy and individual citizens could become members, in addition to national parties.
EU parties would be allowed to take part only in those referenda campaigns directly connected to European issues, for example on a change of treaty.
Isn't there a danger that we could end up with hundreds of EU-level parties?
There might be hundreds of new start-up parties, but in order to get funding they must have at least one MEP and member parties in the national or regional legislative assemblies of at least a quarter of member states (7 countries).
It's not easy to satisfy all these requirements. Currently we have 10 parties getting EP funding; I don't think there will be many more.
How will you ensure money is not wasted and is used transparently?
The funding will continue to be allocated by the EP; all the rules concerning control by the Court of Auditors and the other institutions are in place. I believe there won't be possibilities for corruption if the control authorities do their job well.
The report was discussed in plenary on Tuesday and adopted on Wednesday. EU-level political parties need legal status, says Constitutional Committee (press release) Report on EU political parties Article on hearing on EU political parties Andrew Duff on electoral reform (article)
Reviewing EU policy on its Southern neighbours
Union for the Mediterranean seen as having role ©AFP/BELGA Debated Wednesday, voted Thursday 16 neighbours to South, East included MEPs want more funds for Union for the Mediterranean In the light of the "Arab revolutions" in Tunisia and Egypt, the conflict in Libya and protests in Syria, Yemen and Bahrain the EU's European Neighbourhood Policy, launched in 2004, with the aim of strengthening prosperity, stability and security at EU borders, is taking on new significance. MEPs reviewed the policy Wednesday, looking at what the EU's role should be and how it can help the emerging democracies.
The Neighbourhood policy aims to provide a framework for EU relations with its closest neighbours based on democracy, the rule of law, human rights, good governance, the market economy and sustainable development.
There are two dimensions - Southern and Eastern. "Their nature is totally different," says Mário David, who has drafted a report on the policy. "Our neighbours in the East are European countries that may…become members of our Union. With those countries in the South, my dream is to establish a Mediterranean Economic Space with the new real democracies that will develop."
Errors have been made
The EU supported non-democratic countries in the South "for the sake of stability" and didn't pay enough attention to the enforcement of fundamental rights, "we have been rightly criticised for this," Mr David said. The review should "draw lessons from past and current events (and) correct any shortcomings and incorrect choices", the report says.
MEPs want the EU to play an "active role as a player and not only a payer" in the region. Mr David proposes the EU take concrete action. For example, "In the Mediterranean area, after the successive failures of the Quartet, the EU should take the lead, together with the Arab League, to work for a solution on the main conflicts in the Middle East".
Reconciling immigration policy with human rights
Southern countries are of strategic importance for the EU in terms of immigration, especially from Africa, with Malta and Italy on the front line. MEPs recognise that some neighbours can play an important role but don't want to make the same mistake that was made with Libya, tolerating human rights violations in order to have secure borders.
"Cooperation on the management of migration flows must be fully consistent with EU values and international legal obligations," the report says. But, Mr David notes, "the EU cannot be the destination of thousands and thousands of economic immigrants from other continents".
New context, opportunities for the Union for the Mediterranean?
In 2008, the EU launched a Union for the Mediterranean with all 16 neighbourhood partners to further institutionalise cooperation between the EU and its Southern neighbours and between those countries. The process has stalled. A summit in November postponed action because of difficulties in the Middle-East peace process. MEPs deplore this "negative message" and call for more funds to help the Union play a role in the new geopolitical context of the region.
Mr David is optimistic: "Recent events have proven the importance of the Union for the Mediterranean...I am afraid that some states, on both shores of the Mediterranean, do not yet fully understand the advantages of this model. But they will, and soon".

MEPs want stricter export controls over dual-use goods
MEPs want more transparency Chemicals, technical components, fissile materials and software can all be used for both civil and military purposes and are subject to export controls by member states and the EU, to prevent in particular the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. MEPs want stricter parliamentary control and more transparency. Ahead of a debate on Monday and vote Tuesday, Parliament's draftsman Jörg Leichtfried explained.
What are dual-use items and how does the EU control their export?
Dual-use items are goods that can be used for military or civilian purposes. For example chemicals, technical construction parts, but also software and technology can belong to this category.
The EU is aware that it has to be very careful with the export of these items. Several control mechanisms and obligations for information exist to this end. Despite this, I'm calling for more security. I've tabled several amendments, which include stricter controls and more transparency.
EU countries have sold arms and items that can be used for torture to Libya and allegedly nuclear material to Iran. Should there be a stricter export controls over sensitive materials?
This problem is real, but unfortunately very often it is difficult to predict what the final purpose of the exported items will be...We will try to improve the situation in this sensitive area. Exporters of such items should be obliged under their duty of care to check what the true purpose of these items is.
You want to make the EU's dual-use regime more democratic and transparent - what are the flaws of the current system and what is the EP's role?
I think that the current system favours the industry too much to the detriment of citizen safety.
Since the Lisbon Treaty came into force, the EP has a more important role. We have a bigger say in trade policy and related legislation. In this case for example, we can call for more transparency in the export of these items.

Opening of session: Polish plane crash anniversary, Côte d'Ivoire, Ai Weiwei
Opening of the April plenary session At the start of this week's Strasbourg plenary session, Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek made reference to the anniversaries of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster and to last year's plane crash in Smolensk in which many Polish dignitaries died. He also urged an end to the ongoing violence in Côte d'Ivoire and highlighted the case of Troy Davis, who is on death row in USA. Lastly, he gave an update on the steps Parliament is taking following press reports of corruption by MEPs.
On 26 April it will be 25 years since the Chernobyl disaster, Mr Buzek reminded the House. "We pay tribute to those who lost their lives or who are still struggling with the effects of the disaster", he said. The thoughts of MEPs were also with the people of Japan, he added, following the earthquake, the tsunami and the damage to nuclear power plants.
One year ago 96 people died in the plane crash in Smolensk, including the President of Poland and 18 Polish parliamentarians, said Mr Buzek, who added "I knew half of the passengers on board". It was "not yet clear what happened", he said, but "our thoughts are with those who are still in mourning".
Turning to the case of death row inmate Troy Davis, who is the focus of a campaign in the USA against capital punishment, the President said on behalf of the European Parliament "I appeal to the State of Georgia to commute his death sentence to life imprisonment".
Speaking next of events in Côte d'Ivoire, Mr Buzek insisted that Laurent Gbagbo must hand over power but he called on both sides to shun violence.
The President then spoke about his promise to inform the House of measures being taken in the wake of the corruption allegations against certain MEPs. Following last Thursday's meeting of the EP Conference of Presidents (the President plus Parliament's political group leaders), he could say that Parliament was "taking firm action" regarding a code of conduct for interest groups and lobbyists as well as for MEPs. The EP Bureau (Parliament's highest body responsible for administrative affairs) would meet this evening to decide the next steps.
Lastly, Mr Buzek informed the House that following his resignation as MEP, Ernst Strasser (EPP, AT) had been replaced by Hubert Pirker. Hella Ranner (also EPP, AT) had been replaced by Heinz K. Becker. Trevor Colman (UK), formerly of the EFD group, had moved to the Non-attached Members. EuroparlTV Press conferences and other events European Parliament Audiovisual website
Relaunching the single market
Debate and vote on Wednesday The EU single market guarantees free movement of goods, capital, services and people but many companies and people still fail to take full advantage of its benefits. MEPs discussed three reports Wednesday aimed at making the single market work better and proposing measures from better implementation of the rules and single markets for energy and digital to easier recognition of professional qualifications across borders, a European Skills Passport, more transparent and comparable bank charges and full portability of pension rights.
Strengthening governance of the Internal Market
One problem highlighted by Latvian Christian Democrat Sandra Kalniete 's report on " Governance and Partnership" is the problem of Member State's chequered implementation of single market rules. It proposes measures to improve governance including tougher infringement procedures, the simplification of regulation and better alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. MEPs also want administrative coordination and problem-solving mechanisms to be developed between Member States.
Enterprises and growth
The report on " A Single Market for Enterprises and Growth " by Romanian Liberal Christian Buşoi focuses on the need for an industrial policy, a new regional development policy, a digital single market, a single market for energy and better implementation of the services directive as key areas where work is needed.
The report says EU patent creation, the financing of innovation through EU project bonds, improvement of the participation of smaller companies in the single market and the rationalisation of public tenders should be priorities.
Citizens at the heart of the Single Market
The focus must be on people, according to the report from Portuguese Socialist António Fernando Correia De Campos on a " Single Market for Europeans ". "Efforts to complete the Single Market need to concentrate on the concerns and rights of citizens, consumers, public service users and businesses and bring them tangible benefits in order to regain their full confidence," the report says. It calls for the protection of social welfare and workers rights and includes a range of practical demands on banking, pensions and phone charges.
What's next?
The 3 reports are a first response to the Commission's October communication containing 50 wide-ranging suggestions of ways to boost and develop the single market. There will be a debate and vote Wednesday.
Internal Market Commissioner Michel Barnier is expected to present concrete initiatives in early April. Internal Market Committee page on the Single Market Act Kalniete report Buşoi report Correia De Campos report Commission communication
MEPs criticise measures on economic crisis as insufficient
MEPs criticise EU countries on Libya European Council President Herman Van Rompuy came in for heavy criticism Tuesday morning when he reported back to MEPs on the results of the EU summit of 24-25 March. MEPs said measures agreed to improve Europe's economy were inadequate, while his claim that the EU has a common stance on Libya was dismissed.
Economic crisis
Mr Van Rompuy's proposition that the summit was an important step forward in resolving the economic crisis because leaders had given the final go-ahead for a "significant" package of economic measures to preserve the euro zone's financial stability and strengthen economic governance, got short shrift from Liberal group leader Guy Verhofstadt . "These measures won't resolve the crisis...they are stopgaps. €400 billion has already been invested in the crisis but it still hasn't been resolved."
Socialist group chair Martin Schulz was equally critical, asking why the European Council hadn't come up with the measures a year ago. Both Mr Schulz and Mr Verhofstadt said economic governance was a hostage to national interests and warned that the crisis won't be resolved until the banking sector has been cleaned up.
Daniel Cohn-Bendit , co-chair of the Greens/EFA asked what the economic governance measures really mean for citizens and said the money used so far wasn't well spent. "We spent a lot of money creating what? Inequalities …"
However, Joseph Daul, chair of the EPP , was more positive. "The decisions on economic issues will help our countries to move forward on the right path."
He said that the agreement on the Euro Plus Pact, which is on top of other economic measures and involves the euro zone countries, plus Bulgaria, Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania in increased economic coordination with the aim of improving competitiveness, "is extremely significant as it shows that there is a will among European leaders to draw lessons from the financial and economic crisis."
For the ECR group, Jan Zahradil feared the crisis would be exploited to encourage a move to tax harmonisation and a tax union.
Member states criticised on Libya
Mr Schulz said the lack of consensus between France and Germany on Libya shows "you don't have everything under control," while, Mr Cohn-Bendit criticised the EU for not sticking to its rules on international trade. "What is the value of human rights clauses? Null."
A number of MEPs criticised the behaviour of member states. Lothar Bisky , for the GUE/NGL group said, the EU is in a macabre situation in Libya, where Gaddafi is "a dictator fighting demonstrators with weapons that he bought from us."
Godfrey Bloom , speaking for the EFD group, asked, "when did we realise that Gaddafi is an evil man...it was well-known but he has oil and money, so we turned a blind eye." Council conclusions Watch the video of the debate
MEPs call for help for Italy in Mediterranean refugee crisis
EuroparlTV The Italian island of Lampedusa, Malta and Spain are among the southern European territories taking the brunt of a wave of migration caused by the situation in the Southern Mediterranean. Late Monday, MEPs discussed how to deal with the increased migration inflow, urged more solidarity between member states and called for help for the countries in coping with the influx.
Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said the EU has already set in train a response to the crisis in the Southern Mediterranean and said in the longer-term the aim is to launch a cooperation partnership with North African partners on migration. She called on Parliament and Council to finally agree on European Resettlement programme.
"No country can deal with this pressure on its own," said Italian EFD MEP Fiorello Provera , who drafted the EP's report on the issue. Foreign policy must address problems in the migrants' home countries, he said. "It is of vital importance to co-ordinate our programme with the US to avoid an overlap action and scattering of financial resources". Ms Malmström said, it's crucial to have "tailor-made" approach for each country.
Italian EPP member Mauro Mario and Spanish Socialist Juan Fernando Lopez Aguilar said this is a problem for the whole EU. "When Communism collapsed there was European solidarity in working out a road map to help the Eastern European countries that are now member states....We need a more effective Neighbourhood Policy," Mr Mario said. Mr Lopez Aguilar called for more funding and a more efficient border agency (Frontex). "None of these EU border countries can tackle the problems on their own."
For the Development Committee, Romanian Socialist Corina Crețu said there should be humanitarian support for refugees, but also "realistic promises to the people of Lampedusa who were promised that the refugees would be removed within 48 hours." She called for a broad acceptance of refugees in the EU: "To call only on France and Germany to take these refugees is not the solution."
Portuguese GUE member Rui Tavares called for urgent improvements in Lampedusa where "refugees have been received in the worst possible conditions".
For the EFD, Italian Mara Bizzotto said, "the Italian government has been basically left alone despite expressions of solidarity" and urged the EU to ensure immigrants are accommodated in all EU countries.
Swedish Liberal Cecilia Wikström criticised certain member states for their apathy in dealing with the migration crisis and "helping each other in difficult times."
German Green Franziska Keller on behalf of the Home Affairs Committee said the EU must fight "push-factors" for migration "instead of migrants themselves". She stressed the importance of human rights-centred approach noting that in the past the Commission negotiated an agreement with Colonel Gaddafi to give support and aid to Libya in order to stop migrants. "I think now is the time to change that."
British Green Jean Lambert was especially concerned about the fate of minors, unaccompanied or separated on arrival and urged the Commission to look at their situation and that of other vulnerable refugees.

MEPs debate situation in Syria, Bahrain, Yemen
MEPs call for Association Agreement talks to be suspended ©CIA Shia majority call for more rights ©CIA High unemployment, poor economic outlook ©CIA The revolutions in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya have spread to other, perhaps less well-known, Arab states. MEPs discussed how the EU should react to events in Syria, Bahrain and Yemen with Zsolt Németh, Hungary's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Wednesday. Read on to find out more about these countries.
Syria
"The Syrian Arab Republic" has been ruled by Bashar al-Assad since 2000, after the death of his father Hafez al-Assad who ruled for 3 decades. It is widely considered one of the region's most authoritarian and isolated regimes.
In the context of its re-engagement policy, the EU in 2009 agreed to sign an Association Agreement with Syria. MEPs from across the EP are calling for the suspension of negotiations until the government engages in real democratic reforms.
Syria continues to be heavily criticised for human rights abuses , including the harassment of journalists and human rights defenders.
Population: 22.5 million (2010) - diverse ethnic and religious groups
Main exports: oil, gas
How events have evolved
In February minor demonstrations following the fall of Hosni Mubarak in Egypt were met with a strong police presence and arrests.
In March the protests spread and were strongly suppressed by the regime, with over 100 demonstrators being killed by March 31st.
The government resigned on 29 March but Mr Assad remained as president. He announced committees would be set up to deal with protesters' demands.
Despite increased pressure on the regime, thousands of pro-Assad demonstrators have mobilised on the streets of Damascus and other cities.
Bahrain
The "Kingdom of Bahrain" is made up of an archipelago of 33 islands. It has been ruled by the al-Khalifa dynasty since independence from the UK in 1971.
It is considered a strategic ally by Saudi Arabia and the US (Bahrain is home to the US Navy's Fifth Fleet).
Population: 807,000 (2010)
Main industries: oil (site of the first Middle East oil finds), pearls. It is a major regional banking and financial hub attracting foreign investment. A liberal climate has put it on the tourist map.
How events have evolved
There are tensions between the Shia majority (66%) and Sunni-led government , as the Shia's demand more of a say and better access to housing, healthcare and government jobs
Following the uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia, protests broke out in the capital Manama in February . Violence and police crackdowns led to several people being killed.
Forces from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) entered Bahrain on 14 March to help the government.
Yemen
The "Republic of Yemen" has been governed by Ali Abdallah Saleh since 1978.
It is the poorest country in the Arab Peninsula and belongs to the group of "Least Developed Countries", having very high population growth and unemployment rates .
There have been years of tensions between the north and the south . The Yemeni security forces struggle to contend with the armed challenge posed by al-Qaida and the Houthi rebellion in the North and violent demonstrations in the South.
It has a poor human rights record . Armed conflicts have caused a humanitarian crisis and arbitrary arrests and harassment of journalists have increased.
Population of approximately 24 million (2010)
How events have evolved
In January , following the initial Tunisian revolution, nationwide protests broke out against the regime and poor economic conditions. That then escalated into calls for the President to resign.
Tensions are escalating despite promises for reform. Mr Saleh promised not to extend his presidency or to hand over to his son. Many protesters were killed or wounded on 18 March in a crackdown by security forces. EU-Syria EU-Bahrain EU-Yemen
MEPs adopt estimates for Parliament's 2012 budget
Commission to present draft budget for whole EU 20 April Parliament adopted on Wednesday the estimates for its 2012 budget, a figure of €1.725 billion. This represents an increase of 2.3% over 2011, as compared to the current EU-27 inflation rate of 2.8%. The estimates will now be sent to the European Commission, which will present proposals for the overall EU budget in two weeks' time.
"We said in the guidelines that the increase should be around inflation, now we are far below inflation," said José Manuel Fernandes (EPP, PT), who led Parliament's work on the guidelines. "But also in implementing the budget in 2012 ... we want all the expenses to be justified and we want the variable expenses to be subject to a cost-benefit analysis. Thus, we could also make savings in execution (of the budget)", he added. The resolution drafted by Mr Fernandes was approved by the House today by 479 votes to 176, with 23 abstentions.
Parliament reduced by €13.7 million the proposed figures regarding funding for political parties and foundations, information campaigns, IT, maintenance of buildings and the number of posts.
MEPs expect further savings to be made by cutting expenditure on the hiring of external experts and other services to 2010 levels and as a result of the modernisation and rationalisation of the EP's administration. They also call for cuts in travel expenditure and the use of water, electricity and paper.
Parliament also wants a long-term review of the EP budget, to identify potential savings. Regarding Parliament's security, MEPs put €3 million of the budget in a reserve, to be released only when the administration has presented proposals for improvements and cost plans.
Provisions for 18 new MEPs, a direct result of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, and costs relating to Croatia's EU accession preparations, have been postponed until the final decisions are taken.
The other EU institutions have also submitted budget estimates to the European Commission, which will present its draft 2012 budget for the whole EU on 20 April. The European Parliament and the Council of Ministers will then examine the draft budget, adopt their amendments and finally agree on the budget, probably in November.
Nuclear energy debate: EU plants should undergo stress tests; MEPs reject resolution
Agreement on need for stress tests MEPs reject resolution on nuclear safety Divisions between the groups In the wake of the recent events in Japan, MEPs discussed the lessons to be learnt for nuclear safety in Europe Wednesday afternoon. There was agreement on the need to conduct stress tests at EU plants, but some groups criticised the voluntary and national approach proposed by the Commission. Some members held up anti-nuclear posters at the start of the debate to protest against the use of nuclear energy in the EU. On Thursday MEPs rejected a resolution on nuclear safety because of disagreements between the political groups.
For the Council, Hungarian Secretary of State for EU Affairs Enikő Győri said legislation will be also reviewed in the light of stress tests (comprehensive risk and safety assessments), the results of which should be available before the end of the year. Other alternatives will be considered but "the 14 Member States who have opted for nuclear power cannot shut down their nuclear plants", she said.
Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger said the Commission is "currently drafting a list of criteria (for the stress tests) that will be sent to the EP and made public" by the end of May. The tests will assess if nuclear plants can withstand disasters or attacks. "National regulators will be carrying out tests". It's currently not possible to make such decisions on nuclear power at an EU level, he said.
Dutch EPP member Corien Wortmann-Kool said the situation in Japan "shows us we need to change or revise the regulations in place" and the need to introduce common criteria for nuclear tests for all European plants. She said the EU should set the highest possible standards of safety and if any the plant doesn't pass the tests, they must be decommissioned.
Swedish Socialist Marita Ulvskog said, "It is a global problem that has no borders...We have to overcome differences of view and take decisions together. We obviously need the nuclear energy supplied and can't move on immediately, but we need to find possible alternatives. A new era of sustainability has to start."
Swedish Liberal Lena Ek criticised the tress tests as "too weak". She said they should be mandatory and conducted by "independent experts". German Green Rebecca Harms also had concerns that the stress tests would be "suspicious", because national authorities will be responsible. "It's a club, all of these people have known each other for decades and they have always tolerated the highest risks".
However, British Conservative Giles Chichester said, "there is a world of difference between the 15 year-old reactors in Japan and the modern ones in Europe, and a world of difference in seismic risk...A nuclear moratorium would mean acting without evidence. We need to analyse the situation, not to act in haste".
Sabine Wils a German member of the GUE/NGL group said many people have demonstrated to shut down nuclear plants and in favour of renewables. "We knew the risks even before Fukushima". And Greek EFD member Niki Tzavela warned, "we are entering a new era of mega disasters". She called for companies to be accountable. She spoke about the importance of ensuring companies be accountable. Companies which are not transparent and don't exercise due precautions are committing "crimes against society".
MEPs divided over the future of nuclear energy in Europe
On Thursday, MEPs rejected a resolution on nuclear safety in Europe by 264 votes in favour, 300 against and 61 abstentions.
There were various points of disagreement between political groups, which in the end led to a majority rejecting the final text. Group resolutions on nuclear (see subject: nuclear) Heated nuclear debate at EP after Japan disaster Japan: the EU response (Commission)
Suspend talks with Syria, reassess relations with Bahrain and Yemen
EP: EU must reassess its bilateral relations with Syria, Bahrain and Yemen ©Xinhua/Belga The EU must reassess its bilateral relations with Syria, Bahrain and Yemen in the light of their violent repression of demonstrators, and talks on a future Association Agreement with Syria must be suspended, say MEPs in a resolution passed on Thursday. MEPs are also concerned about the presence of international troops in Bahrain and call for an investigation into the death of 54 protestors in Yemen.
EU negotiations on the still-pending Association Agreement with Syria must be suspended until the Syrian authorities carry out "expected tangible democratic reforms", say MEPs. The resignation of Syria's government on 29 March "will not be enough to satisfy the growing frustrations of the people", they add. President Bashar al-Assad must put an end to repression of political opposition and human right defenders, lift the state of emergency and undertake genuine political, economic and social reforms, says the resolution.
The use of violence by a state against its own people must always have direct consequences, stresses the resolution, drafted by the EPP, S&D, ALDE, Greens/EFA and ECR groups and passed by a show of hands. MEPs therefore call on both the EU and national governments to revise bilateral relations with Bahrain and Yemen, and consider imposing asset freezes or travel bans. The text condemns interference by the authorities of both countries in the provision of medical treatment and denial of access to health facilities for injured protestors.
Bahrain
MEPs state their "concern at the presence of foreign troops under the Gulf Cooperation Council banner in Bahrain". They call on this body "to mediate in the interest of peaceful reforms" and call on all parties to engage in constructive dialogue without preconditions.
Yemen
Parliament wants independent investigations into attacks on protestors in all three countries. In the case of Yemen, the UN or the International Criminal Court should lead an enquiry into the 18 March attacks, in which 54 people were killed and more than 300 injured, it says. Parliament is deeply worried about the extent of poverty and unemployment in Yemen, and believes that the EU and the Gulf Cooperation Council should grant it specific financial and technical support as soon as President Saleh is ready to make way for a democratically-established government.
