Sarkozy to launch French Presidency at 10am on Thursday 10 July
French President Nicolas Sarkozy will launch the French Presidency of the EU at 10am on Thursday 10 July in Strasbourg in a speech to MEPs and the European Commission. The four French presidency priorities are likely to be: immigration, climate change, European defence and agricultural policy. France will hold the presidency of the European Union, on the second semester of 2008 (Jul 1 - Dec 31). France will also have to deal with the consequences of the Irish No vote.
Liberalising the gas market - Industry Committee backs Commission compromise
The Industry, Research and Energy Committee is supporting the liberalisation of the gas market along the lines of a recent Commission compromise proposal, which aimed to address concerns of countries opposed to "full ownership unbundling" (the complete separation of gas suppliers from gas transmission networks) without going as far as the so-called "third option" supported by those countries.
European Strategic Energy Technology Plan needed to achieve 2020 energy climate objectives, say MEPs in the Industry Committee
MEPs in the Industry and Energy Committee say energy efficiency needs to be included in the European Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan in an own initiative report by Jerzy BUZEK (EPP-ED, PL). The report also makes recommendations to the Commission's SET Plan on the inclusion of intensified research into biofuels, and supports the plan to include research in nuclear power and carbon capture and storage (CCS).
Modernising the rules on food additives and labelling of azo-dyes
EU rules for authorising food additives, flavourings and enzymes will be updated and simplified provided Parliament endorses an informal second- reading agreement reached between EP and Council negotiators on a package of four draft regulations. The new procedures will assist the free movement of food within the EU and also give better health and consumer protection, including clearer labelling of certain food colourings. The new "common authorisation procedure" in a report by Åsa WESTLUND (PES, SE) will contribute to the free movement of food within the Community and to the protection of human health and consumer interests. A second report by Åsa WESTLUND (PES, SE) deals with additives such as sweeteners, colourings, preservatives, antioxidants, emulsifiers, gelling agents and packaging gases.
The report by Mojca DRČAR MURKO (ALDE, SI) concerns flavourings and certain food ingredients with flavouring properties. The food industry uses many natural and artificial flavourings, about 2,600 of which are currently registered. As with additives, under the new rules, enzymes will be authorized only if they do not mislead the consumer. The compromise specifies that misleading the consumer relates to the freshness, nature and quality of ingredients and the naturalness and nutritional quality of the product. Avril DOYLE (EPP-ED, IE) drafted the EP report on enzymes.
All-inclusive air fares just around the corner
Air travellers will soon be able to see at a glance exactly what they have to pay for their tickets, assuming Parliament approves new EU rules in Strasbourg next week. Air fares as displayed will have to include all taxes, fees and charges added to the basic ticket price and known at the time of publication.
Safety of small children in plane seats
MEPs and the Commission will discuss ways of improving the safety of children's seating arrangements in aircraft, particularly in the event of a crash.. Children under two years of age are not entitled to a seat of their own and the two commonest methods of protecting them - loop belts and lapholding - are regarded as unsatisfactory.
Europe-wide authorisation of railway rolling stock, but heritage railways exempted
Parliament is set to nod through an agreement reached with the Council on the EU-wide approval of different types of railway rolling stock. Under the new legislation, any rolling stock already approved for use in one Member State will have to be accepted in the other states. This will cut red tape and should boost the development of rail transport in Europe.
European Railway Agency
For the Rail Safety Directive to work, centralised procedures and data will be needed. This is the task of the European Railway Agency. Under the amended regulation on the European Railway Agency, this body is mandated to develop a reference document with information on all the national rules on the placing in service of rolling stock. It will also play a coordinating role in efforts to streamline the number of national safety rules.
Public support, good neighbourhood policy and greater institutional efficiency needed for continued success in EU enlargement
The Foreign Affairs Committee reiterates its “firm commitment to all candidate countries and to those which have been given clear membership prospects,” but also notes that "future enlargements will require more stable democratic support from the EU’s population," in a report it tabled to plenary. It also says that more substantive policies are needed to bridge the gap between the Union’s neighbourhood and enlargement policies.
China after the earthquake and ahead of the Olympics
MEPs, the Commission and Council will debate the situation in China following the earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people in May, and ahead of this summer's Olympic Games in Beijing. There will be a vote on a resolution. Parliament has recently adopted resolutions on both these topics. In the resolution of 22 May on the earthquake, all political groups expressed their sympathy and condolences, and called on the Commission to help alleviate the humanitarian disaster.
EU actions in Afghanistan are a "test case for international development assistance" say MEPs
International reconstruction work in Afghanistan must be much more closely harmonised among all institutions involved, says the Foreign Affairs Committee in a report. It calls for a much larger political role for the EU in Afghanistan and stresses the need to maintain the distinction between military and civilian actions by all actors.
Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails
Luisa MORGANTINI (GUE/NGL, IT) and a number of other MEPs will be asking both the Council and Commission questions on Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. In the last report on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories, the UN Special Rapporteur, John Dugard, states that 'since 1967 over 700,000 Palestinians have been imprisoned. At present, there are some 11,000 prisoners in Israeli jails, a number which includes 376 children, 118 women, 44 members of the Palestinian Legislative Council and some 800 administrative detainees.
ECB praised for reaction to financial turmoil, caution advised on rate rises
The European Central Bank has done “excellent work” in managing the financial turmoil, enhancing its reputation, says the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee in its annual report on the ECB. MEPs also call for the ECB to monitor exchange rates and take action if necessary, and to be cautious about raising interest rates to avoid endangering growth. This report will now be debated by the full Parliament and with the participation of ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet.
Investigate environmental risks of Nord Stream pipeline
The planned Nord Stream pipeline under the Baltic Sea is just one of many infrastructure projects needed to meet the EU's growing demand for natural gas. Its likely environmental impact should be carefully investigated, and possible alternative overland routes should be assessed first, says an own-initiative report proposed by the Petitions Committee. MEPs also want the EU to play a bigger role in supervising the project.
MEPs and Council Presidency reach deal on airline emissions
Following a series of meetings between MEPs and the Slovenian Presidency of the Council, the two sides have agreed details of how to include aviation in the EU Emissions Trading System. The compromise agreement reached still needs to be formally endorsed by the full Council and is now being put to a second reading vote at Parliament's July plenary session in Strasbourg.
The EU answer to the challenge of sovereign wealth funds
Sovereign Wealth Funds, government-owned investment vehicles that invest surplus state funds, are growing rapidly; so also are the political controversy and the potential risks they give rise to, according to a question to the Council and the Commission from the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee.
MEPs' reflections on the Commission's 2009 Preliminary Draft Budget
In response to the Commission's 2009 Preliminary Draft Budget, MEPs in the Budgets Committee call for finances to be available for the EU to respond to new financial needs, for the budget to include a proper reflection of the climate change priority and for the budget to be easier for EU citizens to understand.
Airbus/Boeing WTO disputes - MEPs to quiz European Commission
Helmuth MARKOV (GUE/NGL, DE), on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, will be asking the Commission questions on the Airbus/Boeing WTO disputes.
Reliable space assets needed for an independent European Security and Defence Policy
The European Union needs a common approach to defending its interests in space, says an own-initiative report by Security and Defence Subcommittee Chair Karl von WOGAU (EPP-ED, DE). The report underlines "the need for space assets in order that the political and diplomatic activities of the European Union may be based on independent, reliable and complete information”.
Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the EC and Mauritania
The Fisheries Committee adopted with 19 votes in favour and 2 against a report by Carmen FRAGA ESTÉVEZ (EPP-ED, ES) on the conclusion of the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and Mauritania for the period 1 August 2008 to 31 July 2012. The fishing opportunities are allocated among Spain, Italy, Portugal, Greece and France.
Zimbabwe: MEPs to call for transitional government in resolution?
MEPs will vote on a resolution on the situation in Zimbabwe which says a transitional government of national unity would help end the climate of terror sweeping Zimbabwe since the presidential elections campaign started. This government should also have a mandate to organise fresh presidential elections, says a draft resolution by the EP Development Committee. The resolution also asks to tighten up sanctions against members of the Mugabe regime. The government of national unity, which would include members of the MDC, the party of Morgan Tsvangirai, and members of ZANU-PF, should also help to stabilise the economy, resolve the humanitarian crisis, draft a new constitution and create the right conditions for fresh presidential elections.
MEPs to call for more involvement by Parliament with the approval of the Commission
In a report drafted by Andrew DUFF (ALDE, UK), MEPs in the Constitutional Affairs Committee propose amendments to the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure to make "the entire college of the Commission subject to Parliament's vote of consent".
New rules on written questions
Richard CORBETT (PES, UK) will be putting forward a report on new rules for written questions. If endorsed by plenary, this report will introduce new guidelines for MEPs wanting to table a written question to either the Council or the Commission. According to the proposed changes, written questions will have to fall within EU's competences, be concise and not contain offensive language.
Formation of EP political group threshold to change?
The Constitutional Affairs' committee recommends rejecting a proposal to raise the thresholds for creating a political group. An amendment is proposed to introduce new rules on the possibility for a political group to continue to exist if it falls below the required threshold, under certain conditions. The report will be voted on Wednesday. Richard CORBETT (PES, UK) is again the rapporteur.
Human rights resolutions
The session ends with three debates and votes on resolutions relating to human rights around the world, on this occasion the topics are: the presumed presence of communal graves in the Indian administered part of Kashmir, the situation in Bangladesh and the death penalty, notably the case of Troy Davis (USA).

Sarkozy to launch French Presidency at 10am on Thursday, 10 July
2008-07-03 - 09:55
French President Nicolas Sarkozy will launch the French Presidency of the EU on Thursday 10 July in Strasbourg at 10 am in a speech to MEPs and the European Commission. The four French presidency priorities are likely to be: immigration, climate change, European defence and agricultural policy. France will hold the presidency of the European Union, on the second semester of 2008 (Jul 1 - Dec 31). France will also have to deal with the consequences of the Irish No vote. France holds the six-month rotating presidency of the EU Council from 1 July to 31 December 2008. The next Presidencies of the Council are Czech Republic first semester 2009 and Sweden second semester 2009.
French Priorities for Presidency
Lisbon Treaty
Following the No vote in the referendum in Ireland, President Sarkozy plans to travel to Ireland to hear first-hand the concerns of Irish voters in July and has said: "The first priority is to pinpoint the problem with the Irish voters and to continue to allow other countries to be ratified".
Immigration
France plans to push forward a European pact on immigration to fight against illegal immigration, harmonise asylum policies and promote the integration of legal immigrants at the EU's next summit in October.
Climate Change
France aims to reach an agreement on an EU climate change package that includes a 20% reduction in EU emissions pollutants and increasing the use of renewable energy to 20% of all energy use by 2020, before the end of its presidency in December.
Agriculture
France plans to push forward with the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform programme started by the European Commission in 2003 in the light of its recent CAP “health check”. However, according to Pierre Sellal, France’s Permanent Representative to the EU, its aim is “to adopt the necessary measures - not exactly in line with the Commission perhaps".
Other agriculture-related areas France will be concerned with include the increase in food prices and the need to protect Europe's farmers.
Defence
Previously French President Nicholas Sarkozy said he wants to make EU defence and security policy an example of a "concrete Europe, of a Europe that responds to the needs of its citizens", although he has also said that national armies will remain so that they cannot be integrated into a "supranational army".
Other issues to be covered during the French presidency include setting up a Mediterranean Union, enhancing judicial cooperation, the renewal of the social agenda, measures to help consumers cope with rising fuel prices and creating a single EU market for defence goods.

Energy
Liberalising the gas market - Industry Committee backs Commission compromise
2008-07-03 - 09:55
The Industry, Research and Energy Committee is supporting the liberalisation of the gas market along the lines of a recent Commission compromise proposal, which aimed to address concerns of countries opposed to "full ownership unbundling" (the complete separation of gas suppliers from gas transmission networks) without going as far as the so-called "third option" supported by those countries. An amendment seeking to introduce the "third option" was rejected by 31 votes to 19.
The Commission's original proposal would have given Member States two options: ownership unbundling or the preservation of integrated supply and transmission companies, provided that the operation of the transmission network was handed over to a separate body. Eight Member States had proposed a third option which kept the transmission network with the suppliers but with a structure to ensure it operates independently in practice.
Rejecting this "third option", the committee confirmed its 19 May endorsement of a proposal based on the recent Commission compromise text, involving the creation of "independent transmission operators" (ITOs). This proposal, like the "third option", would allow a company to retain the ownership of pipelines, if management of them is in the hands of a transmission system operator with "effective decision-making rights", but with some further safeguards of these rights.
According to the committee, Member States and companies could chose between complete ownership separation ("full ownership unbundling") or this new plan (the "independent transmission operator" (ITO) model).
Details of the ITO model
The ITO model leaves ownership of pipelines with the with the gas supply companies, but hands the management over to an ITO whose operational independence would be guaranteed by
an 'independent trustee”, meant to protect “the asset value of the transmission system operator”;
a “supervisory body” – composed of gas company representatives, third party shareholders, transmission system operator representatives, as well as the Trustee – responsible for decisions “which may have a significant impact on the value of the assets of the shareholders”;
a “compliance programme” setting out measures that prevent “discriminatory conduct”;
a “compliance officer” responsible for monitoring the implementation of the compliance programme.
No later than five years after the directive's entry into force, the Energy Regulators' Agency would report on whether requirements have managed to ensure the independence of transmission system operators.
The report also confirms the committee’s position in favour of the Commission's proposal to prevent control of transmission systems by third countries unless there is an EU-third country international agreement.
Consumer protection measures
Other changes proposed in amendments bolstered the draft legislation with a number of consumer protection measures. Customers, they decided, should have:
the right to withdraw from contracts with their gas providers without charge;
the right to compensation if service quality levels are not met (as with, for example, inaccurate and delayed billing);
access to information on their rights through bills and gas company web sites;
access to information on procedures to be followed in case of disputes;
the right to be informed, at least quarterly, of actual gas consumption and costs;
access to smart meters within 10 years of the directive's entry into force.
As in the vote on the electricity market, the Committee sought to address the needs of vulnerable energy consumers. It decided, therefore, that EU countries should take "appropriate measures [...] to ensure that the number of people in energy poverty" – those unable to afford heating the home to an acceptable standard, as defined by the WHO – "decreases in real terms." MEPs insist that countries work towards cutting the cost of energy to low income households. In the same vein, they backed an amendment mandating national authorities "to introduce pricing formulas which increase for greater levels of consumption".
This was far from the only amendment to heighten the role for national regulatory authorities. In parallel with the introduction of the new alternative to unbundling, MEPs had already decided to mandate national authorities:
to ensure energy efficiency and integrate renewables (e.g. biogas) in both transmission and distribution grids;
to “facilitate the access to the grid [...] for new market entrants and renewable energies”;
to approve the annual investment plans of the transmission system operators;
to fix or approve network access tariffs;
to impose sanctions - including penalties of up to 10% of yearly turnover - against gas companies non-compliance with their obligations or for discriminatory behaviour.
Regional Cooperation
The Committee’s vote confirmed support for provisions that would see Member States having to ensure that transmission system operators have "one or more integrated systems at regional level covering several Member States for capacity allocation and for checking the security of the network."

European Strategic Energy Technology Plan needed to achieve 2020 energy climate objectives, say MEPs in the Industry Committee
2008-07-03 - 09:55
MEPs in the Industry and Energy Committee say energy efficiency needs to be included in the European Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan in an own initiative report by Jerzy BUZEK (EPP-ED, PL). The report also makes recommendations to the Commission's SET Plan on the inclusion of intensified research into biofuels, and supports the plan to include research in nuclear power and carbon capture and storage (CCS). The aim of the SET Plan is to improve the European innovation system on energy technologies, first by creating the framework conditions and incentives for the development of new energy technologies, and then by fostering the acceleration of the lab-to-market process.
In the report MEPs in the Industry Committee consider the SET Plan as "fundamental to achieving the EU's energy climate objectives for 2020", which include reductions in CO2 emissions, increasing the use of renewable energy and improvements in energy efficiency, if it has adequate financial support.
Nuclear energy, biofuels and energy efficiency
The report supports a list of industrial initiatives the Commission has drawn up, including one on research in nuclear power, and states that research and design resources should support both third and fourth generation nuclear technologies.
The report also supports the European Industrial Initiatives (EIIs) outlined by the Commission, but calls for biofuels research to be intensified under the programme so the overall environmental impact of the production of those fuels can be determined, and for energy efficiency to feature more prominently as "it is the area with the most potential for cost effective emission reductions in the medium term".
Support for research into carbon capture and storage
The report calls on the Commission to facilitate the realisation of up to 12 proposed CCS demonstration projects and believes that the development of CCS technology could play a role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, "provided its efficiency and safety is assured". The report also notes that support for clean coal technologies, such as coal to gas conversion, "will make it easier and cheaper to deploy CCS with the possibility of making it mandatory in the future".
Research and technology transfer
The report emphasises "the need to boost research in basic sciences such as biology, information technology, materials science and macro-technologies", "the need to improve the transfer of technologies from research centres and enterprises" and urges the private sector to invest more in research and assume greater risks.
Financing the SET Plan
MEPs in the committee stress that the SET Plan should not be financed through the reallocation of funds made available for energy under the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) and the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP), and encourage the Commission to urgently ensure adequate financing and support for new low carbon and zero carbon technology research and development, demonstration and commercialisation.

Food safety
Modernising the rules on food additives and labelling of azo dyes
2008-07-03 - 09:55
EU rules for authorising food additives, flavourings and enzymes will be updated and simplified provided Parliament endorses an informal second-reading agreement reached between EP and Council negotiators on a package of four draft regulations. The new procedures will assist the free movement of food within the EU and will also give better health and consumer protection, including clearer labelling of certain food colourings. Food additives are currently regulated by a dozen or so EU laws, which the four new regulations will simplify, update and bring into line with the latest scientific findings. The first regulation lays down an EU-level "common authorisation procedure" for additives, enzymes and flavourings. The other three deal in detail with each of these categories, for which lists of authorised products will be compiled, with conditions of use and rules on labelling. For flavourings, maximum levels for undesirable substances will be set. The European Commission will manage the lists of approved products subject to risk assessments carried out by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).
Single EU-wide approval will guarantee high standard of consumer protection
The new "common authorisation procedure", dealt with by the EP in a report by Åsa WESTLUND (PES, SE) will contribute to the free movement of food within the Community and to the protection of human health and consumer interests.
Community authorisation will be granted in a transparent, centralised manner on the basis of a scientific opinion by EFSA, provided the authorisation criteria set out in the sectoral food laws are met. Authorisation will take the form of a regulation adopted under comitology rules. EFSA will have nine months to give its opinion, not six as the Council wanted. The Commission will have a further nine months to submit a draft regulation to include the new substance in the relevant Community list.
Food additives must be safe and bring benefits to consumers
A second report by Åsa WESTLUND (PES, SE) deals with additives such as sweeteners, colourings, preservatives, antioxidants, emulsifiers, gelling agents and packaging gases.
The legislation states that a food additive may be authorized only if it is safe in use, if there is a technological need for its use, if its use does not mislead the consumer and if it has advantages and benefits to consumers. Food additives will be completely banned in unprocessed food, as will sweeteners and colourings in food for babies and small children, except when specifically included in the Community list. Member States may continue to prohibit the use of certain categories of food additives in traditional foods produced on their territory.
Better labelling of additives containing azo-dyes
As new scientific data on health risks for children exposed to azo-dyes had emerged since Parliament's first reading, MEPs managed to include in the compromise a new provision that foods containing some of those food colours (colourings E 110, E 104, E 122, E 129, E 102 and E 124) must be labelled not only with the relevant E number but also with the words "may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children".
Nanotechnology
In its first reading, the EP had called for separate limit values for nanotechnologies. This was not taken up in the compromise but MEPs demanded successfully that, if the production process of an additive is changed, for example via a change in particle size through nanotechnology, a fresh authorization process, including a safety evaluation, must be carried out.
Flavourings deemed "natural" if 95% natural in origin
The food industry uses many natural and artificial flavourings, about 2,600 of which are currently registered. Flavourings are used in or on foodstuffs to impart odour and/or taste. The EP report on flavourings was drafted by Mojca DRČAR MURKO (ALDE, SI).
The new legislation introduces stricter conditions for the use of the term “natural” when describing flavourings. As demanded by the EP at the first reading, a flavouring shall be deemed "natural" only if 95% of the flavouring element is of natural origin (the Commission had proposed 90%). The compromise adds a recital stating that where possible, attention should be given to the effect of flavourings on vulnerable groups and that flavourings should not mislead the consumer.
Limits on "undesirable substances" - but reprieve for pesto fans
The new legislation sets out clearer rules on maximum levels for "undesirable substances" that might be present in flavourings due to their natural occurrence in plants traditionally used as food or food ingredients. The limits will not apply to certain substances if the only flavouring ingredients added are fresh, dried or frozen herbs and spices (an example is pesto sauce). This exception will cover not only food prepared in restaurants (as proposed by Council) but also, thanks to Parliament, industrially processed food.
Enzymes
Food enzymes have been used for hundreds of years, for example in baking, cheese-making and brewing, where they products perform useful functions such as improving texture, appearance and nutritional value. They play an increasingly important role in food production and can be used as alternatives to chemicals. Currently food enzymes used as processing aids are not covered by EU legislation. Member States’ legislation on food enzymes differs significantly. Under the new legislation, harmonised EU rules would be laid down for the evaluation, approval and control of enzymes used in food.
As with additives, under the new rules enzymes will be authorised only if they do not mislead the consumer. The compromise specifies that misleading the consumer relates to the freshness, nature and quality of ingredients and the naturalness and nutritional quality of the product. Avril DOYLE (EPP-ED, IE) drafted the EP report on enzymes.
How will the system work?
In parallel to the authorisation procedure for new additives, flavourings and enzymes, all such substances already on the market - around 300 additives and 2,600 flavourings - will gradually be re-assessed. Additives/flavourings/enzymes that are currently authorised may stay on the market but once the updating process is complete, any such substance not on the approved list will be banned.

Air travellers will soon be able to see at a glance exactly what they have to pay for their tickets, assuming Parliament approves new EU rules in Strasbourg next week. Air fares as displayed will have to include all taxes, fees and charges added to the basic ticket price and known at the time of publication. The EP Transport Committee, in a second-reading report by Arunas DEGUTIS (ALDE, LT), is recommending that the full Parliament approve a deal on this legislation reached with the Council, as it takes on board the EP's key first-reading amendments.
The price you actually have to pay
Booking via Internet - often the only possibility with low-cost air carriers - is a particular concern. Under the EU regulation, all carriers will in future have to provide the general public with comprehensive information, "including on the Internet," on their air fares. Air fares that are "addressed directly to the travelling public" will have to include all applicable taxes, non-avoidable charges, surcharges and fees known at the time of publication.
The following information, at least, must be specified: air fare or air rate, taxes, airport charges and other charges, surcharges or fees, such as those related to security or fuel. Optional price supplements must be communicated in a clear, transparent and unambiguous way at the start of any booking process and their acceptance by the consumer must be on an "opt-in basis".
According to Mr Degutis: " This regulation promotes price transparency for the passenger and fair prices. The passenger has a right to know the actual price of the ticket, including taxes and extra charges. It is misleading to advertise a ticket at 1 or 2 euros, when the actual cost is actually much higher ."
Security taxes and charges
With security charges on the rise, MEPs successfully argued that the consumer has a right to know how high these costs are, and what they are used for. Where airport or on-board security costs are included in the price of an air ticket, these costs will have to be shown separately on the ticket or otherwise indicated to the passenger. And, whether levied by the Member States or by air carriers or other entities, security taxes and charges must be transparent and be used exclusively to meet airport or onboard aircraft security costs.
A wide-ranging regulation
The new rules on transparency of air fares are part of a regulation which updates existing EU legislation on a range of matters to do with the operation of air transport services in the Community.
Among other things, it aims to establish a level playing field for leasing aircraft and to clarify who has administrative responsibility for revoking or suspending licences.
In addition, stricter controls on the financial situation of airlines should ensure that, if a carrier is on the verge of going bankrupt, passengers' rights can be safeguarded.
Moreover, Member States must now ensure the proper application of Community and national employment legislation to employees of any Community carrier operating air services from an operational base outside the Member State where that carrier has its principal place of business. In the past, the use of bases outside the country of origin has made it difficult to determine which territory's employment laws apply to crews.
The new regulation should enter into force later this year or early next year. Rapporteur Arūnas DEGUTIS ALDE LT A6-0264/2008 Air transport: licensing, right to operate, pricing (repeal. Reg. 2407/92, 2408/92, and 2409/92/EEC). Recast Procedure : Codecision (2nd reading)

Safety of small children in plane seats
2008-07-03 - 09:55
MEPs and the Commission will discuss ways of improving the safety of children's seating arrangements in aircraft, particularly in crashes. Children under two years of age are not entitled to a seat of their own and the two commonest methods of protecting them - loop belts and lapholding - are regarded as unsatisfactory. In an oral question to the Commission, MEPs point out that it has been shown that loop belts (connected to the accompanying adult) can kill or severely hurt children. Yet, under an EU regulation currently being drafted, airlines may end up using loop belts on a larger scale.
Lapholding, which is recommended in Germany and involves protecting the child by simply clasping it in one's arms during a plane accident, is considered by the authors of the oral question not to work.
MEPs wonder whether the answer might be to require airlines to provide child safety seats, as used in cars. Oral question Oral question

Europe-wide authorisation of railway rolling stock, but heritage railways exempted
2008-07-03 - 09:55
Parliament is set to nod through an agreement reached with the Council on the EU-wide approval of different types of railway rolling stock. Under the new legislation, any rolling stock already approved for use in one Member State will have to be accepted in the other states. This will cut red tape and should boost the development of rail transport in Europe. The agreement on which the House will be voting - at second reading under the co-decision procedure - relates to two pieces of legislation. The first updates the existing Railway Safety Directive; the second amends the current European Railway Agency regulation. The EP Transport Committee's reports were drawn up by Paolo COSTA (ALDE, IT).
Cross-border acceptance of rolling stock crucial to free movement
Under current rules, locomotives and other vehicles that can operate in one Member State are not necessarily allowed to operate in another State. Sometimes national safety rules conflict. For example, in Italy fire extinguishers on trains must contain CO2 powder and no foam, while Austria requires fire-extinguishers to be filled with foam and CO2 is not allowed.
Furthermore, rail companies wishing to operate international services have to undergo repeat approval procedures for their rolling stock in each Member State. This often requires the provision of evidence that is not mutually recognised between States and can cause delays and costs. Certification can take up to three years to complete.
The solution proposed by the European Commission - and now on the verge of being endorsed by Parliament and Council - is to introduce the principle of "cross-acceptance through mutual recognition". This means that a railway vehicle that has been approved for use in one Member State must be authorised in the other States.
Safety not to be neglected
Efficiency must not come at the expense of safety, and the Commission proposed from the outset that Member States' authorities be allowed to impose additional national safety requirements in some cases, for example to take account of "local system specifications".
However, MEPs were keen to ensure that safety issues were not used as an excuse to hinder the approval of rolling stock and the creation of new railway undertakings. They therefore proposed a clearer definition of “national safety rules”, which has been taken on board by the Council.
The Commission and Council wanted a voluntary certification system to guarantee that trains are properly maintained but MEPs successfully argued for it to be mandatory, thus creating a level-playing field in the EU. Following pressure from MEPs, this system will apply to all vehicles: for freight wagons two years after the directive enters into force and for all other vehicles no later then ten years after entry into force.
Lastly, heritage, museum and tourist railways are exempted from the directive, as the result of another successful demand by Parliament.
European Railway Agency
For the Rail Safety Directive to work, centralised procedures and data will be needed. This is the task of the European Railway Agency. Under the amended regulation on the European Railway Agency, this body is mandated to develop a reference document with information on all the national rules on the placing in service of rolling stock. It will also play a coordinating role in efforts to streamline the number of national safety rules.
A key point was the introduction of a European Railway Traffic Management System, consisting of the most advanced rail safety technology. This system will be installed on the Trans-European Transport network but, at Parliament's insistence, it will be phased in gradually.

China after the earthquake and ahead of the Olympics
2008-07-03 - 09:55
MEPs, the Commission and Council will debate the situation in China following the earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people in May, and ahead of this summer's Olympic Games in Beijing. There will be a vote on a resolution. Parliament has recently adopted resolutions on both these topics. In the resolution of 22 May on the earthquake, all political groups expressed their sympathy and condolences, and called on the Commission to help alleviate the humanitarian disaster.
In a resolution on China, Tibet and the Olympics adopted on 11 April, Parliament called for a common European stance regarding attendance by EU leaders at the Olympic Games opening ceremony in August.

EU actions in Afghanistan are a "test case for international development assistance" say MEPs
2008-07-03 - 09:55
International reconstruction work in Afghanistan must be much more closely harmonised among all institutions involved, says the Foreign Affairs Committee in a report. It calls for a much larger political role for the EU in Afghanistan and stresses the need to maintain the distinction between military and civilian actions by all actors. The own-initiative report by André BRIE (GUE/NGL, DE) notes that "in Afghanistan, the EU is primarily known as a humanitarian organisation," but considers that "there is also a need for the EU to be seen as having a stronger political influence." To achieve this, the committee argues that "a major strengthening of political will and commitment is necessary," and that "this should be followed up not only by a willingness to provide additional combat troops in the most difficult areas, unrestricted by national caveats, but also by urgent and reinforced civil reconstruction efforts."
Winning the war while building the peace
The committee "supports the efforts of NATO forces to improve security in the country and tackle local and international terrorism, and considers the presence of these forces to be essential in order to ensure the country's future." Nevertheless, MEPs in the committee also say that "Afghanistan's security problems are more complex than just a war on terror and therefore they require more than a military solution."
The report is especially concerned about the effects of military actions on humanitarian aid and development. It notes that "although security and development are interdependent in Afghanistan, there is a clear line between military and humanitarian action that should be maintained." In particular, MEPs in the committee consider "that 'Operation Enduring Freedom' could be perceived as counterproductive if the military pressure on the insurgents is not matched by a strengthened political process through which the Afghan authorities reach out to all segments of the population that recognise the Constitution and lay down their weapons."
Media freedom, civil society, judiciary reform
The report notes that several areas are absolutely crucial for rebuilding Afghanistan. It underlines that "in order to overcome the prevailing 'culture of violence' within Afghan society, the international donor community should lend financial and technical support to local projects aimed at reconciliation." The committee also "emphasises that media freedom is essential in creating a democratic society," and "is very concerned about the rising number of attacks on journalists and calls on the Afghan authorities to seriously investigate these violations."
The report also draws attention to the fact that the mandate of the EU Police Mission (EUPOL) provides opportunities for it to support and train the Afghan Ministry of the Interior, a key priority for establishing the rule of law in Afghanistan. In this context, it strongly criticizes EU Member States for failing to contribute enough personnel to allow EUPOL to be deployed at full strength, and asks the Council to urgently examine this situation.

Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails
2008-07-03 - 09:55
Luisa MORGANTINI (GUE/NGL, IT) and a number of other MEPs will be asking both the Council and Commission questions on Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. The House will vote on a resolution on this topic in September. In the last report on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories, the UN Special Rapporteur, John Dugard, states that "since 1967 over 700,000 Palestinians have been imprisoned. At present, there are some 11,000 prisoners in Israeli jails, a number which includes 376 children, 118 women, 44 members of the Palestinian Legislative Council and some 800 administrative detainees" [1] .
In late January 2008, Israel held 813 Palestinians in administrative detention. These people are held, for renewable periods of up to six months, solely as a result of an administrative decision [2] . Administrative detention is allowed under international law, but only with rigid restrictions on its application, to prevent the danger posed to state security by a particular individual. Israel, however, has never defined the criteria for what constitutes 'state security'. Israel's use of administrative detention therefore violates these restrictions.
Most Palestinian prisoners are held in jails in Israel. This - besides making family visits frequently impossible - violates Article 76 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which requires persons from an occupied territory to be detained in the occupied country, and if convicted, to serve their sentences therein.
'Prisoners are subjected to humiliating and degrading treatment'. The interrogation is carried out in an inhuman manner, sometimes amounting to torture. Food is poor, and there is serious overcrowding [3] . In 2007, two reports published by Israeli NGOs [4] have shown that arrested persons are subjected to physical ill-treatment and deprived of basic needs, such as sleep, for more than 24 hours. The treatment of children is equally disturbing.
The arrest, interrogation and imprisonment of Palestinian children has become systematic in recent years. As at the end of July 2007, there were approximately 385 Palestinian children in Israeli custody. These children are usually prosecuted under the same military system which is used with Palestinian adults [5] . This is of course in violation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), which entered into force in Israel in November 1991. However, Israel denies its applicability to the Palestinian territory.
Is the Council aware of the above-mentioned violation of international law?
Taking also into consideration Article 2 of the EU-Israel Association Agreement, what kind of action does the Council envisage in order to ensure respect for international law, as well as for international conventions, by the State of Israel?

Zimbabwe: MEPs to call for transitional government
2008-07-03 - 09:55
MEPs will debate vote on a resolution on the situation in Zimbabwe which says a transitional government of national unity would help end the climate of terror sweeping through Zimbabwe since the presidential elections campaign started. This government should also have a mandate to organise fresh presidential elections, says a draft resolution by the EP Development Committee. The resolution also asks to tighten up sanctions against members of the Mugabe regime. The government of national unity, which would include members of the MDC, the party of Morgan Tsvangirai, and members of ZANU-PF, should also help to stabilise the economy, resolve the humanitarian crisis, draft a new constitution and create the right conditions for fresh presidential elections.
Lift restrictions on humanitarian aid
MEPs call on Robert Mugabe's government to lift all restrictions on the delivery of aid, in the wake of the orders given to humanitarian aid organisations to suspend their operations.
The EU is urged to channel its aid through local and international NGOs without passing via the Harare authorities. Around two million people in Zimbabwe are under threat of famine, poverty and disease.
Beef up sanctions against Mugabe regime
The Council is called upon to tighten up the sanctions against members of the Mugabe regime and others responsible for grave violations of human rights, if mediation efforts by the Southern African Development Community are not accepted and the state-sponsored violence is not ended, and to press for sanctions to be adopted at UN level, including an arms embargo.
The draft resolution also calls on EU Member States to reject international recognition should Robert Mugabe be sworn in as President for another term. China and Libya are urged to cease their support for the Harare regime.
Frijthof SCHMIDT (Greens/EFA, DE,) stressed that it was time "to stop the double-talk with China and South Africa", while Glenys KINNOCK (PES, UK), argued that "the mediation embarked upon by Thabo MBEKIi , who is proposing a transitional government headed by Mugabe, is not an option that the EU should endorse".
During the committee debate, MEPs highlighted the lack of a firm response to the situation from the Council and Commission. Gay MITCHELL (EPP-ED, IE), suggested inviting the Ambassador of Zimbabwe in order to hand him the resolution in person.
The second round of the presidential elections took take place Friday 27 June with Mugabe as the only candidate. Election observers from both the Southern African Development Community and the Pan African Parliament condemned the election. Debate: 9.07.2008

Enlargement
Public support, good neighbourhood policy and greater institutional efficiency needed for continued success in EU enlargement
2008-07-03 - 09:55
The Foreign Affairs Committee reiterates its “firm commitment to all candidate countries and to those which have been given clear membership prospects,” but also notes that "future enlargements will require more stable democratic support from the EU’s population," in a report it tabled to plenary. It also says that more substantive policies are needed to bridge the gap between the Union’s neighbourhood and enlargement policies. The own-initiative report by Elmar BROK (EPP-ED, DE) notes that “past enlargements have generally been a great success, benefiting the old as well as the new EU Member States.” At the same time, it recalls “that every enlargement must be followed by adequate consolidation and political concentration” within the Union itself, if the EU is to be able to continue functioning effectively.
The committee therefore takes the view that "the success of the enlargement process (and thus the success of the EU political integration process) can only be ensured if there is clear and long-lasting support for the EU membership of each candidate country.” The report therefore urges a more effective communication policy on EU enlargement, and “reminds the governments and parliaments of the Member States that it is their responsibility to adequately inform public opinion about the positive achievements of former enlargements.”
Defining the Union’s “integration capacity”
The report insists that for future enlargements, “the Union must make efforts to strengthen its integration capacity.” The committee “recalls in this context the need to undertake the necessary internal reforms, aimed, amongst other things, at increasing efficiency, social cohesion and strengthening democratic accountability,” although it never mentions the Lisbon Treaty explicitly. Members are also “convinced that any acceding State should resolve its main internal problems, particularly concerning its territorial and constitutional set-up, before it can join the Union.”
MEPs in the committee note that "integration capacity is linked with the Union’s ability at a given point in time to decide and thus to achieve its political objectives,” and define the term "integration capacity" as having four elements: accession states should contribute to and not impair the EU's political objectives; its institutions should be efficient and effective; its financial resources should be adequate, and a communication strategy should be set up to inform public opinion about the implications of enlargement.
Bridging the gap between neighbours and tenants
The report affirms that “participation in the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) does neither in principle nor in practice constitute a substitute for membership or a stage leading necessarily to membership.” Nevertheless, it argues that there is a conceptual and legal gap between the European neighbourhood policy and the Union’s enlargement policy, which need to be bridged. MEPs therefore argue that the EU should “establish an area based on common policies” related to democracy, human rights and the rule of law, and support the recent Polish-Swedish proposal, the re-launch of the Barcelona Process, and further regional cooperation frameworks in the Black Sea region.

Economic and monetary union
ECB praised for reaction to financial turmoil, caution advised on rate rises
2008-07-03 - 09:55
The European Central Bank (ECB) has done “excellent work” in managing the financial turmoil, enhancing its reputation, says the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee in its annual report on the ECB. MEPs also call for the ECB to monitor exchange rates and take action if necessary, and to be cautious about raising interest rates to avoid endangering growth. This report will now be debated by the full Parliament and ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet. In a report drawn up by Olle SCHMIDT(ALDE, SE) in reaction to the ECB’s annual report for 2007, MEPs in the committee highlight the “increased need for cooperation between central banks and supervisory authorities” and ask the ECB also to continue to improve its relationship with other central banks and relevant institutions. The report calls for the setting up of an EU framework for financial supervision closely involving the ECB.
Recognising that the ECB had warned about the under-estimation of risk before the crisis, MEPs ask the Central Bank to examine how to improve “the correlation between such forward-looking warnings and market reactions” and to say what powers it needs to improve macro-prudential supervision in the euro area.
Economic and monetary developments
The committee notes that the Treaty gives the ECB its goal of ensuring price stability, but also that of supporting EU economic policy, and that the two are not substitutable.
The report backs the ECB’s “two-pillar” approach to targeting price stability, which includes analysis of the M3 measure of money supply. It highlights the risks of asymmetric economic developments within the euro area and calls on the ECB to tackle these risks at an early stage. Respect by Member States of the Stability and Growth Pact, is among the strongest measures to protect against these risks.
Caution on interest rates
Given that expectations of economic growth have been revised downward, any further interest rate rises “should be undertaken with caution in order not to endanger economic growth” says the committee, also emphasising the need for investment and structural reforms by Member States to support growth.
A close watch on exchange rates
MEPs in the committee note the recent rise in the value of the euro against the US dollar in particular, and ask the ECB to monitor developments and take action if necessary. They invite the Eurogroup, Commission and ECB to step up their coordination on exchange rate policy.
Communicating with Parliament and the public
The report asks the ECB to provide Parliament and the public with an annual summary of the measures it takes to improve its performance in line with Parliament’s annual resolution. The committee was disappointed with “the low level of commitment” of the ECB’s response to last year’s resolution.
MEPs say that the ECB’s ex-post accountability via the monetary policy dialogue with Parliament is “of primordial importance for confidence, and hence stability, on the financial markets” and Parliament’s responsibility would increase if the ECB becomes a full institution, as proposed in the Lisbon Treaty.
More transparency on decision making?
While recognising the difficulties in making the Governing Council’s minutes public, the committee calls for the ECB to elaborate clearly whether consensus was easily reached within the Council or if divergent views persisted.
Governing Council structure and Executive Board appointments
The committee calls on the ECB to present its ideas for reforming the structure of the Governing Council, which will be ever more necessary as more countries join the euro area.
As for appointments to the Executive Board, MEPs stress that nationality should not be a factor, and that democratic accountability would improve if “the Council evaluated several potential candidates and if the candidate proposed by the Council were then subject to a vote of approval by Parliament.”
Unified international representation
The report also calls for specific steps to be taken towards “a unified euro area representation within international financial institutions such as the IMF.” Rapporteur Olle SCHMIDT ALDE SE A6-0241/2008 Report on the ECB annual report for 2007 Procedure : own-initiative

MEPs and Council Presidency reach deal on airline emissions
2008-07-03 - 09:55
Following a series of meetings between MEPs and the Slovenian Presidency of the Council, the two sides have agreed details of how to include aviation in the EU Emissions Trading System. The compromise agreement reached still needs to be formally endorsed by the full Council and put to a second reading vote at Parliament's July plenary session in Strasbourg. The main elements of the compromise are as follows :
All flights starting and/or landing in Europe (including intercontinental flights) to be included in the ETS from 1 January 2012;
The EU to have an obligation to seek an agreement on global measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation. Bilateral agreements, for example with the US, could be a first step;
85 percent of the emissions certificates to be allocated for free according to a common European benchmark. 15 percent to be auctioned;
The reduction target to be calculated on the basis of airlines' average annual emissions between 2004-2006: in the first period (2012), airline emissions to be cut by 3 percent; in the second, from 2013 onwards, by 5 percent. The percentage to be further modified as part of the general review of the ETS;
Research flights are excluded from the scheme;
Small airline companies producing low emissions are excluded;
The revenues generated from the auctioning of emissions allowances should be used to fund:
- climate change mitigation;
- research on clean aircraft;
- anti-deforestation measures in the developing world;
- low-emission transport.
Commenting on the compromise deal he helped broker over the last few weeks, Peter LIESE (EPP-ED, DE), EP rapporteur on emissions, said: "Of course, a global agreement is our final goal, but the inclusion of third country flights starting and landing in Europe is a major step for the global fight against climate change. Other industries like steel would very much like to be in such a situation."
The Parliament, said Mr Liese, has fought for very strict provisions concerning the revenues from auctioned allowances. "Money should be used to tackle climate change and not disappear somewhere in the general budget. It is not a tax but an environmental instrument. This is why we are very engaged in this field. The agreement is not perfect, but the Council went further than on any other comparable occasion."
Highlighting the importance of funding public transport to reduce emissions, Mr Liese added: "people should be encouraged to use buses and trains - for example by reducing taxes and charges on [such] low emissions transports."
Military flights, humanitarian flights excluded
Military flights performed by military aircraft and customs and police flights, flights related to search and rescue,
fire-fighting flights, humanitarian flights and emergency medical service flights authorised by the appropriate competent authority are excluded from the ETS.
Government and Head of State flights included
Flights performed exclusively for the transport, on official mission, of a reigning Monarch and his immediate family, Heads of State, Heads of Government and Government Ministers, of an EU Member State are included.
The plenary vote on the second reading on inclusion of aviation in the EU ETS will take place on 9 July. A press conference with Mr Liese has been scheduled following the vote.

Petitions
Investigate environmental risks of Nord Stream pipeline
2008-07-03 - 09:55
The planned Nord Stream pipeline under the Baltic Sea is just one of many infrastructure projects needed to meet the EU's growing demand for natural gas. Its likely environmental impact should be carefully investigated, and possible alternative overland routes should be assessed first, says an own-initiative report proposed by the Petitions Committee. MEPs also want the EU to play a bigger role in supervising the project. As one of the infrastructure projects selected under the EU Trans-European Energy Networks (TEN-E) initiative, the Nord Stream submarine pipeline, which would link up Germany and Russia directly, is "a project of European interest that would help to meet the EU’s future energy needs", says the report by Petitions Committee Chair Marcin LIBICKI (UEN, PL)
However, should there be a proven risk of an environmental disaster in the Baltic Sea, MEPs in the committee call on Council, Commission and Member States "to use every legal means at their disposal to prevent the construction of the North European gas pipeline", on the scale proposed.
The own-initiative report responds to two petitions by Polish and Lithuanian environmental associations who fear that the planned pipeline could harm marine eco-systems along the Polish and Lithuanian coastline.
Dumped munitions might pose threat to environment and human health
MEPs warn that this, the world's longest and shallowest dual sub-sea gas pipeline, would be "especially vulnerable to potential damage". They stress that "dozens of months of work in an area of up to 2,400 km², requiring the use of a large number of vessels and other equipment, represents a serious threat to biodiversity and to the number of habitats", and that Nord Stream AG should be obliged to pay compensation for any environmental damage.
Disturbing munitions dumped on the Baltic seabed after World War II could pose a threat to the Baltic marine environment, and to human life and health, says the Committee. Toxic substances such as mustard gas, sulphur yperite, nitrogen yperite, lewisite, Clark I, Clark II and adamsite are all present in about 80,000 tonnes of munitions that are now very heavily corroded and cannot always be located, adds the report.
Independent impact assessment
The committee calls for a "truly independent environmental impact assessment to be commissioned with the approval of all littoral states". An environmental impact assessment commissioned by Nord Stream AG is still under way and will be submitted for approval to Russia, Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Germany, as the “parties of origin” set in the Espoo Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context. The Petitions Committee urges the company to make the research data available to all coastal states.
Analyse alternative routes
MEPs in the committee also underline that the Espoo Convention requires an analysis of alternatives and in this case of overland routes. Given the serious environmental risks, alternative routes which do not disturb the marine environment should be analysed first, as "it is possible to run such routes to the Russian border overland, solely through European Union Member States".
Meet growing natural gas demand
As the EU depends on a limited number of energy sources, suppliers and transport routes, "it is essential to support initiatives aimed at their diversification, both geographically and by developing sustainable alternatives", says the report, which notes that the Nord Stream pipeline will be only one of a large number of infrastructure projects, such as pipelines and liquid natural gas facilities, needed to meet growing demand for natural gas.
In fact, there are already plans to build many energy infrastructure projects in the Baltic Sea, such as wind farms, the Scanled Baltic Pipe, a gas pipeline between Finland and Estonia, power cables between Sweden and Lithuania, and liquified natural gas terminals in Świnoujścje), notes the report.
Gazprom and gas market access
MEPs in the committee also call on the Commission to prevent Gazprom, which is the majority shareholder of Nord Stream AG, from "assuming a dominant role on the EU gas markets without guaranteeing reciprocal rights for EU companies to enter the Russian energy market".
Involve the EU
MEPs in the committee regret "the marginal role played by the EU in this project", commenting that "greater EU involvement would reduce the uncertainty felt by many Member States about the Nord Stream project". They are against the "project being implemented on the proposed scale without the consent of all the littoral states first being obtained".
Finally, to address the environmental and geopolitical security aspects of such projects, the Commission should create "an appropriate post" under the authority of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Commission Vice-President, says the report.

MEPs to quiz Commission on the Creation of a Roma fingerprints database in Italy
2008-07-03 - 09:55
Monica Frassoni (IT), on behalf of the Greens/EFA Group will be asking the following questions to the Commission on the Creation of a Roma fingerprints database in Italy. The House will also vote on a resolution on this topic. The Italian Minister of Interior stated on 25 June, during a hearing in the Constitutional Committee of the Italian Parliament, that the police is collecting fingerprints of Roma in the framework of a series of checks that are being made in Roma camps in larger cities, and that minors are also undergoing fingerprinting procedures. It appears that such data are being stored in a newly created special database held by Italian law enforcement authorities placed under the control of Prefects, who have been appointed as ‘extraordinary commissioners for the Roma emergency’ and granted extraordinary powers. The database purposes, aims, access and other data protection guarantees have not been clarified. The Minister stated during the hearing that ‘it is not ethnic filing, but a census... that foresees that fingerprints of all the residents (in the camps), minors included, are taken, to avoid phenomena such as begging: the final objective is that of allowing those who stay to live in acceptable conditions, those of a civilised society’.
Is the Commission aware of the creation of a Roma database in Italy?
Doesn't the Commission think that such database is based on race and ethnic origin, as fingerprints are gathered only for Roma, while Italian citizens are not required to undergo a similar procedure?
Doesn't the Commission think that this constitutes clear discrimination based on race, ethnic origin and nationality?
Doesn't the Commission think that the collection of fingerprints of Roma and the creation of a Roma database do not respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, the principles of equality and non-discrimination, privacy rights and data protection rules, as recognised by the European Convention on Human Rights and the related case-law, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, EU treaties and notably Article 6 TEU and the political mandates of Article 12 TEC (prohibition of discrimination based on nationality) and of Article 13 TEC (prohibition of discrimination based on race and ethnic origin), as well as the anti-discrimination directive on race and ethnicity (2000/43/EC)(1) and the directive on free movement (2004/38/EC)(2)?
Will the Commission raise its concern with the Italian authorities, and what will the Commission do to ensure that the current situation of Roma in Italy is dealt with according to European standards on human rights and fundamental freedoms? Debate: 7.7.2008
Vote: 8.7.2008 ORAL QUESTION WITH DEBATE pursuant to Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure by Monica Frassoni, on behalf of the Greens/EFA Group to the Commission

Economic and monetary affairs
The EU answer to the challenge of sovereign wealth funds
2008-07-03 - 09:55
Sovereign wealth funds, government-owned investment vehicles that invest surplus state funds, are growing rapidly; so also are the political controversy and the potential risks they give rise to, according to a question to the Council and the Commission from the Economics Committee. MEPs will hear the Commission’s and Council Presidency’s responses to the following question, tabled on behalf of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee by its Chair, Pervenche BERÈS (PSE, FR), before voting on a resolution on the issue:
“The sub-prime crisis and its consequences had the unexpected effect of shedding light on sovereign wealth funds (SWFs). It created new opportunities for SWFs, some of which have come to rescue some major banks.
An EU response needed?
At the European level, do you think that the various current national initiatives create a need for EU coordination, which could bring together regulation elaborated by Member States in order to safeguard a true level playing field, while ensuring a potential for effective and timely answers, should sensitive sectors be affected? In that regard is the Commission (and does the Council think the Commission should be) conducting a review to check Member States' initiatives and their compliance with EU law? Would it be appropriate to evaluate objectively the range of tools we have at our disposal (i.e. transparency requirements, voting rights of SWFs, golden shares, shareholders' rights) and to have an EU approach to sensitive sectors that would overcome national borders? What do you think of a registration system for these funds?
Policy options for dealing with sovereign wealth funds
To what extent do you consider Article 58 of the EC Treaty, which provides for restrictions on capital and payment movements on grounds of public policy/public order, to be in need of clarification in order to guarantee full compatibility with EU interests and perfect functioning of the internal market?
At the global level, what do you think the EU should do? Should it be leading the way for a global approach to SWFs, promoting best practices and finally tackling the reciprocity of market openness?
What do you think of defining and promoting a strong EU position ex ante, especially in global negotiations?
What do you think about running a fundamental reflection on the functioning of global markets and then making proposals to the appropriate international fora?
Do you think that action is needed regarding the oil monarchies, which are worsening the euro-dollar exchange rate disequilibrium, as oil is sold in dollars which are reinvested via SWFs in euro assets?” Pervenche BERÈS PES FR The EU answer to the challenge of sovereign wealth funds - Oral questions to Council and Commission

MEPs' reflections on the Commission's 2009 Preliminary Draft Budget
2008-07-03 - 09:55
In response to the Commission's 2009 Preliminary Draft Budget, MEPs in the Budgets Committee call for finances to be available for the EU to respond to new financial needs, for the budget to include a proper reflection of the climate change priority and for the budget to be easier for EU citizens to understand. The report drafted by Jutta HAUG (PSE, DE) will be the first assessment by the European Parliament of the Commission's Preliminary Draft Budget (PDB) for 2009 and will give a provisional mandate to Parliament's negotiations with the Council in the July conciliation.
Payment appropriations and flexibility
In the report MEPs in the Budgets Committee point out that at EUR 116 796 million, the level of payment appropriations is "extremely low" compared to the commitment appropriations adopted in the 2007 and 2008 budgets (totalling EUR 126 500 million and EUR 129 100 million respectively).
The report notes that the 2007-2013 financial perspective doesn't allot the EU to respond to new political needs flexibly and "the Union's capacity to react to policy changes in budgetary terms is extremely limited".
MEPs in the Committee also note that they cannot always see a clear correlation between the Commission's political priorities and the PDB, and are "still not satisfied with the attempts of the Commission to include Parliament's priorities in the PDB".
Clarity, consistency and transparency
The report stresses "the importance of clarity, consistency and transparency in the presentation of the EU budget, which is an absolute necessity also with regard to the need to communicate to European citizens how EU money is spent".
Changes with the PDB headings
With heading 1a , the report deplores the limited margin available and recommends additional funding if "new priorities are to be set".
With heading 1b , the report "deplores the sharp decrease in payments which, when compared to 2008, fall by 13.9%" and MEPs in the Committee state the EU must be able to deal with "current and future challenges to the solidarity principle".
With heading 2 , the report welcomes the increase of expenditure for LIFE + (the new Financial Instrument for the Environment), but "considers that the horizontal budgetary priority of combating climate change is not properly reflected in these figures".
With heading 3a , MEPs in the committee say they are concerned about the poor funding for "fundamental rights and justice" activities, which has decreased by 10% in payments compared to the 2008 budget.
With heading 3b , MEPs in the committee consider that the funding of "vital policies with a direct impact on the every day life of citizens" is not sufficient and that the possibility to finance pilot projects and preparatory actions (which is important for the European Parliament) is very limited.
With heading 4 , MEPs in the committee call for clarification as to its total needs, including the Common Foreign and Security Policy, and considers that the Commission's budgetary approach is "vague" and "rather arbitrary". The report is concerned by the under-financing of this heading, particularly with regards to Kosovo, Palestine, the Middle East, food aid and macro-financial assistance. The report also "repeats its conviction that neither Flexibility Instrument nor Emergency Aid Reserve must be diverted or misused to finance long-planned policies and activities of the EU".
The first reading resolution of the 2009 PDB will be voted on in October 2008. Rapporteur Jutta HAUG PES DE A6-0262/2008 2009 budget: First reflections on the 2009 PDB mandate for the conciliation Procedure : budgetary

Security and defence
Reliable space assets needed for an independent European Security and Defence Policy
2008-07-03 - 09:55
The European Union needs a common approach to defending its interests in space, says an own-initiative report by Security and Defence Subcommittee Chair Karl von Wogau (EPP-ED, DE). The report underlines "the need for space assets in order that the political and diplomatic activities of the European Union may be based on independent, reliable and complete information”. With an eye to debate over the civilian or military nature of the Galileo satellite navigation project, the report underlines "the necessity of Galileo for autonomous European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) operations, for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and for Europe’s own security". The committee also urges EU Member States to ensure the interoperability of their various observation and reconnaissance systems, and "recommends the urgent conclusion of agreements between the EU Satellite Centre and EU Member States to provide imagery to ESDP operation and force commanders".
Weaponisation and security of space
The committee “is concerned by the possible future weaponisation of space”, and "expresses particular concern about the use of destructive force against satellites", such as the January 2007 test of the Chinese anti-satellite system. The report urges "that under no circumstances should European space policy contribute to the overall militarisation and weaponisation of space". The committee also calls on EU institutions to "promote a conference to review the Outer Space Treaty, with the aim of strengthening it and expanding its scope to prohibit all weapons in space", and calls on "all international actors to refrain from using offensive equipment in space".
On security, the report "deplores the fact that EU Member States do not have access to instant data on ballistic missile launches around the world", and supports projects for early-warning systems to be established. It also "underscores the vulnerability of strategic space assets", and therefore "stresses the need for them to be adequately protected by ground-based theatre missile defence, planes and space surveillance systems".
A space assets budget?
The report also advocates setting up "an operational budget for space assets", and strongly favours putting space operations under the Community budget. "As experience has shown, large-scale common projects cannot be properly managed when 27 different national budget authorities applying the principle of 'fair return' are involved", the committee says, and it "therefore strongly recommends that these projects and programmes be financed from the EU budget". It also “recommends that European non-commercial satellites be carried into orbit by European launchers, preferably from the territory of the European Union”.

Parliament's Rules of Procedure
MEPs to call for more involvement by Parliament with the approval of the Commission
2008-07-03 - 09:55
In a report drafted by Andrew DUFF (ALDE, UK), MEPs in the Constitutional Affairs Committee propose amendments to the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure to make "the entire college of the Commission subject to Parliament's vote of consent". The changes proposed in the report include inviting each Commissioner-designate to appear before the appropriate committee (or committees) for recorded public hearings "in the event of a substantial portfolio change during the Commissioner's term in office, the filling of a vacancy, or the appointment of a new Commissioner following the accession of a new Member State".
The report proposes that "Parliament shall evaluate Commissioners-designate on the basis of their general competence, European commitment and personal independence" and that "Parliament shall have particular regard to gender balance".
A vote by secret ballot is proposed in the report at the committee stage of the approval process when the committee cannot otherwise reach an agreement and when the plenary decides on the appointment of a single Commissioner.
The European Parliament's self-amending Rules of Procedure form its internal organisational and operational rules, and these amendments will be debated and voted on by MEPs on Monday 7 July.

Parliament's Rules of Procedure
Formation of EP political group threshold to change?
2008-07-03 - 09:55
The Constitutional Affairs' committee recommends rejecting a proposal to raise the thresholds for creating a political group. An amendment is proposed to introduce new rules on the possibility for a political group to continue to exist if it falls below the required threshold, under certain conditions. The report will be voted on Wednesday. At present, a group can be formed by a minimum of 20 Members (or 2.5% of EP's membership), who also represent at least one fifth of the Member States (i.e. at least 6 countries). Richard Corbett (PES, UK), rapporteur, proposed an amendment to Parliament's rules of procedure to raise the threshold to 30 MEPs (4% of total membership), representing at least one quarter of the Member States (i.e. 7). But this amendment was rejected by a majority of one in the committee vote, with 15 against and 14 in favour. An amendment is proposed to introduce new rules on the possibility for a political group to continue to exist if it falls below the required threshold, under certain conditions. MEPs in committee adopted the report as a whole as amended (i.e. with no change to the thresholds), by 15 votes in favour to 14 against. Any changes adopted would come into effect after the 2009 European elections. An absolute majority of MEPs is required to approve amendments to the EP's Rules of Procedure. A lively debate In a lively debate on the report in the Constitutional Affairs Committee, rapporteur Mr Corbett explained that his proposal aimed at avoiding excessive fragmentation of the EP and pointed out that "all national Parliaments have thresholds". He added: "Let's look at all financial and human resources provided to groups: is it right for us to have such a low threshold?". Íñigo Méndez de Vigo (EPP-ED, ES) agreed, on behalf of his group, that the reform was needed. He said: "We can guarantee pluralism and at the same time have political decisions which are consistent". Other members, speaking on behalf of respective their groups, disagreed with the proposal. Andrew Duff (ALDE, UK), said that small groups are important, adding that approving the proposed change of threshold, "would mean to force MEPs inside one or the other big group" without "contributing to efficiency and effectiveness of the Parliament ". Sylvia-Yvonne Kaufmann (GUE/NGL, DE) said: "All 5 smaller groups are strongly opposed to this reform". "There's no reason to change the rules", she concluded. Johannes Voggenhuber (Greens, AT) also criticised the proposal to increase threshold to form a group: "This report represents a further limitation to smaller groups". He added: "Agreement on changing rules should always be broad". Finally, Hanne Dahl (IND/DEM DK): asked: "Is it right to limit pluralist debates?" She concluded: "Every call for efficiency is a risk for democracy". Rapporteur Richard CORBETT PSE UK A6-0206/2008 EP Rules of Procedure, Rule 29: formation of political groups Debate: 7.7.2008

Fisheries
Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the EC and Mauritania
2008-07-03 - 09:55
The Fisheries Committee adopted with 19 votes in favour and 2 against a report by Carmen FRAGA ESTÉVEZ (EPP-ED, ES) on the conclusion of the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and Mauritania for the period 1 August 2008 to 31 July 2012. The fishing opportunities are allocated among Spain, Italy, Portugal, Greece and France. The new Protocol provides for a reduction in fishing opportunities compared with the Protocol in force from 1 August 2006 to 31 July 2008. Fishing opportunities have been decreased by 25% for the cephalopods category, by 10-50% for the demersal categories and by 43% for the small pelagics category, thus reducing the overall tonnage from 440,000 tonnes per year at present to 250,000 tonnes per year.
The financial contribution has been set at EUR 86 million for the first year, the same as under the previous Protocol, EUR 76 million in the second year, EUR 73 million in the third year and EUR 70 million in the last year.
Carmen FRAGA ESTÉVEZ welcomes the fact that "we will still have a fisheries Protocol with Mauritania" but questions the work done during the negotiations, when "neither the industry nor the Member States were sufficiently consulted, resulting in a Protocol under which fishing opportunities have fallen considerably while financial compensation is held at virtually the same level". The rapporteur hopes that the four years in which the new Protocol will be in force will offer a better framework for dialogue that will make it possible to resolve these irregularities so that future protocols will not suffer from the same shortcomings.
