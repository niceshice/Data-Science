Better lawmaking and subsidiarity
2006-04-06 - 10:31
Bert DOORN (EPP-ED, NL), for the Legal Affairs Committee, will be putting forward an own-initiative report on Better lawmaking 2004: application of the principle of subsidiarity.
The committee stresses the need for any Community legislation adopted to comply fully with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. The report supports the ambition of improving European legislation, with a view to enhancing growth and jobs, and stresses the need for an integrated and consistent approach to initiatives on " better regulation ", supporting the three Lisbon pillars in case the market fails. The committee stresses that initiatives on " better regulation " must be implemented in a transparent and democratic way. MEPs in the committee promote legislation based on principles and focused on quality rather than quantity. The committee sees the " better regulation " debate as an occasion for reflection on legislation as a process designed to achieve clearly defined policy goals by committing and involving all stakeholders during all phases of the process from preparation to enforcement.
The committee suggests that when a draft proposal is presented by the Commission at the request of one or more Member States, this should be mentioned. The committee calls on the Member States to exchange experience in the use of impact assessment, and also to apply such assessments to national legislation.
Among other recommendations, MEPs in the committee stress the need for Parliament and, in particular, the rapporteur responsible, to play a more active role in monitoring the implementation of European legislation in the Member States, and to make use of the network between the European Parliament and the national and/or regional parliaments.

Implementation, consequences and impact of internal market legislation in force
2006-04-06 - 10:31
Arlene McCARTHY (PES, UK), for the Internal Market Committee, will be putting forward an own-initiative report on the implementation, consequences and impact of the internal market legislation in force. The committee stresses the need for a common approach to better regulation, based on a core set of regulatory principles, namely subsidiarity, proportionality, accountability, consistency, transparency and targeting. MEPs in the committee stress that this approach cannot bypass the rights of social consultation and must respect the principles of participative democracy. The report also stresses the need for Parliament, Council and the Commission to establish 'better regulation' task forces, to set up an inter-institutional working group to develop training, skills and quality control and to share and benchmark better regulation best practice.
The committee urges the Commission to produce a short, clear guide to the better regulation process, outlining the key appraisal steps that should take place in the evolution, development and implementation of EU legislation. The committee suggests that the guide should also summarise the better regulation principles to be followed by all parties in the legislative process. MEPs in the committee insist that all Commission proposals be accompanied by a ‘Better Regulation Check List’ summarising the steps through which the proposal should proceed, and that this check list should be updated as each stage is completed, with cross-references to any relevant studies or impact assessments.
The committee calls on the Commission to set up an independent audit body to structure and guarantee the quality and independence of economic impact assessments of EU legislation. The committee also insists that all legislative proposals forwarded to Parliament include an executive summary of the impact assessment. MEPs in the committee stress that Member States must ensure that they are not causing new implementation problems by imposing additional requirements at national level when transposing Community legislation (‘gold-plating’), and confirm this by means of a formal declaration to the Commission.
Among other recommendations, the committee insists that, in the Annual Work Programme, the Commission provide a list of those proposals which may be the subject of alternative regulation.

Better lawmaking - enforcing Member States' obligations, simplifying EU laws
2006-04-06 - 10:31
As part of the debate on the ‘Better Lawmaking’ initiative, Parliament will be considering two reports on how EU laws are applied.
The first, drawn up by Monica Frassoni (Greens/EFA, IT´) for the Legal Affairs Committee, sets out a range of measures the Commission should take to improve Member States’ implementation of their obligations, while the second, by Giuseppe Gargani (EPP-ED, IT), for the same committee, strongly backs the Commission’s proposals on regulatory simplification, whether by repealing irrelevant or obsolete texts, codifying texts which have become over complex thanks to repeated amendment, or recasting measures which need revising and updating.

Parliament pressures Council of Ministers to meet in public
2006-04-06 - 10:31
MEPs are to debate a report from the Petitions Committee which calls for the Council to meet in public when it is acting as a legislator. The report, by David Hammerstein Mintz (Greens/EFA, ES), backs a call from the European Ombudsman for the Council to review its refusal to do so.
MEPs in the committee consider it unacceptable that the EU’s most important law-making body still meets behind closed doors when acting as legislator. The say the Council should respond to calls for greater transparency coming from parliaments, civil society and the general public.
Arguing that it is of the utmost importance for national parliaments to be able to hold their governments and ministers to account, and that meeting in public would make the Council’s work both more transparent and more relevant to European citizens, they call on the Council to take all measures needed to make the meetings in which it is acting in its legislative capacity open and accessible to the public.
They request that the Council also broadcast, including on the internet, its public meetings and provide in good time dates and agendas of those meetings as well as issuing official transcripts in all EU official languages.
Note: this week’s plenary agenda includes another report from the Petitions Committee, by Proinsias DE ROSSA (PES, IE), regarding complaints against the European Schools in Brussels.

Improving transparency of the EU institutions
2006-04-06 - 10:31
The Civil Liberties Committee is proposing legislative changes to ensure that debates in Council and all preparatory documents on legislative procedures are available to the public and easily accessible. This will be debated by the full Parliament in Strasbourg plenary on Monday, 3 April.
Transparency and democratic scrutiny of the institutions are crucial to ensuring public trust in the Union itself. Responding to this concern, the Civil Liberties Committee, in a non-binding report by Michael CASHMAN (PES, UK), unanimously adopted a package of recommendations calling on the Commission to revise existing rules and to table new legislation by the end of this year on " the right of access " to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents.
Firstly, the amended regulation should require access to be granted to all preparatory documents linked to a legislative procedure – including the opinions of legal services – and also to the records of the Council debates where these institutions are " acting in their role as legislators " and to the identity of the author of each initiative. Secondly, existing legislation should be modified as to define more clearly on what basis specific documents may be classified as confidential, " in order to protect the essential interests of the EU ". MEPs in the committee want to prevent documents being classified as confidential " as a matter of routine, simply because they refer to an issue which is or might be relevant from a security point of view ".
Finally, the European Union should limit the right of Member States to restrict access to their contributions and amendments in co-decision and other legislative procedures, says the report.
The existing EU legislation on public access to the institutions' texts was the fruit of lengthy negotiations between Parliament and Council before its adoption at second reading in 2001. MEPs now feel that the final formulation has proven too vague as far as access to EU documents and Council activities is concerned.

MEPs set to call for the scrapping of transitional measures restricting access to the EU 15 labour markets
2006-04-06 - 10:31
Members of the Employment Committee call for the scrapping of the transitional measures in force, restricting the access of workers from eight new Member States to the labour markets of several old Member States. Member States have to decide before 1 May 2006 whether to lift these transitional arrangements based on the Accession Treaty or to keep them until May 2009.
In an own-initiative report by Csaba Öry (EPP-ED, HU), MEPs in the committee stress that the free movement of workers is one of the four fundamental freedoms provided for in the EC Treaty as well as an expression of solidarity between the old and new Member States. They note that there are no signs of strain on the labour markets of the Member States which have opted to open up their labour markets. Furthermore, the fears of massive migration have proved groundless and migration from the new Member States is having beneficial effects on the economies of the Member States which have opened up their labour markets. The committee notes the denial of opportunities for new Member State workers to work legally in most of the EU-15 has fuelled more illegal work, the promotion of the black economy and worker exploitation.
MEPs in the committee criticise the fact that, in some cases, long-term residents from third countries are in a more favourable position as regards their rights of residence and of access to EU 15 labour markets than citizens of the Member States, which joined the EU in May 2004. They say that workers from the new Member States should not be discriminated against compared to workers from third countries. Member States should also abolish any national rules which contradict the so called 'status quo clause' stating that nationals of Member States which joined the EU in May 2004 must not be subjected to greater restrictions than those imposed on the date of signing of the Accession Treaty. Generally speaking, it must be ensured that labour law is strictly enforced so as to guarantee that all workers in the EU are treated equally.
Background :
According to the Accession Treaty, Member States have until 30 April 2006 to decide whether to lift national restrictions on workers' free movement in the EU. These were introduced in May 2004 by all old (EU 15) Member States (except Ireland, Sweden and the UK which opened up their labour markets without restrictions to nationals of the new Member States) on workers from the eight new EU Central and Eastern European countries. The arrangements can continue for up to seven years, broken down into three periods (2+3+2 years).

Environment
Agreement reached on fluorinated greenhouse gases
2006-04-06 - 10:31
Avril DOYLE (EPP-ED, IE) will be recommending that Parliament approve two conciliation agreements on air pollution: emissions and fluorinated greenhouse gases from motor vehicle air-conditioning systems and on climate change: fluorinated greenhouse gases, hydrofluorocarbons HFCs, perfluorocarbons PFCs, sulphur hexafluoride.
An agreement was reached on 31 January at the first conciliation meeting between Parliament and Council on fluorinated greenhouse gases, which was also the first conciliation of the Austrian presidency. Several rounds of informal talks had paved the way for this deal. The main outstanding point was the highly sensitive issue of national exemptions for countries which already have, or wish to introduce, stricter measures as part of efforts to fight greenhouse gases.
The negotiations between the two institutions concerned two pieces of legislation: a regulation on fluorinated gases covered by the Kyoto protocol and a less controversial directive on emissions from air conditioning systems in motor vehicles.
Limited exemptions, subject to revision
Parliament had argued that Member States should be allowed to preserve existing stricter measures - e.g. countries such as Denmark and Austria - or to adopt them if they wish - Sweden is apparently planning to do so - to enable them meet their commitments under the Kyoto protocol, in line with the provisions on environment policy laid down in Articles 175 and 176 of the EC Treaty.
The Council, however, wanted a cut-off date for these exemptions - 31 December 2012 - so as not to disrupt the internal market, in line with Article 95 (approximation of legislation). MEPs accepted this date but only on condition that there will be a clause allowing for revision in the light of any measures taken by the Union and its Member States pursuant to existing or future international commitments.
This had been the sticking point since the beginning. Now it has been resolved. " With this agreement we have reached a good balance between environmental protection and the proper functioning of the single market ", said rapporteur Mrs Doyle " There is no reduction in the standards we wanted. Our agreement allows some Member States to maintain stricter measures, and others to introduce such measures but under precise circumstances ."
Information and labelling
Under the new legislation, appliances containing fluorinated gases can be placed on the market only if they bear a label indicating clearly and indelibly the chemical names of these gases and the quantity contained, and stating that they are covered by the Kyoto Protocol. The instruction manuals accompanying the appliances must also indicate the potential impact of the gases on climate temperature. These gases can, depending on their chemical make-up, remain in the atmosphere for many years - even centuries or millennia in some cases. The exact format of the label has yet to be decided and the Commission will decide later whether additional environmental information should be added.
Compromises were also reached on various matters relating to fixed equipment for air conditioning, refrigeration and fireproofing, on technical standards to be observed and the inspections to be carried out (standards which will also apply to imported appliances), on the training of maintenance staff, on the identification and inventories of equipment, and on the promotion of alternative technologies both for the equipment covered by the new regulation and for the mobile air conditioning appliances covered by the directive which was also part of the conciliation deal.
"Pioneering work"
The representatives of the three institutions all welcomed the agreement. The invaluable preparatory work of rapporteur Avril Doyle was hailed unanimously and the importance for the three institutions of reaching an agreement was underlined. Antonios Trakatellis (EPP-ED, EL), head of the EP delegation, stated "This new regulation will help us meet our commitments under the Kyoto protocol and contribute to the fight against climate change. Europe is thus acting as a pioneer in the world".
" It was not a foregone conclusion ", acknowledged Josef Pröll, Austrian Environment Minister, " but we arrived at a sensible solution which shows that Europe is still operational in the fight against climate change ". Commissioner Stavros Dimas saw the agreement as " a clear and positive political signal " but added that the Commission will decide if a declaration needs to be issued at the point when the legislation is finally adopted.

The contrasting results of elections in Belarus and Ukraine will be debated by MEPs after Council and Commission statements on the issues. These consecutive debates will also give the delegations of MEPs, who monitored the two countries voting processes, to report back to Parliament.
While the EP delegation in Ukraine was satisfied that the elections there had been free and fair, the delegation appointed by Parliament to observe the Belarusian elections was not even allowed into the country by the Minsk authorities and had to monitor the process from outside Belarus.

Trans-European energy networks: guidelines for the 2004 enlargement
2006-04-06 - 10:31
Anne LAPERROUZE (ALDE, FR) for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, will be putting forward a second reading report on Trans European Energy Networks. The proposed amendments are agreeable to Council and the procedure is likely to be completed at this second reading stage.
The aim of the directive is to adapt the guidelines (TEN energy) to the new shape of a European Union of 25 Member States, allow funding to be earmarked for projects of common interest, enable the internal market in gas and electricity to be completed and, to guarantee security of supply by means of interconnections between Member States and with neighbouring countries (south-east Europe, Mediterranean countries, Ukraine, Belarus). This approach to trans-European energy networks mirrors the approach followed for trans-European land transport networks.
The directive seeks to replace two older Decisions and to include the projects necessary to link the new Member States to be a part of the internal market of electricity and gas. It identifies projects of common interest and those which will be given priority in the coming years. It introduces new elements intended to facilitate the preparation of projects and the national procedures.
The compromise includes two important elements of the original Commission proposal supported by the EP but previously opposed by the Council: the declaration of projects of European interest and the European coordinator.
Background:
The European Union finances electricity and gas transmission infrastructure projects of European interest. A yearly budget of about €25m is spent mainly for supporting feasibility studies. Most of the projects cross national borders or have an influence on several EU Member States. The guidelines on Trans European Energy Networks specify which projects are eligible for funding. The financial rules specify the financial procedures involved. The present proposal seeks to replace the two existing directives with a new one.
The estimated amount of investment required in the period 2007-2013 for the construction of the priority projects for electricity and gas networks is around €28bn (20bn in the EU; 8bn in third countries). An additional amount will be required in order to complete the other projects of common interest. These investment amounts will be mainly provided by the energy networks operators and other private funds supplemented, where appropriate, by the European Community aid and loan mechanisms.

European citizenship
Programme to bring Europe closer to its citizens
2006-04-06 - 10:31
The Culture Committee is giving broad backing to a new Community programme designed to strengthen ties and foster a sense of cohesion between the EU's citizens following the low turnout at the last European elections and the No votes in two referenda on the Constitution for Europe.
In a first-reading report, the Culture Committee and its rapporteur Hannu TAKKULA (ALDE, FI) propose that the terms in the programme's title be reversed by calling it Europe for Citizens instead of Citizens for Europe.
The Commission had proposed three "actions": Active Citizens for Europe, Active Civil Society in Europe and Together for Europe. MEPs wish to add a fourth - Active European Remembrance - consisting of support for projects to commemorate the victims of Nazi and Stalinist mass deportation and mass extermination.
The programme will also cover:
- town twinning, including - at the wish of MEPs - twinning of sports clubs, for which purpose several references to amateur sports clubs are added to the legislation;
- transnational and cross-sectoral citizens' projects;
- support for think-tanks and civil society bodies at European level, such as the Jean Monnet Association, the Robert Schuman European Centre and, following an amendment by MEPs, the Maisons de l'Europe;
- high-profile events organised by or with the European Commission.
The cost of the programme for the period 2007-2013 will be €235 million, which according to MEPs, should be regarded as a minimum. The maximum period for granting funding at any one time should be three years, to prevent the beneficiaries becoming dependent on it, says the committee.
MEPs also stress that encouraging active citizenship is crucial in the fight against racism, xenophobia and intolerance, and in promoting integration, cohesion and democracy. In line with this, the programme should also be open to citizens of non-EU countries who have permanent residence rights in the EU.

Justice and home affairs
Policing Europe - Europol liaison officers
2006-04-06 - 10:31
Europol's liaison officers should "play an enhanced role" in "the EU's area of freedom and security". This is the view expressed in a report drawn up by Martine Roure (PES, FR), on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. The report deals with the Council proposal to amend Decision 2003/170/JHA concerning the use of liaison officers posted abroad by the law enforcement agencies of the Member States.
This proposal was presented on the initiative of the United Kingdom. According to the evaluators’ report certain changes should be made to current practices relating to how Europol liaison officers are used as well as provisions to when meetings for liaison officers are held.
Europol is the European Law Enforcement Organisation and " aims at improving the effectiveness and co-operation of the competent authorities in the Member States in preventing and combating terrorism, unlawful drug trafficking and other serious forms of international organised crime ". Previously the European Council made decisions on the common use of Europol's liaison officers but, after an assessment of the way in which Decision 2003/170/JHA was enacted, it was found that the policy was insufficiently legally-binding. Instead, with this new report, amendments are proposed legally to enhance the role of Europol liaison officers: " to make binding the current practice whereby the Member States use Europol liaison officers for the purpose of forwarding information ".
The report recognises the problems that exist as a result of poor coordination between liaison officers sent by different Member States, and their poor information-sharing performance. Correspondingly, it suggests that liaison officers should " immediately and directly exchange the information collected with Europol " with the " task of collecting, adding to and linking information beyond the national, multinational or organisational framework within which they are posted ”. The proposed amendments ensure that the Europol liaison officers should be responsible for both for the coordination of the liaison officers seconded by the Member States (in cases where there are more than one) and for the same tasks of those liaison officers. This measure is taken with a view to enhancing the cooperation and mutual support between the police force of the Member States. It states, " where liaison officers are several in number and are posted by different Member States to the same third country or international organisation, they shall coordinate their activities and their tasks in such a way that any overlap in their work is reduced to a minimum ".

Work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2005
2006-04-06 - 10:31
Thierry CORNILLET (ALDE, FR), for the Development Committee, will be putting forward an own-initiative report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) in 2005.
The committee welcomes the conclusion of the negotiations on amending the Cotonou Agreement, but regrets that the agreement reached at the Brussels summit of 15 and 16 December 2005, bringing the amount allocated to the 10th European Development Fund (EDF) (2008-2013) to EUR 22 682 million remains short of the initial proposals aimed at maintaining the same level of aid as under the 9th EDF.
MEPs in the committee supports the request of the ACP-EU JPA, expressed at its 9th session in April 2005 in Bamako (Mali) that a suitable proportion of EDF appropriations should be used for the political education and training of parliamentarians and of political, economic and social leaders, in the interests of a lasting strengthening of good governance, the rule of law, democratic structures, and the interaction between government and opposition in pluralistic democracies based on free elections.
The committee calls for greater transparency with regard to the progress and the substance of the negotiations on the economic partnership agreements as well as delivery of substantial assistance in line with President Barroso’s commitment, in Gleneagles, to provide EUR 1 billion in ‘aid for trade’
On sugar, the committee notes that the EU package of compensation and restructuring measures for the EU sugar industry exceeds EUR 7 billion and urges that the 18 ACP signatories to the Sugar Protocol, many of whose economies depend almost entirely on sugar, receive timely and substantial financial support, which must be additional to existing commitments.
The committee calls the JPA members and the European co-secretariat to do everything they can to strengthen the role and the position of the JPA within the European Parliament.
The committee congratulates the UK Presidency and the Scottish authorities on their excellent contribution to the 10th JPA in Edinburgh, particularly to the workshops on the following subjects:
- meeting the MDGs on health through research and development,
- protecting the environment: ecotourism and sustainable energy,
- fishing and fish processing: EU policies and standards Rapporteur Thierry CORNILLET ALDE FR A6-0063/2006 Activities of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2005 Procedure : Own-initiative

Blacklist needed to stamp out corruption in developing countries
2006-04-06 - 10:31
MEPs in the Development Committee call for a blacklist of regimes and representatives of corrupt governments in order to improve the effectiveness of the EU's development policy. The EU is the world's largest aid donor. The African Union estimates that corruption accounts for 25% of Africa's annual GDP - around $148 bn - and is stifling the continent's chances of taking off economically.
The report, drafted by Max van den BERG (PES, NL), stresses that all actors have a role to play in the fight against corruption: politicians, government officials, civil society, media and multinationals. The international community can also play a part. The committee urges EU Member States to ratify the OECD Convention on the Bribery of Public Officials (1997) and the UN Convention against Corruption (2003).
MEPs in the committee would like to go further and they ask the Commission and the Member States to establish an "international system of blacklisting to prevent banks from lending large sums of money to corrupt regimes or individuals representing a government".
What the developing countries can do
MEPs in the committee want national parliaments which, like those in the EU, have budgetary powers to have greater influence in the supervision of public finances. They underline the need for civil society in developing countries to establish watchdogs, with a system of checks and balances on governments. The Commission, they say, should support this process by reserving part of budget aid for such watchdogs.
What Europe can do
The report calls for more transparency in the European Union's aid budget programmes, with the publication of information on the aid spent in each recipient country. It also recommends that "budget aid should always be earmarked for a specific sector, reducing the risk of corruption or mismanagement of funds". Increasingly at present, EU development aid goes directly into the national coffers of recipient countries in the form of budget support, and the proportion has grown from 14% in 2001 to around 30% in 2004.
Finally, MEPs in the committee call on Member States, with major financial centres on their territory, to take legal and administrative measures to ensure that funds acquired illegally are repatriated to their country of origin. Africa is still a net exporter of capital to European countries.

Economic and monetary affairs
MEPs set to back Commission's competition policy
2006-04-06 - 10:31
Parliament looks set to support the Commission's competition policy when it votes on an own initiative report from the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee in response to the Commission's 2004 annual competition report. Alongside its generally positive assessment, the report make a number of specific recommendations.
The Economics Committee urges the Commission to promote the correct application of the competition rules in all Member States and to intervene in good time where the competition rules are being applied unsatisfactorily or in a discriminatory manner. It calls for clarity on the "sometimes obscure relationships" among national competition authorities and 'national champions' to remove any suspicion of complicity.
The report notes MEPs' concern at the continued failure to achieve full liberalisation in the EU gas and electric markets and welcomes the Commission's inquiry into the sector, as it does the inquiry into bank payment systems and the business insurance market, though in these two cases it urges adequate time for full and thorough responses to the Commission. It suggests that in the case of major networked services, competition must be guided by strong public service obligations.
MEPs in the committee call for the Commission to issue a "clear and precise interpretative communication on the fourth criterion set out in the Altmark judgement" on state aid for public services. They ask for a detailed analysis of the problems associated with collective bargaining sensitive economic sectors, such as agriculture, particularly the relationship between small producers and major processors and marketing firms.
Highlighting the importance of consumer information in ensuring a genuine competition culture, MEPs in the committee say there is a need to consider at Community level private compensation in cases of anti-competitive conduct.
The report also reaffirms the call for Parliament to gain a more active role in the development of competition policy by enhancement of its codecision powers in this field.
The rapporteur on this subject is Alain Lipietz (Greens/EFA, FR), but the Economics Committee amended every substantive paragraph of his original draft, changing it so much that he voted against the final version at committee stage.

Economic and monetary affairs
Broad economic policy guidelines
2006-04-06 - 10:31
In its annual report on the EU's Broad Economic Policy Guidelines for the Member States, the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee is making a wide ranging set of recommendations to the Commission and the Member States. Parliament as a whole will now debate the report, alongside the Employment Committee's suggestions on the Employment Guidelines, the two sets of guidelines having been brought together in one package last year.
In the report, drawn up by José Manuel GARCÍA-MARGALLO (EPP-ED, ES), MEPs in the committee call, among other points, for:
the Commission to publish a yearly ranking of the best and worst performers on economic reform among the Member States; speedy implementation of the national reform programmes; a strict interpretation of the renewed Stability and Growth Pact and additional efforts to reduce public debt burdens;
the Member States to refrain from harmful, exaggerated cross-border tax competition;
the promotion of the entrepreneurial spirit in secondary schools;
an evaluation by Member States of the distributive and regional effects of their tax schemes and subsidies;
ambitious birth rates policies, improvements in child care facilities, promotion of work-life balance, integration of immigrants into the labour market and action against illegal immigration, and incentives to delay retirement - all with the aim of improving the ratio of working age population over total population; efforts better to include young people, women, older people and disabled people in the workforce;
measures to reduce non-wage labour costs and thereby discourage the black economy;
improvements for the mobility of researchers and more investment in universities and the encouragement of private investment, to enhance economic efficiency and productivity;
the development of a new coherent EU energy policy; the allocation of more resources to research and innovation and for a coordinated EU innovation policy; the achievement of a single European services market in accordance with the EC treaty;
a forward looking financial services agenda focusing on achieving a Single Euro Payments Area by 2010, a review of insurance solvency, a proposal on cross-border banking mergers to facilitate consolidation and avoid home/host supervisor conflicts, a proposal on mortgage credit and the adoption of a consumer credit directive - as well as efficient supervision and close cooperation among regulatory and supervisory bodies of the Member States.
The committee also wants to see the period of reflection on the constitution to assess the current framework for macroeconomic governance. Rapporteur José Manuel GARCÍA-MARGALLO Y MARFIL EPP-ED ES A6-0077/2006 Broad economic policy guidelines for 2006 Procedure : Own-initiative

Better statistics on foreign affiliates
2006-04-06 - 10:31
Parliament will vote at first reading on Commission proposals to set standards for statistics on the structure and activity of foreign affiliates. The aim is to be able to obtain accurate and useful information on an EU-aggregated basis. The debate on this report was held during the February session, and the vote was postponed while talks were held with the Council and Commission in an effort to reach a first reading agreement.
In a report by Enrico LETTA (ALDE, IT), the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee supports the Commission's plans, albeit with a number of amendments. These seek to ensure Parliament's right of oversight on implementing measures is confirmed by incorporating the same text agreed with Council and Commission for the Capital Requirements Directive - i.e. implementing powers will be granted to the Commission until April 2008, with a review of the 'comitology' procedure to take place in the meantime.
On the substance of the measure, many of Parliament's amendments seek to ensure the burden on Member States and industry of collecting data will not be out of proportion to the benefit gained from the statistics. If this balance is born in mind, says the committee, the pilot studies proposed in the draft regulation, should be mandatory, rather than voluntary as the Commission intended.

Employment policy
Support for Employment Guidelines
2006-04-06 - 10:31
Members of the Employment Committee agree with the Commission that the Integrated Guidelines for Growth and Jobs which were set for 2005 to 2008 should be maintained. In a report by Magda Kósáné Kovács (PES, HU) on the employment guidelines, which are now part of a package with the economic policy guidelines, the committee proposes amendments only to stress the importance of specific guidelines.
This report will be debated alongside the report from the Economics Committee on the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines which form the other part of the package.
MEPs in the committee say that further progress is needed to increase workers mobility. Renewed emphasis should be placed on the employment of young and older people, on workers’ health, on combating work-related accidents at European level, on the integration of vulnerable social groups, on combating social exclusion, on outlawing illegal working and on improving the quality and the stability of jobs and to the establishment of equal rights and opportunities for men and women.
In order to promote economic growth and employment, and to boost competitiveness, says the committee, Member States should announce their research, innovation and research spending targets, as well as the measures they propose to take in respect of investment for the benefit of small and medium-sized businesses and of microfinancing for women's and family-run businesses which use innovative forms of technology.

European Capitals of Culture 2007-2019
2006-04-06 - 10:31
Parliament will be debating the system for choosing 'European Capitals of Culture' and monitoring their progress. A first reading codecision report from the Culture Committee by Christa Prets (PES, AT) is on the agenda, making a number of changes to the Commission's proposed reforms of the system. The major innovation is the introduction of a monitoring phase after a city has been designated as a 'Capital of Culture' to ensure respect of the criteria established for the cultural programme and also to give advice and support to the city concerned.
The text also specifies details of the role of the selection panel and says that the prize, in the form of a financial allocation from the Commission, should be awarded at least seven months before the beginning of the event. It also makes appropriate changes to deal with the forthcoming accession of Romania and Bulgaria, adding them to the list for 2007 and 2019 respectively.
The amendments proposed by the committee have already been agreed with Council and Commission in informal negotiations. Rapporteur Christa PRETS PSE AT A6-0061/2006 European Capitals of Culture 2007-2019 Procedure : Codecision (1st reading)

External/international trade
Call for progress in WTO talks
2006-04-06 - 10:31
Parliament will be debating the Doha round of world trade talks ahead of the World Trade Organisation meeting of 30 April in Geneva, when it considers an own initiative report from Giorgios Papastamkos (EPP-ED, EL) for the International Trade Committee on the outcome of the WTO’s Hong Kong ministerial conference in December.
While deploring the slow progress in the negotiations so far and the predetermined low level of ambition for the outcome of the Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong, MEPs in the committee call for a greater commitment of all major players, including the EU, the US and the emerging economies.
Parliament says industrialised countries and advanced developing countries should engage constructively in real negotiations to reach a successful conclusion.
On agriculture, says the committee, the commitments made by the Commission during the negotiations at the WTO must not go beyond the bounds of the current Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) arrangements or the negotiating mandate. It recalls the scope of the Luxembourg agreement on CAP reform and insists on the need to define ‘green box’ measures including decoupled support. MEPs in the committee also deplore the absence of progress on the establishment of a register for wines and spirits as well as on the extension of geographical indications to other products.
The report asked the Commission to consider the possibility of introducing a ‘development box’ for the Least Developed Countries into the agricultural negotiations. sp that they can tackle food safety and rural employment – major issues when it comes to eradicating poverty.
Negotiations on non agricultural market access should, says the committee, lead to ambitious and balanced results, guaranteeing new real market access opportunities. Given the lack of progress in the services area, the report calls for the intensification of negotiations at both bilateral and multilateral levels, with due regard for the interests of weak and vulnerable economies, while insisting that the EU continue emphasising the liberalisation of services and the opening of markets, especially in finance, tourist and distribution sectors, which are important for the European economy.
MEPs in the committee are calling for strengthened discipline with regard to anti-dumping and other rules issues in order to prevent abusive recourse to trade defence instruments while preserving the legitimate use and effectiveness of these instruments.
Among other points, the report also calls for institutional reform to improve the functioning of the WTO. It reiterates the importance of a parliamentary dimension for the WTO to enhance its democratic legitimacy and transparency, with members of Parliament constituting an important link with citizens.

Schengen Agreement - external border checks
2006-04-06 - 10:31
Parliament is to debate two reports from Michael Cashman (PES, UK) for the Civil Liberties Committee dealing with identity checks at external borders required under the Schengen Agreement.
Under the terms of the Schengen Agreement, visas issued by one Schengen Member State are deemed valid for crossing the external borders of another Schengen Member State, both for short stay and transit purposes. In addition, the current Schengen provisions allow for a system of mutual recognition of long-term visas and residence permits issued by Member States and complying with the Schengen acquis . Since the accession of the new Member States on 1 May 2004, a number of gaps in applying the provisions outlined have arisen, which require attention and which equally apply to the issuing of visas by Switzerland and Liechtenstein.
MEPs in the committee are proposing a number of largely technical amendments at this first reading stage.
Most aspects of the Schengen agreement do not apply to the UK and Ireland.

Urgency procedure for bird flu and fisheries measures
2006-04-06 - 10:31
MEPs are likely to be asked by the Commission to deal with two items under the urgency procedure. One concerns support measures for poultry farmers affected by the slump in demand for chicken products after the outbreak of avian flu, the other concerns a fisheries agreement with Morocco.
In both cases, if these requests are confirmed, MEPs will vote on Tuesday morning on whether to apply the urgency procedure to the proposals. If they agree, a vote on the substance of the issues will take place during the same session, usually on Thursday. Vote : 04.04.2006

Commission's revised proposal for the services directive
2006-04-06 - 10:31
Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Internal Market Commissioner Charlie McCreevy will inform MEPs of the Commission's revised proposal on the services directive in the light of Parliament's major amendments at first reading. At this stage of the legislative process, the ball is in the Council's court: once the Member States have pronounced on Parliament's first reading text - and the Commission's revised proposal in reaction to it - by adopting a common position, the draft directive will return to MEPs for a second reading. Debate: 5pm, 04/04/06
