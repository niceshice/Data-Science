EU Member States must halt the sale of arms to Syria, Bahrain and Yemen, which are violently oppressing their own people, argued members of the S&D, ALDE, Greens/EFA and GUE groups on Wednesday. In a debate on the situation in these three countries, many MEPs complained of a lack of concrete measures by the External Action Service. They proposed reconsidering the EU's bilateral relations with these three countries and also suggested that asset freezes and travel bans should be considered.
Parliament will vote on a resolution on Thursday at noon.
