The europarltv team at work interviewing Pieter Feith, the European Union Special Representative (EUSR) to Kosovo. There is only one web TV channel with programmes in over 20 languages and that is the recently launched europarltv channel. This week it you can watch a round-up of the debates in parliament's committees as well as special programmes on the future of Gaza and Croatia's EU hopes.
Among other hot topics on the channel this week is a programme about a new financial regulation to cope with the economic crisis and new copyright rules.
Every week there are also interviews with the people making the news in Parliament. This week the two leaders of the European Greens - Italian MEP Monica Frassoni and Daniel-Cohn Bendit who sits as a Member for Germany, discuss the future of Green policies in Europe and their campaign to prevent the re-election of Commission President Barroso.
With Gaza still smouldering europarltv asks "Can the deadlock over Gaza be broken?"
Also, with Croatia knocking at the doors of the EU watch a debate on "Where will enlargement stop?"
