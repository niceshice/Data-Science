European Ombudsman Nikiforos Diamandouros Annual report by EU watchdog Concerns about transparency, access to documents The man who investigates charges of malpractice by people against European Institutions like the Commission and the Parliament was in the EP last Thursday (25 November). He was there to debate with MEPs his annual report from last year and a special report on "lack of cooperation by the European Commission in the disclosure of correspondence" between the institution and car giant Porsche.
2009 report on Ombudsman's activities
The MEP who drafted Parliament's report on the Ombudsman's 2009 activities, Bulgarian MEP Mariya Nedelcheva (EPP), told the House that the watchdogs "2009 activities were very positive". She went on to say that "the European Ombudsman should continue to favour amicable solutions and redouble its efforts to communicate well with the citizens". Ms Nedelcheva called for stronger links between the European Parliament and the Ombudsman.
Speaking in the debate the European Ombudsman Nikiforos Diamandouros said that "Parliament and the Ombudsman must both work to ensure that citizens and residents in the EU can enjoy their rights to the full". However, commenting on the work of the Parliament's Petition's Committee he said that "Parliament, as a sovereign political body, can deal with petitions that request changes in the law, or new laws; in contrast, my role is to help uncover maladministration".
Maroš Šefčovič , the European Commissioner for Administration told the House that "the administration should be efficient, professional, and European law must be respected".
For Parliament's largest political bloc, the EPP, Elena Băsescu MEP urged the European Commission to "redouble its efforts to better communicate with the citizens". For the Socialists and Democrats Monika Flašíková Beňová told fellow MEPs that "the European Parliament wants to back and support the Commission, but in return we ask it to give us enough information". The report by the Ombudsman was presented to MEPs on the Petition's Committee on 4 May.
Special report on "lack of cooperation by the European Commission"
Also debated was a special Report from the European Ombudsman to the European Parliament concerning "lack of cooperation by the European Commission" on the disclosure of documents relating to the German car Manufacturer Porsche.
In March 2007 an environmental NGO asked for access to certain Commission documents related to meetings between the institution and car manufacturers.
In November of that year the Commission granted access to them, with the exception of three letters sent to the then Commissioner Günter Verheugen by the German car manufacturer Porsche, alleging that their disclosure would undermine the protection of the company’s commercial interests. The complaint then turned to the European Ombudsman.
Parliament's rapporteur Chrysoula Paliadeli (S&D, Greece) told the House that "this delay prompted the ombudsman to write a special report to the Parliament criticising the Commission for lack of cooperation". Ms Paliadeli said that "I find it unacceptable for the EC to argue that because a private company would not like the documents to be published, they would not be."
European Ombudsman Nikiforos Diamandouros stressed that current Commissioner Mr Šefčovič "has gone out of his way to try and work very closely with the European Ombudsman".
Mr Šefčovič assured that the communication between him and Diamandouros "is very intense". He went on to say that "we are aware that most frequent claims for maladministration concern the lack of transparency, including the refusal to provide information, and I am committed to further tackle such cases".
Special reports are the European Ombudsman’s "ultimate weapon" as Parliament's report on this issue states. The Ombudsman has presented only 17 special reports to the EP since 1995.
