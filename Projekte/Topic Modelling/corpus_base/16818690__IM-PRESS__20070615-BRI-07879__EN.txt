Opening of the June Strasbourg session: changes to this week's agenda - new debate on the situation in Palestine
Following the opening on Monday (18 June) of the Strasbourg session by EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering, the House approved a number of changes to the week's plenary agenda. On Tuesday (19 June) at 9am the President of Parliament and one speaker from each political group made statements on the situation in Palestine.
Equitable Life: not just a British affair
Parliament’s plenary on Tuesday 19 June overwhelmingly backed the calls made by its Committee of Inquiry into Equitable Life for the UK government to compensate victims of the company's near-collapse and for wide-ranging changes to be made in the drafting and implementation of EU financial services legislation. Internal Market Commissioner Charlie McCreevy promised that the Commission would respond in due course to the inquiry's recommendations on the points that concerned it.
MEPs call for a complete ban on the cat and dog fur trade in the EU
The European Parliament adopted a report on a proposed EU-wide ban on trading in cat and dog fur. The first-reading scraps an exemption allowing trade in fur from cats and dogs if they were "not bred or killed for fur production". MEPs fear this would leave a "gaping loophole" in the legislation, which traders would quickly exploit.
Vodka 'whisky whiskey' definitions go down smoothly for MEPs
MEPs adopted first-reading report and settled on a definition of vodka that would allow the drink to be produced from any agricultural material, provided that it was appropriately labelled. The co-decision report by Horst Schnellhardt (EPP-ED, DE) was adopted in Strasbourg today, setting out the definitions and labelling of spirit drinks in the EU. The first-reading compromise with the Council, clears the way for the regulation to come before a final Council vote probably in September.
MEPs debate the situation in the Middle East
Following the recent deterioration and violence in Gaza, MEPs turned their attention to the situation in the Middle East. MEPs expressed diverse views with many condemning the violence in the Gaza strip. The House will vote on a resolution during the July Strasbourg plenary (9-12 July). European Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering said: "We have all been profoundly moved and disturbed by the terrible situation and frightening developments over the past days in the Gaza Strip.
MEPs call to re-launch energy dialogue with Russia
The future partnership and cooperation agreement (PCA) with Russia - the current one expiring in December 2007 - should include a meaningful energy dimension to safeguard Europe's energy supplies from its primary source of oil and gas, says the European Parliament in an own-initiative report on economic and trade relations with Russia adopted today with a large majority. The European Parliament insists that Russia ratifies the European Energy Charter.
MEPs call to ban mercury imports and exports by 2010
Parliament approved with amendments a draft regulation on the banning of exports and the safe storage of mercury. MEPs voted for the proposed ban on exports to be brought forward to 1 December 2010 and for stricter rules on storage. They also voted for an import ban, which was not included in the Commission's draft legislation.
Parliament backs Cyprus and Malta for euro membership
MEPs voted to support both Cyprus and Malta in adopting the euro on 1 January 2008. They also adopted a resolution seeking a formal agreement with the Council and Commission to improve the way Parliament is consulted on future euro area enlargements. The EU summit will take a political decision on the two countries' applications this week, then the ECOFIN Council will makes its formal decision on the legislation on 10 July.
Galileo - MEPs say it should be financed in full from EU money
In adopting a joint resolution on the financing of the European programme of satellite radio-navigation(Galileo), MEPs consider that the Galileo programme should be financed in full from the Union's budget. The House also points out that the Commission must present a revised proposal for a regulation on the financing of the Galileo programme, which must be agreed upon by Parliament and the Council in codecision.

2007-06-21 - 16:22
Following the opening on Monday (18 June) of the Strasbourg session by EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering, the House approved a number of changes to the week's plenary agenda. On Tuesday at 9am the President of Parliament and one speaker from each political group made statements on the situation in Palestine. The vote on the resolution on the Middle East, scheduled for Thursday, was postponed to the July plenary, in view of the speed with which events are evolving in that part of the world. Also on Thursday, under debates on breaches of human rights, the topic "Situation of Iraqi refugees" was replaced by a debate on Cuba.

Equitable Life: not just a British affair
2007-06-21 - 16:22
Parliament’s plenary on Tuesday 19 June overwhelmingly backed the calls made by its Committee of Inquiry into Equitable Life for the UK government to compensate victims of the company's near-collapse and for wide-ranging changes to be made in the drafting and implementation of EU financial services legislation. Internal Market Commissioner Charlie McCreevy promised that the Commission would respond in due course to the inquiry's recommendations on the points that concerned it. The massive endorsement of the committee’s report by the full Parliament (by 602 votes to 13, with 64 abstentions) was welcomed by its author, Diana WALLIS (ALDE, UK), who said "I believe this report will assist the victims in a pincer movement with the UK Parliamentary Ombudsman, perhaps finally to deliver compensation. More importantly, I hope it will deliver a huge jolt to our institutions about our lawmaking processes and the European system of justice".
Call for UK government to aid policyholders
Over a million policyholders of the British life assurance company Equitable Life lost money when the company got into financial difficulties. This was primarily due to mismanagement by Equitable. But the EP report argues that, given the British government's “failure to comply” with EU insurance law (notably the UK regulators’ failure to ensure that Equitable had sufficient reserves to pay its policyholders), the government should assume responsibility and “devise and implement an appropriate scheme with a view to compensating Equitable Life policyholders within the UK, Ireland, Germany and elsewhere”.
Implications for EU financial services legislation
Indeed, this is far from being a purely British affair. Not only were there victims in several EU countries; the case has also brought to light a number of broader, long-term concerns relating to the EU single market in services. The inquiry's findings thus go far beyond the grievances raised in the two petitions to the EP from victims of Equitable Life's difficulties, which prompted Parliament to set up the investigation.
MEPs are particularly keen to stress the need to build consumer confidence in a healthy European pensions and insurance market, especially given demographic trends in Europe. With this in mind, the report makes a raft of proposals on the nature and form of EU financial services legislation, the rights of consumers who buy financial services products in EU countries other than their own, and the role of the EP and the Commission in monitoring the implementation of EU legislation in the Member States. (See summary of committee's findings - link below)
MEPs and Commission agree on need to learn lessons
Referring to the consumer rights of policyholders outside the UK who found themselves unable even to apply for compensation when the authorities in different countries tried to shift the responsibility to each other, rapporteur Diana Wallis said "I think we all understand and appreciate the importance of financial services companies – and indeed other companies – being able to trade and do business across the European Union". But, she added, "if we are going to do this – and it is clear that we are – we have to be absolutely crystal clear who is responsible for what". She underlined a point made in the report, that, in the area of financial services, there can be "no mobility without liability".
On the role of the EU institutions in overseeing the application of EU legislation, she said "Better implementation means a proactive Commission combined with a watchful Parliament ".
Mairead McGUINNESS (EPP-ED, IE), who chaired the committee, stressed the value of the inquiry in bringing Parliament's work closer to the citizens - and all because of the petitions sent in originally. She also stressed that "the UK was flawed in its implementation of the Third Life Directive. Yes, it ticked the boxes, but its day-to-day application was deficient and inadequate" and that "if the cross-border dimension of consumer protection is not properly taken into account, can we blame consumers in the EU for not shopping more across borders?"
Internal Market Commissioner McCREEVY said that the inquiry's work was “a job well done", adding "I am personally pleased that the committee of inquiry went beyond the specifics of the Equitable Life case and took a broader look at how transposition and implementation checks are done more generally." He believed that "All parties received a fair hearing. We have learned important lessons and take this on board for the future."

MEPs concerned about land law in Andalucia, Valencia and Madrid
2007-06-21 - 16:22
In adopting a resolution on the results of the fact-finding mission to Andalucia, Valencia and Madrid, MEPs consider that the obligation to cede legitimately acquired private property without due process and proper compensation, linked to the obligation to pay arbitrary costs for often unnecessary infrastructure development is a violation of an individual’s fundamental rights as determined by the European Convention and jurisprudence on Human Rights and as contained in the EU Treaty. The House deeply regrets that such practices are widespread in various autonomous regions of Spain, in particular in the Valencia region and other parts of the Mediterranean coastal area, but also, for instance, in the Madrid region. The resolution was adopted with 327 votes in favour, 222 against and 35 abstentions.
The European Parliament expresses its severe condemnation of, and opposition to, massive urbanisation projects initiated by construction companies and real-estate developers which bear no relation to the real requirements of the towns and villages affected, are environmentally unsustainable and have a disastrous impact on the historical and cultural identity of the areas affected.
MEPs condemn the tacit approval by some town halls for building developments which are subsequently declared illegal and which as a result lead to the destruction, or threatened destruction, of property which had been bought in good faith by European citizens through regular commercial developers and sales agents.
MEPs recognise the Commission’s efforts to ensure the compliance of Spain with the directives on public procurement, but considers that the Commission should pay special attention to the documented cases of infringements of directives on the environment, water and consumer policy issues.
The House calls upon the Spanish authorities and regional governments, in particular the Valencian Government, which are under an obligation to respect and apply the provisions of the EU Treaty and EU laws, to recognise the individual’s legitimate right to his legally acquired property and to establish in law more precisely defined criteria regarding the application of Article 33 of the Spanish Constitution concerning the public interest, in order to prevent and forbid the abuse of people’s property rights by decisions of local and regional authorities.
The House calls into question the methods of designation of, and frequently excessive powers given in practice to, urbanisers and property developers by certain local authorities at the expense of local communities and the citizens who have their homes and legally acquired property there.
MEPs strongly condemn the covert practice of certain property developers of undermining by subterfuge the legitimate ownership of property by European citizens by interfering with land registration, and calls upon local authorities to establish proper legal safeguards against this practice.
The House calls upon regional authorities to establish special administrative commissions involving local ombudsmen, to which independent investigation services should report, which should have powers of arbitration in relation to disputes concerning urbanisation projects, and which should be accessible free of charge to those directly affected by urbanisation programmes, including those who are victims of illegal property deals concerning unauthorised urban development.
Finally, MEPs call on the Commission to initiate an information campaign directed at European citizens buying real estate in a Member State other than their own.

MEPs call for a complete ban on the cat and dog fur trade in the EU
2007-06-21 - 16:22
The European Parliament adopted a report on a proposed EU-wide ban on trading in cat and dog fur. The first-reading scraps an exemption allowing trade in fur from cats and dogs if they were "not bred or killed for fur production". MEPs fear this would leave a "gaping loophole" in the legislation, which traders would quickly exploit. In December 2003, Parliament adopted a declaration calling on the European Commission to draft a regulation banning the import, export, sale and production of cat and dog fur and skins. Three years later – after a public outcry over evidence that cat and dog fur products were still entering the EU, despite a voluntary code of conduct adopted by European fur traders – Parliament got its wish.
“The placing on the market and the import to or export from the Community of fur of cats and dogs and products containing such fur shall be prohibited”, stipulates Article 1 of the draft regulation proposed by the Commission. The committee backed this element of the legislation by a large majority.
However, they did not back a derogation proposed by the Commission to the ban, which would open up the possibility for cat and dog fur to be placed on the EU market provided that the fur (or products containing it) were (a) “labelled as originating from cats or dogs that have not been bred or killed for fur production”, or (b) constituted “personal or household effects” introduced into, or exported from, the Community.
Rapporteur Eva-Britt SVENSSON (GUE/NGL, SE) was adamant about doing away with the derogation, saying that it “would provide a gaping loophole, which would be ruthlessly exploited by traders of all future consignments of cat and dog fur, thus rendering the entire regulation useless”. Fellow MEPs agreed, voting to delete the relevant article, and committee chair Arlene McCARTHY (PES, UK) echoed their views, saying “We want a ban, not a restriction”.
In the course of negotiations with the Council, MEPs did agree, however, that, "by way of exceptional derogation", the Commission may adopt provisions allowing cat and dog fur on the EU market "for educational or taxidermy purposes."
By entering into negotiations with the Council Presidency ahead of the plenary vote, MEPs have secured a first-reading agreement on the ban. This means, effectively, that the Council is expected to back the Parliament's report (i.e. its amendments) and to adopt the legislation without any further changes. The ban will apply from 31 December 2008.
NGOs working in this sector estimate that around two million dogs and cats a year die in this trade in China alone, simply to supply the European market.
British speakers in the debate on Monday, 18 June 2007
Caroline LUCAS (Greens/EFA), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade warmly welcomed Mrs Svensson's report and congratulated her on her excellent work. It is very clear, Ms Lucas stated, that Parliament is united in saying that there should be no derogations that would compromise the integrity and the effectiveness of a ban.
However, continuing she stated that in terms of this legislation being forthcoming from the Commission, we have had to wait quite a long time. She recalled her writing to Commissioner Byrne back in 2002 calling for a ban on cat and dog fur. We were, she said, told simply that it was a very complex issue and the Commission was reflecting.
"What worries me about that is that in a sense this slowness is being repeated on another issue that I want to turn your minds to, which is the issue of banning imports of seal products. Again, Parliament is being told that it is a complex issue. Exactly the same language is being used again now, when it comes to seal products, as was used back in 2002 about cat and dog fur.
As the draftsperson in the Committee on International Trade, I tabled amendments to the cat and dog proposal, not suggesting that we try to include seals – that would be too much – but at least asking the Commission to bring forward similar legislation to deal with imports of seal products. This was agreed by the Committee on International Trade.
The Commissioner said earlier that there was no lack of political will when it came to dealing with the cat and dog issue, what was lacking was an imaginative legal base. I urge the Commissioner and his services to be extraordinary imaginative and to recognise that Europe’s citizens feel the same revulsion about cat and dog fur as they feel about imports of seal products. We must have legislation coming forward very urgently on that issue as well."
Struan STEVENSON (EPP-ED), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. – expressed his very warm thanks to Mrs Svensson for a brilliant piece of work and a brilliant report. He also wished to thank Mrs McCarthy for her dedication and commitment to steering this very important report through Parliament. However, most of all, he expressed his gratitude for the great courage of Commissioner Kyprianou, because, as Mrs Lucas has just said, the previous Commissioner told us that it was impossible and there would never be a legal basis. I remember Commissioner Kyprianou saying to me, ‘As a lawyer, if I went round telling clients that things were impossible, I would never make a living!’. He has fulfilled his pledge.
"It is music to my ears to hear this debate this evening, because it has taken eight years to get this far, with the help of Humane Society International. Betsy Dribben, who used to work for Humane Society International, has flown over from Washington and is in the public gallery tonight, and many thanks are due to her for her dogged campaigning.
Humane Society International estimates that, every year, about two million cats and dogs are killed in China alone to supply the fashion market in Europe with items like this little toy, which the rapporteur mentioned – little cats, which mums and dads buy for their kids because they are cat and dog lovers, not realising that they have been made out of real cat and dog skin from animals that have been brutally killed. The trade buys these cat skins to make collars for trim for parka hoods and ski boot and ski glove linings and all sorts of fashion items.
This has been a perpetrated fraud on the public. The public are never told that they are buying real items of cat and dog fur. Sometimes it is even dyed to look like fake fur and given false labels to fool the public. I am glad that, at long last, there will very soon be a law on the statute books – a regulation – in all 27 Member States banning this evil trade. I thank the Commissioner and everyone else who has been involved in achieving that."
Arlene McCARTHY (PES), chair of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO), reminded the House that the late Philip Whitehead, former chairman of the IMCO Committee, asked the Commission to take action and on 30 December last year "I received on behalf of concerned citizens a petition signed by over a quarter of a million people calling for us to bring in that ban. We have acted but I believe that it is citizens' determination and animal welfare campaigners who should take the credit for this new law and for helping us to persuade the Commission to give us the legal power to ban it. There is plenty of evidence of the inhuman treatment of cats and dogs bred for fur. Animal welfare organisations have been contacting my office and welcoming the law. Their only criticism is that it has taken us too long. But this law is also about protecting consumers who have unwittingly been deceived into buying clothes, toys, household products, made from cat and dog fur. I would say that people power can win the day over bureaucracy and over legal barriers.
I want to stress to the Commission and to the Member States that the committee's negotiating team wanted the EU to adopt the highest international standards and best practices in ensuring we ban this obscene trade and that cat and dog products do not end up in the shops by the back door."
Concluding Ms McCarthy insisted on a report back on how the ban is being implemented and action if it is not working. "We expect Member States to take their responsibilities seriously in both implementing and enforcing the ban. There must be tough and dissuasive penalties to deter the cat and dog fur traders. In short, a ban must mean a ban in principle and in practice. Not a restriction enabling continuation of the trade by the back door."
Catherine STIHLER (PES) stated that one million Europeans have lobbied in favour of banning the import of cat and dog fur into the EU. The Commission, she said, had listened to the European Parliament and reacted by taking legislative action to ban the import of cat and dog fur. She welcomed this and hoped that we will see an end to the barbaric trade which accounts for the slaughter of over two million cats and dogs each year. However, warm words are not enough, she said. Some constituents have raised concerns that loopholes in the Commission's proposal may allow imports via the back door. Ms Stihler recently tabled a written question asking the Commission about derogations that might allow the trade to continue. The reply that she received gave information on two derogations, one relating to fur that was part of personal or household effects being brought into the EU, and the other relating to fur or products containing fur that have not been bred or killed for fur production.
Ms Stihler welcomed the fact that the European Parliament's report deletes these derogations and she urged colleagues to fully support this report. "We want to be sure that cat and dog fur will not be imported into the EU."
Elizabeth LYNNE (ALDE) welcomed the fact that several EU countries – France, Italy, Denmark, Greece and Belgium – moved unilaterally to ban the trade. However, she said, there are differences in the approaches of other Member States, ranging from bans on rearing and slaughter to labelling requirements. These differences can cause problems for consumers, retailers and traders alike. That is why, as we all know, an EU-wide ban is so important if we want an end to this vile trade.
"We have already heard that 2 million dogs and cats are slaughtered each year for their fur and that it takes at least 10 dogs and up to 24 cats to make a single coat. These animals live in horrific conditions and many are skinned alive. Since the US brought in a ban, more cat and dog fur is coming into the EU. The problem is that many customers do not know what they are buying, as cat and dog fur is quite often labelled as fake fur. It is also included in a variety of products other than clothing, such as some homeopathic medicines, children's toys and accessories."
Concluding Ms Lynne welcomed the debate and vote which followed and congratulated the Commissioner on his commitment.

Safer Internet: MEPs sketch out plans for better e-shopping in Europe
2007-06-21 - 16:22
The numbers speak for themselves. Despite the potential of online shopping, only 6 % of European consumers engage in cross-border e-commerce. Of those who attempt it, 33 % find that businesses refuse to sell their goods or services because the buyer and seller are not resident in the same country. Overall, European consumer and business confidence in the digital environment is low. A report adopted by the European Parliament sets out to remedy the situation. As the report notes, the lack of confidence in online sales - and the legal uncertainty associated with it - is one of the main reasons why Europe lags behind the United States and Asia in certain aspects of e-commerce. It is "regrettable", MEPs note in their report, "that the EU currently has no strategy of its own that would help resolve the situation". With that in mind, the report calls on the European Commission to propose a strategy for increasing consumer confidence, to take steps to make e-business more attractive, and to stop the fragmentation of the internal market in the digital environment (i.e. to improve access to goods and services offered online in another Member State).
To start with, as MEPs agree, a new e-confidence initiative is necessary. Such an initiative should include, among other things:
- a grant programme for projects aimed at increasing consumer confidence
- an electronic teaching module relating to consumer protection and users' rights in e-commerce
- educational and information projects designed to raise SMEs' awareness of cross-border online sales
- an early-warning system, including a database, to combat online fraud
At the same time, "a clearer and improved" consumer acquis, "oriented towards horizontal legal instruments and the harmonisation of certain aspects of consumer contract law" - and comprising, among other things, directives on distance selling of financial services and e-commerce - would be needed, argue MEPs. The Commission, they advise, should also take action on "collective redress mechanisms for cross border [business-to-consumer] disputes in the digital environment".
E-rights and wrongs
The text also makes recommendations pertaining to the rights of internet shoppers. It proposes a "European charter of users’ rights" that would clarify the rights and obligations of online shoppers and retailers. Members, in the same breath, suggest the creation of an information system, which would offer consumers detailed guidance about their rights and call on the Commission to make the supply chain in e-business more transparent.
Lastly, MEPs ask the Commission to initiate steps to set up a European online trust mark-- this, once "obstacles to the integration of the retail side of the internal market have been removed."
The report, penned by Zuzana Roithová (EPP-ED, CZ), was adopted by an overwhelming majority of members.

Vodka 'whisky whiskey' definitions go down smoothly for MEPs
2007-06-21 - 16:22
MEPs adopted first-reading report and settled on a definition of vodka that would allow the drink to be produced from any agricultural material, provided that it was appropriately labelled. The co-decision report by Horst Schnellhardt (EPP-ED, DE) was adopted in Strasbourg today, setting out the definitions and labelling of spirit drinks in the EU. The first-reading compromise with the Council, clears the way for the regulation to come before a final Council vote probably in September. The Commission's proposal had originally suggested establishing three categories of spirit drinks, which the EP's Environment Committee rejected, arguing for a single category of 'spirit drinks'. This single category is maintained in the compromise with the Council, as well. Although the Environment Committee had argued for a two-year transitional period, the compromise on the table would apply three months after the entry into force of the regulation.
Vodka: controversial until the last drop
The most hotly debated point in the vote centred around the definition and labelling of vodka. The Environment Committee's proposal had suggested that traditional vodka only be made from grain, potatoes or sugar beet molasses. Vodkas made from other raw materials would have had to clearly indicate what they were made from, with a large label on the bottle (2/3 of the size of the word 'Vodka' on the label).
The adopted compromise with the Council foresees a slightly different approach: traditional vodka could only be made from grain or potatoes (not molasses), and other raw materials would only be allowed to be used if they were clearly indicated on the label. The size of this label, however, would not be specified.
Some MEPs from traditional vodka-producing Member States (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Sweden) would have preferred to only allow the name 'vodka' to be applied to spirits made from grain, potatoes and molasses, but their amendments failed to garner enough support among MEPs.
Traditional whisky names safeguarded
The House voted for existing geographical names to remain valid. These could be supplemented by additional descriptions provided they are regulated at national or regional level or are included in the technical specifications, such as "single malt" and/or "Highland" for Scotch whisky. Applications for geographical designations must justified by the Member State of origin. This point is unchanged by the compromise.
Co-decision and flavourings: the end of a spirited debate
The Committee's proposal not to allow flavouring of spirits was maintained by the compromise with Council, as was their call to maintain existing geographical designations. On the other hand, the Committee's insistence that any change to these regulations be subject to the co-decision procedure was not accepted by Council, so the definitions of individual spirit drinks (laid down in Annexes to the Regulation) will be subject to comitology.
British speakers in the debate in Strasbourg on Monday, 18 June 2007
Gary Titley (PES), congratulated Mr Schnellhardt on his patience above all else.
"The spirit industry is extremely important to us, creating jobs, status, export and tax revenue. Therefore it has been important to update the 1989-1990 regulations, to bring greater clarity and greater legal certainty to improve the definition of the main spirit drinks and to resolve any problems with spirits with a quasi-geographical indication status.
What we now have is a proper registration system for geographical indication, which is important, and I am glad we have got rid of the three categories of spirits. We have now ended up with something that is compatible with the WTO and TRIPS, which ensures smooth running in the internal market, prevents fraud and counterfeiting, protects the consumer and does not underplay and undermine solid, long-established industries, such as the second biggest vodka producer in Europe – the United Kingdom – where in Scotland vodka is such an important industry. That is why we must support these proposals.
I think the Commission proposal was better than the compromise, but it is important to move forward with the compromise on vodka, bearing in mind geographical indications will protect forever Polish vodka, Finnish vodka, Swedish vodka, Lithuanian vodka, and so on."
Linda McAvan, (PES) stated that the Socialist Group will be supporting the trialogue compromise and all its elements, as outlined by the rapporteur, She thanked Mr Schnellhardt for all his hard work and, like Mr Titley, his patience, because this has become a very complex dossier and one on which emotions have started to run high.
"We are supporting this compromise because we want the European drinks industry to have high-quality products for consumers and we want to protect our industry on the world markets. What we do not want to do with this legislation is to give one country’s type of production an advantage over another country’s type of production. That is not the aim of the legislation. There is room for all European producers, as long as they meet high quality standards.
That brings me to the vodka compromise. I think it is a good compromise. Why? Because, as Mr Schnellhardt has said, for the first time it recognises that there is a special place for traditional manufacturers using cereals and potatoes. But, at the same time, it allows other long-standing producers of vodka to continue to market their products on the European market – and they will be labelled.
We cannot have a situation as proposed by some of the amendments which seek to take certain European producers off the market. That would never get a majority in this House and would never get a majority in the Council. Everybody has to work in a spirit of compromise and what we have got on the table has something for everybody.
We have also got to work with facts. It is simply not true that the compromise on vodka would allow you to make vodka, for example, from animal waste, as has been circulated again in this House today. That is not true. It is made from very high-quality agricultural products.
I want to say something to the British Conservatives about vodka. I understand from their press release last week they are not supporting the compromise now and they have accused Labour of selling the British vodka industry down the river. I have to say that this is vital for European jobs, it is vital for the drinks industry, which employs 60 000 people, and has the support of British industry as well as European vodka producers and other drinks manufacturers. I can see surprise from some Members. I hope we will have this clarified because I have the press release here.
Finally, it is not just about vodka, it is about high-quality drinks. Many colleagues from different countries have come to Mr Schnellhardt, myself and other colleagues and asked for certain changes because of their traditional production. All those things have been met. The Council and the Commission have been very helpful and I very much hope that tomorrow, after, as Mr Titley has said, 18 years have passed since we started trying to get this legislation on the statute book, we just go ahead and do it and protect European jobs."
Ian Hudghton (Greens/EFA) stated that as a Scots MEP he has an obvious interest in any regulation that relates to whisky. However, he stated, we also have other national drinks, including a very significant economic interest in vodka and gin distillation and bottling.
"Some say that spirits should be treated the same, but vodka and whisky are not the same, and this proposal simply has to recognise that fact. Vodka has traditionally been made from different ingredients in different areas; Scotch whisky is a product of centuries of traditional practice, by contrast. The first reference to Scotch whisky in Scotland was in Exchequer records in 1494/95. The first taxes were imposed in 1644.
Some spirits have traditionally been rounded off using sugar. Scotch whisky has not, and this regulation must not allow that to happen. Protecting the term ‘Scotch whisky’, as well as the methods of production under geographic definition, is extremely important for Scotland for obvious reasons. Some details still have to be underlined in the technical files, and I look forward to that.
However, this first-reading compromise – the product of lengthy and very heated exchanges – is something that, in the spirit of that compromise, I am now prepared to accept, and I hope that the House will accept it tomorrow."
Roger Helmer (NI) responding to Mr Maaten's question if we have not been to see a distillery which is a craft industry. "Well, Mr Maaten, yes I have. I worked in the industry for several years and I can tell you that a malt whisky distillery is indeed a craft industry, but a vodka or grain whisky distillery is an industrial process and the process for producing vodka produces pure alcohol whether you make it from sugar or from potatoes or from anything else.
All this talk about consumer protection is nonsense. The product is identical and the reason we should not compare vodka with whisky – or brandy, as has been rightly pointed out by my colleague on the other side of the Chamber – is because in those products, the ingredients significantly affect the flavour. Whisky is only whisky if it is made in the proper way, but vodka is based on pure alcohol.
If I may make a general point, we should not be seeking to change the established meanings of words by legislation. However, in this case the compromise proposed by the rapporteur seems to be the best outcome on offer so I suppose that we must reluctantly support it. As happens so often in the European Union, we have to make the best of a bad job."
Struan Stevenson (EPP-ED) confirmed that the UK Conservatives are indeed supporting Mr Schnellhardt’s amendment on vodka. The issue, he said, which our Scandinavian and Polish colleagues appear to be banking on now is the old equality-with-whisky argument.
"I have heard people in the House this evening saying that that we could possibly have a situation where whisky is going to be made out of grapes. Well I have to say that these arguments are completely bogus. We are trying to define these products for the benefit of consumers to ensure that what is in the bottle conforms to their expectations of what a whisky or a vodka should be. As distillers will tell you, if you distil at a lower alcoholic strength, more taste comes over the still. Spirits like whisky are distilled at a low strength and derive their taste from the raw materials. Other spirits like vodka are distilled at a high strength and may then even be filtered through charcoal to remove the taste of the raw materials.
Our Nordic colleagues and their allies are trying to have it both ways. They are asking us to define a product not by reference to its characteristics or by reference to what the consumers expect, but by reference to the raw materials that their producers currently use. It is interesting that they have not sought to include sulphite waste, which was the predominant raw material in Sweden in the 1920s, nor apples, nor coal and yellow turnips, which have all been used in Poland in the past. Parliament should not be in the business of defining products so as to exclude producers and distort competition. We should be protecting the consumer, and it is for that reason that we support the approach being taken by Dr Schnellhardt, which avoids artificial restrictions on production while ensuring that consumers are adequately informed."
James Nicholson (EPP-ED) congratulated the rapporteur on his report which he considered it to be an excellent piece of work. This report and this debate, he said, have, to say the least, provoked a considerable disagreement between many Members, between Groups and within groups. Mr Nicholson believed that that support should be given to the compromise which has been reached. There are other proposals, but they cover what one specific viewpoint holds to the detriment of the other.
"The bottom line should be the quality and the standard of the product. Additives are and must be controlled, but you cannot ban products that have been used for a long time. We have to be aware of the needs of the spirit industry, as well as of consumer protection.
As some have said, this has turned out to be a complex report, with some very strong and different points of view, but we must have an acceptable agreement. Compromise agreements sometimes dilute the original intention of the directive, but on this occasion I believe that this is the best we can achieve at the present time. This is a very important and serious subject and we must get it right. The debate on what is vodka has removed some of the importance of this directive and that is unfortunate, but that sometimes occurs in politics.
I listened to the different contributions and to my two colleagues from Scotland who protested that they have the longest-standing whisky. Where I come from in Northern Ireland we have a little product called Bushmills and we would probably have a good debate as to who actually owned the oldest whiskey on the island of Ireland! I shall conclude on that note."

EP call for appropriate assistance to students with family responsibilities
2007-06-21 - 16:22
The European Parliament adopted an own-initiative report where MEPs call for tax breaks, appropriate housing, sufficient childcare and flexible study conditions for young women and men with family responsibilities. National "certification" schemes for family-friendly higher-education establishments should also be set up, MEPs believe. MEPs point out in the report by Maria PANAYOTOPOULOS-CASSIOTOU (EPP-ED, EL) that according to the conclusions of the Green Paper on demography, the European demographic deficit is due in part to the various stages of life (education, work, family) being reached later.
On the other hand, it also means more and more students have family responsibilities - in Sweden, 41% and in Finland, 31% of women had their first child before completing their education. MEPs therefore want the Commission and the Member States to "promote policies which make it easier to combine studying, training and family life, which support the balanced assumption of family responsibilities by young people without any form of discrimination, and which enable them to optimise their contribution to European growth and competitiveness."
Resources have to be suited to needs
MEPs encourage the Member states to be more aware of the situation of young men and women who have family responsibilities while they are in education or training, and particularly to make resources available to them that suit to their needs. They encourage the Member States to offer affordable "student insurance", in particular social and medical cover - which could be extended to the student’s dependants and "to reduce or put an end to the taxation of young men and women who both study and work and who have family responsibilities or responsibilities towards dependants". MEPs also call on the Member States and credit institutions to simplify and facilitate the provision of loans on beneficial terms to young people who combine family responsibilities with their studies.
The higher education establishments on their part are invited "to take account of the financial situation of young men and women who have family responsibilities when calculating course fees" and encouraged to provide appropriate assistance.
The Member States are also asked "to count maternity and parental leave during a period of study towards women's aggregate time spent in work and their retirement pension entitlement periods, with a view to meeting fully the goad of genuine gender equality".
Suitable housing and childcare
The Member States in partnership with local authorities and higher education institutions are encouraged to adopt measures to enable students who are parents to live in housing that is suited to their needs and to have access to sufficient and adequate child care under the same conditions of eligibility as working parents. In doing that the Member States should make full use of the possibilities provided by Community funds and in particular the ESF in this area.
The higher education and vocational training establishments are also encouraged to set up child-care services on their premises and MEPs believe Member States should support such initiatives.
Flexible study conditions
The Parliament also calls on the Member States, in association with higher education or vocational training establishments, to propose more flexible ways of organising study courses, for example by increasing the provision of distance learning and the possibilities for part-time study and by allowing more adults to continue their education, as part of lifelong learning.
In addition to that, Member States should establish a national "certification" scheme for the identification of higher education or vocational training establishments at which student life and family life may be combined.
Exchange of best practice and possible reform of education systems
MEPs recommend to the Member States, Council and Commission that in the Open Coordination Method and meetings of education ministers and social services ministers, they exchange best practice concerning support for students with family responsibilities and take account of innovative arrangements in this area which some European countries have introduced.
The report also calls on the "Member States to consider, with reference to their national situation, whether a reform of their education system to encourage flexibility and better management of time spent in education would have the effect of enabling young people to begin their working lives at an earlier stage and achieve their desire for parenthood".
MEPs also adopted an amendment, where they submit "that the principle of shared parental responsibility could also apply to young women and men living together on some basis, specific to each country, other than official marriage".

Integrated strategy at national and European level needed to tackle juvenile delinquency
2007-06-21 - 16:22
The European Parliament stresses in an own-initiative report adopted today that juvenile delinquency can be effectively combated only by adopting an integrated strategy at national and European level, which will use three guiding principles: prevention, judicial and extrajudicial measures (and the social inclusion of all young people. The MEPs want the Commission to set up an integrated Community framework programme. The report was adopted by 440 votes for, 64 against and 71 abstentions. In the report drafted by Katerina BATZELI (PES, EL), the MEPs note that juvenile delinquency is becoming a matter for concern since it has assumed huge proportions and because delinquency is starting at a younger age, MEPs believe that it is only possible to combat this phenomenon with an integrated strategy at national and European level. Policies at national level The report stresses that it is crucially important for all stakeholders in society to be directly involved in the planning and implementation of an integrated national strategy. MEPs believe that effective combating of juvenile delinquency calls for an integrated and effective school, social, family and educational policy which will help to ensure that social and civic values are passed on and that young people adjust to society at an early age. It is also necessary to adopt a policy geared to greater economic and social cohesion and to reducing social inequalities, and countering social exclusion and poverty, especially child poverty. The report stresses that the guiding principles for any policy need to be: prevention, judicial and extrajudicial measures and the social inclusion of all young people. MEPs also emphasise the specific role the family plays in all stages of this fight against juvenile delinquency and ask the Member States to develop adequate support for parents. They note that in certain cases there is a need for parents to be involved to a greater extent and to be made more aware of their responsibilities. MEPs also propose various measures, e.g. one-year parental leave, special training for teachers in the management of heterogeneous classes, conflict management guidelines and a (European) "road map" for the media involving a ban on the broadcasting of extremely violent images at certain times of the day. Actions at European level The Member States should, MEPs believe, in cooperation with the Commission, draw up and adopt immediately a number of minimum standards and guiding principles common to all Member States. The objective of a European approach should be to define models for intervention to deal with and manage juvenile delinquency, while recourse to custodial measures and punishment should constitute the last resort and be implemented only when judged to be absolutely necessary. The Commission should provide funding for preventive measures under existing Community programmes and should create a new budget heading for integrated actions and networks to combat juvenile delinquency and to contribute to the social integration of all young people. A helpline for missing children and a free Europe-wide telephone hotline for children and young people with problems are also called for. Once the necessary studies have been completed, the Commission is asked to propose an integrated Community framework programme with Community preventive measures, support for NGO initiatives and transnational cooperation and the funding of pilot programmes at regional and local level, which will be based on best national practices, will attempt to disseminate these practices throughout Europe and will also cover social and educational infrastructure requirements.

MEPs debate the situation in the Middle East
2007-06-21 - 16:22
Following the recent deterioration and violence in Gaza, MEPs turned their attention to the situation in the Middle East. MEPs expressed diverse views with many condemning the violence in the Gaza strip. The House will vote on a resolution during the July Strasbourg plenary (9-12 July). European Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering said: "We have all been profoundly moved and disturbed by the terrible situation and frightening developments over the past days in the Gaza Strip. As you are aware, I expressly chose the Middle East as the destination of my first official visit outside the EU, and I was in the region three weeks ago.
My meeting with the President of the Palestinian Authority Mahmoud Abbas was to have taken place in Ramallah. Due to the increasing strife between Fatah and Hamas, President Abbas invited me to visit him in his headquarters in Gaza where he was engaged in negotiations. I responded to this request and exactly three weeks ago today I spoke with President Abbas in Gaza.
I was struck by the calm decisiveness with which President Abbas conveyed to me his concerns. Outside his offices I could feel the tension in the air. I wish to emphasise that I strongly condemn the violent attacks by Hamas militia against the legitimate security forces of the institutions of the Palestinian Authority. I wish to recommend to you that we express our full support for and solidarity with President Abbas.
We support the decision of the Palestinian President to respond to the extraordinary situation by naming a new emergency government so that the political crisis in the Palestinian Territories can be brought to an end as quickly as possible. We have great confidence in the new Prime Minister, Mr Salam Fayyad, who recently visited me in Brussels, and in his undisputed leadership ability. I wish to restate this confidence to the new Prime Minister today.
The new government faces a difficult challenge and will need the committed assistance of the European Union and the international community. In tune with the conclusions of yesterday's Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg, I would like to state clearly today that the European Parliament fully backs all efforts at bringing peace to the Middle East and will continue to work for this goal in a convinced manner, both in word and deed.
At the opening of the plenary session of the European Parliament yesterday, it was decided to have a full debate on EU Middle East policy during our July session, followed by our conclusions. In view of the current instability and the constantly evolving situation in the region, I believe this is the right decision.
However, this does not mean that we will passively observe developments. The European Union, including the European Parliament, must give the lead in a renewed engagement with the Palestinian people and their representatives.
Dear colleagues, we must face up to our own responsibilities. We must do everything within our power to ensure that humanitarian conditions can be restored within the Palestinian Territories. We must support the Palestinian people to cope with their most urgent needs of this time, but we must also work to develop a long-term political perspective.
We should welcome that the Council yesterday decided to reactivate normal contacts with the Palestinian Authority. In this context, the European Union decided to take the necessary measures so that efficient and transparent direct financial assistance can recommence, including help to build up functioning institutions. The aims of the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy, including police cooperation, will be brought forward. The European Parliament, which has a decision-making role on the EU budget, will lend its full support to this.
Above and beyond these measures, we in the European Parliament must appeal to the Palestinians to renew their commitment to the path of dialogue so that the necessary reconciliation can be achieved within the prospect of a viable Palestinian State which unifies the Palestinian Territories. It is in nobody's interest that the civil war is prolonged or escalated.
There can also be no peace without Israeli involvement. Israel has a great responsibility. During my visit to Israel, and above all in my speech before the Knesset, I stressed very clearly that the European Parliament called on Israel to exercise its political responsibility and unequivocally support President Abbas.
In this context I would like to repeat my insistence that Israel, which for months has withheld Palestinian customs duties in the region of 800 million US dollars, to release this money to President Abbas. The Israeli Government declared its willingness to do so, now they must deliver on this rapidly. The European Union must be a trustworthy intermediary and I see it as a challenge to the European Parliament to follow this in a responsible manner.
Israelis and Palestinians have the same dignity. They both have the same right to live within secure borders. I hope that the day will come when Palestinians and Israelis will be able to live peacefully together. The European Parliament, as the representatives of the peoples of Europe, must in a committed and responsible manner support a policy of reconciliation and understanding, even if that may seems very far away from us today."
Political group speakers
José Ignacio SALAFRANCA SÁNCHEZ-NEYRA (EPP-ED, ES) said that the situation in the Middle East constituted a "very serious political, economic, social and humanitarian crisis." and that "we have to try to solve the international standstill on Palestinians since Hamas won the elections. Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra added that "progress can only be made by denouncing violence and recognising the state of Israel" and "without unity, we will not be able to realise this dream of a viable Palestinian state. It is "now time to put down weapons" and for the EU to "make a contribution to a first sustainable peace in the Middle East."
Martin SCHULZ (DE), for the PES group, said that "there is only once path possible" and that "history has proven that dialogue can show a way out of violence." Mr Schulz added that "we have to involve all forces, we have to bring everybody round the table" and we need to "be a bit more honest with ourselves." The EU's task is "not to send European soldiers to Israel", and it is "unacceptable" that "we don't have the money to provide humanitarian aid, but we do have money to send soldiers there."
Graham WATSON (UK), for the ALDE group, said that "a two-state Palestine is emerging, riddled with conflict and fear, while a two-state solution is increasingly further away." He stressed that "unless we want civil war to triumph over unity, both sides have to face the facts", and added that "a heavy dose of pragmatism is now required."
"The EU must not be prepared to take a back seat", Mr Watson continued, because "politics and politics alone can create the prospects for peace in the Middle East" and that the international community together must "work to foster peace in the region."
Brian CROWLEY (UEN, IE) spoke of "the failure...of both Israel and Palestine to live up to their commitments", adding that "a two-state solution must be based on viability... [and] equality."
Mr Crowley went on to say that "to think that what happened in Gaza with Hamas was an accident is to misread our own failures" to deal with the situation. Mr Crowley said that "now we have been given a new opportunity to show courage in the face of death and disaster."
Daniel COHN-BENDIT (Greens/EFA, DE) said that his group agreed with the analysis made by the Council. The Palestinians and the Israelis, he said, were paying the bitter price for this instability. The EU, he said, must galvanise itself and take the lead as neither the US or Russia could do this. The EU, he said, should organise an international conference as there was a danger that Iran would fill the vacuum in Gaza. Finally, Mr Cohn Bendit said that Israel's policies of "occupation and fences" would never work. The Israelis should enter into negotiations with the new Palestinian government.
Francis WURTZ (GUE/NGL, FR) said that appeals to end the violence were ineffective as the Israeli government benefited from "total impunity from the International community". The Palestinians were suffering from permanent humiliation. The international community's policies were bearing fruit in Gaza.
Bastiaan BELDER (IND/DEM, NL) said that so called "unity government had suffered a bloody divorce". Hamas he said, had refused to recognise Israel and was carrying out a policy of permanent destabilisation. The bold words on a two - state solution were not being respected. It was necessary, he said, to work together with Israel.
Andreas MÖLZER (ITS, AT) said the Gaza was effectively "a prison" and the Palestinians were suffering terrible conditions. There had been multiple failures in the past but now the EU must come to the forefront. It was a mistake, he said, not to have recognised the democratically elected Hamas-led government.

Aid to Palestine through the MEDA programme
2007-06-21 - 16:22
In adopting an own initiative report on financial support to Palestine, the House says that even if the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership has not as yet produced the expected benefits and has not contributed to the lowering of tensions in the area to its full potential, improvements can still be made and thus the Barcelona Process continues to be the appropriate framework for Mediterranean policy, in which changes and the necessary political will are needed to obtain better results. The House recalls its resolution of 1 June 2006 on the humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territories and the role of the EU in which it called on the Commission and the Council to develop a temporary international mechanism (TIM) in order to avoid a major humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territories. MEPs recall having welcomed, following the recommendations of the European Council and the Quartet in June 2006, the setting-up by the EU of the TIM for the Palestinian Authority and its subsequent renewal.
The House notes that this financial stopgap measure made it possible, in a transparent manner and in partnership with the President of the Palestinian Authority, to limit the most egregious humanitarian suffering caused by the freezing of European and international financial aid, Israel’s partial payment of Palestinian customs revenues and the general impossibility of developing a viable economy in the current occupation situation.
MEPs underline that payments under TIM did not go to, or through, the Office of the President of the Palestinian Authority or the Ministry of Finance, but provided for direct payment of invoices, or cash payment to the individual beneficiaries of allocations. Parliament notes that allocations did not cover security staff or political level.
Finally, the EP regrets however, that this financial assistance did not compensate the tragic situation in Palestine and that the conditions for all economic, social and human aspects have worsened in the past months.
Council decision to resume aid to Palestine
On 18 June, the Council decided that the EU will resume normal relations with the Palestinian Authority immediately. With this objective, the EU will develop the conditions for urgent practical and financial assistance including direct financial support to the government; support to the Palestinian Civilian Police through the resumption of the EUPOL COPPS mission; the resumption of the activities of the EU Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM) Rafah; and intensive efforts to build the institutions of the future Palestinian state. MEPs welcome the Council decision of 18 June asking the EU to resume normal relations with the Palestinian Authority immediately and to this objective to develop the conditions for urgent practical and financial assistance including direct financial support to the new government as well as to ensure the provision of emergency and humanitarian assistance to the population of Gaza (via especially TIM).

MEPs call to re-launch energy dialogue with Russia
2007-06-21 - 16:22
The future partnership and cooperation agreement (PCA) with Russia - the current one expiring in December 2007 - should include a meaningful energy dimension to safeguard Europe's energy supplies from its primary source of oil and gas, says the European Parliament in an own-initiative report on economic and trade relations with Russia adopted today with a large majority. The European Parliament insists that Russia ratifies the European Energy Charter. "In addition to the need for Russia to ratify the European Energy Charter, the EU should consider negotiating a formal framework document on energy relations with Russia in the context of the new PCA" , says the House in an own-initiative report by Godelieve Quisthoudt-Rowohl (EPP-ED, DE).
The current partnership agreement expires in December 2007 and negotiations on a new one have reached deadlock, as illustrated by recent disputes at the Samara summit of 17-18 May. The EU remains highly dependent for its energy on the Russian Federation, taking 63% of the latter's oil exports and 62% of its natural gas exports.
The interruption of gas supplies to Ukraine at the beginning of 2006 and of oil to Lithuania at the start of 2007 are weighing heavily on EU-Russia relations. MEPs call on Moscow "to offer fair and non-discriminatory treatment to all its partners". They also call for investment to modernise Russia's nuclear power stations.
Concern over climate for investment in Russia
MEPs note that the EU is open to investment from Russia. They therefore consider it "highly problematic" that foreign companies operating in the natural resource sectors in Russia are not granted the same degree of access.
The House expresses its concern over the nationalistic and monopolistic trends in the management of Russian energy resources. (Par 43)
In particular, MEPs voice concern at "the bill recently introduced in the Russian Federation, which allows the government to reject foreign bids for majority stakes in Russian companies, thus prohibiting foreign ownership of more than 49% […] in 39 strategic industries". They believe this measure risks damaging Russia's attraction to European investors, who are its main source of capital. MEPs also want to see increased efforts in the fight against corruption.
The report acknowledges that it is important for the EU that Russia should join the WTO but stresses that this "must not result in higher levels of import duties and stronger protectionism".
Intellectual property rights and Polish meat
According to the House, the Russian court system needs to be adapted "in order to effectively protect intellectual property rights", in particular to combat the production and sale of counterfeit pharmaceutical products.
Russia's embargo on Polish meat has become another source of friction between Europe and Russia. MEPs urge the EU "to find a common solution to problems with exports to the Russian market", specifically relating to health and plant health issues. Russia is an important market for agricultural exports - meat, fish and dairy products - from several EU Member States.

Broad support for EU Competition Policy
2007-06-21 - 16:22
Parliament has adopted a report on the EU’s competition policy in 2005, welcoming the Commission’s moves to modernise competition policy, in particular its reinforced stance on targeting cartels and unauthorised state aid, as well as the sectoral enquires launched by Commissioner Neelie Kroes. The report, drawn up by Elisa Ferreira (PES, PT), welcomes the Commission’s economic rather than rules-based approach, and the efforts to improve the quality of enforcement of decisions. It calls for further progress in reducing differences of interpretation by national courts, and suggests setting up a network of judicial authorities, similar to that already linking competition authorities – the European Competition Network.
Among other points, the report :
repeats Parliament’s call for clarification of the application of competition rules to services of general economic interest;
asserts that certain taxation practices in some Swiss cantons could have the effect of distorting competition and calls on Member States to continue dialogue with Switzerland with a view to it participating in the Code of Conduct for Business Taxation;
expresses concern at the relative failure to achieve genuine competition in energy markets especially in a situation where markets open to new players might facilitate environmental progress; suggests that progress would be welcome in reviewing the “two-thirds rule” which governs whether national or European competition authorities deal with a particular case;
stresses the need to avoid competition and duplication between Member States’ state aid schemes;
notes that EC competition policy should focus on aid practices of third countries which might favour competitors to EU firms in globalised markets, while preferring a cooperative, mutual recognition approach rather than subsidy competition.

Fiscalis 2013 – cooperation between national tax authorities
2007-06-21 - 16:22
MEPs gave a first reading to the EU’s new programme to facilitate cooperation between national tax authorities over the next six years, Fiscalis 2013. They are proposing a number of changes aimed at enhancing transparency of the scheme, and also want to limit it to EU Member States, where the Commission was proposing to include countries participating in the EU’s Neighbourhood Policy too. Following on from a previous programme in the same field, Fiscalis 2013 aims to provide a forum for increasing knowledge and exchange of best practice between national tax authorities, to enhance the fights against fraud and illegitimate trade by strengthening cooperation and mutual assistance, including via computer information exchange systems and to help cut red tape for taxpayers by looking at the optimal balance between controls and the administrative burden they cause.
The proposed budget for Fiscalis 2013 is around €157m.
The rapporteur on the programme is Hans-Peter MARTIN (NA, AT).

MEPs say that broadband can help bridge the digital divide
2007-06-21 - 16:22
Rolling out broadband Internet connections to bring e-government, e-health, or e-learning on-line services to remote or rural areas like Greek islands or Andalusian mountains is vital to making Europe a world-leading knowledge-based economy. In an own-initiative report adopted by MEPs on broadband policy options, the European Parliament sets out measures to bridge the "digital divide" between urban and rural areas. At the end of 2006, 28% of all households within the EU27 had broadband internet access at home, says the Commission's latest Eurobarometer 'E-Communications household survey'. Measured by numbers of broadband lines rolled out, Europe has been ahead of the USA since October 2005. However, internet connection performance varies markedly across Europe, with some connections carrying more data, and faster, than others. Whereas in the Netherlands and Denmark broadband is quite common, very few households in Greece, Cyprus, Slovakia, and Romania have access to this technology.
A critical mass of 500 million users
Broadband availability is limited, especially in inaccessible and rural areas like islands and mountains, because the low demand outside metropolitan centres discourages service providers. Yet the report by Gunnar Hökmark (EPP-ED, SE) points out that a single market of nearly 500 million people with broadband connections would create "a globally unique critical mass of users", helping Europe to become "a world leading knowledge-based economy".
MEPs note that it is precisely in the EU's less-developed regions that broadband internet connections may contribute most to "more sophisticated, inclusive" health-care and education systems, by enabling distance-diagnosis and distance-healing as well as distance-learning applications in regions that lack a satisfactory school infrastructure. The report as approved by the European Parliament calls on Member States to promote broadband connections at every school, university and educational centre in the EU "with a view to a future where 'no European child and no individual involved in educational programmes is left off line in Europe'".
Invest in broadband, but don't distort the market
Improving broadband infrastructure should therefore be a special priority for the use of EU structural and rural funds. MEPs believe that these funds could also be used for upgrading or replacing broadband networks that do not provide connections with "suitable functional capacity". Nevertheless, the report also calls on the Commission to closely examine whether the EU regulatory framework is fully implemented and whether state aid rules are applied whenever those funds are used for broadband investments. EU funding should not favour specific players or technological options, but "only the most efficient solutions" and should only be permitted "in under-served areas". The EU's role would be to provide "a regulatory framework that invites competition and private investment" and by the use of relevant funds to drive demand for broadband services.
The House also urges the Community institutions and Member States to work with industry to solve problems (such as micro-payments, security and trust, interoperability and Digital Rights Management) that hamper the development of new business models in the broadband field.
Ensure equal access for service providers, stimulate competition
The Commission should ensure that all service providers have equal access to any broadband networks that have been rolled out with the help of EU structural and rural funds. The House therefore advocates a "functional unbundling of access networks of market incumbents from their operating activities", so as to ensure fair and equal treatment of all operators. Moreover, for MEPs it is "imperative" that national regulators, competition authorities, national and local governments promote "more vigorous competition and investment in broadband markets". They should also take legal measures against abuses of dominant positions and cartels.

MEPs call to ban mercury imports and exports by 2010
2007-06-21 - 16:22
Parliament approved with amendments a draft regulation on the banning of exports and the safe storage of mercury. MEPs voted for the proposed ban on exports to be brought forward to 1 December 2010 and for stricter rules on storage. They also voted for an import ban, which was not included in the Commission's draft legislation. The House approved the first-reading report drafted by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL, EL) for the Environment Committee by 673 votes to 14, with 9 abstentions.
As a result of the MEPs' vote:
- the ban on exports of mercury would now start on 1 December 2010, one year earlier than the Commission proposed;
- in addition to metallic mercury, the ban would also cover products containing mercury which may not be sold in Europe and also mercury compounds (e.g. cinnabar ore and calomel and other mercury compounds with a mercury concentration of above 5% by weight, but not mercury sulphide);
- an import ban on mercury would start on 1 July 2010 (no import ban was proposed by the Commission);
- tougher conditions on storage would be required when the ban comes into effect.
MEPs voted for any storage of mercury to be temporary, pending its final disposal. Whereas the Commission had proposed using an underground salt mine for this purpose, MEPs voted for an underground salt mine or an above-ground facility to be used. They also said that, under the polluter-pays principle, the owner of the storage facility must be responsible for safety.
Parliament suggests examining the possibility of using a site at Almadén, Spain, as the chief storage depot. As this site was until 2003 the biggest mercury mine in Europe (it is now disused), MEPs argue that it would be a good idea to use it now for the storage of mercury to assist the economy of the region.
Uses and hazards of mercury
Mercury can come from waste recycling (e.g. fluorescent lamps, batteries), natural gas cleaning or the industrial treatment of non-ferrous metals. It is used above all in the chlor-alkali industry, which has undertaken to convert towards techniques that are less dangerous to health and the environment; the old methods produce large quantities of highly toxic calomel (mercurous chloride).
Mercury is highly toxic to humans, especially when transformed into methylmercury. It is also bio-accumulative, meaning that it concentrates in the food chain. Numerous scientific studies blame it for cardiovascular and immune-system ailments. Above all it can affect the brain development of unborn children, even in minimal doses.
Mercury use is declining both in the EU and globally. Global demand is around 3,400 tonnes per year, with the EU-15 accounting for 440 tonnes in 2005.
Globally, the main uses of mercury are in small-scale gold mining, the chlor-alkali industry and production of vinyl-chloride monomer, the basis of PVC plastic. In the EU only the chlor-alkali industry remains a significant user, and it is progressively phasing out the use of mercury-containing cells in its production of chlorine.
EU legislation on mercury
In March 2006 Parliament adopted a resolution on a general strategy for mercury put forward by the Commission (see link below). The draft regulation on exports and storage is a specific application of the general strategy.
A separate regulation introducing restrictions on measuring instruments containing mercury, such as thermometers and barometers, comes before Parliament's plenary in July.

Midway point of MDGs: the EP wants Member States to honour their promises
2007-06-21 - 16:22
The EP commends the Member States that have reached or exceeded the 0.7% ODA/GNI target and those that are increasing their aid levels, but regrets that some EU-15 countries have missed the interim 0.33% target in 2006. The report drafted by Glenys Kinnock (PES, UK) on the midway point of the Millennium Development Goals has been adopted by 507 in favour, 64 against and 119 abstentions. The House regrets that at the recent G8 Summit in Heiligendamm, leaders failed to do enough to guarantee their promises to Africa. Although the G8 reiterated their 2005 pledge to increase ODA to Africa by EUR 18.6bn a year by 2010, the G8 did not commit to an accountable timetable for delivering these aid promises (AM 2).
Italy missed the 0.33% target by wide margin, with its aid in 2006 amounting to only 0.2% of its national income, after a 30% drop in real aid levels. Portugal - due to host the EU-Africa Summit during its Presidency in 2007 -, achieved only 0.21% ODA/GNI in 2006.
The worst inflators of aid are Austria (57%), France (52%), Italy (44%), Germany (53%) and the UK (28%). Germany, which holds the Presidencies of both the EU and G8, would not have reached the target of 0.33% ODA/GNI without inflating its aid, notes the report.
The report calls on the Commission and Member States to exclude spending on debt relief from aid reporting, in line with what was decided in Monterrey in 2002.
The EP calls on the developing countries to improve their own prosperity potential by instituting programmes of economic liberalisation, especially in the area of property rights, which would release at a stroke substantial capital for immediate investment.
EDF and EIB
On the European Development Fund, the EP calls on the Commission to ensure that funds will be available during the probable transitional period (2008–2010), i.e. before the 10th EDF is ratified by all 27 Member States (most likely in 2010). The EU could decide to implement new forms of funding MDGs such as through the European Investment Bank (EIB), according to the report. The EP also calls on the EIB to ensure that the same political accountability is extended to Parliament on the funding of such projects as for other EIB operations.
China
MEPs urge the EU and the G8 to recognise the growing importance of new donors, and in particular China, and to engage these new donors in a dialogue on approaches and standards for external assistance, including the importance of applying internationally agreed norms and standards in aid implementation.
Healthcare
The House urges the EU to continue to be at the vanguard of efforts to support sexual and reproductive health rights by maintaining levels of funding for the implementation of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) Programme.
MEPs believe that health care infrastructure deserves stable and long term financial support from national budgets and international assistance in order to deliver on the health-related MDGs : reducing infant mortality by increasing immunization coverage, reducing maternal mortality by increasing access to skilled professionals, supporting research and development of and access to new diagnostics and therapies, providing safe drinking water and sanitation, and scaling up significantly towards the goal of universal access to prevention, treatment, care and support of HIV/AIDS, Malaria, TB and other diseases by 2010, including for marginalized populations and those most vulnerable to infectious diseases.
EPAs and access to medicines
MEPs believe that pharmaceutical-related TRIPS affecting public health and access to medicines which go beyond the TRIPS Agreement should be excluded from EPAs and other future bilateral or regional agreements with low-income countries.

Work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly - MEPs want a strong position on Zimbabwe
2007-06-21 - 16:22
In adopting an own initiative report on the work of the African Caribbean Pacific - European Union Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA), MEPs urge the JPA to adopt a strong common position concerning the failure of democracy, rule of law, human rights and the economic system in Zimbabwe and to insist that international travel bans on key figures in the Zimbabwean regime are fully respected. The next meeting of the JPA takes place in Wiesbaden Germany from 23 June to 28 June. The situation in Zimbabwe is on the agenda and the JPA will vote on a resolution on this topic.
The report calls upon the Commission to honour its commitment without delay on the basis of the procedure applied in the case of the regulation establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation.
The Assembly met twice in the course of 2006. The 11th session was held at Vienna (Austria) from 17 to 22 June and the 12th session was held at Bridgetown (Barbados) from 18 to 23 November. 2006 is the first year in which the sessions were reversed. Nine resolutions were adopted in that year, and there were seven joint delegations. In the course of its proceedings the Assembly welcomed not only the successive Co-Presidents of the ACP-EU Council but also the Members of the Commission responsible for development and humanitarian aid and for trade.
The report calls upon the ACP countries’ national parliaments strongly to urge their governments and the Commission to ensure that they, in collaboration with civil society organisations, are constantly involved in the programming, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the national strategy documents relating to cooperation between the EU and their country (2008-2013 period)
MEPs also regret the use of voting in separate colleges, which led to the rejection of the resolution on East Africa at the Bridgetown Session, even though a majority of the Assembly members supported the resolution.

Employment policy
Minimum standards for supplementary pension rights
2007-06-21 - 16:22
Demographic change and population ageing are making supplementary pension schemes an increasingly important way to secure decent living standards in old age. A new directive aims to facilitate workers' mobility within and across Member States by setting minimum standards for the acquisition and preservation of supplementary pension rights. According to the first-reading report by Ria OOMEN-RUIJTEN (EPP-ED, NL), the proposed directive should apply to all schemes that offer supplementary pensions for workers, e.g. group insurance contracts, pay-as-you-go schemes agreed by one or more branches or sectors, funded schemes or pension promises backed by book reserves.
Member States would be affected quite differently by this new legislation. In some Member States there are no supplementary pension schemes at all, in others the coverage is quite low (e.g. in Poland with only 0.6 % of the working age population). In Sweden, on the other hand, around 75 % of all workers between 20 and 64 are members of occupational pension schemes.
Acquisition conditions
The European Parliament strives for common minimum standards for acquiring supplementary pension rights. For example, MEPs set a maximum "vesting" period of five years i.e. after at most five years in a job employees will have acquired rights that have to be paid or preserved after the termination of their employment. Currently some schemes in France and the majority of schemes in Portugal foresee vesting only at the moment of retirement if the workers still belong to the company at the time.
Moreover, the report states that no vesting conditions shall be applied to members of a scheme once they have reached the age of 25. In Germany, for instance, the current minimum age is 30 years. MEPs also emphasised that if the employee has not yet acquired vested pension rights when the employment is terminated, all the contributions paid, or their investment value if the worker bears the risk, should be reimbursed.
Fair treatment of dormant pension rights
The EP calls on Member States to take measures to ensure that outgoing workers can retain their vested pension rights in the respective scheme. Member States shall also guarantee "fair treatment" of those dormant pension rights, says the text. The value of dormant rights should, therefore, generally develop in line with that of the rights of active members. MEPs underline that the values of dormant rights should be adjusted in accordance with, for example, inflation rates, salary levels, current pensions or the return on investment intended by the supplementary pension provider. At present, it is only in Ireland and the United Kingdom that former employees have the guarantee that their dormant rights are protected against inflation by adjusting them up to a certain ceiling.
Member States may also allow supplementary pension schemes to pay a capital sum to former employees instead of preserving their rights. This sum should be equivalent to the value of the vested pension rights and should be paid to the worker as long as it does not exceed the threshold established by the Member State.
Gradual improvement of the transferability of vested pension rights
The Parliament took a more cautious approach to the transferability of pension rights and spoke against the Commission's proposal to include this right into the new directive. The Commission proposed that workers should be able to transfer their vested rights to their new employer. In some countries like Spain and Finland, a transfer of occupational pension rights is currently not possible at all. In others such as Denmark, Ireland, Italy and Sweden, transfer is internally possible, but cross-border transfer might be hindered by taxation rules or is totally forbidden by law in order to prevent tax evasion.
MEPs state that when introducing new supplementary pension schemes, Member States should endeavour to gradually improve the transferability of vested pension rights. They also ask the Commission to draw up a report, no later than five years after the directive takes effect, on the conditions for transferring capital representing workers' supplementary pension rights. This report should be the basis for proposing any amendments to this directive.

Euro
Parliament backs Cyprus and Malta for euro membership
2007-06-21 - 16:22
MEPs voted to support both Cyprus and Malta in adopting the euro on 1 January 2008. They also adopted a resolution seeking a formal agreement with the Council and Commission to improve the way Parliament is consulted on future euro area enlargements. The EU summit will take a political decision on the two countries' applications this week, then the ECOFIN Council will makes its formal decision on the legislation on 10 July. While there was overwhelming support for the applications from Cyprus (585 in favour, 14 against, 90 abstentions) and Malta (610 in favour, 12 against, 74 abstentions), MEPs were concerned that the timetable they were being asked to follow in adopting their opinion was too short. To avoid this happening in future, they adopted - by 552 votes in favour to 37 against and 43 abstentions - a separate resolution urging the Commission and Council to come to a formal inter-institutional agreement with Parliament with a view to ensuring MEPs have at least two months to consider proposals to enlarge the euro area.
They ask that Member States announce their intention of making a formal request to adopt the euro by at the latest the autumn of the year before doing so, and to seek early contact with Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee. They want he Commission to draw up an interim convergence report by the beginning of the year after this pre-announcement, and that steps are taken to ensure the reliability to statistical data presented by the Member States Finally, they insist that any excessive deficit procedure concerning a Member State should be closed before it's compliance with the convergence criteria is formally assessed.
While Parliament's opinions on euro area enlargement are only advisory, the Council cannot take its formal decision until MEPs have adopted their resolution. EU leaders are set to make the political decision on Cyprus and Malta at their summit this week, with the necessary legislation being adopted by Finance Ministers at the 10 July meeting of the ECOFIN Council.
The main criteria set out in the treaty for entering the euro area are to have appropriately adapted all the relevant national legislation and to be in line with the convergence criteria covering inflation, national debt, budget deficits and interest rates. The applicant’s currency should also have been in the Exchange Rate Mechanism II for over two years.

MEPs push for better public procurement
2007-06-21 - 16:22
The EU, over the years, has made substantial efforts to open public procurement markets in the Member States to cross-border competition. To a large extent - and given that a majority of procurement deals comply with EU rules - it has succeeded. However, as the EP concludes in an own-initiative report on transposition and implementation of EU public procurement law, adopted today, there is still room for improvement. As rapporteur Arlene McCarthy (PES, Labour North West UK) points out, "favouritism for national champions and other failures to award contracts on a competitive basis are a continued threat" to the Internal Market. Bearing in mind that public procurement accounts for over 16% of EU GDP, correct transposition and implementation of EU laws in this sphere is a pressing concern.
To date - despite records which show overall improvements in transposition rates in the EU - only twenty Member States have transposed the new public procurement directives. With an eye to this, MEPs consider that the Commission "should be given the human resources to police late and incorrect transposition more effectively". Moreover, they note, Member States should provide the Commission with "sufficient data" on their implementation of EU public procurement law.
MEPs also echo the Commission's concerns about the number of illegal direct awards. These, says the report, occur as a result of: misinterpretations of public procurement rules; errors made in complex procurements; alleged corrupt practices; circumvention of lengthy timescales associated with EU advertising; and unnecessarily elaborate national tendering requirements.
Breaches of EU rules could be reduced, however, if EU countries collaborate more extensively with the Commission, say MEPs, calling - in the same breath - for new advisory agencies to assist contracting authorities in the correct implementation of public procurement rules. Member States, reads the report, should also "coordinate and simplify electronic purchasing techniques to facilitate access to [...] procurements". The Commission, other than showcasing best practices, should encourage EU countries to tackle "transposition and implementation problems" in public procurement, "focusing on illegal direct awards and late or incorrect transposition".
Tomorrow, the EP will vote on a proposal to modify a pair of pre-existing public procurement directives - this, with an aim to ensuring better transparency and more effective review in contract award procedures.

Better transparency in public procurement
2007-06-21 - 16:22
On Thursday, 21 June, the European Parliament adopted a co-decision report on EU public procurement which -- by modifying a pair of existing directives -- is set to ensure better transparency and more effective review in procedures for awarding contracts. At the centre of the co-decision report on "Review procedures concerning the award of public contracts", drafted by Jean-Claude Fruteau (recently elected to the French National Assembly) (PES, FR), lies the idea of a so-called "standstill period".: a period allowing effective review between the decision to award a contract and its conclusion. Such a provision is, among other things, expected to encourage economic operators to pursue public award contracts in other EU Member States.
The Commission had proposed that, under the "standstill" clause, authorities must suspend the conclusion of an awarded public contract for at least 10 days from the date when the contract award decision is sent to relevant tenderers. MEPs voted to retain this minimum period in cases where such notification is made by fax or electronic means. In instances where notification is made by other means, however, it extended it to 15 days.
In line with a Council-EP compromise agreement, Member States, in turn, must ensure that review procedures allow for measures - such as suspending the procedure for the award of a public contract or awarding damages - to correct alleged infringements or to prevent further damage to the interests at stake.
The infringement of the standstill period or the suspensive effect, MEPs decided, will lead to the contract being rendered ineffective. Member States may derogate from this by applying alternative sanctions: by levying fines, or shortening the duration of the contract. Illegal direct awards, on the other hand, will have to be rendered ineffective in every case.
Having entered into negotiations with the Council Presidency prior to the vote in plenary, MEPs secured a first-reading agreement on the dossier. The Council, therefore, is expected to back the Parliament's amendments and to adopt the legislation without further changes. EU countries will then have 24 months (after the publication of the directive in the Official Journal) to bring its provisions into force.

Budget
Galileo - MEPs say it should be financed in full from EU money
2007-06-21 - 16:22
In adopting a joint resolution on the financing of the European programme of satellite radio-navigation(Galileo), MEPs consider that the Galileo programme should be financed in full from the Union's budget. The House also points out that the Commission must present a revised proposal for a regulation on the financing of the Galileo programme, which must be agreed upon by Parliament and the Council in codecision. MEPs will oppose any solution which would combine Community funding with additional intergovernmental funding.
The European Parliament expresses its concern at the possibility that the additional financing necessary to fill the gap following the failure of the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) could be agreed on an intergovernmental basis.
The House reminds the Council and Commission that the multi-annual financial framework contains an amount of roughly €1 billion foreseen for the operational expenditure of Galileo for the period 2007-2013 and that the financial reference amount under the amended proposal for a regulation on the implementation of the deployment and commercial operating phases of the European programme of satellite radionavigation is €1,005 billion at current prices;
The House reiterates its support for the Galileo programme, which is of an enormous European added value, and expresses its strong support for continuing it under EU responsibility.
Finally, the House is of the opinion that if the public sector assumes the complete financing of the project, as well as taking over some or all of the risks and liabilities, this factor should be taken into account in a future revised concession contract, especially as regards the reimbursement mechanism for public financial contributions and the prices of services.

MEPs urge adoption of a legal framework to combat racism and xenophobia
2007-06-21 - 16:22
The European Parliament adopted a report on taking effective action racism and xenophobia in all Member States. MEPs say that minimum harmonisation at European level is needed to defend one of EU's most important common values. MEPs evaluate the progress of negotiations conducted at Council on this framework decision and expect to be formally re-consulted by Council in the coming months on the basis of the political agreement reached by Ministers of Justice last 19 April. The aim of the draft decision as it stands now is to ensure that all Member States will impose harmonised criminal sanctions -from one to three years of prison- to any public incitement to violence and hatred against persons of a different race, colour, religion, national or ethnic descendent, dissemination of writings with such content, public approval, denial or gross trivialisation of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.
The draft legislation does not forbid specific symbols per se --such as swastikas-- and does not mention specific historic events, but it appeals to the definitions of war crimes or genocide contained in the Statute of the International Criminal Court and the Nuremberg Tribunal of 1945.
Parliament's report aims to send a strong political message on the need to ratify this framework decision as soon as possible and recommends Council to "recognise" in the final text the fact that "some Member States have criminalised the denial or flagrant trivialisation of genocide" like the holocaust.
Criminal sanctions should be more severe in the case of public figures and representatives of the authorities, as their status should constitute an aggravating circumstance, MEPs stressed in the text. Other recommendations by Parliament are focussed on fixing common definitions on terms such as "racist and xenophobic offences" or "public order offence".
The Chamber finally requested EU governments to issue an evaluation report on this framework decision at the latest three years after it enters into force.
The fact that this legislation will be a framework decision implies that the general provisions adopted by the EU will have to be transposed into different national laws afterwards, allowing Member States the necessary degree of flexibility to maintain their specific constitutional traditions regarding the right to freedom of expression.

EP calls for support an International Arms Trade Treaty
2007-06-21 - 16:22
In adopting a joint resolution on the establishment of common international standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional weapons, MEPs calls on all 153 States which voted for the UN resolution, which included all the EU Member States, to send their submissions supporting an Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) to the UN Secretary General without further delay. MEPs urge the Council to devise a programme of activities using various international fora, including NATO, the OSCE and the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, to encourage States to send in their submissions.
The House urges all States to emphasise in their submissions that the ATT should codify existing obligations under international law with respect to arms transfers, and especially those covering human rights and humanitarian law.
MEPs call upon all States, pending the adoption of an ATT, to take efficient measures to stop the irresponsible brokering and transportation of arms, ammunition and associated military and security equipment of all types, including components and dual-use items, as well as the transfer and licensing of foreign production of such equipment to parties subject to international arms embargoes or who persistently commit serious violations of international human rights law or international humanitarian law.
The House calls in this context on all Member States to transpose the provisions of the EU Common Position on Arms Brokering into national law in order to maximise the efficiency of efforts to halt irresponsible arms brokering.
MEPs categorically denounce trade in arms and ammunition in violation of United Nations Security Council arms embargoes and recognises that the transport of such goods primarily takes place by air.
Finally, the European Parliament calls upon EU Member States to enhance their cooperation with other States in this area. The House calls upon the competent international organisations and the appropriate regional organisations to recommend, in coordination with the air transport industry, appropriate preventive measures.
