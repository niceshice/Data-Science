Booking: prices and green options could soon be clearer Clearer information on taxes and surcharges and more information on greener travel options are just two of the proposed benefits of an overhaul of the rules that govern computerised reservation systems across Europe. These systems are widely used by travel agents and for online booking. Operated jointly by airlines, travel agents and car hire firms the current code of conduct is not felt to be strong enough. MEPs will debate a new regulation late Wednesday.
"Travel agents and consumers will be better protected from market abuse and distortion...through tougher safeguards," British Conservative Timothy Kirkhope, who prepared a report for parliament told us. His report outlines two areas where change is required:
All inclusive information on prices: computerised systems ought to display all applicable taxes, charges, surcharges and fees to be paid by the traveller. This would bring more flexibility and fiercer competition between systems and protection from any market abuse or distortion. New rules could bring the prices of airline tickets down by 10%, says the Commission.
More options for environmentally-conscious passengers: In the future such systems should also include easily comparable information on the environmental impact of a journey, such as the CO2 emissions per person and fuel consumption per person. For air journeys of up to 90 minutes, possible train options will automatically be displayed.

"Consumers should get more choice and a better service from their travel agents."
