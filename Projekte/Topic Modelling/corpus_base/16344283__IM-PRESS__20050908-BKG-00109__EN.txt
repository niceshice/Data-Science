Debates at the European Parliament on the digital society
Institutions
2005-09-08 - 17:09
In view of the fast-moving developments in the digital society and their far-reaching implications for private and professional life, the European Parliament has decided to hold three separate debates on 12 and 13 September: on blogging, on the Internet as an opportunity for the formation of new political communities and on the use of the Internet as a tool of government information.
Weblogs - competition, challenge or chance? Who's afraid to open Pandora's Blogs?
If anything has skyrocketed in cyberspace it is surely the use of weblogs. At the moment there are some 31 million weblogs, to which some 80,000 new ones are added each day. In spite of - or perhaps because of - its popularity "blogging" raises a host of practical and ethical issues. Probably the most obvious is how to see the wood for the trees or how to separate the sheep from the goats. With 31 million weblogs, how can anyone find those that are reliable and worthwhile, especially since the contents of blogs range from the highly political to the highly personal?
A hot issue in the field of blogging is, of course, its relationship with traditional journalism. Some argue that blogging is the ultimate democratisation of news dissemination. Bloggers may provide information that journalists will not, due to the time constraints, professional conventions or company policies they face. Others will counter that the unfiltered information from blogs will leave people bewildered and is in many cases irrelevant. Moreover, there is no guarantee that bloggers' information is reliable. A provocative question in this respect is whether traditional journalists can also be bloggers.
To these, and other questions, a panel of experts - both bloggers and non-bloggers - will try to find an answer. The panel consists of Richard Corbett, MEP and himself an ardent blogger; Aidan White, the general-secretary of the International Federation of Journalists; Karlin Lillington, technology journalist at the Irish Times and also a blogger; Thomas Burg, editor of BlogTalk.net and former head of the Centre for New Media at the Danube University Krems. The debate will be led by Guido Baumhauer, a journalist at Deutsche Welle.
New political communities on the web - a challenge to politicians?
A remarkable feature during the referendum campaigns on the EU constitution in France and the Netherlands was the extensive - and successful - use made of the web by the 'No' supporters. Equally successful was the web campaign waged by the organisation behind the 'Live8' event and the Global Campaign Against Poverty in the run-up to the G8 summit in July.
This phenomenon raises the question of how effective the internet can be as a political tool and whether it will strengthen established political institutions or weaken them. Should governments and parliaments attempt to take the lead in using the internet as a means of providing political information and stimulating political discussion, or should they encourage others to use the internet as a political forum? Can the web be a useful instrument for governments and parliaments to sense out public opinion and emerging political trends?
The debating panel will take a closer look at the actual campaigns and discuss their implications. The panel consists of Marielle de Sarnez, French MEP and rapporteur on a safer Internet ; Martin Gill, head of New Media at Comic Relief and a contributor to the MakePovertyHistory and Live8 campaign; Guilhem Fouetillou, who as a member of the research group RTGI studied the French "Non" campaign on the web; and Ann Zimmermann, a PhD candidate who has worked on several research projects on internet-based political communication. The panel debates will be led by Bill Hayton, a journalist at BBC World.
E-government - how feasible for countries, how practical for citizens?
Increasingly, national governments and the EU institutions are making an effort to put their information on the web and to make it easier for citizens to cope with administrative procedures, in other words to create an electronic administration. For example, several governments have made it possible to fill in tax returns through the internet. This "e-government" is intended to bring the institutions closer to the citizen. But is every country equally able to bear the cost of such an exercise? And will it in the long run really reduce administrative cost and time or will it merely add another layer to the bureaucratic apparatus?
E-government risks creating a new divide, between those who have access to information technology and those who don't. Other sensitive questions concern the security of government information systems. Is the privacy of personal data sufficiently guaranteed? What will happen in the case of a system break-down or a cyberterrorist attack? Are the information systems sufficiently secure against electronic espionage?
Speakers at this final debate in the series on the digital society will be Alejo Vidal-Quadras, MEP and Vice-President of the European Parliament responsible for information; Ivar Tallo, president of the e-Governance Academy in Estonia; Oliver Ryan, director of the Irish government agency Reach; and William Davies, senior research fellow on digital society at the Institute for Public Policy. The debate will be led by Olivier Da Lage, journalist at Radio France International.
