Conference logo The EU must take the lead and push for global measures to increase renewable energy and energy efficiency when heads of state and government meet in June for the UN "Rio+20" summit on sustainable development and a green economy, MEPs said 29 September. The EP called on EU governments to come up with a common position by November.
The meeting takes place 20 years after the first "Earth Summit", which was also in Rio de Janeiro and was a milestone in raising environmental and climate awareness around the world.
The 2012 UN Conference on Sustainable Development, Rio+20, will focus on:
the green economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication
an institutional framework for sustainable development.
Old hopes, new hopes
During a plenary debate on "Rio+20" on 28 September, Environment Committee head Jo Leinen spoke about the previous Rio summit: "there was a lot of hope (and) we have achieved some things...but the mega trends are still going in the wrong direction."
"The gap between rich and poor has become bigger, we have cut down big areas of forests, we have overfished the seas....Next year in Rio we need a new political will, a new commitment," he said.
What MEPs want
The gist of the EP's resolution is that the EU should take the lead in the Conference on Sustainability and speak with one voice, said German Christian Democrat Karl-Heinz Florenz , who helped guide the proposals through parliament.
MEPs want the summit to set concrete global green economy targets. They are also calling for an end to environmentally-harmful subsidies by 2020.
The EP is calling for raw materials, energy efficiency and forestry to be put on the conference agenda.
MEPs also want the international tax on financial transactions, proposed by last week by the European Commission, to support climate and biodiversity protection in developing countries.
