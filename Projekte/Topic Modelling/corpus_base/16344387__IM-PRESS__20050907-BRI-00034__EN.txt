Keep children safe while browsing the Internet, say MEPs
2005-09-08 - 17:39
The Committee on Culture and Education is calling for action to protect children from inappropriate content on the Internet. Marielle DE SARNEZ (ALDE, FR) will be presenting the draft legislative report on the protection of minors and human dignity, the right of reply and the competitiveness of the European audiovisual and information services industry, MEPs in the committee say action is needed from politicians, the industry, schools and parents.
The committee is recommending the creation of a new top-level domain name ". kid " (like .com or .org) with content reserved for children, which could provide a secure Internet area regularly monitored by an independent authority. MEPs in the committee say the Commission should introduce a European free telephone number providing information on existing filter methods and making it easier to lodge complaints with the relevant authorities or report harmful sites. This is intended to offset the absence in some Member States of such hotlines.
The latest statistics show that young people spend more time on the Internet than watching television. At the same time, there are around 260 million pages with pornographic content circulating on the Internet. According to Ms De Sarnez, information from some Member States (including Ireland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark) shows one young person in three taking part in discussion forums or chat rooms is subject to sexual advances.

European schools
2005-09-08 - 17:39
Referring to the Commission's Communication on the European Schools system, MEPs are to debate an own-initiative report by Mary HONEYBALL (PSE, UK) for the Committee on Culture and Education. The report calls for more European schools, also in new Member States, and urges the establishment of sections in " new " languages at already existing schools. It also prompts a solution for four disputed schools (Bergen/Netherlands, Culham/UK, Karlsruhe/Germany, Mol/Belgium).
The primary purpose of the European schools is to provide education for children of EU officials in their mother tongue. There are currently 13 European schools, with a total budget of some €225m, enrolling 19,500 pupils (including those of non-EU officials). Teachers are appointed by Member States who also pay their national salaries.
The report prompts the Board of Governors to revise the criteria for establishing, maintaining and closing language sections so as to rule out any discrimination against an official language of the EU. It also insists that - " where the necessary criteria are met " - language sections for the languages of the new Member States be established as a matter of urgency.
In parallel, MEPs in the committee call on the Commission to examine the establishing of European schools in new Member States. Since provisions for pupils with special educational needs also vary from one European school to another, the committee calls to fully implement the concept of inclusive education, " as is the case in other schools across Europe ".

Public health
Special medicines for children
2005-09-08 - 17:39
"For far too long Europe's children have been waiting, and parents' and patients' organisations have been calling, for special paediatric medicines. Let's not disappoint them!" This is the appeal made by rapporteur Francoise GROSSETÊTE (EPP-ED, FR), on behalf of the Environment Committee, in a report on paediatric medicines. The aim is an early agreement with the Council at first reading under the co-decision procedure.
Frequently sick children have to take smaller doses of medicines designed for adults, although their organism absorbs or eliminates them differently and there can be particular side effects. Few pharmaceutical companies produce drugs aimed specifically at children, because the clinical trials are more difficult and the time taken to perfect them is longer.
Six months for all
The draft regulation under consideration aims precisely to encourage the pharmaceuticals industry to change its attitude, essentially by extending the life of patents or supplementary protection certificates by six months. MEPs are to debate the merits of this incentive at length. Some would like to make it proportional to the profits earned, shorter in some cases and longer in others.
However, the rapporteur, the Commission and a majority of Member States feared that variable protection regimes might cause insurmountable problems of implementation. In addition, many procedures laid down in the regulation would have had to be reformulated. In the end, no alternative proposal achieved majority support in the committee, which thus positions itself de facto on the side of the Commission's initial text: six months in all cases. There will, however, be one exception: the exclusive commercial rights of "orphan drugs" , intended to treat rare illnesses, will be increased from 10 to 12 years if they are invented specifically for children.
Under current legislation, a medicine covered by a patent and a supplementary protection certificate is protected for a maximum of 15 years. A further six months of protection would, according to Commission estimates and depending on the case, produce extra profits of €800,000 to €9m, compared with the average cost of a clinical trial, which can be as much as €4m.
Stimulating research
The Commission is urged to review the regulation six years after it enters into force and amend it if it has not produced the desired impact, notably on research. But MEPs in the committee want to boost research now by other means. One of their proposed amendments calls for the creation, within a year after the adoption of the regulation, of a special EU programme for research into medicines for children, to be called MICE (Medicines Investigation for the Children of Europe).
To optimise research efforts, the regulation would set up, under the auspices of the European Medicines Agency, a network of researchers and research centres to avoid duplication of research and or tests on children. The agency should also, say MEPs in the committee, compile an inventory of therapeutic needs in the two years after the entry into force of the regulation, and this should seek to establish priorities for research.
The regulation will also set up a Paediatric Committee, the " cornerstone " of the whole edifice, according to Ms Grossetête. MEPs in the committee would like this to be created six months at the latest after the entry into force of the regulation. They want to amend some of the provisions regarding its composition and call for its opinions to be published. These would include opinions on paediatric research plans submitted by companies seeking the extra six months protection.
MEPs in the committee want there to be transparency in the granting of certain derogations provided for in the regulation. Lastly, it should be noted that the regulation not only details the procedures for authorising the marketing of products, the derogations regime and requirements in terms of communication, it also provides for penalties to be imposed on companies that do not comply.

Protecting workers from the risks of optical radiation
2005-09-08 - 17:39
Parliament's contribution to a package of measures to protect workers' health and safety will reach another important stage with the second reading report on the exposure of workers to risks from optical radiation. The report is drafted by Csaba ŐRY (EPP-ED, HU) for Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
Prevention and early diagnosis of damage to the eyes, together with the prevention of long-term health dangers, are the key aims of the directive, which lays down exposure limit values and requires employers to carry out risk assessments. It also includes provisions on workers' rights to information, training, consultation and health checks.
MEPs in the committee disagree with the Council's common position on one key point. They believe national authorities - rather than the EU - should lay down the rules on whether and how employers should assess dangers to the eyes from natural radiation from the sun, and how they must respond to such risks. The Council's text would require employers not only to assess the risks but also to set up an action plan if a risk is identified.
However, MEPs in the committee agree that rules on radiation from artificial sources are best laid down at EU level. Concerning radiation from lasers, for example, the Council common position gives details of the measures employers must take to protect their employees (e.g. switching to different working methods to reduce the risk from radiation; limiting the duration and level of the exposure; the design and layout of workplaces). MEPs in the committee agree with these rules, although they want the Commission to draw up a practical guide to help employers, in particular managers of smaller firms, to understand the technical provisions of the directive.
This directive is the last of a series of four designed to protect workers from the dangers of various " physical agents ". Previous directives have dealt with vibrations, noise and electromagnetic fields.

PROGRESS - for employment and social solidarity, 2007-2013
2005-09-08 - 17:39
Karin JÖNS (PES, DE) for the Employment and Social Affairs Committee will be presenting a draft legislative resolution on the so-called PROGRESS programme.
PROGRESS is an integrated Community Programme relating to employment and social cohesion from 2007 to 2013. It groups four specific action plans and various budget lines into one common programme.
The Employment and Social Affairs Committee supports the Commissions proposal to simplify and rationalise existing programmes and is proposing several amendments in order to better take into account gender mainstreaming, disabled people, the role of the European Parliament and of NGOs.
The main proposed amendment concerns the financial framework; MEPs in the committee want to increase the Commission's proposal which is €628.8m to €854.2m. The committee says that more money should be granted, especially for gender mainstreaming.

Environment
Mining waste: MEPs set to stand firm
2005-09-08 - 17:39
After the serious accidents notably in Romania in 2000 and in Spain in 1998, where mining waste containing heavy metals or cyanide was released into the environment, the EU decided that a directive targeting this sector was needed to regulate the management and storage of such waste. The Environment is proposing a legislative report which may result in major differences with the Council particularly over the derogations Member States should have.
Some types of waste can present dangers to public health and safety as well as the environment. The collapse of a heap of inert waste in Aberfan, Wales, caused 144 deaths in 1966, and the rupture of a fluorite tailings dam in Stava, Italy, left 268 dead in 1985. In all, it is estimated that waste from mining industries amounts to about 29% of the total waste generated in the EU each year (400 million tonnes).
During the debate that preceded the vote in committee, rapporteur Jonas SJOSTEDT (GUE/NGL, SE) expressed his displeasure with the common position adopted (with some difficulty) by the Council. " The Council has created new categories of waste and multiplied the national derogations. It has set the bar far too low ", he said. He proposed an amendment to limit the derogations: " I don't want big holes in the net. The exceptions envisaged by the Council are unacceptable ", he stated. The Environment Committee followed his lead by deleting a series of derogations introduced by the Council.
Former installations, where the sites have been closed, also represent, in the eyes of the rapporteur, real " time-bombs ". Here too, MEPs in the committee propose to tighten up the Council's proposed measures. They want an inventory of closed sites to be established by every Member State in the three years following the entry into force of the directive, prioritising the most dangerous sites.
The site should if necessary be rehabilitated in the following four years at the expense of the waste producers. This point is of particular importance to the new Member States of Central and Eastern Europe where many mining companies have long flouted safety standards.
In the future, every time a mining site starts up, a financial guarantee must be given and regularly adjusted to ensure that obligations are met, during and after use of the site, for the rehabilitation of the land within the site as well as land directly affected by the waste facility.
MEPs in the committee also propose to tighten up the conditions for allowing waste to be dumped in rivers and seas (which in principle is forbidden) as well as the classification criteria for the most dangerous facilities (known as category A).

EC-Albania Readmission Agreement
2005-09-08 - 17:39
Ewa KLAMT (EPP-ED, DE) for the Civil Liberties Committee is recommending that Parliament approve the proposed Council decision concerning the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Albania on the readmission of persons residing without authorisation.
The readmission agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Albania is the fourth readmission agreement negotiated and concluded by the European Community with a non-Member State.
To date, negotiations have been completed with four countries: Hong Kong (November 2001), Macao (October 2002), Sri Lanka (May 2002) and Albania (November 2003). Agreements with Hong Kong and Macao entered already into force respectively on 1 March 2004 and 1 June 2004. Agreements with Sri Lanka and Albania will enter into force in 2005.

External/international trade
Opening up the textile market but only on equal terms
2005-09-08 - 17:39
Following the debate on the textile market which took place during the last plenary session on Thursday 7 July, Parliament will vote on the own-initiative report on textiles and clothing after 2005.
Parliament's International Trade Committee is calling for a level playing field between the EU and China for textile exports. MEPs in the committee want Chinese manufacturers to observe international labour and environmental standards and to do more to combat the production of counterfeit goods.
In an own-initiative report by Tokia SAÏFI (EPP-ED, FR) on textiles and clothing, MEPs in the committee stress that they do not seek protectionism but simply equal terms for EU manufacturers.
The committee welcomes the Memorandum of Understanding of 10 June 2005 between Trade Commissioner Peter MANDELSON and Chinese Trade Minister Bo XILAI aimed at limiting Chinese textile exports. But MEPs want to go further and they call on the Commission and Council to " extend the coverage of the agreement to other categories where necessary and to give transparency on the calculation basis of the export limitations".
The committee wants to see a more extensive textile trade reform with an opening up of markets. However, it stresses that China is not competing on equal terms, causing job losses both in the EU and in developing countries.
MEPs in the committee therefore call for the introduction of measures in accordance with WTO TRIPS agreement on combating counterfeiting and pirating, and for the Commission to ensure such measures are implemented by the Chinese government. They also call on the Commission to enforce the terms of trade agreements where exporters to the EU are supposed to comply international norms on workers' rights and environmental standards.
To address the slow-down in the European textile industry and safeguard its future and competitiveness, the committee would like to see a Euro-Mediterranean production area established. For the MEPs in the committee, this is the only way to ensure that countries on both shores of the Mediterranean "will be able to stand firm against the American and Asian regional blocs" . This area would be supported by a programme for research, innovation and cooperation and a common customs framework.
Lastly, the committee calls for a European textile plan to assist in restructuring and retraining for the entire textile and clothing sector, especially aimed at small and medium-sized firms. However, it notes that not all EU countries have the same interests regarding trade in textiles. MEPs in the committee also call for the long-term interests of European importers to be taken into account. Tokia Saïfi EPP-ED FR A6-0193/2005 Report on textiles and clothing after 2005

Major and neglected diseases in developing countries
2005-09-08 - 17:39
John BOWIS (EPP-ED, UK) for the Development Committee will be presenting an own-initiative report on major and neglected diseases.
The committee stresses the critical importance of securing increased and adequate financial resources from Member States and in the funding of the EU’s External Actions and development aid given that the resource gap for HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB alone is projected to reach €11.5 billion by 2007. The report urges ACP countries to meet the European Parliament’s target of allocating 20% to health.
The committee stresses the need for increased investment in R&D into new technologies for HIV prevention such as vaccines and microbicides. It calls for the development of adapted and affordable paediatric formulations of ARV for the 2.2 million children living with HIV, alongside diagnostic and monitoring tools suited to their needs and developing country settings.
The committee calls for the Seventh Framework Programme to include specific reference to and funding for research on illnesses that affect citizens of developing countries.
The committee also calls for a stronger linkage between sexual and reproductive health and HIV/AIDS programmes, and adequate, accessible and affordable HIV/AIDS and sexual and reproductive health related supplies, including male and female condoms and STD diagnostics and drugs.

Tourism and development
2005-09-08 - 17:39
Thierry CORNILLET (ALDE, FR) for the Development Committee will be presenting an own-initiative report on tourism and development. The committee calls for the impact of tourism and the principles of sustainable tourism and good governance to be systematically and coherently taken into account in the drawing-up of the EU's development policy.
MEPs in the committee deplore the recent segregationist measures taken by Cuban authorities with a view to prevent personal contact between tourists and Cuban citizens working in the tourism industry.
The committee calls for the Global Code of Ethics for Tourism adopted by the World Tourism Organisation and its Member States in Santiago (Chile) in 1999 to be incorporated by all countries into their national law. The committee also call on the governments of the countries concerned to circulate among themselves an annual list of visa refusals, to be confined on the grounds of sex tourism offences and crimes against humanity or terrorism.

€1 billion for Galileo satellite system
2005-09-08 - 17:39
Parliament's Industry Committee is backing the European Commission's plans to provide €1 billion over the period 2007-2013 to fund the final two phases of the Galileo satellite navigation system, covering deployment and commercial operations.
In a first-reading draft report by Etelka BARSI-PATAKY (EPP-ED, HU), MEPs in the committee stress that the figure of €1 billion is indicative, pending a decision on the Financial Perspective. Once the Financial Perspective has been adopted, the Commission must present a proposal to adjust the funding for the programme. The amount of each annual subsidy will then be decided under the annual budget procedure.
The aim of Galileo is to create a worldwide satellite radionavigation and positioning network for civilian purposes. It consists of four phases. Phase one (definition), from 1999 to 2001, was completed successfully.
Phase two (development) runs from 2002 to 2005. Phase three (deployment) starts in 2006 and involves building and launching the satellites and establishing the entire ground-based component. Phase four (commercial operation) is due to begin in 2008 and will cover the management of the system as well as maintenance and updating.
During these last two phases, the construction and then the management of the system will be carried out by a private concession holder working under the Supervisory Authority, a Community agency which is to be the licensing authority for the system. The choice of a concession contract was identified as the best way of ensuring the success of the programme in the framework of a public-private partnership.
Since Galileo may prove lucrative, the Industry Committee is proposing an amendment calling for a profit-sharing mechanism to be set up to enable the Community contribution to be repaid. MEPs in the committee also want ownership of the Intellectual Property Rights and licences to stay with the Supervisory Authority but say the revenues deriving from the exploitation of these rights could form the income of the concession holder.
The Industry Committee believes the Community will probably have to give financial guarantees and undertake liability commitments because of the nature of the programme, especially the fact that it is a public-private partnership. It therefore demands that these commitments be subject to budgetary approval by Parliament and Council.

Fisheries
Electronic recording and reporting of fishing activities
2005-09-08 - 17:39
The Commission has presented a proposal aimed at introducing the obligation to electronically record and report information relating to fishing activities. In proposing a non-binding report by Paulo CASACA (PES, PT), the Fisheries Committee is backing the new system as it will replace the obligation to record information on paper and improve the quality of data. However, the committee is trying to render it more acceptable to fishermen who are concerned about its cost.
MEPs in the committee urge the Community to grant financial assistance to fishermen and national authorities in order to facilitate the purchase and installation of the equipment needed for the electronic recording and reporting of fishing activities.
At the moment, no definitive conclusions can be reached on the pilot projects on electronic recording and reporting, which have been conducted in several Member States. The Fisheries Committee wants the regulation introducing the new system to enter into force on 1 January 2008 and not on 1 January 2006, as proposed by the Commission.

Culture
Cultural diversity requires balance in TV production
2005-09-08 - 17:39
" Competition is not enough to ensure pluralism ", the Committee on Culture and Education concludes in an own-initiative report by Henri WEBER (PES, FR). A closer watch must be kept on new developments in the constantly evolving broadcasting industry in order to guarantee cultural diversity, MEPs in the committee believe.
The committee also calls for an overhaul of the current " TV without frontiers " directive (which dates from 1989 and was amended in 1997) to preserve the " European audiovisual model " and reflect the digital era. However, the majority of MEPs in the committee reject a call for a charter of European audiovisual public services.
A key issue for MEPs in the committee is the application of Articles 4 and 5 of the directive, which require a majority of broadcasting time to be reserved for programmes produced in Europe. Here the report notes that "indicators in all but a few cases show a rise in the programming of European works". Referring to the Commission communication on the future of the European regulatory audiovisual policy, the report adds: "The broadcasting quotas for European works and works of independent producers have been broadly complied with."
Nevertheless, the committee describes this picture as not entirely accurate due to "major discrepancies among methods of implementing and interpreting the provisions ". MEPs in the committee stress the importance of gathering information on satellite and cable channels, which are often left out of national reports. Any persistent failure to comply with the provisions or to provide information should be sanctioned, the report adds.
Flood of US programmes jeopardising cultural diversity
The Culture Committee is also concerned "that our audiovisual space is being exploited better by American producers than by the Europeans themselves - even though Europeans are more productive in terms of documentaries and fiction" . MEPs in the committee are worried that "the imbalance in the movement of audiovisual works jeopardises cultural diversity".
Although most of the quotas for "European works" are filled by national programmes, MEPs in the committee are opposed to any expansion of the current quota system. They prefer voluntary initiatives for further quotas on works from other European countries. The report also calls for more precise definitions of " European works", "independent producer" and "specialist channel ".
The risk of a "two-speed" audiovisual sector
Anticipating the Commission's new draft directive on TV without borders, due to be launched this year, MEPs in the committee argue that a review is "necessary and urgent in order to face up to structural changes" . They fear that purely economic considerations will prevail and are concerned about inter-governmental horse-trading. They emphasise that " the market alone will not resolve the problems ".
Noting the risk of a "two-speed" audiovisual sector emerging, MEPs in the committee also conclude that "more choice does not necessarily mean either better quality or greater quantity of European works" , even if "digitalisation and interactivity represent opportunities for both the industry and the consumers".
In conclusion, the Culture Committee says the "European audiovisual model" must balance a strong and independent public service sector with a dynamic commercial sector. Public access to quality content is becoming ever more crucial in the context of technological change and an increasingly competitive and globalised environment.

Economic and monetary affairs
VAT - one-stop shop
2005-09-08 - 17:39
Zsolt BECSEY (EPP-ED, HU), for the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, will be presenting a non-binding report on simplifying value added tax obligations and a new one-stop scheme.
This deals with the simplifications of the VAT system, notably for small businesses wanting to trade with other EU countries. In future, they will no longer have to go through the whole process of full registration for VAT in each of the 25 Member States - they will be able to use their ' home ' registration number and follow a simplified process. Consultation procedure applies.
The committee is proposing some relatively minor amendments, for example to reduce the language burden on businesses. Zsolt László Becsey EPP-ED HU A6-0228/2005 Report: 1. on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 77/388/EEC with a view to simplifying value added tax obligations

Tourism
New challenges for tourism in the European Union
2005-09-08 - 17:39
Immediately after their own summer break, MEPs will discuss an own-initiative report by Luis QUEIRO (EPP-ED, PT) on new European Commission proposals and new challenges for tourism in the European Union.
The Transport Committee is proposing adoption of this report after its approval by 37 votes in favour and 5 against at committee stage. Mr Queiro takes the view that tourism is one of the most important and fastest growing economic industries in the EU with over 2 million companies working in this industry, most of which are SMEs directly involved in tourist services.
The Transport Committee feels that the time is ripe for better coordination in community action towards tourism. It is also considered of vital importance to complete the internal market in tourist services and to achieve genuine equality between tourist operators. To this end, a Community-wide classification, to be used in particular for the classification of hotel facilities, should be introduced.
Members in the Committee are proposing an important compromise amendment on VAT provisions. They call on the Council to restart the work on the proposed revision of the directive amending Article 26 of Directive 77/388/EC regarding special VAT provisions on the profit margins of travel agents and tour operators. There is also broad support for the objectives of simplifying this special VAT scheme and maintaining the competitive position of operators established in the EU vis-à-vis the operators based in third countries.
The Council is also asked to conclude its decision-making resolutions as regards reduced VAT rates. This would enable Member States to apply in a structured way reduced VAT rates for restaurants as this already exists for other tourism-related activities, such as holiday accommodation, renting of plots on camp sites, hotels and amusement parks.
Finally, MEPs in the committee take the view that the gradual ageing of the population will lead to an increase of the number of off-season tourists. The Commission is therefore called on to encourage the development of senior citizens' tourism within the EU. A low season " third age " campaign should therefore be launched. This would help older people's quality of life; create jobs and assist the necessary growth in the European Community.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Gender discrimination and health systems
2005-09-08 - 17:39
There is now acceptance that gender is an equally important health determinant as social, economic and ethnic background. The need for a better understanding of this issue is the subject of an own-initiative report on gender discrimination and the health system by Eva-Britt SVENSSON (GUE/NGL, SE) on behalf of the Women's Rights Committee.
A key step is to make health sector workers aware of the role of gender in determining the individual's health. This means including education on gender disparities in the training of healthcare staff. Knowledge of support techniques is essential to help female victims of violence. The committee also wants EU policies and programmes to give priority to preventing female genital mutilation and prosecuting the perpetrators.
All publicly funded health services should provide good healthcare and social security services on equal terms, say MEPs in the committee. However, the rapporteur points out that this is not always the case, citing a study from a Stockholm hospital which shows that if women received the same care as men, the resources spent on women's treatment would increase by 61%. Or if women's standard of treatment were the norm, a saving of 33% would be made.
The report urges improved measures to fight breast cancer. Comprehensive screening programmes in accordance with EU guidelines exist in only nine Member States (Belgium, Finland, France, Spain, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Sweden, Hungary and the United Kingdom). The Women's Committee wants the other Member States to make mammography screening at two-yearly intervals available to all women aged 50-69. Regular screening can reduce breast cancer mortality by up to 35% among women in this age group.
Lastly, the report calls for research into different areas relating to gender and health and the use of gender-disaggregated statistics and data in all health and medical services. It also stresses the importance of developing the gender perspective in health strategies on national and European level.
