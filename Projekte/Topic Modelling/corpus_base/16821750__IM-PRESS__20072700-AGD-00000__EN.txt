The latest phase of postal services liberalisation is now being discussed in Parliament, with a first reading vote due to take place at the July plenary session. The Transport Committee is proposing to delay the deadline for the opening of the market for items under 50 grams from 2009 – the target set in existing legislation and which the Commission wants to maintain – to 2011.
Parliament and Council will have to agree on the final text of this measure. Ahead of the plenary debate and vote, Parliament’s Directorate for the Media is organising a seminar to familiarise journalists with the evolution of postal services liberalisation over the last 20 years, the issues at stake now and the different positions of the main players.
This will involve a series of briefings from EP and Commission officials, followed by a panel debate between MEPs from the different political groups.
