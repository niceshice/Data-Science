The EU must urgently put in place an efficient common European asylum system which fully respects human rights, MEPs urged on Tuesday in a debate with Home Affairs Commissioner Malmström. The recent ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, on the case of an Afghan national sent back from Belgium to Greece, shows that the Dublin system must be revised and that solidarity between Member States is required now more than ever.
The Dublin II regulation determines which Member State is responsible for dealing with an asylum application. Most MEPs agreed that this ruling by the European Court of Human Rights is a turning point and that it sends a signal that the EU must reform its asylum system.
Some MEPs argued that Member States must stop playing "ping pong with asylum seekers" and underlined the need to relaunch the debate on a suspension mechanism to stop sending them back to countries already overloaded. Also, proper procedures must be applied to asylum cases, in order to guarantee that asylum seekers are not treated in an inhuman way.
This is not only a Greek, Maltese, Italian or Spanish problem, it's a European one, MEPs concluded.
The recasting of the Dublin regulation is under way, and MEPs will decide upon it on an equal footing with Member States.
