15 seconds against the death penalty
Human rights
2008-10-08 - 11:09
More than 15 seconds of fame, Italian actor Raoul Bova Friday marks the European day against the death penalty. As one of several events and debates to mark human rights this week, the European Parliament hosted an Italian film on the death penalty called "15 seconds" - the time an electric chair execution takes. Main actor Raoul Bova talked to us about the film.
The UN estimates that last year alone over 5,000 people were executed by 49 states around the world. China is the most prolific executioner with over 470 in 2007, followed by Iran with over 300 and Saudi Arabia with over 140 (source amnesty international).
The film was prompted by a resolution last year by the United Nations calling for a moratorium on the death penalty. Supported by 104 countries it was a powerful tool in the hands of those who oppose the death penalty. MEPs later passed a resolution supporting the UN's position.
State has no right to "grievously" take life
However, for Raoul Bova "the moratorium was a step forward, ground for hope...but it falls short of abolition of the death penalty". He went on to say that "it is intolerable that any State should act so grievously against individuals and that they assume the right to take somebody's life".
For 37 year old Bova - whose roles have included Macbeth and playing Saint Francis - "parliament is the most important arena to echo our message". The film - shown on 7 October - was hosted by Italian MEP Luisa Morgantini (GUE/NGL). She said that "this movie is about learning to seek justice, not revenge".
"I hate people who just talk"
Directed by Gianluca Petrazzi, Bova explained that he wanted to be in the film claiming: "I hate people who just talk, who say they are against something yet do nothing about it".
Expressing his personal commitment to the project he said "I have put my money in this project and I have acted in it. We cannot always wait for somebody else to provide a solution, for somebody else to solve our problems".
In the film the culpability of the condemned man is not made clear. However, for Bova that is inconsequential: "'it is not right to condemn anyone to death, be they innocent or guilty
The film continues to be shown at the European Parliament. At this stage no firm plans to release the film generally have been made.
