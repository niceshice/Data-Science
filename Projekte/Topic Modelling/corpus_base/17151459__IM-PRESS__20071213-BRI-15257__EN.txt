EU strategy on the rights of the child
Monday 14 January 2008
The first plenary session of 2008 opens with a report on the future of the automobile industry - CARS 21 . The report says that research funding needs to be increased to meet binding CO2 targets in the car industry. The Industry Committee adds that cars should be permitted to emit more CO2 if these emissions result from mandatory safety measures, and that intellectual property rights must be effectively protected worldwide. MEPs urge the Commission not to set any final mandatory targets for CO2 emissions for any date before 2015. From then on, however, an average target of 125g/km of CO2 emissions for new passenger cars should be achievable, says the report.
MEPs will debate a legislative report on airport charges . The report that sets out common principles for levying airport charges at Community airports. The directive aims to prevent any abuse of a dominant position in the market by individual airports, thus contributing to the balanced development of the EU airport sector. The Transport Committee recommends increasing the threshold so only 67 airports in the EU are affected. The Commission's proposal would have affected some 150 airports.
Tuesday 15 January 2008
Tuesday starts with a report by Glenis WILLMOTT (East Midlands, Labour, PES, UK) on health and safety at work . The non-binding report calls for better protection of healthcare workers from blood borne diseases. Besides, new and emerging risks e.g. from nanotechnologies had to be identified, and asbestos needed to be phased out.
The legislative highlight of the week is a second-reading agreement on new rules on EU-wide consumer credit . Two out of three Europeans use credit to buy furniture, a washing machine or a car. Yet the market in consumer credit is still a national one. The EP Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee is proposing a report at second reading on plans to stimulate the European market while still protecting consumers. The draft directive aims to harmonise consumer credit contracts in a number of areas, such as information provided to consumers before contracts are signed and when they are concluded, calculations of the total cost of a loan, the right to cancel and the right to pay off a loan early. At the time of publication, negotiations between the Council and the European Parliament are still ongoing in the hope of reaching an agreement. The vote takes places on Wednesday.
At midday on Tuesday the Grand Mufti of Syria Ahmad BADER HASSOUN will address the House in a formal sitting. The Grand Mufti is the first speaker to address the EP as part of Parliament's programme of visits by eminent figures in the context of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue (2008).
Tuesday afternoon sees MEPs debating the EU strategy on the rights of the child . MEPs are expected to call for the strategy to include tougher measures to combat paedophilia on the Internet as well as steps to counter child sex tourism and enable suppliers of products manufactured with child labour to be prosecuted in Europe.
Michael Cashman (West Midlands, Labour, PES, UK) will be presenting his non-binding report on the adoption of a Multiannual Framework for the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights for 2007-2012 .
On Tuesday evening, Commissioner Dimas will make a statement of the " alarming situation regarding waste in the region of Campania ". The House will also vote on a resolution on this topic,
Wednesday 16 January 2008
Slovenian Prime Minister Janez JANŠA will present the priorities of the Slovenian Presidency at 9am on Wednesday 16 January . Slovenia took over the six month rotating presidency on 1 January 2008, and is the first Member State from the 2004 enlargement to hold the Council Presidency. MEPs will debate the presidency's priorities and José Manuel BARROSO will respond for the Commission.
In the afternoon, the European Parliament will debate the dramatic situation in Kenya . The EU has condemned the recent acts of violence in Kenya and urges political leaders of all sides to exercise maximum restraint and refrain from any action or comment which could provoke further violence. The people of Kenya exercised their right to vote in the elections on 27 December in a dignified way. They can now expect that their human rights are respected as the election results are disputed.
MEPs will debate the situation in Pakistan . On 27 December 2007, Pakistani former Prime Minister Benazir BHUTTO was assassinated. Ms Bhutto - the first woman PM in an Islamic state - was leaving an election rally in Rawalpindi. The EU will send an election observation mission to the re-scheduled elections of 18 February 2008.
Thursday 17 January 2008
Thursday morning sees MEPs debating the role of women in industry . The report encourages action to promote women’s position in relation to wage equality, working conditions, career opportunities, vocational training, with maternity and paternity being borne in mind as fundamental social values.
The House also debate the results of the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) in Rio . The second meeting of the IGF was held in Rio de Janeiro on 12-15 November 2007. The forum founded in 2006 is a worldwide organisation which supports the United Nations in promoting multi-stakeholder policy dialogue on internet governance. Last year's Internet Governance Forum discussed issues such as critical Internet resources, access, diversity, openness and security. The next Internet Governance Forum will take place from 8 to 11 December 2008 in New Delhi, India.

European Council
Presentation of the programme of the Slovenian Presidency - Slovenian PM
2008-01-10 - 09:44
Slovenian Prime Minister Janez JANŠA will present the priorities of the Slovenian Presidency at 9am on Wednesday 16 January. Slovenia took over the six month rotating presidency on 1 January 2008, and is the first Member State from the 2004 enlargement to hold the Council Presidency. MEPs will debate the presidency's priorities and José Manuel Barroso will respond for the Commission. The five main priorities of Slovenian presidency are:
1. The future of the Union and timely entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty
After signing the Lisbon Treaty on 13 December 2007, efforts of all Member States will need to be concentrated on successful completion of ratification procedures in 2008 to allow the new Treaty to enter into force before the next elections to the European Parliament in 2009. Slovenia wants to set a good example for other Member States by ratifying it no later than at the beginning of 2008.
2. Successful launching of the new Lisbon Strategy cycle
The Lisbon Strategy is one of key priorities of the Slovenian Presidency. The Presidency looks forward to launching the second cycle of the renewed Lisbon Strategy at the Spring European Council. The Strategy is starting to deliver benefits in terms of increased jobs and growth, and therefore does not need radical changes to priorities or processes. The key to success will be continuing the process and smooth transition into the next cycle. The aim is to make it a strong cycle, which will be capable of mobilising and empowering European citizens. The Integrated Guidelines strike a delicate balance, and should remain broadly unchanged for the second cycle (2008-2010).
The Presidency believes the focus should remain on four priority areas of the Lisbon Strategy: investment in research, knowledge and innovation, development of a competitive business environment, adaptation of labour markets and response to demographic challenges, as well as energy policy and climate change.
3. A step forward in addressing climate-energy issues
The European Council of March 2007 defined the basic elements of the Union’s new integrated climate and energy policy. The European Commission’s “climate-energy package”, which will be issued at the end of January, represents one of the key priorities of the Slovenian Presidency. The Presidency will start complex negotiations, but decisive actions will be required from all Member States. Slovenia would favour early agreement on the energy-climate package (late 2008/early 2009 at the latest) as this would put the EU in a very strong position with international partners, particularly in view of the December 2009 conference in Copenhagen. As the fight against climate change and energy policy are closely related, the Presidency will also strive for further progress in the EU energy policy.
4. Strengthening of the European perspective of the Western Balkans
Stability of the Western Balkans is of utmost importance for security and prosperity of the entire Union. Therefore, the Slovenian Presidency firmly believes that further affirmation of the European perspective for the Western Balkans countries should remain a central item on the EU agenda. The Presidency will endeavour towards the reaffirmation of the 2003 Thessaloniki Agenda, completion of the network of Stabilization and Association Agreements, and the enhancement of regional cooperation in several areas.
The resolution on the future status of Kosovo as well as the management of the post status process, where the EU will need to assume a leading role, should be achieved in a way to strengthen the stability and security of the entire region.
5. Promoting dialogue between cultures, beliefs and traditions in the context of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue
As 2008 has been proclaimed the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, the Presidency will endeavour to strengthen the intercultural dialogue within the EU. It is important to popularise the value of intercultural dialogue among the European public at large. The Presidency will particularly strive to promote the intercultural dialogue with the Western Balkans. A special Slovenian contribution in this context is the initiative for establishing a Euro-Mediterranean University in the city of Piran.

Situation in Kenya - MEPs to vote on a resolution
2008-01-10 - 09:44
MEPs will debate the situation in Kenya after hearing statements from Council and Commission. The EU has condemned the recent acts of violence in Kenya and urges political leaders of all sides to exercise maximum restraint and refrain from any action or comment which could provoke further violence. The people of Kenya exercised their right to vote in the elections on 27 December in a dignified way. They can now expect that their human rights are respected as the election results are disputed.
Alexander LAMBSDORFF (ALDE, DE) headed the EU EOM (European Union Election Observation Mission) to Kenya. Jan MULDER (ALDE, NL) headed a four-strong delegation of MEPs to observe the elections. According to the MEPs, the 2007 General Elections have fallen short of key international and regional standards for democratic elections.
On 27 December 2007, elections were held for the President, 210 members of the National Assembly and 2,498 members of local authorities. These elections were the tenth general elections since the country's independence in 1963 and the fourth general elections since the introduction of multiparty democracy in 1991.
Raila Odinga is still contesting the final outcome of the ballot which saw the re-election of Kenya's ruling President Mwai Kibaki . According to the EU EOM preliminary statement, "s erious inconsistencies and anomalies were identified in the results announced by the ECK ( Election Commission of Kenya).
European Parliament involvement
Jan Mulder , Dutch Liberal, headed a four-strong delegation of MEPs to observe the elections. They were on the spot from the 26th to the 29th December. The other Member of the delegation were Valdis Dombrovskis (EPP-ED, LV), Horst Posdorf (EPP-ED, DE) and Johan Van Hecke (ALDE, BE).
The EP delegation endorsed the preliminary conclusions of the EU EOM which says that "t he 2007 General Elections have fallen short of key international and regional standards for democratic elections" . These elections also saw "significant levels of ethnically based violence, including loss of life by a number of citizens", says the statement.
The EU calls on Kenya’s leaders to address the concerns about the integrity of the election process raised by EU observers, as well as by Kenyan civil society organisations and by other international observers. The EU expects all parties to resort to dialogue and do their utmost to reach a political solution. The EU stands ready to support the outcome. The EU welcomes the readiness of the African Union to support Kenya in finding a way out of the present crisis. The Kenyan authorities should take advantage of these good offices. The EU also supports other efforts from Africa to the same end. Debate: 16.01.2008

Situation in Pakistan
2008-01-10 - 09:44
The European Parliament will debate the situation in Pakistan following statements from the Commission and the Council. On 27 December 2007, Pakistani former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was assassinated. Ms Bhutto - the first woman PM in an Islamic state - was leaving an election rally in Rawalpindi. The EU will send an election observation mission to the re-scheduled elections of 18 February 2008. On 3 January 2008, the Presidency made the following statement on the Pakistani Election Commission to postpone general elections until 18 February 2008:
"The EU took note of the decision of the Election Commission of Pakistan to postpone general elections until 18 February. The EU strongly reiterates the importance of holding free and fair elections by this new date, which should allow for a democratic and transparent electoral process under proper security conditions.
The EU calls upon all involved parties to accept the decision of the Election Commission with dignity and restraint, and participate fully in the general elections, ensuring a truly democratic outcome. The EU urges the Pakistani authorities to improve conditions for elections in line with international standards.
At this stage, overall stability in the country and further progress on the path towards democracy are among the most important challenges for Pakistan. The EU continues to support the Pakistani people in addressing these challenges. Elements looking to destabilise Pakistan should not be allowed to succeed."

EP to speak out in favour of more regional cooperation in the Black Sea region and the South Caucasus
2008-01-10 - 09:44
The Parliament will debate and vote on two reports calling for more regional cooperation in the Black Sea and South Caucasus regions. In both areas, the Foreign Affairs Committee stresses the importance both of democratic principles and human rights and of the necessity to improve economic and trade relations, especially regarding energy supplies. The own-initiative report by Roberta Alma ANASTASE (EPP-ED, RO) on the Black Sea region is a response to the Commission's communication on Black Sea Synergy. The committee is not satisfied by the progress made since the last such communication, published in 1997, and calls for a "genuine regional dimension tailored to this area," with "concrete proposals for fostering regional cooperation." It underlines the importance of involving Russia and Turkey in any regional cooperation efforts, and supports the creation of a free trade area in the region.
The committee says the doubling of financial resources under the ENPI (European Neighbourhood Policy Instrument) for cross-border projects, and notes a number of priority fields in which cooperation is necessary. These include the EU's role in overcoming the unresolved conflicts in the region, the creation of "new infrastructure and viable transport corridors diversifying both suppliers and routes" for energy and the tackling of environmental problems in the region, especially in the Black Sea and the Danube delta.
South Caucasus
Lydie POLFER 's (ALDE, LU) report on the South Caucasus calls for a differentiated approach to the three countries of the region, asking the Commission to "not ignore the three states' particular characteristics." It calls for a feasibility study to evaluate the possibility of a free trade agreement with Georgia and Armenia, underscores the importance of supporting and empowering civil society and developing people-to-people contacts and specifically urges all countries to "strengthen the representation of the parliamentary opposition in their delegations" to the Parliamentary Cooperation Committees with the EP.
With respect to the individual states, the report calls for "further efforts to be made in establishing an independent judiciary, in promoting reforms in the police, the civil service and local government, in fighting corruption and in creating a vibrant civil society" in Armenia . It "reiterates its serious concern about the deterioration of the human rights situation and media freedom in Azerbaijan," and "expresses deep concern over the recent developments in Georgia."
Frozen conflicts
MEPs in the committee address the issue of frozen conflicts in the region, noting that they reject "all attempts by foreign powers aimed at creating exclusive spheres of influence," while also urging the states in the region to "stop the increase in their military spending.". The Foreign Affairs Committee "reiterates its unconditional support for the territorial integrity and inviolability of the internationally recognised borders of Georgia," as well as taking the view that "further delay in the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict will not benefit either of the countries involved." MEPs in the committee also reiterate their call on Turkey to "engage in serious and intensive efforts for the resolution of outstanding disputes with all its neighbours [...] including a frank and open discussion on past events."

Consumers
A Europe-wide market in consumer credit
2008-01-10 - 09:44
Two out of three Europeans use credit to buy furniture, a washing machine or a car. Yet the market in consumer credit is still a national one. The EP Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee is proposing a report at second reading on plans to stimulate the European market while still protecting consumers. At the time of publication, negotiations between the Council and the European Parliament are still ongoing in the hope of reaching a second-reading agreement. In particular, article 16 paragraph 2 of the Council common position on the amount of compensation to be paid to the financial institution for early repayment is the issue where Council and Parliament have yet to agree. (see below)
The draft directive aims to harmonise consumer credit contracts in a number of areas, such as information provided to consumers before contracts are signed and when they are concluded, calculations of the total cost of a loan, the right to cancel and the right to pay off a loan early. Parliament's rapporteur is Kurt Lechner (EPP-ED, DE).
The directive was proposed by the Commission in autumn 2002 and given a first reading by Parliament in April 2004. It took the Council until September this year to reach a common position on the issue. At Monday's committee vote, some 236 amendments had been tabled to that common position. The political groups reached agreement before the vote on 10 compromise amendments covering some of these. The major changes adopted by the committee concern the scope of the directive, advertising, pre-contractual and contractual information (in particular for overdraft facilities) and, in particular early repayment terms.
What will change?
The day the new directive enters into force, all EU consumers will have the right to the same information for choosing the best offer in their country or another EU Member State. Consumers will also be able to benefit from bank products that are not available in their own country. The directive also lays down the standard information that must be mentioned in advertising containing financial information on a loan. But MEPs in the committee chose to leave more room for manoeuvre than either the Commission or the Council proposed when it comes to this basic information. With the aim being to enable consumers to take fully-informed decisions, lenders will also be expected to provide information on both the benefits and the drawbacks of the loan offer.
Harmonisation will go further as regards the information to accompany the signing of the contract. It will also be easier to calculate the total cost of a loan. Definitions will be standardised EU-wide and will be used as a basis for calculating the annual percentage rate of charge (APR). Other definitions will be standardised, for example concerning overdraft facilities. But the text proposed by the Internal Market Committee is less strict than that in the Council's common position when it comes to contractual and pre-contractual information which lenders are obliged to provide to their customers in the case of overdrafts.
Avoiding taking on too much debt
One priority is to protect consumers against taking on too much debt. The information provided by the lender must enable the borrower to take a responsible decision. The lender must also assess the solvency of the consumer before concluding a contract. Databases accessible by banks should make it easier to meet this requirement. But if the banks refuses a loan on these grounds, the customer will have the right, according to Monday's vote, to see, without charge, the information in that database and where necessary correct any errors. Where legislation providing for similar measures already exists in a Member State, these mechanisms will be preserved. In other cases, they will have to be set up.
Right to pay off early
The new directive will give consumers the right to pay off loans early while also stipulating the rules by which the lender can calculate the compensation to be paid by the client. The justification (which must be honest and objective) for the amount of compensation required must respect the national law of the country concerned, say MEPs in the committee. The directive should not itself set a ceiling on the level of compensation, but this amount should not go beyond the interest charges the client would have paid had the term of the loan not been reduced.
The Council says compensation shall be determined by the creditor and may not exceed 1 % of the amount of credit repaid early, if the period of time between the early repayment and the agreed termination of the credit agreement exceeds one year. If the period does not exceed one year, the compensation may not exceed 0,5 % of the amount of credit repaid early.
The compensation shall not exceed the amount of interest the consumer would have paid during the period between the early repayment and the agreed date of termination of the credit agreement.
A right of cancellation within 14 days will also apply EU-wide. But MEPs in the committee say that for linked credit agreements this period could be reduced to three days at the request of the customer.
What loans are covered by the directive?
The new legislation will cover consumer loans between €200 and €75 000 (latest EP figure) , the Parliament's negotiating team proposes, as opposed to the Council's preferred upper limit of €100 000. It will only cover credit contracts, not guarantors and other aspects of credit agreement law. The directive will apply only to loan contracts on which interest is paid, and not products such as deferred payment cards (charge cards).
What will be the benefits?
The new legislation should enable the European economy to take advantage of the potential for the development of cross-border trade in consumer credit. Removing obstacles should boost competition and prompt credit institutions to improve performance, by diversifying and enhancing their products for Europe’s consumers.
Finding the right balance
The situation varies greatly from one Member State to another, both in legal terms and as regards the credit habits of households, a situation which does not make harmonisation easier. In addition, the right balances must be struck. On the one hand, easier credit must not lead to a debt burden on households. On the other, consumer protection must not generate costs that could be intolerable to the financial health of banking institutions. On the one hand, better consumer protection means strengthening customers' rights to information; on the other hand, too many bureaucratic requirements might discourage banks from offering credit on favourable terms. This balancing act explains the long delay in arriving at a second reading. There are differences of view both within the Council (which took years to reach a common position) and within Parliament (where a series of very close votes in committee mean it is not yet clear in every case how the plenary will decide).
Directive does not apply to:
(a) credit agreements which are secured either by a mortgage or by another comparable security commonly used in a Member State on immovable property or secured by a right related to immovable property;
(b) credit agreements the purpose of which is to acquire or retain property rights in land or in an existing or projected building;
(c) credit agreements involving a total amount of credit less than €200 or more than €75 000(LATEST EP FIGURE proposal to Council from the negotiations) as requested by the EP. Council would have preferred a top limit of €100 000.
(d) hiring or leasing agreements where an obligation to purchase the object of the agreement is not laid down either by the agreement itself or by any separate agreement; such an obligation shall be deemed to exist if it is so decided unilaterally by the creditor;
(e) credit agreements in the form of an overdraft facility and where the credit has to be repaid within one month;
(f) credit agreements where the credit is granted free of interest and without any other charges and credit agreements under the terms of which the credit has to be repaid within three months and only insignificant charges are payable;
(g) credit agreements where the credit is granted by an employer to his employees as a secondary activity free of interest or at annual percentage rates of charge lower than those prevailing on the market and which are not offered to the public generally;
(h) credit agreements which are concluded with investment firms as defined in Article 4(1) of Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on markets in financial instruments or with credit institutions as defined in Article 4 of Directive 2006/48/EC for the purposes of allowing an investor to carry out a transaction relating to one or more of the instruments listed in Section C of Annex I to Directive 2004/39/EC, where the investment firm or credit institution granting the credit is involved in such transaction;
(i) credit agreements which are the outcome of a settlement reached in court or before another statutory authority;
Next steps, publication and transposition
The draft directive, currently at the second reading stage, has been in the pipeline since autumns 2002. Parliament and Council are holding negotiations ahead of the vote in the hope of reaching a compromise. The directive enters force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. The previous directive (Directive 87/102/EEC) is repealed two years after the entry into force of this Directive.

Rights of the child: the European Parliament to set out its strategy
2008-01-10 - 09:44
An EU strategy on the rights of the child is set to win Parliament's backing next week in Strasbourg. MEPs are expected to call for the strategy to include tougher measures to combat paedophilia on the internet as well as steps to counter child sex tourism and enable suppliers of products manufactured with child labour to be prosecuted in Europe. The own-initiative report, drafted for the Civil Liberties Committee by Roberta Angelilli (UEN, IT) and approved almost unanimously by the committee in December, is Parliament's response to a Commission communication of 4 July 2006 titled Towards an EU strategy on the rights of the child .
The report restates Parliament's opposition to all forms of violence against children and calls for a specific budget heading for their rights, with which to fund work required by the strategy.
Combating paedophile pornography and violence on the internet
Among the committee's many proposals, MEPs call for technical measures to combat the dissemination of paedophile content via the internet. They would also like to involve access suppliers, search engines and even banks, so as to block payment by would-be purchasers of illegal content.
In addition, the committee wishes to protect children by tightening up rules on the transmission of harmful content via the internet or multimedia messaging services and the sale of violent video games. It would like a uniform classification and labelling system to be created for such games, and for all audiovisual content.
Children should be better informed of their rights via a dedicated internet site to be set up for this purpose, argues the committee.
Enforce ban on child labour
Among other points, MEPs advocate a mechanism to enable the prosecution, in Europe, of suppliers of products that have been manufactured with child labour. The Commission is urged to check whether production lines comply with rules prohibiting child labour.
Early warning system on child abductions and prosecution of sex criminals
The committee recommends setting up a European early warning system on child abductions and supports the Commission's plan to introduce a telephone help-line for children. It also urges the creation of a European strategy, and a single EU-wide set of extraterritorial criminal laws, to counter child sex tourism.
Community instrument on adoption
Pointing out that every child has the right to a family, MEPs suggest establishing a Community instrument to facilitate adoption. Lastly, the EU is urged to sign up to the UN and Council of Europe conventions on the rights of the child.

EUROPOL revamped
2008-01-10 - 09:44
Parliament will vote next week on a report on a draft Council decision converting Europol into an EU agency, meaning that its funding will be provided from the EU budget, its staff will become Community officials and changes to its remit will be easier, thus enabling it to respond more quickly to new crime threats. Europol is the EU body that deals with criminal intelligence. Its purpose is to improve cooperation between Member States' authorities on intelligence in the fight against serious organised crime and terrorism, with an emphasis on targeting criminal organisations. It is politically accountable to the Justice and Home Affairs Council via the Europol Management Board. The Council controls the appointment of Europol's director as well as its budget, which is currently funded from Member State contributions, rather than the EU budget.
The intention is now for the existing Europol Convention to be replaced with a Council decision, due to be finalised by 30 June 2008. The new Europol (also known as the European Police Office) will be funded from the EU budget as from 1 January 2010.
In addition, the draft decision seeks to extend Europol's mandate to criminal activity not strictly related to organised crime. This will make it easier for Europol to support Member States in cross-border criminal investigations where the involvement of organised crime is not demonstrated from the start.
The decision also provides for Europol to receive data from private bodies and to support Member States in connection with major international events with a public order policing impact.
More safeguards needed on data protection, say MEPs
In a consultation report drafted by Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra (EPP-ED, ES) for the Civil Liberties Committee, MEPs propose a number of improvements to the draft decision. They welcome the creation of an independent Ombudsman to protect Europol data but they want extra safeguards on data protection, since data obtained from private bodies may not have been obtained in the first place by safe, reliable means.
Regarding democratic scrutiny, the committee calls for Parliament to have the right to be consulted not just over any proposed dismissal but also over the appointment of Europol's director. MEPs welcome the proposals for Europol to be funded from the EU budget as this will allow Parliament greater involvement in the agency's financing.
Lastly, the Civil Liberties Committee calls for Parliament to be re-consulted under the new Lisbon Treaty if the Council decision establishing Europol is not adopted by June 2008.

A European strategy on the Roma people
2008-01-10 - 09:44
The House will hear a response from the Commission to an oral question on A European Roma strategy tabled by the PES group. The question asks what steps are planned to tackle the problems facing this ethnic minority group, which is unusual in that it is not tied to any particular territory, thereby making its problems a trans-national issue. The next day MEPs will vote on a draft resolution on this issue. Text of the oral question:
In April 2005, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the situation of Roma (see below) calling on the European Commission to prepare a communication on how the EU could best coordinate and promote efforts to improve the situation of the Roma and to adopt an action plan with clear recommendations to the Member States. The resolution also suggested considering recognising the Roma as a transnational European minority.
A series of initiatives has been taken that touch on Roma issues, but the European Commission has so far not come forward with a comprehensive action plan. Does the European Commission intend to draft a Communication on Roma issues in the coming year, having in mind the above mentioned request of the European Parliament?
What is the amount of European funds available for Member States aiming at the integration of Roma communities? Has the Commission conducted any evaluation of the actual impact of European funding on Roma inclusion?
Is the European Commission considering the possibility of adapting its institutional structures in order to deal in a more effective way with Roma issues? Is the European Commission prepared to create a Roma Unit or establish a Roma Inter-service Group? If not, how will the European Commission ensure effective coordination of its efforts to support the social and economic integration of Roma communities with other policy initiatives? Would the European Commission consider conferring primary responsibility for Roma issues into a single European Commissioner’s portfolio?
Is the European Commission ready to enforce incentive measures for the social integration of Roma people, as Directive 2000/43/EC recommends?
Is the European Commission considering the possibility of becoming more involved in the 'Decade of Roma Inclusion' initiative, possibly by appointing an EC Coordinator for Roma issues?

Industry
More science funding needed to meet CO2 targets for car industry
2008-01-10 - 09:44
Research funding needs to be increased to meet binding CO2 targets in the car industry, says the Industry Committee's report on a competitive automotive regulatory framework (CARS 21). The committee adds that cars should be permitted to emit more CO2 if these emissions result from mandatory safety measures, and that intellectual property rights must be effectively protected worldwide. The own-initiative report by Jorgo Chatzimarkakis (ALDE, DE) stresses the economic importance of the European automotive industry as a sector producing 19 million vehicles yearly and providing 2.3 million direct jobs and a further 10 million in ancillary sectors. MEPs in the committee say that, while the industry will have to undergo substantial change, adjustments in EU policy will also be needed to ensure regulations do not lead to job losses.
Allow higher CO2 emissions if they result from safety measures
As the development of new types of passenger cars takes about five to seven years, MEPs urge the Commission not to set any final mandatory targets for CO2 emissions for any date before 2015. From then on, however, an average target of 125g/km of CO2 emissions for new passenger cars should be achievable, says the report.
MEPs in the committee stress that additional safety systems might increase the weight of passenger cars and thus lead to higher CO2 emissions. They therefore call on the Commission to develop a system that allows car manufacturers to emit additional CO2 if these are a result of legally binding safety measures.
Increase research funding to meet CO2 targets
Binding CO2 targets have to be accompanied by an increase in Member States' funding for research and development for the automobile sector, says the report. The committee suggests that one of the first knowledge and innovation communities of the new European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) should address CO2 reduction through vehicle technology.
Effective protection of intellectual property rights
Committee members are concerned that the European automotive industry might lose its position as one of the most competitive industries in the world due to "unfair competition and the infringement of intellectual property rights". "Effective protection of IPR" should be a precondition for any partnership with China.
Within the EU's current negotiations for a free-trade agreement with Korea, the removal of that country's non-tariff barriers is seen as essential, and any strategy of phasing out EU import tariffs should depend on this, says the committee.
A common market for spare parts
The Commission should come forward with proposals to create a common market for custom and tuning parts such as special tyres, wheels and other tuning and spare parts. The committee stresses that independent operators should have genuine access to technical information, training, spare parts, multi-band diagnostic tools and testing equipment.
Motor sport and hybrid engines
MEPs in the committee recognise the role motor sport can play in changing attitudes and customer behaviour towards environmentally friendly technology. The committee therefore asks the FIA and others involved in Formula 1 to change their rules accordingly, so that environmentally friendly technologies like bio-fuels, four-cylinder engines or hybrid can be more easily applied.
Membership of CARS 21 high level group
Among the Members of the CARS 21 high level group are:
Malcolm Harbour Member of the European Parliament (EPP-ED, Conservative, West Midlands, UK), Joint Chairman Forum for the automobile and society
Margaret Beckett at the time was Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, United Kingdom. Rapporteur Jorgo CHATZIMARKAKIS ALDE DE A6-0494/2007 CARS 21: A Competitive Automotive Regulatory Framework Procedure : own-initiative

Transport
MEPs to set out new charges system for 67 EU airports
2008-01-10 - 09:44
The European Parliament will debate and vote on a legislative report that sets out common principles for levying airport charges at Community airports. The directive aims to prevent any abuse of a dominant position in the market by individual airports, thus contributing to the balanced development of the EU airport sector. The Commission had proposed that the new rules should apply to airports with an annual traffic of more than one million passengers, but the Transport Committee was in favour of five million passengers as a threshold or which accounted annually for more than 15% of the passenger movements in the Member State where it is located. This reflects a concern that the Directive as drafted would capture smaller airports who are not in a potentially market dominant position. The Transport Committee's decision means that 67 airports throughout the EU will be affected by the directive.
Under the new rules, all airports will be bound by common rules on provision of mutual information, transparency and the way airport charges may be collected. It is also planned to introduce national independent regulatory authorities to ensure that the directive is applied in full. This body, says the committee, should establish procedures for resolving disagreements between the airport managing body and the airlines about changes to the level and structure of airport charges including relating to quality of service.
Compromise amendments are also proposed on the definition of airports charges, on airport networks, on the level of service quality to be provided by the airports managing body in return for the airports charge and the financing of new infrastructure projects.
The list of the 67 airports concerned is as follows:
Alicante, Amsterdam/Schiphol Athina/Eleftherios Venizelos, Barcelona, Berlin-Schoenefeld Berlin-Tegel, Birmingham Bourgas, Bratislava, Bristol, Brussels/Brussels-National, Bucharest/Henri Coanda, Budapest/Ferihegy, Catania/Fontanarossa, Dublin, Düsseldorf, Edinburgh, Faro, Frankfurt/Main, Glasgow, Gran Canaria, Hamburg, Hannover, Helsinki/Vantaa, Iraklion/Nikos Kazantzakis, Kobenhavn/Kastrup, Köln/Bonn, Lanzarote, Larnaka/INTL, Lisboa, Ljubljana, London Gatwick, London Heathrow, London Luton, London Stansted Luxembourg, Lyon Saint-Exupery, Madrid/Barajas, Malaga, Malta/Luqa, Manchester, Marseille-Provence, Milano/Linate, Milano/Malpensa, München, Newcastle, Nice-Cote d´Azur, Pafos/INTL, Palma de Mallorca, Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Paris/Orly, Praha/Ruzyne, Riga, Rodos/Diagoras, Roma/Fiumicino, Sofia, Stockholm/Arlanda, Stuttgart, Tallinn, Tenerife Sur/Reina Sofia, Timisoara, Toulouse-Blagnac, Toulouse/CCER, Varna, Venezia/Tessera, Vilnius, Warszawa/Okecie and Wien/Schwechat.

Abolition of discrimination in transport rates and conditions and in hygiene of foodstuffs
2008-01-10 - 09:44
Paolo COSTA (ALDE, IT), on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, will be presenting a legislative report to plenary on the abolition of discrimination in transport rates and conditions as well as on foodstuff hygiene. The aim of the action regarding Regulation No 11 is to reduce administrative burdens for transport enterprises by removing outdated documentation requirements regarding the route to be taken, distance to be travelled, frontier crossing points etc.
On the basis of the requests initiated by the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Transport and Tourism for splitting the proposal into two parts, the Conference of Presidents of 5 July 2007 decided to authorise the Environment and Transport Committees to draw up one legislative report each on the basis of Commission proposal. The split will provide the desirable objective which is the swift adoption of the Regulation, and hence the economic benefits of this proposal in a very quick short term period.
The committee fully endorses the Commission proposal, including the introduction of a reference of the consignment notes or to any other transport documents, which would reduce red-tape for transport undertakings.
According to the Commission's impact assessment for the transport part, the expected benefit from the reduction of the administrative burden is estimated around €160 million annually. The measure will affect more than 300 000 undertakings (100 rail, 7,000 inland waterways and 300,000 road freight carriers).
The Commission's proposal was submitted under the so-called "fast track action" which aims at the reduction of administrative burdens in the EU. Rapporteur Paolo COSTA ALDE IT A6-0513/2007 Reduction of the administrative burdens on businesses: abolition of discrimination in transport rates and conditions (amend.

MEPs call for better protection of workers from occupational diseases and workplace accidents
2008-01-10 - 09:44
In an own-initiative report on the "Community strategy 2007-2012 on health and safety at work", the Employment and Social Affairs Committee regrets that the Commission "is silent on targets for the reduction of occupational diseases". MEPs in the committee also repeat their call for better protection of healthcare workers from blood borne diseases. Besides, new and emerging risks e.g. from nanotechnologies had to be identified, and asbestos needed to be phased out. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) estimates that in the EU in 2006, approximately 167,000 people died from a work related accident or disease. Another 300,000 workers suffer permanent disability every year, estimates the Commission.
Protect healthcare workers from blood borne infections
The report by Glenis Willmott (PES, Labour, East Midlands, UK) criticises that the Commission did still not propose to amend the "directive on the exposure to biological agents at work" so as to protect healthcare workers from blood borne diseases due to needle stick injuries. MEPs warn that healthcare workers are at risk of contracting more than twenty life-threatening viruses such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV/Aids. Committee members expect "a suitable amendment to the directive to be adopted well before the end of the legislature in mid-2009".
New legislation on occupational diseases and musculoskeletal disorders needed
The Commission has set itself the ambitious target of reducing workplace accidents across the EU by 25 %. But also for the reduction of occupational diseases - such as occupational cancer - targets need to be set, says the Employment and Social Affairs Committee. MEPs in the committee, therefore, suggest transforming the EU recommendation on occupational diseases into a minimum directive. They are also concerned about the increasing occurrence of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and therefore ask the Commission to consider proposing a directive for MSD. The report notes the scientifically proven link between growing stress at the workplace and the diseases it gives rise to, particularly chronic illnesses, cardiovascular diseases and musculoskeletal disorders.
Identify new and emerging risks and phase out asbestos
The committee also stresses the need "to identify and monitor new and emerging risks, e.g. nanotechnologies and psychosocial risks, in good time".
Member States should draw up national action plans on phasing out asbestos which should include obligations to map asbestos in buildings and to provide for a safe removal, say MEPs in the committee.
Obligatory job retention
The report calls on governments to ensure that people who have experienced a physical or mental illness during their working lives retain their jobs e.g. through training or reallocation of tasks.
Corporate Social Responsibility
The committee considers the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as one of the effective tools to improve the competitiveness, better occupational and safety at work, better working environment and in this aspect encourages exchange of good practices at local, national and European levels among the Member States and globally at multinational level as well as further applying of CSR on voluntary bases, but as an integrated part of business strategies for development.

Employment policy
Social security schemes for employed persons
2008-01-10 - 09:44
Csaba ŐRY (EPP-ED, HU) for the Employment and Social Affairs Committee will be tabling a legislative report updating a report on the application of social security schemes to workers and their families moving within the EU. Directive to be replaced - technical amendments only
The Commission proposes an update to the 1408/71 regulations taking account of the amendments which have been made to national social security legislation, particularly in Ireland, Hungary, Poland, the Netherlands and Austria. It also seeks to make changes and technical improvements to the regulation. In other words, it is a technical, transitory regulation, given the imminent application of the new Regulation 883/2004 and its implementing provisions.
The committee welcomes the proposed amendments, which seek to facilitate the coordination of social security schemes. The committee proposes a number of amendments, also technical in nature, seeking to simplify the proposal, correct errors and omissions and update the annexes to Regulation 1408/71.
At this stage, the committee confines itself to tabling those amendments which were absolutely necessary for the moment to ensure the normal functioning of Regulation 1408/71, given that it will soon be replaced by Regulation 883/2004.
Ireland
The technical change for Ireland refers to "Child benefit, guardian's payment (contributory) and increases of widow's (contributory) pension and widower's (contributory) pension payable in respect of children eligible under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 and subsequent amending legislation".

Environment
Export and import of dangerous chemicals
2008-01-10 - 09:44
Johannes BLOKLAND (IND/DEM, NL) for the Environment Committee will be tabling a legislative report on the export and import of dangerous chemicals. The aim of the regulation is to implement the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade, to promote shared responsibility and cooperative efforts in the international movement of hazardous chemicals in order to protect human health and the environment from potential harm and to contribute to their environmentally sound use.
The report proposes the following amendments:
- it specifies that 'Articles' containing substances listed in parts 2 and 3 of Annex I require an export notification, just as it is required for substances and preparations;
- in order to ensure that notifications are not unduly delayed, a deadline for the provision of information to complete the requirements of Annex II is needed. The report states that when a chemical qualifies for PIC notification, but the information is insufficient to meet the requirements of Annex II, identified exporters or importers shall, upon request by the Commission, provide all relevant information available to them, including that from other national or international chemical control programmes within 60 days;
- the report specifies that Part 2 of Annex I lists substances that are not yet included in the PIC procedure, but that are restricted or even banned in the EU should be treated in a more flexible way. Since they are not included in the Convention of Rotterdam, the request for explicit consent for these substances remains very often unanswered. This is very time consuming for the designated national authorities and it seriously hampers the exporters' competitiveness. Therefore, this derogation proposes to treat these substances in a more flexible way, but remains however in line with the Convention of Rotterdam;
- the validity of each explicit consent obtained or waiver granted shall be subject to periodic review by the Commission in consultation with the Member States concerned as follows:
(a) for each explicit consent obtained a new explicit consent shall be required by the end of the third calendar year after the consent was given, unless the terms of that consent require otherwise; (b) unless a response to a request has been received in the meantime, each waiver granted shall be for a maximum period of twelve months, upon expiry of which explicit consent shall be required;
- the Commission shall make all information regarding penalties available upon request;
- on account of the direct hazard to health and the environment, information on how packaging should be handled after the chemicals have been removed is extremely important for users;
- the Commission shall be assisted by the same committee as established by REACH Regulation in order to anticipate the future.
- Annex I of this Regulation should be amended to take into account regulatory action in respect of certain chemicals taken pursuant to Directive 76/769/EEC relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations, Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market, Directive 98/8/EC concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market and of other Community legislation. These chemicals are to be added in the existing Regulation 304/2003 through a comitology-decision (due to be taken this year).
- metal arsenic itself and metal mercury itself have been mentioned in this Annex as well as metal mercury Rapporteur Johannes BLOKLAND IND/DEM NL A6-0406/2007 Dangerous chemicals: export and import, implementation of the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure Procedure: Co-decision 1st reading

Monitoring the application of Community law
2008-01-10 - 09:44
Monica FRASSONI (Greens/EFA, IT) will be tabling an own-initiative report for the Legal Affairs Committee on monitoring the application of Community Law (2005). The report notes that the total number of infringement proceedings initiated by the Commission has constantly increased in the last years and reached 2,709 detected infringements in 2003 (for EU 15). The report further notes that the number of detected infringements dramatically decreased in 2004 (by 563) and increased again in 2005, albeit to a level which is lower than in 2003: 2,653 registered infringements (for EU 25).
The Legal Affairs Committee believes that the Commission should be more proactive in monitoring national events which may disclose a breach of Community law. MEPs in the committee call on the Commission, therefore, to make more intensive use of its Representation Offices to prevent or remedy infringements.
The committee also calls on the Member States to go beyond a purely formal transposition of Community legislation and to avoid, as far as possible, the fragmentary transposition of directives with a view to making legislation simpler and more transparent.
European Court of Justice
MEPs call on the Commission to be more firm in applying Article 228 (take the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court of Justice) of the Treaty in order to ensure that judgments of the Court of Justice are properly complied with.
Role of the European Parliament and national parliaments
Finally, the report calls for increased cooperation between national parliaments and the European Parliament and their respective parliamentarians, in order to promote and increase effective scrutiny of European matters at national level. The committee considers that national parliaments have a valuable role to play in monitoring the application of Community law, thus helping to strengthen the democratic legitimacy of the European Union and bring it closer to the citizens.

Agriculture
Remote sensing applications developed within the CAP
2008-01-10 - 09:44
Friedrich-Wilhelm GRAEFE ZU BARINGDORF (Greens/EFA, DE) for the Agriculture Committee will be presenting his non-binding report on remote sensing applications developed within the CAP. In July last year the European Commission proposed to extend a draft pilot project on remote sensing which was launched in 2003 until 2013. The Commission says that the techniques used have proven their efficiency in the domain of the management of CAP notably in terms of predicting yields and the follow-up of ground and earth conditions.
The remote-sensing applications constitute a tool for the Commission to: (a) help manage agricultural markets; (b) allow for agro-economic monitoring such as crop condition in order to estimate yields; (c) promote access to information regarding agricultural land and crop yield estimations; and (d) ensure technological follow-up of the agro-meteorological system.
The committee says the financial framework for the implementation of this programme for the period 2008 to 2013 is hereby set at €9.2 million. The annual appropriations should be authorised by the budgetary authority within the ceilings of the budget headings in the financial framework.
Clarifying the objectives of the regulation
The committee says that Joint Research Centre Agriculture Unit website should making all relevant research data freely available to the public.
The Commission should create an inventory of all spatial data, remote-sensing and agro-meteorological projects and consolidation of existing spatial data infrastructure and websites.
MEPs in the committee also clarify that remote sensing alone is not sufficient to manage agriculture markets. The purpose of the remote-sensing applications is to provide digital information to improve the tools for managing and monitoring the common agricultural policy. However, farm surveys, says the committee, will remain necessary and these applications thus do not suffice for the full management of agricultural markets.

Education
Barriers for adult learning should be lifted, say MEPs
2008-01-10 - 09:44
MEPs will debate and vote on an own-initiative report by Doris Pack (EPP-ED, DE for the Education and Culture Committee on adult learning. Barriers that keep adults from participating in education should be lifted, and the quality of the adult learning should be assured, MEP underline in the report. Millions of adults should participate in lifelong learning in the coming years if the targets set by the Lisbon Strategy in order to increase the knowledge and competitiveness of the European work force are to be reached.
The Education and Culture Committee welcomes the Commission proposal for an Action plan for Adult Learning. The Action Plan was presented by the Commission in September 2007 and aims at removing barriers to the participation in adult learning, to increase the quality and efficiency of the sector, to speed up the process of validation, recognition of qualifications and to ensure sufficient investment and monitoring of the sector.
MEPs in the committee approve the approach by the Commission. They call on Member States to establish a lifelong learning culture, focusing on education and training for adults.
4 million more adults should participate in training
MEPs stress that education and training are critical factors for achieving the Lisbon Strategy and that 4 million more adults would need to participate in lifelong learning if the participation rate of the benchmark agreed by the Member States in the framework of Education and Training 2010-process should be reached. Figures from the Commission Communication show that the goal of 12.5% participation in adult learning by 2010 is far from reached; in the 2006 there was even a slight decrease to 9.6% of participation.
According to Eurostat's latest figures, (see link below) the UK scores highly at 26.6% just behind Sweden and Denmark. Ireland's figure is 7.5%. Life-long learning refers to persons aged 25 to 64 who stated that they received education or training in the four weeks preceding the survey.
In order to improve participation in lifelong learning, the committee urges that more should be done in order to motivate more people to participate, and agrees that special phone lines and websites are very successful means to promote adult education To increase the potential of the adult learning. MEPs in the committee also want to link adult learning to the European Qualification Framework, so the qualifications obtained can be recognised in other Member States.
Lifelong learning during working hours
Lifelong learning should also be compatible with family life, the Committee states, and points out that this calls for social, economic and tax incentives to promote the access for adults to training. MEPs also say that it is important to encourage employers to could provide company childcare facilities for parents who return to work, and assure that these parents have the possibility to continue lifelong learning during working hours. The practice of employers financing and organising of training should become widespread and supported by tax concessions, MEPs believe.
Solidarity between generations
With view to the demographic challenges ahead, MEPs in the committee underline the need to improve the transmission and exchange of knowledge between the generations, in the form of mentoring schemes to support various entrepreneurial and craft activities.
The committee also emphasises the importance of more support for language courses especially those aimed for immigrants, and for encouraging the learning of foreign languages among the population as a whole.

Taxation
Tax treatment of losses in cross-border situations
2008-01-10 - 09:44
Targeted action at EU level to align the currently varying tax treatment of cross-border corporate losses could be of great benefit to the functioning of the internal market, according to a report from the Economics Committee now due for debate and vote in Parliament. The own initiative report, drawn up by Piia-Noora Kauppi (EPP-ED, FI) in response to a Commission communication on the subject, says that differing company tax regimes create obstacles to entering different national markets and the proper functioning of the internal market, distort competition and prevent the maintenance of a level playing field.
The committee stresses that any measure for cross-border loss relief should be defined and implemented on the basis of a multilateral, common approach and coordinated action by Member States. This would only be an intermediate solution, say MEPs in the committee, pending the introduction of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base, which would be a comprehensive long term solution for tax obstacles linked to the cross-border off-setting of profits and losses.
Action in favour of groups of companies doing business in several Member States should be a priority, as these often suffer different treatment from groups operating within one country, which in most Member States are effectively treated as a single entity. While extending domestic regimes is difficult where the tax bases differ, the committee believes that as far as possible, corporate groups present in several Member States should be treated in the same way as those in a single Member State.
While avoiding double taxation, any solution would also need to prevent one loss being off-set twice and tax avoidance The concept of what constitutes a ‘corporate group’ would also need to be carefully defined to avoid opportunistic distribution of profits and losses among Member States.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
The role of women in industry
2008-01-10 - 09:44
MEPs will debate and vote on a non-binding report by Ilda FIGUEIREDO (GUE/NGL, PT) on the role of women in industry which encourages action to promote women’s position in relation to wage equality, working conditions, career opportunities, vocational training, with maternity and paternity being borne in mind as fundamental social values. The Women's rights and Gender Equality Committee encourages Member States to promote female entrepreneurship in the industrial sector and to provide financial support for women setting up companies.
On average, around 14% of women in employment in the EU work in industry, but this figure rises to 25% in some countries; of that average, more than 21% are employed on a part-time basis, and whereas women represent 65% of part-time workers in this sector.
The committee calls on the Commission and the Member States to urge large companies to draw up and introduce their own negotiated equality programmes on a compulsory basis and also to encourage small and medium-sized undertakings to do likewise.
Combat exploitation
The House calls on Member States to take all the necessary measures effectively to combat the exploitation of women at work, which is most common in certain sectors such as the textile industry, in order to ensure that the basic rights of workers, in particular women, are respected and that social dumping is prevented.
The report calls on the Commission and the sectoral social partners to define high standards for health protection at work that take account of the gender dimension, and in particular maternity protection, at the level of research, control and preventive measures. The report notes that women are overrepresented in sectors in which repetitive movements are responsible for occupational diseases such as musculo-skeletal disorders, and that special consideration should be given to such conditions.
Technology sector and training
The committee regrets the low proportion of women in the advanced technology sector and stresses the importance of operational educational and training programmes in science and technology, guaranteeing the quality and diversification of training opportunities for women in the various Member States and the promotion of scientific and technological studies for girls.
Finally, the report calls for Community aid not to be granted to companies which, after benefiting from such funding in a Member State, transfer their production to another country without fully implementing contracts concluded with the Member State concerned.
