Parliament has approved the nomination of Lorenzo BINI SMAGHI to the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (ECB). In a secret ballot, with 410 votes in favour to 88 against with 40 abstentions, MEPs adopted a consultative report from the chair of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, Pervenche BERÈS (PES, FR), giving a positive assessment of his candidature.
Speaking during the debate on Tuesday, Ms Berès said: "There is no doubt about Mr Bini Smaghi's professional experience or his credentials. He will be a good member of the Executive Board. He also brings added value as a good communicator and as someone with a multidisciplinary vision of things. He is willing to take a broader view and is attuned to the real aspirations of EU citizens."
Mr Bini Smaghi took part in a confirmation hearing before the committee on 19 April 2005. More details on the hearing, including Mr Bini Smaghi's CV, can be found here: http://www.europarl.europa.eu/comparl/econ/hearings/20050419/default_en.htm
The final decision on the appointment will be made by agreement between the Member States, at Head of State or Government level.
