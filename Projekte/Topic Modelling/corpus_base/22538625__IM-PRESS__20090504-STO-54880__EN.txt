Thursday marked the last day of debates of the 2004-2009 European Parliamentary term before June's elections As the gavel came down at 1615 on Thursday, it marked the end of the final session of the 2005-2009 European Parliamentary term before elections in June. The parliament's annual human rights report was discussed and MEPs approved funding for a programme to boost the European and International film industry.
Parliament's annual human rights report welcomed the retreat of the death penalty around the world and the progress made on women's and children's rights.
It criticised the fact that the EU does not promote human rights effectively and that the Union often does not live up to its own principles - for example on terrorism and immigration.
In relation to human rights, MEPs also discussed Turkey's EU aspirations. It has been a candidate for EU membership since 2005 and has undertaken many reforms. In particular MEPs welcomed improvements in the freedom of speech.
Many Members called on Turkey to prove that is it still committed to the reform process. They also called for the Kurdish question to be settled and said that institutional reforms thus far were insufficient to warrant full membership.
With regard to Iran MEPs expressed concern at the general deterioration of the human rights situation there. MEPs also condemned the "unfounded sentences" handed down against the American-Iranian journalist Roxana Saberi which was condemned in a resolution by MEPs. Members were concerned about the treatment of trade unionists and the execution of juvenile offenders.
MEPs gave the European and international film industry a boost by approving â‚¬15 million in funding for the Media Mundus programme which pays for international productions, training programmes and professional scholarships.
