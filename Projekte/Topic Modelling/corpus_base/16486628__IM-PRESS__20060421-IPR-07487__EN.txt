2006-04-26 - 17:11
President Josep BORRELL opened the session and presented the revised agenda for approval by the House. This was adopted without further changes from the previously published version, except to note that there would be no resolutions arising from the debate on the suspension of aid to the Palestinian Authority.
Strasbourg uncertainty could delay discharge vote
Acting on a recommendation by the Budgetary Control Committee and rapporteur Markus Ferber (EPP-ED,DE), the Chamber will vote tomorrow on the decision to postpone the 2004 discharge for Parliament following the uncertainty surrounding the purchase by the EP of the Winston Churchill and Salvador de Madariaga buildings in Strasbourg. Parliament is contesting the â‚¬29m compensation that the city of Strasbourg claims from the owner of the two buildings.
If the 2004 discharge is postponed, the report by Mr Ferber will then be referred back to the Budgetary Control Committee. The final decision on the discharge will be made on the basis of the complementary information the EP is expecting to receive on this matter.
This topic will be debated by MEPs in the course of the joint discussion on the 2004 discharge tonight in Brussels at 9pm.
The changes already announced include:
- declarations by Council and Commission on the suspension of aid to the Palestine authority now comes as the 3rd item on Wednesday (without resolution)
- the report of Mr Mavrommatis on multilingualism is moved from Wednesday to Thursday, 2nd item
The session will start at 9.00am on Thursday.
