Jordan's King Abdullah called for "end to conflict"
Wednesday saw the proclamation of Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Hemicycle. It comes just one day before EU leaders sign the Reform Treaty - which gives the Charter legal force. MEPs debated the treaty Wednesday ahead of the meeting of EU leaders on Friday. Climate change, Schengen, anti-terrorism and Kosovo were debated. Jordan's King Abdullah addressed the House and called for support for peace in the Middle East. MEPs adopted a resolution on terrorism and debated combating extremism.
Charter of Fundamental Rights proclaimed "core of European identity"
The three Presidents of the Institutions (Hans-Gert Pöttering, José Sócrates, José Manuel Barroso) proclaimed and signed the Charter of Fundamental Rights on Wednesday. The Charter will gain full legal force under the Reform Treaty.
EP President Pöttering called the proclamation "a fortunate day for the citizens of the EU". "We celebrate today our common values, the core of our European identity". He welcomed the fact it will become legally binding when the Reform Treaty comes into effect, with violations coming within the competence of the European Court of Justice.
Amid a mix of applause and with some eurosceptic MEPs shouting "referendum", Portuguese PM José Sócrates took the floor and said he was honoured that his country was associated with such an event, which he said would reinforce subsidiarity and democracy. Commission President Barroso also praised the Charter and welcomed the fact that it will now be legally binding.
The great majority of MEPs gave the signing ceremony a standing ovation - while small groups of eurosceptic MEPs held up signs saying "referendum" and chanted "referendum".
MEPs debate preparations for EU Council/Reform Treaty
On Thursday EU leaders will sign a new Reform Treaty in Lisbon and then go to Brussels a summit on Friday.
Ahead of the meeting, MEPs debated job creation, the Schengen area, the fight against terrorism, the Bali climate change conference, Kosovo and the recent EU-Africa summit with representatives of the Portuguese Presidency of the Council and Commission President José Manuel Barroso.
MEPs mostly welcomed the imminent signature of the Reform Treaty, and the inclusion of the Charter, seeing it as bringing increased democracy to the EU and underpinning the shared values of its members. However, some MEPs warned that while citizens are demanding more Europe, this does not mean more laws. For a full round up of the debate see the link below.
Jordan's King Abdullah tells MEPs of "spark of hope"
Jordan's King Abdullah was in Strasbourg with a delegation of leading Jordanian MPs to address MEPs. He told the House that the recent Annapolis peace conference has created "a new spark of hope" and that there was "growing hope" in the Middle East.
He called on Europe to support the goal of peace negotiations. He defined this as "a final settlement, creating an end to conflict, security for both Palestine and Israel, a sovereign, independent and viable Palestinian state".
In a bid to improve the situation on the ground, he stressed the importance of "tangible results" - using trade and aid to boost living conditions - particularly for Palestinians. The King, who addressed MEPs five years ago, reminded them that "Europe has a unique experience with post-conflict recovery and reconciliation". Mr Pöttering told the King that "in the search for peace, we are on your side".
Extremism on rise, but EU committed to its values
Following a statement from Commissioner Frattini, MEPs discussed the rise in extremism (terrorist actions, but also racism, xenophobia, islamophobia and other kinds of intolerance). Speakers stressed the fact that the EU is committed to combating intolerance (2007: European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, 2008: European Year of Intercultural Dialogue) and to respecting human rights like those enshrined in the Charter. Speakers also condemned manifestations of extremism - for example racism against Roma minorities.
Earlier on Wednesday, MEPs agreed measures to fight against terrorism, including calls for the media to inform people about the dangers of "hate speech" and for the EU's Agency for Fundamental Rights to be given a "clear mandate" to investigate extremist groups.
Key votes
Car parts - MEPs backed plans to open Europe's market in spare car parts and other machinery, meaning companies other than motor manufacturers will be able to design and sell car parts, which could lead to lower prices for consumers.
Wine reform - As the largest producer and exporter of wine, the EU industry is worth millions of euros a year and employs thousands of people. MEPs opposed the liberalisation of planting rights and want subsidies for "grubbing up" (taking vines out of commission) to be distributed over three years rather than the five proposed.
