Bonuses for bankers to be curbed Boat passengers to get more rights The last Parliamentary session before the recess saw Members approve crucial steps that will cap banker's bonuses and set up a Europe system to regulate Europe's financial markets. The week also saw more rights for boat passengers and tighter rules on industrial emissions. Spain's EU Presidency also bowed out and Belgium took over at the helm. A ban on food from cloned animals was also endorsed by the House.
Bankers' bonuses capped and cut
Once more, several plenary debates were related to the economic and financial situation . On Wednesday, Parliament called for financial supervision package, adopting a resolution on banking crisis management and voted on the salaries of directors of listed companies and policies in the financial services sector. The texts approved included a report with recommendations to the Commission on Cross-Border Crisis Management in the Banking Sector, another on the establishment of a European Securities and Markets Authority.
Green light for EU diplomatic corps
The week was notable for MEPs strongly supporting the establishment of the European Union's nascent diplomatic corps - the External Action Service. After a debate between MEPs and High Representative Catherine Ashton the House approved a resolution clarifying the Service's staffing, budget and administration.
Parliament gives green light for SWIFT II
The new version of the SWIFT anti-terrorist agreement on bank data transfers to the US was approved by the European Parliament on Thursday. MEPs rejected the agreement in its previous form four months ago but since then have negotiated certain safeguards for Europe's citizens and won an undertaking that the EU will start work in the second half of this year on a European data processing system that precludes the need to transfer data in bulk to the US.
The recommendation that Parliament approve the agreement, drafted by German Liberal Alexander Alvaro was adopted by 484 votes to 109 with 12 abstentions. The agreement is due to take effect on 1 August this year.
"In February Parliament sent a very clear message. We made it known that the Lisbon Treaty has given us more opportunities and more responsibility", said Mr Alvaro in Tuesday's debate ahead of the vote. "During the negotiations, Parliament was able to make sure that improvements were incorporated into the agreement".
Mr Alvaro also stressed that the agreement will not cover financial transactions between EU states but only those to non-EU countries. Article 4 of the accord rules out transfers of any data relating to the Single Euro Payments Area.
Adiós Spain, bienvenue-welkom-willkommen Belgium!
Spanish PM Zapatero faced friends and critics in the hemicycle while presenting the results of his 6-month EU Presidency . Belgian PM Yves Leterme presented his programme the following day: economy, environment and fighting unemployment are among his priorities.
Better protected boat passengers
As of 2012 the rights of passengers of regular boat and ferry services will be extended. New regulation approved by EP on 6 July enshrines rules on assistance and compensation in cases of delays. Cancellation or a 1.5 h late departure will give right to be rerouted, returned to the initial port of departure or fully reimbursed. In addition, depending on the delay, compensations of 25-50% of the ticket price will be paid out. Boat passengers will have more rights than air passengers.
Ban on food from cloned animals
Does Dolly the sheep now really belong to a museum? MEPs approved the ban of food from cloned animals from the European market. They are concerned about potential risks for the human health. Nevertheless, they should still negotiate with European governments to reach an agreement.
Stricter rules on industrial emissions
The EP overwhelmingly approved second reading report drafted by a German Liberal MEP Holger Krahmer. This means more stringent updated rules on industrial air pollution , with strict limits for nitrous oxides, sulphur dioxides and dust particles, which are particularly harmful to health and the environment. Thousands of industrial plants across the EU will be affected by the Industrial Emissions Directive, which will impose tougher restraints on emissions of nitrous oxides, sulphur dioxide and dust by 2016.
MEPs back Iceland's EU ambitions
The prospect of Iceland becoming a new EU Member State is welcomed in a resolution adopted on Wednesday by the European Parliament. The controversy of repayments to British and Dutch governments following the collapse of Icelandic banks needs to be resolved "bilaterally", adds the resolution. Iceland is also asked to cease all whaling.
