The European Parliament adopted a resolution requesting all Member States to at least provide for the possibility - after a court ruling - of withdrawing public funding from political parties that do not condemn violence and terrorism and do not respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, democracy and the rule of law as set out in the ECHR and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
The House also calls on those that already have this possibility to do so without delay; also calls on the Commission to ensure that no EU funding is available to media which are used as a platform to widely promote racist, xenophobic and homophobic ideas.
The text, adopted by 527 votes in favour, 15 against and 39 abstentions, calls on the Commission to support NGOs and civil society organisations devoted to promoting democratic values, human dignity, solidarity, social inclusion, inter-cultural dialogue and social awareness of the dangers of radicalisation and violent extremism, and which are devoted to fighting all forms of discrimination.
The resolution also calls on the Commission to ensure that no EU funding is available to media which are used as a platform to widely promote racist, xenophobic and homophobic idea.
Islamic fundamentalist recruitment and anti-Semitism
MEPs also say that they are "seriously alarmed at the Islamic fundamentalist recruitment and violent propaganda campaign with terrorist attacks within the European Union, based on hatred of European values and on anti-Semitism."
MEPs stress that public personalities should "refrain from statements that encourage or incite to hate or stigmatisation of groups of people on the basis of their race, ethnic origin, religion, handicap, sexual orientation or nationality" and believe that being a public personality should be considered as an aggravating circumstance when inciting to hatred. Furthermore, on an amendment adopted by 450 votes in favour, 93 against and 30 abstentions, MEPs warn, looking to the 2009 European elections, "of the possibility that extremist parties may secure representation in the European Parliament and calls on the political groups to take the appropriate measures in order to ensure that a democratic institution is not used as a platform for financing and echoing anti-democratic messages".
The resolution calls on the EU institutions to give a clear mandate to the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights to investigate on the structures of extremist groups, and for governments to give appropriate preventive responses.
MEPs urge the Commission and Council to lead the search for appropriate political and legal responses, especially at the preventive stage with reference to young people's education and public information, teaching against totalitarianism and disseminating the principles of human rights and fundamental freedoms in order to keep alive the memory of European history; calls upon the Member States to develop policies of education for democratic citizenship based on citizens' rights and responsibilities.
MEPs also express their concern on how to counteract the existence of public and easily accessible websites which incite to hatred without violating freedom of expression.
The resolution says that neo-Nazi, paramilitary and other extremisms are directing their violent attacks against a wide variety of vulnerable population groups, including migrants, Roma, homosexuals, antiracist activists and the homeless.
On 29 November, Parliament also adopted a consultation report to harden a future EU law to combat certain forms of racism and xenophobia, including the establishment of criminal sanctions -from one to three years of prison- to any public incitement to violence or hatred, even by dissemination or distribution of tracts, pictures or other material. The legislative text - first European law of this kind, which still needs to be transposed by Member States -, also includes punishment for the denial or gross trivialisation of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.
