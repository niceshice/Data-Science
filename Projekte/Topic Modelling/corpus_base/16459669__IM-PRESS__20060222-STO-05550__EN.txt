Bird flu knows no borders

Bird flu in 6 EU countries
Migrating birds are highlighting the fact, if we weren't already aware of it, that Europe has no borders and that there are areas where the EU has an indispensable role. For months now, it has been “all hands on deck” as European institutions combat the threat posed by the bird flu virus.
The H5N1 virus has now been identified in six EU Member States. National surveillance networks have demonstrated their effectiveness by updating and coordinating information at the European level, and containment plans are immediately put into action. So what more can be done? Europe’s response is to play an active role at all levels.
On Monday, it was agriculture ministers who were discussing whether or not all poultry should be vaccinated and whether poultry producers, who are already facing sharp falls in consumption in several countries, should be compensated (even though no European poultry have yet been struck by the virus). No decisions were taken at that meeting, but it was then the turn of veterinary experts from the Member States, who were due to meet on Tuesday to weigh up the pros and cons of vaccination. While such injections can protect the birds that have been treated, they can also conceal a potential infection and, paradoxically, make it harder to combat the virus.
Following the agriculture ministers’ meeting, health ministers from EU countries and EU candidate countries will hold an emergency meeting in Vienna on Friday at the invitation of Austria, the current holder of the EU presidency. They will be able to hear the advice of experts from the World Health Organisation and, in particular, that of experts from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. The Centre, which has been in operation since May 2005, is a new European agency, created in 2004. The current bird flu alert marks a real baptism of fire for the centre, which collects information and provides scientific expertise to all the European institutions (see the website link below).
At this stage, the Parliament’s role is mainly consultative, but it can also pose questions and seek explanations from other institutions. So while agriculture ministers were meeting on Monday, MEPs on the Agricultural Committee were able to question Markos Kyprianou, the European Commissioner responsible for health and consumer protection, about the latest developments and new measures being taken. In December, Parliament adopted a report on EU-wide measures on the fight against bird flu which called for certain areas to be strengthened. These covered developing oral vaccines for poultry, strengthening national emergency plans and coordination facilities, providing workers in the industry with more information and offering them greater protection as well as more proactive moves to coordinate the development of vaccines for human use and in building up antiviral stocks.
