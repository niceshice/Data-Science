In the resolution entitled "HIV/AIDS: early diagnosis and early care", MEPs call on the Council and the Commission to formulate a strategy on HIV to promote early diagnosis. They ask for a reduction of barriers to anonymous testing and want the two authorities to communicate on the benefits of earlier care. The resolution was adopted with 480 votes in favour, 4 against and 10 abstentions.
The European Parliament asks for monitoring and surveillance by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. The deputies insist on more precise estimates of the undiagnosed population. Indeed, EuroHIV and UNAIDS report that the estimated number of people infected with HIV in some countries is almost three times higher than the official number.
MEPs call on the Member States to enact discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS, including restrictions that impact on their freedom of movement. They also ask them to step up information and education campaigns on the prevention, testing and treatment of HIV/AIDS as 11% of all new HIV infections affect young people under the age of 25 in the European Union, according to the EuroHIV end-year report 2006.
