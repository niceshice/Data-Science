It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people may be affected each year in Europe. In a seminar MEPs urged greater emphasis on this issue. As Parliament's rapporteur Anna Hedh said it "is 2010 and women are still sold into slavery - even though slavery was abolished long ago". The Swedish Socialist believes Europe is engaged in an "every day struggle" against it.
An EP resolution in February stressed that "victims of human trafficking, especially women and children, should receive protection and "unconditional" assistance".
The European Commission tabled new proposals aimed at "preventing and combating trafficking in human beings, and protecting victims" in March.
The proposals propose a broader concept of what should be considered trafficking including "forced begging". This is an area where children are at particular risk and may be complicated as sometimes parents are complicit or the trafficker.
A "low risk crime"
According to several of Europe's police forces present at the seminar, trafficking in people is the third most lucrative form of crime after drugs and weapons.
However, trafficking is still seen as a "low risk" activity for criminals. Steve Harvey of Europol's Serious Crime Department said, "we still do not have the hostile environment that makes traffickers think twice".
He also said that patterns of trafficking were changing: "Five years ago it was easy to point to a map and say where people were being trafficked from. This is not the case today. Since Schengen opened its borders, this has facilitated trafficking."
Martina García Aranda from the Spanish presidency of the EU said the proposal would also punish clients using a service if they knew that the person was a victim of trafficking.
In Sweden those seeking sex from people who have been trafficked can face criminal prosecution. Mats Paulsson of Gothenburgs anti-trafficking unit, said the Swedish model of criminalisation of sex purchasing has made it possible to bring down demand.
Slovak centre right MEP Ms Edit Bauer is Parliament's co-rapporteur on this issue. Closing the seminar she said, "we have a real responsibility, it is important that there should be a European approach".
