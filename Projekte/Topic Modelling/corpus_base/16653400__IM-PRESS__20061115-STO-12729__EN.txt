People talking about Europe in a citizen's forum
The European Union wants to communicate better with the citizens - the aim of which is reducing the apparent "gap" between the EU and the people. On Thursday MEPs will vote on a report which considers the European Commission's latest proposals to reach out to the public. They would like to see more information about the affairs of the EU on TV and in the newspapers and magazines, although they rejected a "code of conduct" on how the institutions of the Union should communicate with the people.
Why a new communication strategy?
When French and then Dutch voters voted "no" to the proposed European Constitution in the spring of 2005 - a considerable amount of soul searching took place as to how the EU should communicate with the people.
The Commission launched "plan D" aimed at fostering greater "dialogue and democracy" whilst a period of reflection took place around Europe.
As the only directly elected body in the EU institutions, the European Parliament has a particular interest in how the "message of Europe" is communicated. As part of this, in the spring of this year it initiated the "Citizens forums" across the EU bringing together the public and local, national and European elected officials. All subjects were up for discussion - it was driven by the people.
Keep it local
In February the Commission unveiled a consultation paper with some proposals on how to communicate better. In addition to this the Parliament decided to add its contribution to the debate. A report on this new communication policy was adopted last month by its Culture Committee.
The report also underlines that to reach citizens it was important to show the relevance of EU decisions in their daily lives. The report also stresses the importance of regions and cities in informing people about what the Union is doing.
It also wants to increase the use of simple and concise language and to avoid the use of "EU jargon", which increases rather than closes the gap between institutions and citizens.
A better use of new communication technologies, accompanied with measures to prevent the "digital divide" making access to information even more difficult - are also among the proposals submitted by the Culture Committee to the plenary this November.
The report rejected a Commission suggestion for guidelines and a code of conduct for all EU institutions. A final report taking into account the different angles is due by the Commission in March next year
