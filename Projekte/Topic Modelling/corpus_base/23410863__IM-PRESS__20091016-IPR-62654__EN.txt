A strong appeal for the abolition of capital punishment was issued by EP President Jerzy Buzek as he opened this week's plenary session in Strasbourg with a reference to European Day against the Death Penalty.
International Day for the Abolition of the Death Penalty - 10th October - has also since 2007 been European Day against the Death Penalty, pointed out President Buzek. He regretted that the death penalty continued to be used in one European country, Belarus, and also highlighted its use in China, Iran and the United States. "I would like to reiterate our appeal to every country still applying the death penalty to abolish it or establish, pending its abolition, a moratorium on executions and death sentences", he said.
On other topics, the President mentioned the signing of the Lisbon Treaty by Polish President Kaczynski and said "I am convinced that we will find a solution with the Czech Republic in the near future".
Turning to the coming week's agenda in Strasbourg, Mr Buzek highlighted a new feature of Parliament's plenary sessions: Question Hour with Commission President Barroso. The first such debate, scheduled for Tuesday at 3pm, "will make debates more lively and will open up our discussions even further", said Mr Buzek.
A request by the EPP group to alter the title of Wednesday's vote on motions for resolutions on "Freedom of information in Italy and other EU Member States" to "Freedom of information in the European Union" was defeated by 231 votes to 195 with 9 abstentions.
