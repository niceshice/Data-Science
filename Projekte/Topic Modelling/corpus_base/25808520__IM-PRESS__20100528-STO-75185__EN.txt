MEP Thomas Mann in his office in Brussels on 2 June Old and young squeezed in job market Own initiative report offers some solutions Both young and old people are often squeezed out of the labour market and find it difficult to find jobs. The 15-24 age group has the highest unemployment of any group and just half of 55-64 year olds are in work. We interviewed centre right German MEP Thomas Mann who has just drafted a report called "solidarity between generations" which he shared with Members of Parliament's Employment Committee on 1 June.
You underlined the need to promote active ageing and the employment of people above 60 and you insist on the need to tackle youth unemployment. How can the European economy realistically improve employment at both ends of the age spectrum?
The labour market and economy will undergo major structural changes. There will be more "older workers", more retired people and more people aged 80 plus. There will also be fewer children, young people and adults of working age. You cannot solve multiple problems by single solutions.
Therefore, I propose a package of measures. For example the "European Youth Guarantee" under which every young person would be offered a job after six monthsâ€™ unemployment. With regard to older people I suggest a "50-plus pact". It contains the demand to increase the employment rate of people aged over 50 to above 55% as well as the gradual elimination of early retirement, more people of all ages in further and higher education and incentives for over 60s to remain at work.
The pact should be accompanied by specific measures such as the development of mixed-age teams within companies and steps to review and remove age limits.
Longer working lives and lower pensions are usually seen as the only answer to the demographic and budgetary challenges facing Europe. Is there no other way out?
There are many ways to reach the goal. I show in my report that family, migration, economic or active ageing policies also offer important approaches.
Thee facilitation of work and family life balance, a child-centred view, a focus on the contribution of young and older people to society can also help.
You speak about monitoring the efforts of European governments in this area. Has progress been slow? What could be done to improve both monitoring and implementation of the strategy, especially in this age of severe budgetary constraints?
The main instruments for bringing about intergenerational justice are in the hands of the Member States. The potential for European added value lies in creating the necessary premises and tools for an open and frank dialogue between the generations, with a view to achieving win-win situations.
The European Commission and the European governments should therefore introduce generational accounting on the basis of the Eurostat (the EU's statistical agency) sustainable development indicators in all countries and at EU level. The aim is to produce reliable models and forecasts of payment flows between the generations and the degree to which each generation will benefit or be burdened.
