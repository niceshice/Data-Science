Two proposals to provide EU Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) aid worth a total of €9,506,036 for workers who were made redundant in Austria, and one request by Commission for €610,000 to cover its EGF administrative expenses, were backed by the Budgets Committee on Wednesday.
Austria applied for €8,284,908 to help find new jobs for 356 redundant workers formerly employed by 54 firms in the Steiermark and Niederoesterreichmetal regions. Altogether,1,180 employees of these firms lost their jobs.
A further €1,221,128 was requested to help find new jobs 74 workers at the printed circuit board manufacturer AT&S, in eastern Upper Styria. Altogether, 167 AT&S workers lost their jobs.
The Budgets Committee also agreed to mobilise €610,000 from the EGF to cover the European Commission's administrative needs for managing, monitoring and evaluating EFG programmes and sharing best practices with Member States. Up to 0.35% of EGF funding can be made available each year for technical assistance, at the initiative of the Commission, to finance activities necessary to implement the EGF Regulation.
Rapporteur Barbara Matera (EPP, IT), welcomed the fact that, after Parliament's repeated requests that the EGF be given its own budget, for the first time the 2011 budget shows payment appropriations of €47,608,950 on the EGF budget line. This was achieved by means of an amending budget.
Next steps
The full Parliament and the Council of Ministers now have to give their approval. The Council is expected to decide on Monday, and Parliament's plenary vote is scheduled for 14 September.
Background
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was established to provide additional support for workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation or the financial crisis and to assist them with their reintegration into the labour market. The fund's annual ceiling is €500 million.
