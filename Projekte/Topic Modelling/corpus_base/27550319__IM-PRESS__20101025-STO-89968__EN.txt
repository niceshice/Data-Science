Tweet your MEP! Facebook,Twitter etc can provide "feedback" from people say some MEPs Allows people "extraordinary access to information" This autumn one MEP is leading the way and organising classes on how fellow MEPs can use social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter to reach out to voters. French Member Damien Abad (EPP) is behind the course and here we speak to him as well as Portuguese Socialist MEP Edite Estrela, Italian Liberal Sonia Alfano and Spanish Green Raül Romeva i Rueda.
Why are you active on social media platforms? (eg Facebook and Twitter)
Edite Estrela: Social media is one of the means to stay in touch with the people who elected me. Sometimes European citizens have the feeling that Brussels is too far away and that the media don't pay enough attention to work of the European Parliament.
Sonia Alfano: Social media represents an incredible tool to reach out to an incredible amount of citizens. It also gives citizens the chance to get to know their politicians in a different way: what they do, which music they like, if they are "pissed off" because they missed their plane or had a fight with their husband.
But does the use of social media really make it easier for people to understand EU-politics or is it just hype?
Raül Romeva i Rueda: Yes, it does, that's exactly why I started to use social media. As a MEP I felt frustrated. The general opinion was that the Parliament wasn't doing anything - people simply didn't know about our work. With social media platforms I can explain life in the Parliament. Now people come to me and say: "Thanks to you at least we understand what the Parliament is doing".
A recent survey found that American politicians in Washington are much better at using social media than MEPs. Why are MEPs lacking behind?
Damien Abad: Often politicians don't know how to use all these new tools. That's why I decided to start up my new classes. I would like to create an education system for MEPs. We want to show that we can make politics in a different way. Nowadays social media give the citizens an extraordinary access to information.
What are the advantages of social media compared to traditional forms of communication?
Edite Estrela: Our messages are more efficiently passed on and it's easier to reach out to younger people.
Raül Romeva i Rueda: Social media represents "horizontal communication". Now you can not only explain, but also receive feedback. As a citizen I wouldn't be interested in slogans, but rather look for dialogue and exchange of opinions. And that's exactly what social media allows us to do.
What are the dangers of using social media?
Edite Estrela: Sometimes it is hard to avoid fake information or destructive comments.
Will social media still play an important role in modern politics in 10 years?
Raül Romeva i Rueda: No idea. If you would have told me ten years ago that I would become so addicted to Facebook and Twitter, I would just have laughed at you. Maybe we will attend the plenary sessions by Skype in 10 years. Who knows?
