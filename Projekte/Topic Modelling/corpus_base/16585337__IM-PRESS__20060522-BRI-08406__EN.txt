Briefing : 12-15 June 2006 : Strasbourg
2006-06-08 - 11:29
MEPs will debate the European Council which will take place in Brussels on 15-16 June 2006 with one of the key topics being the Constitutional Treaty after the French and Dutch "no" votes. Parliament will tackle the future of European research and development with two reports on the 7th Framework Programme for research. MEPs will also be questioning the Commission on its efforts to combat and prevent preventing trafficking in human beings and forced prostitution during the World Cup in Germany .
Monday 12th June
Michael CASHMAN 's report (PES, UK) on the work of the Petitions Committee highlights the need to ensure that "response times … become shorter, investigations even more effective and its service … equally available to all citizens of the EU".
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality will be asking the Commission what special measures has the Commission taken or does it intend to take for combating and preventing trafficking in human beings and forced prostitution during 2006 football World Cup , if the Commission has considered practical options for launching a European Day against trafficking in human beings, as well as Germany's measures in place and the effective working with NGOs.
Tuesday 13th June
MEPs are likely to broadly throw their weight behind the Commission's proposals on the future of European research and development for the period 2007-2013. However, there is likely to be heated debate on the funding of embryonic stem cell research.
Parliament will also vote on a report by Stephen HUGHES (PES, UK) on p rotecting workers against the risk of infection from contaminated needles. Every year around a million workers in Europe, mainly in the medical world, suffer injuries from used surgical needles. The consequences can be serious, including infections from HIV or hepatitis B or C. The EP Social Affairs Committee wants to improve existing EU legislation so as to give workers better protection. Parliament will vote on this topic following the postponement from the last plenary in Brussels.
The House will also debate series of reports dealing with protection of personal data as well as non-discrimination and equal opportunities. Parliament will also debate the human rights situation in Tunisia and will adopt a resolution on the subject. MEPs will also adopt a resolution and debate EU-Russia relations following the EU-Russia Summit of 26 May.
Wednesday 14th June
The key debate of the plenary agenda focuses on preparations for the European Council to be held on 15-16 June 2006 in Brussels . The Austrian Presidency 's agenda consists of three headings: Europe Listens, discussing the future after France and the Netherlands' rejection of the Constitution, Europe at Work, citizens' security and life in the European Union, and A Work Plan for the Future, including subjects that will concern the EU in the near future. The resolution will focus on Romania's and Bulgaria's progress towards accession.
On Wednesday afternoon, the House will also debate the i ncrease in racist and homophobic violence in Europe.
Seán Ó NEACHTAIN 's (UEN, IE) report on inshore fishing and the problems encountered by inshore fishermen and underlines the sector's "vital contribution" not only to local economies but also to maintaining the social fabric of coastal communities and preserving cultural traditions and practices.
Thursday 15th June
MEPs are set to back Slovenia's ambitions to join the euro zone following the report from the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which approves the Commission’s proposal. MEPs will also debate a report on protection of the financial interests of the Communities and the fight against fraud , criticising individual Member States' efforts and the Commission's lack of efforts to improve the situation. Parliament will also vote on the 7th Framework programme for research, debated on Tuesday morning.
The session ends with debates and votes on human rights issues in East Timor, Syria and North Korea. 20060522BRI08406

European Council
Preparing for the June EU Summit
2006-06-08 - 11:29
The key debate of the plenary agenda focuses on preparations for the European Council to be held on 15-16 June 2006 in Brussels – immediately after the plenary session. The Austrian Presidency has put forward an agenda under three headings: Europe Listens, Europe at Work and A Work Plan for the Future.
Under ‘Europe Listens’ EU leaders will take stock of the reflection period following the rejection of the proposed EU Constitution in referendums in France and the Netherlands. They will also consider ways to improve the EU’s communication efforts.
‘Europe at Work’ addresses a range of current issues: protecting the security of Europe’s citizens, giving greater clarity on how the EU operates, and preserving and developing the European way of life.
Finally, the ‘Work Plan for the Future’, will look at subjects to be dealt with over the months to come, notably how to make the EU operate better under the existing treaties.

Industry
Broad backing expected for 7th Framework Research Programme
2006-06-08 - 11:29
The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy is broadly throwing its weight behind the Commission's proposals on the future of European research and development for the period 2007-2013. MEPs in the committee endorse the overall structure of the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7), which will consist of four specific programmes covering a number of thematic areas.
Budget
The committee is proposing an amendment to bring the budget of the programme into line with the agreement on the Financial Perspective: the seven-year programme will have a budget of €50,862 million compared to the €72,726 million originally proposed by the Commission. In further proposed amendments to the first-reading report by Jerzy BUZEK (EPP-ED, PL), MEPs in the committee modify the allocation of these funds among the different parts of the programme in line with their preferences.
Support for SMEs, young researchers and women
MEPs in the committee are keen to increase the involvement in FP7 of small and medium-sized firms (SMEs), and to boost the position of young researchers and women in science.
For SMEs, one way is to ensure that they gain better access to pre-funding. If SME-specific instruments should become oversubscribed, MEPs want the financing of the various FP instruments to be reviewed with the aim of directing funds towards the instruments that are in demand.
Other amendments proposed are to encourage young researchers and support the early stages of their scientific careers, and to introduce measures to reduce the "brain drain" such as reintegration grants. MEPs in the committee also want to see efforts to bring more women researchers into the programmes.
Real autonomy for European Research Council
Members in the committee welcome the proposed creation of a European Research Council - a new instrument to support investigator-driven “frontier research” - but want to be sure it enjoys real autonomy. They suggest it should initially be set up as an Executive Agency and - after a brief transition phase - become an independent structure. The Commission is therefore asked to present a proposal to Parliament and Council, under the codecision procedure, to "implement the ERC as a permanent, legally independent structure ". By 2008, says the committee, an independent review must be carried out of the ERC's structures and mechanisms, following which the structures and mechanisms of the ERC could be modified.
To avoid top-heavy administration, MEPs in the committee propose an amendment calling for administrative and staffing costs for the ERC to account for not more than 3 % of the annual ERC budget.
Ethical questions
Turning to ethical issues, Members in the committee argue that FP7 must not finance research aimed at human cloning for reproductive purposes, research intended to modify the genetic heritage of human beings which could make such changes inheritable or research intended to create human embryos solely for the purpose of research or the purpose of stem cell procurement, including by means of somatic cell nuclear transfer.
However, research on the use of human stem cells, both adult and embryonic, may be financed depending both on the contents of the scientific proposal and the legal framework of the Member State(s) involved. As regards the use of human embryonic stem cells, the institutions, organisations and researchers must be subject to strict licensing and control in accordance with the legal framework of the Member State(s) involved.
Priorities for financing under FP7
A wide range of amendments deal with the nine thematic areas which are broadly defined in the Commission's proposal. MEPs in the committee support the selection of these nine thematic areas but wish to broaden and clarify the Commission's definitions. They also add for each of the areas a number of activities which they feel merit Community support. Lastly, MEPs in the committee want to split the area "security and space" into two separate headings. Thus the following ten areas would be funded via FP7:
- Health
- Food, Agriculture and Biotechnology
- Information and Communication Technologies
- Nanosciences, Nanotechnologies, Materials and new Production Technologies
- Energy
- Environment (including Climate Change)
- Transport (including Aeronautics)
- Socio-economic Sciences and the Humanities
- Security
- Space
Review
The Industry Committee wants the Framework Programme to be continuously and systematically reviewed. It says the Commission should not carry out just one evaluation - in 2010 - but at least two interim assessments (in 2009 and 2011). Specifically on ethical questions, MEPs in the committee say the research fields must be reviewed in the second phase of FP7 in the light of scientific progress.
Stem cell research
The relevant specific programme explicitly excludes EU funding for research that involves human reproductive cloning, the creation of human embryos for research (including by means of therapeutic cloning) and research that intends to change the genetic heritage of human beings.
Concerning research using embryonic stem cells the Commission does fund projects using this technique, but only under very strict conditions: the cells can only come from embryos which were already created for in-vitro fertilisation purposes, but not used, and where explicit consent has been given for their use for research. In this way we avoid creating any sort of pressure for the donation of eggs. The team must justify their use scientifically and show that other types of stem cells, such as from umbilical cords, are not appropriate. The project must then undergo an ethical review at European level and in every country where the research will be carried out. Nothing will be financed in a country that does not allow such research nationally. Finally, each project must be approved by a committee of all 25 Member States. According to the Commission, the EU has thus the most sophisticated monitoring system on ethics and research ever established in a public institution.
Commissioner Potocnik proposes continuing the system used in FP6 for FP7.
Which Member States allow research using human embryonic stem cells (hESC)?
Belgium , UK and Sweden allow therapeutic cloning, which is expressly excluded from FP6.
Denmark , Finland, France, Greece, Spain, Netherlands have regulations allowing the derivation of new hESC from supernumerary IVF embryos.
Estonia , Hungary, Latvia and Slovenia have no specific regulations on hESC, but allow some research on supernumerary IVF embryos.
Germany and Italy have regulations which restrict hESC research. These regulations mean that scientists in these countries cannot derive new hESC, but can import them. In Germany, these cells have to have been derived before 1 January 2002.
Austria , Lithuania and Poland have legislation prohibiting hESC research.
What is the worldwide situation?
In the US, federal funds are restricted to funding research on hESC derived before 9 August 2001. There are no restrictions for industrial, private or state funds, though some states are currently reviewing their funding rules. New rules are currently going through the US legislative process.
China , India, Israel, Singapore and South Korea currently allow therapeutic cloning.
Australia , Brazil, Canada, Japan, Switzerland and Taiwan have regulations allowing the derivation of hESC from supernumerary IVF embryos. The Swiss rules were approved by a public referendum in November 2004.
Euratom Framework Programme
The committee adopted a second report by Mr Buzek on the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) for nuclear research and training activities (2007-2011). The overall budget of this programme will be €2751 million, compared to the original Commission proposal of €3092 million.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Forced prostitution during the 2006 football World Cup
2006-06-08 - 11:29
Anna ZÁBORSKÁ (EPP-ED, SK), on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality will be asking the Commission the following question on forced prostitution during 2006 football World Cup:
At the seminar held by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality on the occasion of International Women's Day (8 March), the Commission representatives made a few proposals for combating the problem of forced prostitution and trafficking in women and children for sexual purposes during the forthcoming football World Cup in Germany.
1. What special measures has the Commission taken or does it intend to take under the EU plan on best practices, standards and procedures for combating and preventing trafficking in human beings, adopted by the Council on 1-2 December 2005, with a view to the forthcoming football World Cup? Has any campaigning material been produced at EU level and what cooperation has there been with NGOs?
2. Has Germany informed the Commission of the practical measures it intends to take, in particular a multilingual direct hotline to assist victims of trafficking?
3. Has the Commission taken measures in cooperation with Europol, the main European instrument for combating trafficking in human beings, in relation to the World Cup?
4. Has the Commission considered practical options for launching a European Day against trafficking in human beings, in order to raise public awareness of the seriousness of the issue of trafficking and forced prostitution? Have the Member States and representatives of civil society been involved, given that this kind of initiative should be supported by the largest possible number of people?
5. What measures has the Commission taken in agreement with Germany and the other Member States to alert embassies and consulates to the issue of forced prostitution and ask them to take the necessary steps to identify cases of trafficking in women and provide support for potential victims ?

Environment
Flood assessment and management
2006-06-08 - 11:29
Richard Seeber (EPP-ED, AT) for the Environment Committee will be putting forward a legislative report on the assessment and management of floods
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety says that one needed to expand the definition of the territories concerned. It states that one needs to refer to flood risks rather than floods and that the areas which could be subject to erosion of flood terraces and slopes of river valleys and to bank erosion and debris flow deposition needed to be included in the management proposal as the previous version referred only to damage to coastal areas, whereas most flooding in Europe affects river valleys.
MEPs in the committee emphasise the importance of the environment as this framework will help to attain the environmental objectives laid down in the Community legislation in force in addition to assessing and managing of flood risks aiming at the reduction of the adverse consequences on human health, the environment and economic activity associated with floods in the Community. They note that flooding per se is not a risk to the environment, but that flood damage to the environment mainly occurs through damages to human property and the release of dangerous chemicals. The committee proposes the drawing up of flood maps showing the installations that might cause accidental environmental pollution as a consequence of flooding.
The report says the aim of the Directive is not only the reduction of flood risks, but also the management of such risks. Therefore Member States shall, at the level of the river basin district, prepare flood maps and indicative flood damage maps, hereinafter “flood risk maps”, for the river basins, sub-basins and stretches of coastline identified. Existing maps prepared by Member States which meet the requirements of this Directive may be used for this purpose in order to avoid unnecessary costs. In addition, the Member States should therefore be allowed some discretion as to what investigation period or what likely return period they wish to use as the basis for their high-probability flooding maps.
Concerning areas beyond national borders, MEPs in the committee said that in the case of shared river basins, sub-basins or stretches of coastline, Member States shall cooperate in the implementation of the Directive. The report aims to ensure that in the case of shared river basins Member States are required to coordinate when determining the levels of protection. This is a particularly important safeguard for downstream countries. Furthermore, in the case of an international river basin district extending beyond the boundaries of the Community, where one single international flood risk management plan including any third country concerned is not produced, the Member State or Member States concerned shall endeavour to establish appropriate coordination with the relevant third countries, with the aim of achieving the objectives of this Directive throughout the river basin district.
The committee states that the flood risk management plans shall include measures the flood risk management plan shall also include an assessment of rescue and recovery measures and that the impact of climate change shall be taken into account in drawing up this report.

Groundwater: our most important natural resource
2006-06-08 - 11:29
"Groundwater is our most important natural resource. Over half of the EU's groundwater sources are polluted. Once polluted they can no longer be cleaned up. Hence the importance of protecting them." This, in the words of Parliament's rapporteur Christa Klass (EPP-ED, DE) is the key issue being tackled by a new European directive.
Ms Klass, whose second-reading recommendation on the protection of groundwater against pollution was adopted unopposed by the Environment Committee, will now present it to the plenary session. MEPs in the committee were not happy with the Council's common position, which they said did not pay sufficient attention to prevention. A number of first-reading amendments were reintroduced.
The text adopted by the committee does not impose single standards for all countries, except for nitrates and pesticides, but it does seek to harmonise methods for measuring potential pollutants. MEPs wish to beef up the directive on a number of points, by improving sampling methodologies, tightening up the wording of the legislation and closing loopholes to prevent the directive being undermined. As in the water framework directive, the notion of "deterioration" is absent. Parliament wants to enlarge the scope of the directive by including a definition of deterioration which would mean "any slight, anthropogenically induced and persistent increase in concentrations of pollutants in relation to the status quo in the groundwater". MEPs in the committee also want to include two other notions: background concentration and baseline concentration.
Where the rules on nitrates and pesticides would require changes to farming practices, MEPs suggest providing special aid through the rural development plans which will be drawn up under the reformed common agricultural policy. For around ten other substances, the directive leaves it up to Member States to lay down limit values. These threshold must be established by December 2008 at the latest. Arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury and sulphates are concerned. The resultant range of national standards should, however, be the subject of an impact study on the environment and the single market.
The standards adopted should be reviewed five years after the entry into force of the directive (i.e. 2011 if the legislative procedure is completed in 2006) and every six years thereafter. In addition, MEPs in the committee want the directive to be the subject of an overall efficiency assessment by 2015.
Among other improvements introduced by the committee are the establishment of a common methodology for the protection of spa and medicinal waters and tougher rules, e.g. to ensure that catchment areas for drinking water are indeed protected by the new directive when industrial and urban activities are planned, since in most Member States drinking water is usually taken from groundwater.

Ensuring free public access to environmental data
2006-06-08 - 11:29
INSPIRE – or Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community – is a Commission proposal aiming to create a system for access to and exchange of spatial information needed to monitor the state of the environment, in particular the quality of air, water, soil and the countryside. The European Parliament is aiming to ensure free public access to this information as the legislation returns at second reading.
INSPIRE aims to involve citizens more in environmental policy, give a larger role to local and regional authorities in the field and to enable better targeting and efficiency of environmental action at a cross-border level.
At its first reading Parliament aimed to reduce the obstacles in the way of public authorities seeking to share data and to reinforce the subsidiarity principle in the operation of INSPIRE, ensuring Member States and their local and regional authorities all play their proper part. Parliament also decided that intellectual property rights should not prevent the supply of data, although there was room for special access conditions. Altogether, some 49 amendments were adopted at first reading.
When it agreed its Common Position, the Council took account of just ten or so of these amendments, rejecting all of the most significant. The Environment Committee is therefore proposing that Parliament should reinstate them, including the removal of intellectual property rights from the list of exceptions to the general rule of access to data.
Free access, according to the committee, should without payment for members of the public - not only for those searching the data, but also for those consulting the data itself. MEPs in the committee are willing to take account of the costs of providing information to other public authorities, but in any case a fee should be limited to the costs actually incurred in processing the request.
If the plenary session follows the advice of the Environment Committee and reinstates the main first reading amendments, then the issue is likely to go to conciliation. Parliament and Council will have to agree on a joint text before the measure can be finally adopted.
At the July plenary session, Parliament is scheduled to consider a third reading of legislation dealing with the similar issue of access to environmental data, specifically the application of the Aarhus convention to the EU institutions.

Is the EU prepared for a bird flu pandemic?
2006-06-08 - 11:29
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is proposing a leading role for the Commission as well as the creation of a European Influenza Task Force representing all the Member States in order to be able to act rapidly and decisively to control avian influenza.
The report by Adamos ADAMOU (GUE/NGL, CY) on pandemic influenza preparedness and response planning in the EU says that one of the most important aspects of properly dealing with the problem of a possible human avian influenza pandemic is having the correct, scientifically proven, information regarding drugs, vaccines, natural resistance to the disease as well as reliable epidemiological data.
Mr Adamou said " It cannot be stressed enough that there is a strong need to strengthen the co-ordination activities between the Member States. It is empirical to ensure equal access to anti-viral drugs for all Member States irrespective of their size and economic strength . Furthermore, research and development must be promoted in order to make available the pandemic vaccine as soon as possible, and when this happens, equitable distribution of this pandemic vaccine must be ensured. What is important in order to stop a possible pandemic from arising is prevention and not only treatment. Equally important to all the above is the protection of the livelihood of small and medium-sized livestock farmers who have been literary whipped out from bird flu as well as the implementation of Community legislation relating to health and safety at work in order to ensure the adequate protection of workers, particularly those in high infection risk groups. "
MEPs in the committee stress that the Commission must play a strong coordinating role between the Member States in all activities relating to pandemic preparedness in the European Union and say that the Commission should take steps to ensure that sufficient antivirals and vaccines are available for those who are exposed to the virus in the event of an outbreak in one or more Member States. Furthermore, the committee considers that, in the event of an influenza pandemic in the EU or in neighbouring States, the Commission should within 24 hours be able to adopt crisis measures such as quarantine and disinfection measures at airports in connection with flights from certain regions and travel restrictions.
The report therefore suggests the creation of a European Influenza Task Force, coordinated by the Commission, on which the European Parliament is represented and in which all the above-mentioned fields of expertise are brought together at European level.
The committee emphasises that rapid and decisive action must be taken to control avian influenza and so prevent a human pandemic and must also be taken to prepare for a possible human pandemic, so that the means to control it should it occur, are available. MEPs in the committee highlight the need to strengthen surveillance systems, rapid reporting and alerting systems, data analysis and epidemiology for animal and human diseases. The report stresses the importance of education and correct information in the event of crises and that appropriate instructions should cover not only compliance with hygiene rules but also the provision of information in areas such as mobility, transport and employment and accentuated the need for sufficient funds to be made available by the Commission and the Member States in order to provide people with more pertinent, understandable and tangible information and thus raise public awareness.
The report urges the Commission to work for a more coherent international framework in the follow-up of the Beijing pledging conference that goes beyond crisis management and addresses the issues of building up a better infrastructure for animal health in developing countries, as well as advancing research in animal health products that can be used in developed as well as developing countries.

Fisheries
Inshore fishing and the problems encountered by inshore fishermen
2006-06-08 - 11:29
Seán Ó NEACHTAIN (UEN, IE) for the Fisheries Committee will be putting forward an own-initiative report on inshore fishing and the problems encountered by inshore fishermen. The report underlines the sector's "vital contribution" not only to local economies but also to maintaining the social fabric of coastal communities and preserving cultural traditions and practices.
The report also states that inshore fisheries "can and must" play a constructive role in the protection and conservation of the coastal marine environment.
The committee calls for the creation of minimum criteria for a common definition at EU level of inshore fisheries, taking account of aspects such as the length of vessels, the distance from the home port within which the vessels operate, the maximum length of time during which the vessel is away from home, the fact of vessels returning to port daily and selling their catch fresh, etc. The Commission is urged to propose ways of harmonising data on inshore fisheries throughout the EU with a view to establishing a common definition.
Among other recommendations, the report calls on the Commission to finance the modernisation of inshore fishery vessels, bring forward specific educational and training programmes, "so as to encourage the entry of young professionals into the sector" and ensure that any new inshore fisheries legislation pays special attention to establishing and maintaining a "safety culture". It also wants to see greater recognition of the role of women in the inshore fisheries sector and ensure that their economic and social rights were guaranteed. Lastly, the committee says that it was essential for inshore fishermen and dependent communities to be more directly involved in processing and trading in order to strengthen their profit base and improve their living standards. And it reiterates Parliament's traditional position that the Commission should consult with the sector and ensure that it is actively involved "at the appropriate policy level in the decision-making process", with the Regional Advisory Councils playing an essential role in this context.

Data on landings of fishery products
2006-06-08 - 11:29
Philippe MORILLON (ALDE, FR) for the Fisheries Committee will be putting forward a report broadly approving the proposed regulation on the submission of data on landings of fishery products in Member States, subject to a number of amendments under the 1st reading of the codecision procedure.
- it should be stipulated that the statistical data shall cover total landings on national territory "within the European Union", given that the national authorities do not have statistical data from their overseas areas;
- a new article provides for the Commission to report regularly to Parliament and the Council (three years after the regulation's entry into force and every three years thereafter) on the relevance and quality of the statistics compiled, including a cost-effectiveness analysis of the system used as well as reports on best practices for lessening the workload for Member States and enhancing the usefulness and quality of the data;
- the committee feels that some Member States would have difficulty in submitting data on all the intended uses provided for in Annex IV and therefore proposed that mandatory submissions be restricted to the first two categories (human consumption and industrial use), while the submission of data on the other intended uses would be made voluntary;
- MEPs add a number of missing definitions to the proposal, such as "withdrawn from the market", "bait","animal feed", "waste", and "intended use unknown". Rapporteur Philippe MORILLON ALDE FR A6-0169/2006 Data on landings of fishery products Procedure : Codecision (1st reading)

Criticism for Member States, Commission and OLAF on fraud
2006-06-08 - 11:29
MEPs in the Committee on Budgetary Control will submit a report on protection of the financial interests of the Communities and the fight against fraud, criticising individual Member States' efforts and the Commission's lack of efforts to improve the situation. They also call upon the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) to reform itself in order to confirm its credibility.
The report by Herbert BÖSCH (PES, AT) stresses that the importance of year-on-year fluctuations in losses reported should not be overestimated and that they may be affected by a wide variety of factors. However it singles out certain members of the European Union in its criticisms: the committee regards it as completely unacceptable that there are still 'old' Member States (Germany, Greece and Spain) failing to forward notifications on irregularities to the Commission electronically, that those notifications are incomplete and that they are forwarded with several years’ delay and points out that Spain and Germany account for more than 65% of losses. Therefore the committee expects a report from the Commission setting out the steps it has taken to prevail upon the Member States concerned to fulfil their Treaty obligations.
MEPs in the committee emphasise that falling figures in the area of agriculture are also the result of the effective operation of the integrated administration and control system (IACS) and therefore insist that that system be used in all Member States. The committee highlights that customs, agriculture and external aid have proved to be particularly susceptible to fraud and underscores the fact that OLAF puts the financial loss resulting since 2000 from cigarette smuggling and the marketing of counterfeit products at EUR 1 317 m.
Concerning the groundwork for amending the OLAF regulation, the report stressed that Parliament will endorse no proposal which would restrict the prerogatives it has had to date, and that it will advocate that all OLAF's investigatory powers be grouped together in a single regulation.
The committee criticises the fact that, to date, the Commission has submitted no interim report on the activities of the 'Eurostat Task Force' despite its having been announced on several occasions. Additionally, MEPs in the committee stated concern, against the backdrop of the current risk of bird flu, that a new trend is emerging involving the illegal import of poultry meat from countries banned by the European Union (particularly China).

MEPs set to back Slovenia's euro ambitions
2006-06-08 - 11:29
Parliament is to debate a report from the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which approves the Commission’s proposal that Slovenia should join the euro zone from 1 January 2007.
The report drawn up by Werner LANGEN (EPP-ED, DE) limits itself to proposing that Parliament should give the go-ahead for Slovenia’s accession, adding only a call to the Member States “to allow the Commission to assess compliance with the Maastricht criteria on the basis of definite, current, reliable and high-quality data.”
Parliament’s role in the process of euro zone enlargement is consultative – see the link below for more details on the procedure.
Another, more detailed, report from Mr Langen on the issues surrounding euro zone enlargement in general was adopted at the May II plenary session.

Protecting workers against the risk of infection from contaminated needles
2006-06-08 - 11:29
Every year around a million workers in Europe, mainly in the medical world, suffer injuries from used surgical needles. The consequences can be serious, including infections from HIV or hepatitis B or C. The EP Social Affairs Committee wants to improve existing EU legislation so as to give workers better protection. Parliament will vote on this topic following the postponement from the last plenary in Brussels.
MEPs believe that many of these "needlestick injuries" which occur in the medical world could be prevented if appropriate measures were made compulsory in medical and veterinary services. In a report by Stephen Hughes (PES, UK), adopted by a large majority by the Social Affairs Committee on Thursday, MEPs say studies have shown that the use of safer needles together with regular training and organisational measures can help reduce the number of injuries. They add that safer working practices and medical devices designed to prevent accidental needlestick injuries would also produce financial savings.
The committee says the existing directives which should in theory cover these risks have not had the desired effect. It therefore calls on the Commission to add various new provisions to one of the directives intended to improve accident prevention and the protection of workers (Directive 2000/54/EC on the protection of workers from risks related to exposure to biological agents at work). MEPs want the Commission to put forward a proposal to amend this directive within three months.
These proposals were made under a little-used procedure which enables the European Parliament to request the Commission to draft new legislative proposals (Rule 39 of Parliament's Rules of Procedure - see link below). The draft resolution by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs must still be approved by a majority of MEPs in plenary (at least 367 out of 732). Since the committee adopted the draft resolution with only two votes against, it has every chance of being adopted in plenary.

€154 million to combat maritime pollution
2006-06-08 - 11:29
The Transport Committee welcomes the Commission proposals for a financial package of 154 million euro for the period 2007-2013 to allow the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) actions in the field of response to pollution caused by ships.
The funds will enable EMSA to make specially equipped anti-pollution vessels available to Member States in order to recover pollutants and develop satellite images to detect pollution in good time. The Committee felt that particular attention should be paid to those areas identified as the most vulnerable.
Rapporteur Luis DE GRANDES PASCUAL (EPP-ED, ES) is putting forward a legislative report to plenary. He is happy to announce that, even in the light of the financial perspectives, this amount of €154 million could be guaranteed. It was agreed that, given the long-term nature of EMSA's responsibility for responding to and preventing pollution caused by ships, it should be given the necessary financial security by means of a multi-annual undertaking.
The €154 million budget is aimed at bringing supplementary assistance for the fight at sea via the contracting of commercial ships equipped with recovery and stocking equipments for polluting substances. These ships should be ready to intervene whenever required by a Member State.
EMSA has opted for long-term chartering by concluding stand-by contracts with commercial ship operators having vessels of sufficient capacity that can be adapted for pollution response purposes, which would cover for four designated priority regions: the Baltic Sea, the Western approaches to the Channel, the Atlantic Coast with two areas, the North and the South; and the Mediterranean particularly the area along the tanker trade route from the Black Sea. Three contracts have already been signed in November 2005 providing for 7 ships spread in the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean Sea (La Valetta, Malta) and the other approaches to the Channel (Brest, France).
Another crucial activity covered by the multi-annual funding will be the establishment of a satellite imagery service which would complement the activities of the Member States and the Commission in responding to illegal discharges and accidental spills from ships. The rapporteur also announced that the scope of the directive included all kind of pollution by ships and not just oil pollution. Consequently, pollution caused by hazardous and noxious substances will be also under the scope of the directive.

MEPs set to back the European Rail Traffic Management System
2006-06-08 - 11:29
The Transport Committee is supporting the introduction of the European Rail Traffic Management System, ERTMS. The full Parliament will now debate the plan to replace the more than 20 different national train protection and signalling systems with one European system.
ERTMS would boost the competitiveness of European freight and passenger railways, since trains could run across borders without changing drivers. The system features two basic components: GSM-R, a radio system used to exchange information (both voice and data) between traffic management centres and the on board crew and equipment, and ETCS (European Train Control System), a computer-based system to control train speed. ERTMS is a fully developed and tested system already available on the market and in commercial use in several Member States. Version 2.3.0 of the system should make it possible to start operating high speed or high capacity international rail corridors in Europe from 2007.
MEPs in the committee say that if ERMTS is to succeed, it should be introduced in particular on six international routes: Rotterdam-Genoa, Naples-Berlin-Stockholm, Antwerp-Basel-Lyon, Seville-Lyon-Turin-Ljubljana, Dresden-Vienna-Budapest and Duisburg-Warsaw, with priority for the route from Rotterdam to Genoa.
The own-initiative report was drafted by Michael CRAMER (Greens/EFA, DE) and was adopted unanimously by the committee. Rapporteur Michael CRAMER Verts/ALE DE A6-0183/2006 Deployment of the European rail signalling system ERTMS/ETCS Procedure : Own-initiative

Parliament debates strict rules for 'Sky Marshals'
2006-06-08 - 11:29
The Transport Committee is insisting on strict regulation of the use of ‘Sky Marshals’ on board aircraft. This is one of the amendments proposed by MEPs in the committee to Commission plans to update the common EU aviation security rules introduced after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. The issue now goes before the plenary session.
The first reading report, drawn up by Paolo COSTA (ALDE, IT), concerns measures aimed to protect against “acts of unlawful interference that jeopardise the security of civil aviation.” The draft regulation aims to ensure common rules regarding checks, searches, surveillance, prohibited items, security patrols and other aspects of airport and aircraft security are correctly applied by Member States, airports and airlines.
For the first time, European rules will cover security measures during flights, including in-flight security officers. ‘Sky marshals’, as they are commonly known, will have to be properly trained and MEPs in the committee insist that weapons “shall not be carried on board an aircraft, unless the required security conditions have been fulfilled, and authorisation has been given by the State granting the operating licence to the air carrier concerned”. They demand prior approval by the State of departure, by the State of arrival and, where applicable, by “any State which is over flown or where intermediate stops are made”. No Member State will be obliged to accept in-flight security officers. Among other issues, the committee says passengers whose behaviour is “manifestly abnormal and threatens to compromise the security of a flight” will be subjected to appropriate security measures during the flight.
MEPs in the committee decided that the costs of the security measures should be met by airline users and Member States, though if a Member State wants to impose even more stringent measures, it will have to cover the whole cost. The report stresses that security taxes and charges must be used “exclusively to meet airport or on board aircraft security costs”. To avoid any distortions in the market, they call on the Commission to propose a uniform system for the financing of airport security measures.

MEPs to welcome Court's landmark ruling on criminal measures
2006-06-08 - 11:29
The Legal Affairs Committee welcomes the ruling from the Court of Justice which confirms that the EU can adopt measures relating to the criminal law under the Community method. However, MEPs in the committee urge the Commission not to automatically extend the conclusions of the Court to every field of Community competence.
On 13 September 2005, the European Court of Justice established that, although as a general rule the Community does not have competence in criminal matters, the Community can adopt measures related to the criminal law when these are essential to combat serious environmental offences. Subsequently, the Commission proposed to extend the conclusions of the Court to other areas of Community competence. In a nutshell, the Commission says that criminal provision essential to "for the effective implementation of Community law" should be adopted according to the Community procedure, and not under the intergovernmental method, which would continue to be used for cross-cutting criminal law provisions, such as cooperation between legal systems and measures relating to the area of freedom, security and justice.
In approving a report drawn up by Giuseppe GARGANI (EPP-ED, IT), MEPs in the Legal Affairs Committee welcomed the Court's ruling. They agree with "the Commission's view that any recourse to measures relating to criminal law must be motivated by the need to give effect to the Community policy in question", while recalling that "as a general principle, it is the Member States which are responsible for the due application of Community law."
MEPs in the committee urge the Commission not to automatically extend the conclusions of the Court to every field of Community competence. They do, however, back the Commission's decision to withdraw or amend, on a case-by-case basis, pending legislative proposals whose legal basis could be incorrect in the light of the Court ruling.

European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction
2006-06-08 - 11:29
Parliament is to consider a proposal to update and modify the legal basis for the Lisbon-based European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction. The Commission is proposing to recast the instrument that founded the centre to incorporate various changes made over the years since it was created in 1993 into one text, and also to make some further modifications.
In a report drawn up by Frieda BREPOELS (EPP-ED, BE), the Civil Liberties Committee is calling on Parliament to give first reading approval under the codecision procedure, subject to a number of amendments, notably the strengthening of Parliament’s own links to the centre.
The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) is the hub of drug-related information in the European Union. Its role is to gather, analyse and disseminate ‘objective, reliable and comparable information’ on drugs and drug addiction and, in so doing, provide its audiences with a sound and evidence-based picture of the drug phenomenon at European level.

Equal opportunities for all?
2006-06-08 - 11:29
MEPs are to debate a call for more comprehensive action to tackle discrimination in all its form across the European Union. In a report to be presented to the plenary session, the Civil Liberties Committee calls for ‘positive action’ to address longstanding inequalities, but rejects the idea of ‘positive discrimination.’
The report, drawn up by Tatjana ŽDANOKA (Greens/EFA, LV), gives examples of what might be considered ‘positive action’: overhauling recruitment policies and practices, taking steps to bring opportunities to the attention of disadvantaged groups, setting targets to improve the representation of such groups within the workforce or providing assistance to help them participate in society as a whole. Targets for such action could include women and ethnic minorities, including the Roma people.
Welcoming the Commission’s plans for 2007 to be the European Year of Equal Opportunities, the committee calls for measures launched during this year to be continued in 2008, under the auspices of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
The committee deplores the fact that the European Charter of Fundamental Rights does not yet have legal force. It calls on the Commission to fulfil its obligations as guardian of the treaties by taking action against all and any Member States which fail fully to transpose EU equal treatment legislation into national law. MEPs in the committee call on the Commission to present a new legislative instrument covering all the grounds for discrimination under Article 13 of the EC Treaty before mid-2007.
Among other points, the report also calls for the prohibition of discrimination against same-sex couples, either married or in a registered partnership, when exercising their right to free movement enshrined in EU law. It says the principle of mutual recognition should apply in this field too.

Information on payer when funds are transferred
2006-06-08 - 11:29
MEPs are to debate and vote on a proposed regulation aiming at preventing money laundering and terrorist financing by ensuring basic information about the payer of funds transferred through the banking system is available to the authorities. The regulation would impose an obligation on payment service providers that such transfers be accompanied by accurate and meaningful information about the payer.
In a report for the Civil Liberties Committee, Alexander ALVARO (ALDE, DE) is recommending a number of amendments aimed at improving the Commission’s proposals. Rapporteur Alexander ALVARO ALDE DE A6-0196/2006 Combating money laundering and terrorist financing: information on the payer accompanying transfers of funds, transposition of the Special Recommendation VII on “wire transfers” (SR VII) of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) into Community legislation Procedure : Codecision (1st reading)

EP backs proposal to allow transfers of sentenced persons between EU countries
2006-06-08 - 11:29
This own-initiative report by Austria, Finland and Sweden is aimed at speeding up the process of transferring sentenced persons to a particular State with which that person is linked in some way and where it is thought likely that optimum social rehabilitation can be achieved.
Suppose a Spanish criminal is caught, judged and sentenced in Poland for an offence committed there, but he does not speak any Polish and has no family or personal ties with the country at all. Keeping him in a Polish jail would make his social rehabilitation very difficult, and the situation for the authorities and personnel dealing with him would not be easier neither. Next week the European Parliament will vote on a proposal by Austria, Finland and Sweden aimed at speeding up the process of transferring sentenced persons for the rest of their sentence to the jail of a particular State with which that person is linked in some way: by nationality, legal residence or family close links. The sentence must in any case exceed 3 years, of which at least 6 months would remain at the time of the transfer. The recognition of the transfer order will be done within a period of 30 days and its enforcement in 60 days.
The proposed decision, endorsed in broad terms by the members of the Civil Liberties Committee, fixes a fast-track mechanism for the recognition enforcement of the sentence by another Member State by issuing a standard certificate. The main problem however was to decide whether or not the sentenced person has to give consent for the transfer. MEPs in the committee say in their consultation report that the person could give an opinion on the transfer, although " his or her involvement should no longer be dominant by requiring his or her consent " for demanding the transfer. The Commission had gone further and established that Member States " have the duty " to take charge of nationals or residents sentenced in another country, " irrespective of their consent, unless there are specific reasons for refusal ". MEPs in the committee establish that the sentenced person will in any case be given the opportunity to give his opinion even if his consent is not necessary for the forwarding of the order.
MEPs in the committee also propose a series of amendments aiming to ensure that the receiving Member state can refuse the transfer if the necessary requisites are not met, and that an amnesty or pardon may be granted by the State receiving the sentenced person only in consultation with the State which issued the sentence.
Finally, the victims of the sentenced person should also be given the opportunity of being informed about the order of transfer to another EU country, stressed MEPs in the committee.

Privacy rights need to be respected in transfers of personal data -even if aimed at fighting terrorism and serious crime, claim MEPs
2006-06-08 - 11:29
The European Parliament is set to endorse the Commission proposal to extend data protection rules to the transfer of information in police and judicial cooperation, an action field which depends directly on Member States and which falls out of the scope of existing community laws to protect data so far. MEPs have tabled more than 60 amendments to limit the use and access to personal data to the very necessary cases and when there is a real threat to public security.
The Commission proposal responds to a longstanding claim from the Parliament, who since the creation of the III pillar has been calling for standards on data protection in the context of judicial and police cooperation: The issue is particularly relevant now that the European Court of Justice decided to annul existing agreements between the EU and U.S. government on the transfer of personal data of air passengers flying into the United States. It is a priority of the members to push for a quick adoption of this draft decision by the Council, which would affect future agreements with the U.S.A.
Strict criteria to collect and access data
Data collection and access to national governments or competent authorities must be limited " to specific purposes ", only " if strictly necessary ", and carried out with the " principles of proportionality and necessity " and for the purpose of " preventing a threat to public security or to a person ", say MEPs in the committee. This personal data made available to a given Member State might be further transferred to another only with the consent of the authority which made available the information in the first place. The members also propose to delete the paragraph allowing access to data to different authorities other than the " competent authorities " established by each Member State.
Sensitive data such us biometrics or DNA information will follow additional specific safeguards to ensure they are accurate and that they can be challenged by the subject of such data. MEPs in the committee also demand a different treatment for personal data depending on the status of the person concerned: information related to " non-suspects " will be treated " only for the specific purpose they were collected, for a limited period of time and with adequate limitations on access to them and on their transmission ".
Transfers to third countries
One of the main concerns for MEPs in the committee is the potential access to personal data that authorities from third countries could ask in the name of fight against terror and organised crime. In this sense, the members of the LIBE committee tabled an amendment forbidding such transfer to competent authorities outside the EU except if the transfer " is provided by a law clearly obliging or authorising it " and if the Member States can ensure that the level of protection afforded by the third country is adequate. This assessment would be based on concrete criteria listed in the text. Only exceptionally, this adequacy decision can be omitted if it is to prevent an imminent serious danger threatening public security.
Finally, the Committee members propose other amendments to give the citizen the right to deny the accuracy of some personal information and mark it on the database, as well as to impose criminal sanctions to authorities in case of intentional offence or gross negligence Martine ROURE PES FR A6-0192/2006 Fight against terrorism: processing and protection of personal data in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters.
