More than 5000 internet sites are said to incite terrorism MEPs wrestled with the balance between security and civil liberties in a debate on terrorism and data protection Tuesday morning. More than 5000 internet sites are said to incite terrorism, and the debate focused on how to deal with new technologies in the fight against terrorism. Later MEPs turned to the six reports of the "maritime package" and voted two texts on the financial situation.
MEPs backed proposals to criminalise the "public incitement to terrorism", recruitment for terrorism and terrorist training, but added safeguards. They underlined the importance of balancing data protection and the fight against terrorism and called for common rules. French Socialist Roselyne Lefrançois, who drafted the report on combating terrorism said, "It is essential to adapt European legislation to prevent acts of terrorism" but "(we) need to guarantee that the measures taken are proportionate to the objective".
Concerns about freedom of expression
Many MEPs focused on last weekend's bombings in Spain and Pakistan. Spanish Christian Democrat Luis de Grandes said, "it is not about typifying opinion crimes", adding "ETA is not considered a terrorist group by the EU for what it says, but for what it does".
Some MEPs consider the Commission proposal goes too far and could threaten freedom of expression. German Liberal Alexander Alvaro said "how can we criminalise incitement without being totally certain that it's intentional?"
MEPs were also worried about possible abuses in the use of personal data in the name of counter-terrorism measures. French Socialist Martine Roure, who drafted the report on the protection of personal data said, "data should not be used for a different purpose than that for which it was collected." She added, "the fight against terrorism can only be effective and proportionate if the protection of human rights is reinforced."
