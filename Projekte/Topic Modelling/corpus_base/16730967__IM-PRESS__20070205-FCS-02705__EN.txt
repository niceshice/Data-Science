Brussels Wednesday Plenary: Romania's President, climate change
MEPs began the two day session with an address by Romanian President Traian Băsescu, just weeks after his country joined the EU. This was followed by a debate on climate change between MEPs, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers. Later, MEPs voted to endorse the membership list of Parliament's committees, allowing them to elect chairmen and vice-chairs.
In his opening remarks Parliament's President welcomed Romania into the EU. He noted that "it has taken 60 years for Romania to return to the bosom of Europe" and that the EU is "politically and culturally strengthened" by Bucharest's membership. "Romania...a breath of fresh air" "We're back in Europe" was the upbeat message from Romanian President Traian Băsescu. He said that since the fall of Communism his countrymen "could speak freely". Mr Băsescu made a plea for greater solidarity and understanding between citizens of Western and Eastern Europe. He said that while the Parliament had bridged east and west "certain people still have misgivings about accepting Eastern European citizens as equals". He said Europe must overcome these "nationalist tendencies" and called for restrictions on Romanian workers travelling abroad to be lifted. "Romania can be a breath of fresh air" to the Union he told MEPs. Tribute to Hrant Dink Later, Mr Poettering paid tribute to Hrant Dink - a recently murdered prominent Turkish journalist of Armenian descent. Mr Dink had written about aspects of Turkey's history that had infuriated nationalists. "The message from science is clear: climate change is happening" On climate change, Stavros Dimas the European Commissioner for the Environment said "the message from science is clear: climate change is happening". He cited the warm winter being experienced by Europe as one indicator. He told MEPs that now was the time to put Europe on to a "more secure low carbon future". Mr Dimas said the Commission's January Communication on Climate Change would achieve the EU's objective of limiting global warming to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. He also said it would allow international negotiations to move On behalf of the EU Presidency, German Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel raised the issue of how to improve the lives of the 2 billion people in the world who do not have access to electricity whilst protecting the climate. He said that high technology areas like Europe would have to take the lead. "What is the role of Europe?" Peter Liese of the German European People's Party said that "energy and access to energy and protection of the climate are the two main challenges that mankind faces in the 21st century" while Italian Socialist Guido Sacconi said the EU must be "coherent on legislation, emmissions trading, aviation, reduction of CO2 for automobiles and all the other things we are considering". Concluding the debate Mr Gabriel posed a rhetorical question to MEPs: "what is the role of Europe if China is the workbench of the world, India the service provider, Russian the petrol pump and Brazil the farmer?" The answer: Europeans have to be the technicians and engineers

Thursday Plenary: Bulgarian President, obesity, death penalty
Bulgaria's President Georgi Parvanov The second day of plenary saw Bulgaria's President Georgi Parvanov make a plea to MEPs to support him in persuading EU members to open their borders to Bulgaria's workers. The day also saw the adoption of reports on obesity and discrimination against young women and girls in education. The House passed a resolution supporting an international moratorium on the death penalty.
President Parvanov used his address to the House to say that "fears of migrant waves" had proved unfounded after the last EU enlargement in 2004. He told MEPs that the lifting of barriers would "bring benefits to Bulgaria and the EU". On fears over the safety of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant in Bulgaria, the President cited recent checks by international experts and restated his countries commitment to nuclear safety. On the Bulgarian nurses sentences to death in Libya for allegedly infecting 400 children with the AIDS virus, he welcomed the "solidarity shown by the EU" on the issue. Welcoming him to the Chamber Parliament's President Poettering congratulated Bulgaria on the reforms it had undertaken on the road to EU membership. Reduce fat, salt to tackle obesity With the levels of obesity rising dramatically across the European Union - a report passed by MEPs yesterday on the "prevention of overweight, obesity and chronic diseases" was timely. It calls for obesity to be recognised as a chronic disease rather than something which is somehow "self inflicted". MEPs hope a reclassification of it will lead to less discrimination and stigmatisation. The report suggests a school based approach - it calls on countries to ensure that schools have sufficient funding to provide healthy and nutritional schools meals (burgers and chips are usually cheaper than vegetables and fruit). The report would also like to see better labelling of food - common labels across the EU would help raise nutritional standards. The key to reducing obesity is reducing fat, sugar and salt levels in food. In this aim the report calls on EU governments, manufacturers, retailers and caterers to make this their first priority. The rapporteur for the issue was Belgian Liberal MEP Frédérique Ries. Death to the death penalty MEPs passed a resolution committing Parliament to support UN efforts for an international moratorium on the death penalty. In particular they called on all EU members to support a resolution on the death penalty in the UN's General Assembly. The resolution also condemned the recent execution of Saddam Hussein, the manner it was carried out and the media's exploitation of the event. Young women need more educational support In the EU women make less progress than men in the educational system. A report passed by MEPs yesterday calls on EU members to support young women and girls and put in place national educational policies that can help them achieve their potential. In particular it identifies young women from religious and ethnic minorities and immigrants as particularly vulnerable. The report identifies economic and social reasons why young females are not doing as well in education as young males. It also says that prejudice towards women plays a role. Věra Flasarová of the European United Left group acted as the rapporteur. MEPs meet for their next plenary session on 12 February Romanian President Traian Băsescu Opening of the Plenary Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov Obesity report Death Penalty Resolutions adopted Plenary round up
