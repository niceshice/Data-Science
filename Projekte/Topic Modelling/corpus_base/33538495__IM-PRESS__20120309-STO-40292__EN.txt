6th World Water Forum Â©Belga/MaxPPP Only 60% of the world population has access to clean drinking water and it also remains a problem in parts of Europe. On 12 March the 6th World Water Forum, the largest international event dedicated to water issues, starts in Marseille to discuss how to achieve water security. On Thursday MEPs will debate how the EU can use water management to fight poverty and mitigate the effects of climate change. This will be followed by a parliamentary resolution.
Access to water remains a problem
MEPs discussed Europe's water challenges with experts on 8 March during a workshop organised by the EP's environment committee. A recent study on the current state and future challenge of Europe's waters was also presented.
Austrian Christian-Democrat Richard Seeber, who chaired the workshop on 8 March, said: "Water is at the heart of all life and all economic development in the world." He stressed that only 2.5% of all water in the world is usable.
Portuguese Social Democrat Edite Estrela, who like Mr Seeber is a member of the environment committee, commented: "The EU already has a significant policy framework, but much work remains to be done." She said more and more Europeans are victims of draught and water scarcity due to climate change, the energy sector and agriculture.
This year the EU is reviewing existing water legislation to see if there is any need to update and reinforce it, for example because of new kinds of water pollutants such as antibiotics and hormones.
World Water Forum
Since 1997 the Word Water Forum has attracted thousands of stakeholders every three years to discuss, debate or share best practices in order to find concrete solutions for water issues. This year 25,000 participants are expected to take part. This includes 140 ministerial delegations and representatives from more than 180 countries.
The goal of this year's forum is to put water high on the political agenda. The right to water, which was recognised by 189 states at the UN two years ago, must be guaranteed for everyone and implemented everywhere.
