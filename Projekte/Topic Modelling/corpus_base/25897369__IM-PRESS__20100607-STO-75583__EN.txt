Palestinians walking through the Erez border crossing in the northern Gaza Strip Ahead of a debate in plenary on 16 June about how to move the peace process forward in the wake of recent events in and around Gaza, three MEPs who took part in the recent Parliamentary delegation to the region analyse the EU's role and whether aid is reaching the right hands and objectives.
"The association agreements with Israel and €600 million (a year) in aid to Palestine and should come with the condition that they respect the engagements they have made," said Alain Lamassoure.
The centre-right French MEP, who heads the Budget Committee, wants to leverage EU aid into a political say. "The conclusion isn't that Europe should stop its aid. But it has paid enough to have the right to play a major role in this political game."
French Green Eva Joly, who chairs the Development Committee, said international and EU aid are essential and can't be suspended. "It would be difficult and morally indefensible." However, there must be strict control to ensure that it is really the people of Gaza who benefit, she said
What can the EU do?
"The goal is for Europe to speak with one voice. Unfortunately this still isn't happening, as we have seen in the UN vote about the international investigation (into Israel's commando operation against a humanitarian convoy trying to break the Gaza block, which resulted in deaths and injuries)," said Italian Socialist Pier Antonio Panzeri, the Chair of the Maghreb delegation.
Ms Joly said the EU's High Representative could call a meeting of the EU-Israel Association Council to verify that Israel has honoured its human rights commitments. Member States could also ask for a postponement of Israel's adhesion to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.
The EP's Foreign Affairs Committee on 1 June called for an impartial international inquiry into the commando operation and for Israel to end the Gaza blockade.
Peace process to resume?
"The problems of Gaza and the settlements need to be solved immediately. It's a fundamental preliminary step. This doesn't mean that Hamas is right, but Israel needs to know that jackals will always win if the situation remains undefined," Mr Panzeri said. As the strongest side, Israel has bigger responsibilities, he added.
Ms Joly said, ""I hope that the international community will mobilise to enable a rapid revival of the peace process."
