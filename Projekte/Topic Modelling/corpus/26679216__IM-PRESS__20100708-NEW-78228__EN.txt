The floods in Pakistan and the EU's response to the ensuing humanitarian crisis will be debated by MEPs with the Commission in Strasbourg on Tuesday afternoon.

Deportation of Roma
2010-09-02 - 18:01
Parliament will discuss with the Commission whether the deportation of hundreds of Roma people this summer from France to Romania and Bulgaria breached EU provisions on freedom of movement and fundamental rights. More than 8000 Roma have been expelled from France since January. In a resolution adopted in March, Parliament stated that the failure of policies to promote the social integration of the Roma people must be examined critically, given the "unsatisfactory progress" to date. MEPs stressed at the time that Member States should make better use of structural funding opportunities to promote the integration of the Roma, and that the implementation of local projects should be monitored objectively.
In response to MEPs' demands, the European Commission produced detailed plans for improving the economic integration of Roma people in Europe. Lívia Járóka (EPP, HU) is Parliament's rapporteur on this subject.
At the request of the S&D group, next Wednesday Parliament will also debate with the Commission the " temporary restrictions affecting Romanian and Bulgarian citizens on the EU labour market ".

New limits on animal testing
2010-09-02 - 18:01
Governments to check on welfare of animals used in scientific experiments Animal testing to be allowed only if no workable alternative available The use of animals in scientific experiments will soon be scaled down if Parliament backs an agreement reached with Council in July on new EU legislation. National authorities will be required, under the legislation, to assess the animal welfare implications of every experiment performed, with a view to promoting alternative testing methods and reducing levels of pain inflicted on animals.
Under the new assessment procedure, Member States must ensure that, whenever an alternative method is available, this is used instead of animal testing. Animal tests would only be approved if they used methods of killing that cause the least possible pain or distress while still producing scientifically satisfactory results. The law would also tighten up rules on the use of primates in scientific experiments, classify tests according to their severity and lay down the inspections needed to ensure compliance.
According to rapporteur Elisabeth Jeggle (EPP, DE), the deal reached with Council aims to strike the right balance between improving animal welfare and assisting research against disease. A positive vote by MEPs would mean the legislation is approved and implemented in two years.
Procedure: Codecision (2nd reading)

Anti-counterfeiting agreement: latest talks
2010-09-02 - 18:01
The ongoing negotiations on the multilateral Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) will be discussed with the Commission on Wednesday in the wake of the tenth round of talks, held in Washington from 16 to 20 August. The aim of ACTA is to beef up the enforcement of intellectual property rights and combat counterfeiting and piracy. On 10 March 2010, the EP adopted a resolution calling for the negotiations to be conducted transparently.
MEPs demanded that no personal searches should be conducted at EU borders and that the agreement should not introduce any type of "three strikes" internet disconnection as a penalty for three online copyright infringements.
Parliament also insisted that ACTA should not affect global access to affordable and safe medicinal products on the pretext of combating counterfeiting.

Press freedom in the EU
2010-09-02 - 18:01
Curbs on freedom of expression and information as well as government control of the media in several Member States will come under the spotlight in a debate with the Commission on Tuesday. Following a heated debate last autumn that highlighted the differing views on this topic among MEPs, Parliament rejected - on 21 October 2009 - all the motions for resolutions on press freedom in Italy and other Member States tabled by its various political groups.
In a report published in July this year the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) voiced concern about press freedom in several EU countries.

EU law needed to fight discrimination against same-sex couples?

MEPs will ask the Commission on Tuesday about its plans to combat discrimination encountered by same-sex couples. Same-sex couples, whether married or in civil partnership, still face discrimination when working, studying and travelling in the EU, since the spouse is not legally recognised as a family member by many Member States. MEPs will quiz the Commission about its lack of concrete proposals in this area.

Human rights in Iran: two women at risk
2010-09-02 - 18:01
Parliament will hold a debate on human rights in Iran, focusing on the cases of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani and Zahra Bahrami.

Dutch MEPs have called on EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton to discuss these cases with the Iranian authorities. The EP will vote on a resolution on Thursday.

EU-South Korea trade agreement: vote on safeguard clause
2010-09-02 - 18:01
. MEPs will vote on safeguard measures accompanying a new free trade accord with South Korea. The measures are intended to shield individual EU industries against any disproportionate rise in imports.
Safeguard measures could be imposed if lower customs duties led to an excessive increase in imports from South Korea, causing or threatening to cause "serious injury" to EU producers.
An investigation into the need for such measures could be initiated by any Member State, the Commission, the EU-Korea Domestic Advisory Group or, under amendments tabled by the EP International Trade Committee, the European Parliament or associations representing at least 25% of the industry. MEPs wish to set the maximum length of an investigation at 200 days, instead of 6 months extendable by a further 3 months, as proposed by the Commission.
Parliament wishes to introduce a special monitoring system for the car manufacturing and related industries, as these will be among the sectors most exposed to increased competition after the trade agreement enters into force.

Weeding out faulty euro coins to stop vending machines jamming
2010-09-02 - 18:01
. Parliament will be asked to approve legislation designed to combat the common problem of jammed vending machines caused by counterfeit and damaged euro coins.
Vending machines throughout the eurozone countries are all programmed to accept standard euro coins. But because there is no mandatory common authentication system, faulty coins can slip through the net, thereby undermining the euro as a currency but also causing more mundane problems such as blocked coffee machines.
The legislation lays down binding measures for the regular testing of coin-processing machines and the training of staff involved in manual checking. It also specifies the types of controls to be undertaken by Member States and their frequency.

EU-Switzerland: lowering barriers for cross-border workers
2010-09-02 - 18:01
. Every day around 200,000 commuters from the EU or one of the EFTA countries cross the border to Switzerland to work. The Internal Market Committee suggests ways to improve the free movement of people and services together with EU-Swiss cooperation in this area.
Since Switzerland signed the Agreement on Free Movement of Persons in 1999, the number of posted workers and self-employed service providers from the EU working in Switzerland has increased significantly. However, the Internal Market Committee's draft resolution highlights various issues that still need to be tackled to make the free movement of services a reality.

Proposed Israeli law on NGOs under the spotlight
2010-09-02 - 18:01
. An Israeli draft bill seeking to monitor the activities of Israeli NGOs funded by foreign governments or government-funded donors will be discussed on Wednesday by MEPs.
Members of four political groups (S&D, ALDE, Greens/EFA and GUE/NGL) have expressed concern over this bill, which requires all recipients receiving foreign funding for the purpose of 'political activity' in Israel to register with the Political Party Registrar.
Situation of the lower River Jordan
Parliament will also debate the much-needed rehabilitation of the River Jordan and in particular its lower reaches. The river - which has great historical, symbolic and religious meaning for Arabs and Israelis, for Christians, Jews and Muslims - has been devastated by overexploitation, pollution and a lack of regional management. MEPs will vote on a resolution on this issue on Thursday.

Employment rate of 75% by 2020?
2010-09-02 - 18:01
. The employment rate in the EU should be increased to 75% by 2020, with priority being given to vulnerable groups, argues the Employment Committee in a draft resolution that lays down job targets for EU Member States.
Governments should seek to increase the employment rate to 75% of the active population by 2020, raising it as a first step by 10% by 2014 and making a special effort towards vulnerable groups. The resolution, drafted by Csaba Öry (EPP, HU), is designed to influence the Europe 2020 strategy for growth and jobs.

Green jobs, the key to a sustainable economy
2010-09-02 - 18:01
. The EU needs a strategy by 2011 to encourage the creation of green jobs. Education and training systems must be shaped to reflect these new types of work, says a draft resolution by the Employment Committee.
MEPs call on the European Commission to come up with a concrete strategy on this area by next year. They urge new incentives to prompt companies to invest more in clean technologies.

Positive discrimination in favour of older women?
2010-09-02 - 18:01
. With women living longer than men and facing a greater risk of ending up in poverty, the Women's Rights Committee wants to see positive discrimination measures for older women.
New types of paid leave at work for caring duties other than parental leave are among the proposals.
Innovative policies should be devised, say MEPs, to support 'informal carers' (most of whom are women) with benefits and social security rights, says the committee's draft resolution. Workers with dependent older relatives should be able to choose whether to be paid if they opt to care for them themselves or to be allowed to call on social services instead.
Governments should also ensure that workers whose income is temporarily lower owing to their caring duties can continue acquiring pension rights, adds the Women's Rights Committee. Lastly, the Commission should come up with a plan to support women who care for grandchildren while the parents are at work.
Also in plenary next Tuesday, the Employment Committee will table an oral question to the Commission concerning long-term care for older people.

2010-09-02 - 18:01

Member States have promised to prevent the export of military technology and equipment which might be used for internal repression or international aggression or contribute to regional instability, under a December 2008 Council Common Position on defining common rules governing control of exports of military technology and equipment.

2010-09-02 - 18:01
. MEPs will vote on a draft resolution by the Legal Affairs Committee on the Brussels I Regulation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of civil and commercial court judgments.
The time and cost of getting a foreign court judgment recognised are hard to justify in the single market, with rulings in debt cases causing particular problems.
