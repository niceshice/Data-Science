What can the European Ombudsman do for you?

The European Ombudsman P. Nikiforos Diamandouros
Suppose you want to consult an EU document and the institution involved won't supply it, or imagine a scenario where you took part in a competition to work at the European Parliament and the procedure seemed wrong. You have raised the issue but there has been no satisfactory solution. The European Ombudsman may have the answer.
The European Ombudsman investigates complaints about maladministration in the institutions and bodies of the European Union. He usually makes inquiries based on complaints - any EU citizen, business, organisation or resident can lodge a complaint - but he can also launch inquiries on his own initiative.
The Ombudsman may be able to resolve a problem simply by flagging the complaint to the institution involved. For others he will try to mediate a solution that corrects the maladministration and satisfies the complainant. If conciliation fails, he can make recommendations and if these are not accepted, he may make a special report to the European Parliament, which appoints him and can take political action.
The current European Ombudsman is Nikiforos Diamandouros, former Greek national ombudsman. His office receives over 300 complaints a month and in 2005 he was able to help around 75% of complainants. For example:
UK-based Statewatch, which monitors civil liberties in the EU, obtained previously withheld documents from the Council of ministers after it took on board the Ombudsman's arguments.
The Parliament agreed to re-launch a call for tender after a Belgian architect complained that she had been treated unfairly.
