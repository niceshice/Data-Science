Norwegian fisheries minister Lisbeth Berg-Hansen was quizzed by Fisheries Committee MEPs Tuesday on Norway's compliance with international rules on whaling and the likelihood of any whaling policy change.
Norway's approach to whaling differs from the EU's, as it does on seals. Its "ecosystems" approach relies strictly on scientific data, and "we should not be distracted by emotions", said Ms Berg-Hansen in her introductory remarks.
Respecting international rules
Josefa Andrés Barea (S&D, ES) asked how Norway set s criteria for whaling opportunities, since scientific data c an be interpreted in different ways. " Could we all work on the basis of the same criteria? ", she asked . Kriton Arsenis (S&D , EL ) asked whether Norway's approach would be revised to co mply with international rules, and in particular the moratorium on commercial whaling.
" We respect the moratorium " , replied Ms Berg Hansen, adding that " whaling and seal hunting are based on the international legislation currently in force ". She also underlined that Norway's approach relies on sustainability, strict rules, no subsidies and meat intended only for the Norwegian market , and that common standards apply to all sea species .
Endangered species and sanctuaries
Isabella Lövin (Greens/EFA, SE) asked whether Norway supports a compromise in the IWC (International Whaling commission) that would allow the hunt of two endangered species. The MEP also asked the minister's opinion on " bogus " scientific whaling by Japan.
" We hunt only species which are not threatened at all ", replied Ms Berg-Hansen, also stressing that Norway is not involved in any whaling in protected areas. She also pointed out that Norway is participating in international discussions on whaling within the IWC.
The d ebate took place simultaneously with the annual meeting of the IWC which started on Monday in Agadir, Morocco.
Parliament passed a resolution in February last year calling for the EU to work towards a universal agreement on whaling. MEPs argued for the elimination of lethal whaling for scientific purposes and the maintenance of global moratorium on commercial whaling.
