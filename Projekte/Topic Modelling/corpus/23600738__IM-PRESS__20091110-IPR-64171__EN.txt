The European Parliament will host a major event on global warming and food policy on 3 December where Chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Dr Rajendra K. Pachauri and environmental activist Sir Paul McCartney will urge legislators and experts to focus on what an individual can do to fight climate change, for example by eating less meat.
The "Global Warming and Food Policy: Less Meat = Less Heat" hearing takes place on 3 December, in Parliament's plenary chamber, in Brussels, from 10.00 to 12.30, chaired by Vice-President Edward McMillan-Scott. The opening speech is to be delivered by Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek. It will be followed by a press conference.
The UN Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) produced a major report ‘Livestock’s Long Shadow’ in 2006 which demonstrated that meat production is much less efficient in the use of various inputs and very intensive in emissions of greenhouse gases and water use as compared to equivalent vegetarian food production.
On the eve of the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen the event reflects a perception that climate change needs to be addressed at all levels – especially individual but also at local, regional, national, across Europe and worldwide.
As a legislative body, Parliament votes on the EU laws that help to slow climate change. Parliament has thoroughly examined climate change issues with respect to agriculture, food and development policies and will present its views to the heads of governments meeting in the Danish capital from 7 - 18 December 2009.
