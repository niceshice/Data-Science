MEPs question the Commission and Council on human rights and the Cooperation Agreement with Vietnam
MEPs will question the Commission and Council on human rights and the Co-operation Agreement with Vietnam. Marco CAPPATO ( IT) and Marco PANNELLA ( IT), on behalf of the ALDE Group, will be asking the Council and Commission the following questions on democracy, human rights and the new EU-Vietnam Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.
Parliament to give its assent to agreement with Bosnia
MEPs are expected to give their assent next week to the conclusion of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). In a resolution adjacent to this report, MEPs point out the issues where Bosnian authorities need to make progress: reform of the state, return of refugees, non-discriminatory access to education and future constitutional structure. MEPs are also in favour of strengthening the EU Special Representative's role.
Statistics on trade within the EU
MEPs will vote on a series of changes to the EU’s system for collecting statistics on the trade in goods between Member States. The proposals aim to reduce the administrative burden on businesses involved in reporting data to statistical bodies, while at the same time, maintaining access for policy-makers to high quality statistical information.
Hearing of Baroness Ashton - Monday evening: MEPs to quiz Commissioner-designate
Following Peter Mandelson's return to UK politics, Baroness Cathy Ashton takes over the trade portfolio in the Commission. The EP's International Trade Committee is organising a hearing of the Commissioner-designate. The International Trade Committee will play an active role in this hearing and will want to know Ms Ashton's stance on a number of development-related trade issues, such as Economic Partnership Agreements and the Doha Development Agenda. MEPs from the Development Committee and Foreign Affairs Committee will also take part in the hearing. The hearing takes place from 6-9pm in room LOW N1.4 on Monday 20 October.
2009 Budget: abiding by the EU's commitments
The EP Budgets Committee is proposing its draft report on the 2009 EU budget. MEPs have increased most of the figures proposed by the European Commission, believing that the Council's cuts had made it impossible to meet the EU's commitments. The fight against climate change, the EU's social dimension and security questions are Parliament's priorities for 2009. The vote takes place on Thursday 23 October.
Erasmus Mundus II: MEPs seek to facilitate access and sharpen focus on languages
To help enhance the quality of university teaching and attract the best foreign students and academics to Europe, MEPs are fine-tuning phase two of the EU's Erasmus Mundus university co-operation and student mobility programme (2009-13). A report proposed by the Education and Culture Committee says it should be made easier for Erasmus students from third countries to obtain visas, and that tuition fees should not be imposed in countries that do not currently charge them.
Awarding of the Lux Prize for Cinema
Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, directors of 'Le silence de Lorna', Kornél Mundruczó, director of 'Delta', and actress Orsi Tóth as well as Miroslav Janek, director of 'Obcan Havel', will be at the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Wednesday, 22 October 2008 for the LUX Prize for cinema award ceremony at 11.15am.
Towards a common charge system for EU airports
Common principles for levying charges at Community airports are set out in a second-reading report, proposed by the Transport Committee on a directive to prevent individual airports abusing a dominant position on the market. MEPs in the committee want the rules to apply to airports with an annual throughput of over five million passengers per year, whereas the Commission had proposed one million.
MEPs to vote on a resolution on sea piracy
On Thursday 23 October, the House will vote on a resolution on sea piracy following the debate that took place on 23 September 2008. At the EU defence summit of 2 October, EU Ministers agreed that military contributions to maritime surveillance will be consolidated to respond to intensified illicit trafficking and acts of piracy. The minister’s proposal to create a European maritime surveillance network received support. The planning of an EU military naval operation to fight against piracy off the coast of Somalia will be accelerated.
Does the freedom to provide services override the right to strike?
The House will vote on a draft own-initiative report by the Employment Committee that looks at the consequences of some recent cases on employment law brought before the European Court of Justice. At issue is whether employers can invoke the freedom to provide services and the freedom of establishment to override the right of workers and unions to take collective action, for example in defence of pay and working conditions laid down under existing agreements at national level.
Temporary agency workers to gain equal rights
The Employment and Social Affairs Committee is recommending approving the Council Common Position on temporary work, without amending it. The Common Position takes up the vast majority of Parliament's first-reading amendments, including those on equality of treatment of temporary workers with those of the employer company. Under the proposed deal, Britain's 1.3 million agency workers will get the same pay and conditions as permanent staff after being employed for 12 weeks.
Deal on the promotion of clean road transport vehicles
Dan JØRGENSEN (PES DK), for the Environment Committee, will be tabling a proposed first reading agreement with Council on the promotion of clean road transport vehicles. The most important point of the deal is that the directive stays mandatory, but that Member States are given some flexibility. The aim of the directive is to promote and stipulate the market for clean and efficient vehicles to prompt industry to develop and invest in environmentally-friendly vehicles.
Annual report on European Ombudsman's activities calls for more initiatives to raise citizens' awareness
Dushana Zdravkova (EPP-ED, BG) will be tabling a report for the Petitions Committee on the 2007 annual report of the European Ombudsman's activities. Nikiforos Diamandouros, the European Ombudsman from April 1, 2003, will take part in the debate. The report calls for all EU institutions and bodies to be given the necessary budgetary and human resources to ensure that citizens receive prompt and substantive responses to their enquiries, complaints and petitions. In general, the report considers that Mr Diamandouros has "continued to exercise his powers in an active and balanced way".
EU Solidarity Fund: MEPs to quiz Commission on obstacles for its reform
The European Commission proposal modifying Council Regulation (EC) No. 2012/2002 on the European Union Solidarity Fund has been kept on hold by the Council for more than two years since the European Parliament gave it its first reading. The European Parliament considers it to be of paramount importance to have a Solidarity Fund Regulation which meets the challenges and allows the Union to deliver prompt and effective assistance when Member States suffer a disaster. Gerardo GALEOTE (EPP-ED, ES), on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, will be asking the Commission questions on the above and obstacles to reform.
MEPs to vote on a report on governance in regional policy
Regional development spending from various EU funds needs to be better planned and co-ordinated, and regional and local partners enabled to take part in development planning from the outset, says this own-initiative report by Jean-Marie Beaupuy (ALDE, FR), on governance and partnership at national, regional and project levels in regional policy, unanimously proposed by the Regional Development Committee on 9 September.
Recovery of cod stocks - Celtic Sea plan to get green light
The Fisheries Committee is proposing a report on the Commission's proposal aimed at strengthening a recovery plan for cod stocks. MEPs in the committee say that all cod caught ought to be landed, rather than discarded, so as to enable proper scientific evaluation of stocks, stress that new mechanisms must be introduced to encourage fishermen and Member States to engage in cod-avoidance programmes and agree with the inclusion of the Celtic Sea in the recovery plan.
Management of fishing fleets registered in the outermost regions
The Fisheries Committee defends the extension until end of 2011 for the entry into the fleet of the fishing vessels receiving national State aid for renewal. The aim of the proposal on the management of fishing fleets registered in the outermost regions analysed in Pedro Guerreiro's (GUE/NGL, PT) report is to extend the deadline for the entry into the fleet of the fishing vessels receiving national State aid for renewal.
A safer internet for children
The proposal seeks to introduce a new "Safer Internet" programme to run from 2009 to 2013, following on from the success of the current programme (2005-2008). The aim is to anticipate discernable trends in the online environment. With a budget of €55 million, the programme will combat illegal content, promote a safer online environment, raise public awareness and establish a "knowledge base" for research purposes. Parliament is working on this legislation in co-decision with the Council of Ministers.
Questions raised about accord with Australia on passenger name records
The House will vote on a draft recommendation by the Civil Liberties Committee criticising the Council for concluding an agreement with Australia on the processing and transfer of passenger name records (PNR) without consulting or even informing the European Parliament. MEPs are concerned about the consequences of the agreement for EU citizens' right to data protection.
Clarifying rules on divorce for international couples
Where should international couples be able to divorce? Parliament will vote in Strasbourg on a draft report by the Civil Liberties Committee which voices support for plans to reduce the number of disputes over the choice of country for the roughly 170,000 cross-border divorces that take place every year in the European Union. (The United Kingdom opted out of this legislation from the start. Ireland is not taking part in the enhanced cooperation procedure.)
Deal on the marketing authorisations for medicinal products
Françoise GROSSETÊTE (EPP-ED, FR) will be putting forward a first-reading agreement concerning a Commission proposal to harmonise the regulatory system used to change marketing authorisations for medicinal products (changes subsequent to the placing on the market, such as change in the production process, change in the packaging or change in the address of the manufacturer, update of patient information leaflet). It will ensure that all medicinal products placed on the Community market - including those authorised at purely national level - are subject to the same criteria for the approval and administrative handling of changes, regardless of the procedure under which those medicines have been authorised (national or EU procedure).
Timeshares: Parliament and Council agree new rules
The timeshare holiday rights of some 1.5 million European families will soon be better protected, as MEPs in Strasbourg are expected to endorse a compromise reached between Parliament and Council on the new Timeshare Directive. The directive seeks to enhance consumer confidence and legal clarity, which are essential to the growth of this sector, via simplified EU-wide rules.
MEPs debate the Holodomor, the Ukrainian famine of the 1930s
MEPs will hear a Commission statement and hold a debate to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Holodomor, the large-scale famine that took place in Soviet Ukraine in 1932-33. Estimates for the number of deaths from the famine run into the millions, although some survivors are still alive today. The disaster is widely attributed to food shortages caused by the Soviet collectivisation of agriculture, while some argue there was a deliberate element, with the Soviet government seeking to destroy opposition to their authority.
Human rights situation in the world
As usual the session ends with three debates and votes on human rights situations in the world, on this occasion the topics are: Venezuela, DR Congo: clashes in border areas, and Burma.

EU summit: financial crisis, food prices, climate/energy, immigration, Lisbon Treaty
2008-10-16 - 10:04
MEPs will hold a debate on Tuesday 21 October with French President and Council President-in-Office Nicolas Sarkozy on the outcome of the EU summit of 15-16 October in Brussels, where the European Union's leaders are due to discuss the world financial situation, energy and climate issues, immigration and asylum, food and petrol prices and the next steps on the Lisbon Treaty. The House will vote on a resolution on Wednesday. Economic and financial matters, especially the instability on world financial markets, will dominate the summit. Another topic will be food and petrol price volatility. The energy/climate package will also be discussed with a view to the December European Council.
Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen will present a report on the Lisbon Treaty to the Heads of State or Government, who will discuss ratifications and the options available to resolve the situation created by the Irish rejection of the treaty.
The summit will also be asked to adopt the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum, one of the four priorities set out by the French Presidency (the others being energy/climate change, defence and reform of the common agricultural policy).
Georgia
There will also be a follow-up to the extraordinary European Council meeting of 1 September on Georgia and EU-Russia relations. The EU observer mission having now deployed on the ground, ministers will review the political situation ahead of the talks starting in Geneva on 15 October and the Georgia Donors' Conference in Brussels on 22 October.

Alliance of Civilisations: Jorge Sampaio addresses MEPs
2008-10-16 - 10:04
MEPs will hear an address by Jorge Sampaio, former President of Portugal and currently High Representative for the Alliance of Civilisations. This visit takes place as part of European Year for Intercultural Dialogue. The Alliance for Civilisations was established in 2005, at the initiative of the Governments of Spain and Turkey, under the auspices of the United Nations. Its aim is to improve understanding between cultures and religions, and thereby counter polarisation and extremism.
The Alliance is supported by a Group of Friends - a community of over 85 member countries and international organisations and bodies. It acts as a bridge builder, to promote trust and understanding between communities, particularly - though not exclusively - between Muslim and Western societies. It helps give impetus to innovative projects aimed at reducing polarisation between nations and cultures, seeking to amplify voices of moderation and reconciliation with the aim of calming cultural and religious tensions.
Jorge Sampaio
Jorge Sampaio was President of Portugal from 1996 to 2006. In May 2006 he ws appointed by the United Nations Secretary-General as his Special Envoy to Stop Tuberculosis. In April 2007, he was appointed as the High Representative for the Alliance of Civilizations. From 1979 until 1984, he was a member of the European Commission for Human Rights.

EU-Russia relations
2008-10-16 - 10:04
MEPs will debate EU-Russia relations after hearing statements from the Council and Commission. The next EU-Russia summit will be held in Nice on 14 November under the auspices of the French Presidency. Russia is the EU’s third biggest trade partner, with Russian supplies of oil and gas making up a large percentage of Russia’s exports to Europe. The ongoing cooperation is based on four specific policy areas. These “common spaces”, cover economic issues and the environment; Freedom, Security & Justice; External Security; and Research & Education, including cultural aspects.
The EU will study whether to restart stalled negotiations with Russia on a broad partnership pact after Russia pulled its troops from buffer zones around two breakaway regions.
The partnership pact between the 27-nation bloc and its largest energy supplier covers everything from trade provisions to delicate areas such as how the two handle disagreements on human rights.
Russia has largely pulled out of the so-called buffer zones adjacent to the rebel regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, before the 10 October deadline in the French-brokered ceasefire. Council and Commission statements - EU-Russia relations

MEPs question the Commission and Council on human rights and the Cooperation Agreement with Vietnam
2008-10-16 - 10:04
MEPs will question the Commission and Council on human rights and the Co-operation Agreement with Vietnam. Marco CAPPATO ( IT) and Marco PANNELLA ( IT), on behalf of the ALDE Group, will be asking the Council and Commission the following questions on democracy, human rights and the new EU-Vietnam Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. – Considering that, in November 2007, during the visit of the European Commission President, Mr Barroso, the negotiations for a new EU-Vietnam Partnership and Cooperation Agreement were launched, and a first negotiation round took place in July 2008;
– considering that a new negotiation round will take place in Hanoi on 20 and 21 October 2008;
– considering that the actual Cooperation Agreement includes the human rights clause, on the basis of which at Article 1 it states that 'respect for human rights and democratic principles is the basis for the cooperation between the Parties and constitutes an essential element of the Agreement';
– considering that the Socialist Republic of Vietnam is a single-party State, under the control of the Vietnamese Communist Party, which exerts full control also over trade unions, associations, religious organisations and the media;
– considering that systematic violations of human and civil rights have been documented in Vietnam, particularly against ethnic minorities such as the Montagnards (Degar) and unrecognised religious organisations like the Unified Buddhist Church, and that, according to influential NGOs, in the last 18 months, at least 26 political dissidents have been sentenced to jail;
– considering that Vietnam is a country that maintains the death penalty; that in the last few years the use of the death penalty has increased and that in 2008 at least 83 people were sentenced to death, including 14 women;
What initiative, if any, has the Council undertaken to make sure that the negotiations for a new cooperation and partnership agreement will lead to concrete steps forward with regard to respect for human rights and the establishment of democracy in Vietnam?
What tangible improvements does the Council deem necessary to achieve an agreement which could be satisfactory, including its democracy and human rights aspects? OQs - Democracy, Human Rights and the new Partnership and Cooperation agreement EU/Vietnam

Parliament to give its assent to agreement with Bosnia
2008-10-16 - 10:04
MEPs are expected to give their assent next week to the conclusion of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). In a resolution adjacent to this report, MEPs point out the issues where Bosnian authorities need to make progress: reform of the state, return of refugees, non-discriminatory access to education and future constitutional structure. MEPs are also in favour of strengthening the EU Special Representative's role. MEPs welcome the agreement which has the potential to boost BiH's economy but remind political leaders that this can be achieved only if they pursue with determination reforms at all levels - state, entity and local. This should be done with a view to modernising the country and making it more efficient and compatible with EU standards. BiH should abolish all unnecessary legal and administrative barriers and streamline its administrative structures, according to the resolution.
Situation of refugees
The report drafted by Doris PACK (EPP-ED, DE) is concerned by the lack of progress in refugees' and IDPs' returns, for example in the region of Posavina, located in the Republika Srpska. Local authorities should be more involved and adequate housing, infrastructure and employment in the areas of origin needs to be provided.
Education
Serious efforts need to be undertaken in order to overcome the segregationist structures currently operating in the country, according to MEPs, since this is key to promoting employability but is also instrumental in achieving reconciliation.
Future constitutional set-up
MEPs are of the view that the debate on the future constitutional set-up of BiH must be led by the Bosnian Parliament. Any constitutional settlement must be the product of voluntary agreement between the different political parties in BiH. The international community and the EUSR must play a facilitator's role.
MEPs are in favour of strengthening the EU Special Representative's role when the Office of the High Representative is closed down, but remind that this can only happen when all the conditions set by the International Community are fulfilled.
Stabilisation and Association Agreements
The SAA with BiH has been signed in June 2008. SAAs are the first step towards accession to the European Union, provided that the Copenhagen criteria are fulfilled. The EU Summit in Thessaloniki (June 2003) reaffirmed the prospect of EU membership for the countries of the Western Balkans.

MEPs debate the Holodomor, the Ukrainian famine of the 1930s
2008-10-16 - 10:04
MEPs will hear a Commission statement and hold a debate to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Holodomor, the large-scale famine that took place in Soviet Ukraine in 1932-33. Holding a debate on this topic was a request of Professor Geremek (PL) before he passed away. The House will also vote on a resolution on this topic.
Estimates for the number of deaths from the famine run into the millions, although some survivors are still alive today. Severe food shortages arose during the collectivisation of agriculture and the rapid industrialisation driven by the Soviet authorities. Some historians view the famine as the deliberate tool of a government seeking to destroy opposition to its authority.
The Conference of Presidents, meeting on Thursday 16 October, is expected to agree to a proposal for Parliament to vote on a resolution on this topic which would express solidarity with the victims. Commission statement - Commemoration of the Holodomor, the Ukraine famine (1932-1933)

Budget
2009 Budget: abiding by the EU's commitments
2008-10-16 - 10:04
The EP Budgets Committee is proposing its draft report on the 2009 EU budget. MEPs have increased most of the figures proposed by the European Commission, believing that the Council's cuts had made it impossible to meet the EU's commitments. The fight against climate change, the EU's social dimension and security questions are Parliament's priorities for 2009. The vote takes place on Thursday 23 October. The work on the next EU budget is taking place in a very particular context. The world financial crisis is forcing the Community to make spending cuts, while a number of recent policy commitments, such as food aid to developing countries and aid for reconstruction in Georgia, have been added to ordinary EU policies and programmes which cannot be abandoned. The gap between the forecasts of financial needs ("commitments") and programmed expenditure ("payments") entered in the draft 2009 budget by the Council has never been so wide. According to the Budgets Committee, this situation bodes ill for the implementation of the budget and indicates a shortage of funding to meet the EU's commitments and its priorities. The committee, therefore, decided to reduce this gap.
However, to take account of the world situation, MEPs in the committee chose not to increase payments to the maximum allowed under the ceiling of the financial perspective (the EU's multiannual budget plan), which is 0.97% of the accumulated gross national income (GNI) of the Member States. The budget proposal by the Budgets Committee places the level of payments at around 0.954% of GNI. This will become Parliament's negotiating position if confirmed by the plenary. By comparison, the Commission's preliminary draft budget (PDB) proposed 0.899%, while the Council adopted a figure of 0.885%. The budgetary conciliation between Parliament and Council, the two arms of the budgetary authority, takes place on 21 November.
Priorities: climate, social dimension and security
MEPs decided to restore the Commission's figures for most of the budget headings, rather than follow the Council's. In some cases they even went further than the figures in the PDB, for priority policies and actions.
Climate change . MEPs want to increase by over €2bn the total spending on certain budget headings for EU measures against climate change. In many cases, it means taking greater account of climate change in existing programmes, such as rural development, transport, research and the environment. For example, MEPs wish to virtually double the payments for the LIFE+ programme. The also call for a new budget line for climate change in Heading 2 (Natural resources) to make the budget more transparent and comprehensible. This would allow measures to combat climate change and the funding allocated to this area to be grouped together. In addition to these transferred amounts, MEPs wish to allocate €20m extra to this new heading.
Social dimension and employment . The committee is also seeking to expand the budget for the EU's social and employment dimension, i.e. the policy goals mainly included in Headings 1a (Competitiveness) and 1b (Cohesion). This includes the European Social Fund (which MEPs believe should get over €135m extra for convergence, employment and growth), the Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund. A package of measures is targeted at small and medium-sized firms (SMEs). MEPs also propose an increase in the payments for the programme to improve the financial environment for SMEs. In addition, they wish to launch pilot projects such as the Erasmus programme for entrepreneurs or measures to aid SMEs to seize opportunities to internationalise their activity.
Security . This priority is reflected in several budget headings amended by the committee, since it is a multidimensional objective. In Heading 3a (Freedom, security and justice), the increased funding for Frontex (the European agency for managing operational cooperation on the EU's external frontiers) is justified by the growing permanence of its missions, especially on the Union's southern borders (€10m extra in commitments and in payments, of which €5m are placed in reserve). MEPs also wish to increase the commitments for aid to projects of common interest in the transeuropean energy network. This would facilitate the building of the Nabucco gas pipeline on the Middle East-Caspian-European Union route, the aim being to guarantee the EU's gas supplies in the long term.
Fulfilling the EU's commitments around the world
Even before the vote in committee, MEPs had voiced disappointment at the figures earmarked for the EU's external policy action, which comes chiefly under Heading 4 of the budget (The EU as a global actor) and has been underfunded ever since the current financial perspective was adopted.
The Budgets Committee wants to keep the amounts for European security and defence policy laid down in the Commission's PDB. It would also preserve the EU funding for Palestine proposed in the PDB and increased by the Commission in its amending letter (€300m in commitments and €280m in payments). Funding for aid to Kosovo, financed from several different headings, is also the same as the amount proposed by the Commission. Aid for reconstruction in Afghanistan (€160m in commitments and €150 in payments) also remains at the same level as in the PDB.
However, the experience of past years clearly shows that these figures are not enough. MEPs therefore wish to persuade the Council to grant more money to external policy. The money needed could be found by, for example, using the flexibility mechanism or emergency aid. However, in line with the existing agreement between the institutions, the use of these sources requires the consent of both Parliament and Council. This will be a crucial issue at the negotiations on 21 November. An amendment adopted by the Budgets Committee groups together all the policy priorities for which the budget does not cover the extra funding demanded by MEPs (which would exceed the allowed ceilings of €390m).
Georgia and food aid for developing countries
In addition to the existing commitments that are underfunded in Heading 4, new objectives have recently emerged: food aid for developing countries and reconstruction aid for Georgia.
Following the increase in food prices in 2007 and 2008, the European Council of June 2008 called on the Commission to bring forward a proposal to set up a new fund to support agriculture in developing countries. The Commission suggested a billion euros, with €750m committed under the 2008 budget and €250m under the 2009 budget. MEPs included the amount needed in 2009 for food aid in the same negotiation package as Palestine, Kosovo and Afghanistan.
Turning to the commitments given by Member States on reconstruction aid for Georgia, MEPs adopted a number of amendments to take account of the situation in that country. Most of these amendments are more important politically than financially. Parliament cannot allocate funding while there is no legal basis and while the amounts the Member States are willing to put on the table are still not known. MEPs therefore decided to create a special budget line for aid to Georgia but without granting it any funding, pending the outcome of the donors' conference.
Next steps
The budgetary conciliation meeting between Parliament and Council takes place on 21 November 2008.

Education
Erasmus Mundus II: MEPs seek to facilitate access and sharpen focus on languages
2008-10-16 - 10:04
To help enhance the quality of university teaching and attract the best foreign students and academics to Europe, MEPs are fine-tuning phase two of the EU's Erasmus Mundus university co-operation and student mobility programme (2009-13). A report proposed by the Education and Culture Committee says it should be made easier for Erasmus students from third countries to obtain visas, and that tuition fees should not be imposed in countries that do not currently charge them. "Europe's higher education must be competitive to attract the many foreign university students and teachers who previously went to study in the United States. The quality of higher education, its ability to disseminate knowledge and expertise, will make Europe a must, thanks to the centres of excellence to be developed through this programme. The aim is not to organise the brain drain, but, on the contrary, to train the future generations of emerging countries", said Parliament's rapporteur, Marielle De Sarnez (ALDE, FR), after the first-reading vote on her report on the Erasmus Mundus II programme (2009-2013).
The €950 million (proposed by the Commission) Erasmus Mundus II programme aims to promote EU as a centre of academic excellence. It seeks to attract the best-qualified students and academics from third countries by offering high-quality master's or doctoral programmes created by a consortia of universities from at least three different countries. The programme also seeks to create partnerships between universities within and beyond Europe, as well as promoting European higher education internationally.
For the second edition of the programme, Culture and Education Committee MEPs stress the need to focus on academic excellence and attracting the best students. To facilitate exchanges within the programme, they encourage Member States should make a special effort to simplify procedures.
Linguistic diversity and access for all
As linguistic diversity is a high priority for the Community in higher education, the report says that programmes should provide for the use of at least two EU languages, and the students should be offered language preparation. MEPs also wish to facilitate access to the programme for persons from poor or minority backgrounds.
Tuition fees
As tuition fees vary greatly among Member States, MEPs say that if a group of universities behind an Erasmus Mundus programme claim tuition fees, these fees should always comply with the national legislation, so that universities in countries like Denmark, where these fees are forbidden, are not excluded.
Phase two Innovations
The second phase of Erasmus Mundus (2009-13) is expected to start in 2009. Its key new features are the inclusion of joint doctoral programmes, more scholarships for European students and stepping up structural cooperation with third-country higher education institutions. Phase two also includes a mobility programme for all levels of higher education.
The new programme, which has a budget of about €950 million, consists of three actions:
creating joint master's degrees and doctorates (€450 million). These should be of a high academic standard, and each involve at least three European universities,
establishing partnerships between European and third country universities (managed by the European Commission directorates-general for external relations and external co-operation - about €460 million), as a basis for structural co-operation exchange and mobility, including a scholarship scheme, and
promoting European higher education (€16.5 million).
In the previous programme, 4,424 scholarships were granted from 2004-2008 to students from third countries and 323 universities took part, 265 of them in Europe. Rapporteur Marielle DE SARNEZ ALDE FR A6-0294/2008 Erasmus Mundus programme (2009-2013) Procedure : Codecision (1st reading)

Awarding of the Lux Prize for Cinema
2008-10-16 - 10:04
Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, directors of 'Le silence de Lorna', Kornél Mundruczó, director of 'Delta', and actress Orsi Tóth as well as Miroslav Janek, director of 'Obcan Havel', will be at the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Wednesday, 22 October 2008 for the LUX Prize for cinema award ceremony at 11.15am. On 22 October 2008, the European Parliament will host the second annual award ceremony of the LUX Prize. The three finalists films are: 'Delta' by Kornél MUNDRUCZÓ (Hungary, Germany), 'Le silence de Lorna' by Jean-Pierre and Luc DARDENNE (Belgium, UK, France, Italy), and 'Obcan Havel' by Miroslav JANEK and Pavel KOUTECKÝ (Czech Republic). They have been chosen from an official selection of 10 films made by a 17-strong independent panel drawn from the highest level of the cinema profession: producers, distributors, cinema operators, festival directors and critics. To be eligible the film should illustrate the universality of European values and/or the diversity of European culture and/or bringing insights into the debate on the process of building Europe.
A prize to promote European cinema
The purpose of the LUX Prize is to break down the languages barriers that often prevent European films from being distributed widely and to facilitate the circulation of European films and give a boost to cinematic work within the European Union. The winning film will be sub-titled in the 23 official languages of the European Union. The value of the LUX Prize is estimated at €87,000.
In 2007 the LUX Prize was awarded to "Auf der anderen Seite" by Fatih Akin (German/Turkish production).
Press conference and interviews
The ceremony will be broadcasted live on Europe by Satellite, Wednesday, 22 October from 11.15-11.30am.
A press conference chaired by EP Vice-President Gérard ONESTA (Greens/EFA, FR) and with participation of directors and actors from the three finalist films will be held the same day at 2.30pm in the European Parliament press room.
Directors and actors will be available for interviews after the ceremony from 12 noon to 1pm. Award of LUX Prize - 11.15am, 22.10.08 LUX Cinema Prize

Employment policy
Does the freedom to provide services override the right to strike?
2008-10-16 - 10:04
The House will vote on a draft own-initiative report by the Employment Committee that looks at the consequences of some recent cases on employment law brought before the European Court of Justice. At issue is whether employers can invoke the freedom to provide services and the freedom of establishment to override the right of workers and unions to take collective action, for example in defence of pay and working conditions laid down under existing agreements at national level. The freedom to provide services is one of the cornerstones of the European project but this should be balanced against fundamental rights and the social objectives anchored in the treaties, argues the Employment Committee in a report drafted by Jan Andersson (PES, SE) and adopted by 38 votes in favour to 0 against and 5 abstentions.
The report argues that the freedom to provide services does not take precedence over the rights contained in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, such as the right of trade unions to take industrial action, especially as this is a constitutional right in several Member States. The recent Laval, Viking, Rüffert and Luxembourg rulings of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) appear to undermine the right to take collective action such as strikes.
Posting of workers directive and national labour agreements
The Posting of Workers Directive (PWD) lays down a “hard core” of minimum working conditions that Member States have to guarantee and that will also apply to temporary, foreign workers. However, in the Laval case, the ECJ ruled that the PWD does not allow the host Member State to go further and, for example, require employers to comply with employment conditions that may have been negotiated with trade unions and are better than the minimum. The court's ruling in the Rüffert case further develops and explains this position. In practice, then, national wage agreements can be undercut for posted workers.
The committee believes the legal basis of the PWD should be broadened to include a reference to the free movement of workers. It should also be revised to take account of matters such as working conditions, pay levels and equal treatment.
MEPs also challenge the idea of applying a "proportionality principle" to the right to take industrial action against firms that use the right of establishment or the right to provide services across borders as way of undercutting terms and conditions of employment.
"Letterbox companies" under fire
The Member States and the Commission are also asked to adopt measures to combat "letterbox companies", which are not engaged in any genuine business in the country of origin but have been created to circumvent the full application of regulations in the host country, especially those governing wages and working conditions.
Lastly, the report maintains that fundamental social rights are not hierarchically subordinate to economic freedoms. It therefore asks for a re-assertion in primary law of the balance between fundamental rights and economic freedoms.
Background
In the Viking case, the Viking company wanted to reflag a vessel from Finland to Estonia to avoid the constraints of Finnish collective bargaining agreements. In the Laval case, a Swedish trade union tried, through collective action, to force a Latvian service provider to sign a collective agreement when performing services in Sweden. In two judgments handed down in December 2007, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in favour of Viking and Laval, which had complained, respectively, of violations of the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services.
In April 2008 the ECJ delivered its verdict in the Rüffert case, which concerns the right of public authorities, when awarding contracts, to demand that tendering companies pay wages in line with rates already agreed through collective bargaining in the place where the work is performed, and whether such demands could be outlawed as a restriction on the freedom to provide services under Article 49 of the Treaty.
In the Luxembourg case , the ECJ ruled in favour of the European Commission, which accused Luxembourg of transposing the 1996 PWD too restrictively into Luxembourg law.

Employment policy
Temporary agency workers to gain equal rights
2008-10-16 - 10:04
The Employment and Social Affairs Committee is recommending approving the Council Common Position on temporary work, without amending it. The Common Position takes up the vast majority of Parliament's first-reading amendments, including those on equality of treatment of temporary workers with those of the employer company. UK position - 12 week rule
Under the proposed deal, Britain's 1.3 million agency workers will get the same pay and conditions as permanent staff after being employed for 12 weeks. The revised wording of the Agency Workers Directive allows the UK to implement the agreement between CBI and TUC which means that an agency worker is entitled to equal treatment (at least the basic working and employment conditions that would apply to the worker concerned if they had been recruited directly to occupy the same job) after 12 weeks in a given job.
Parliament's first-reading amendments (report by Ieke van den Burg (PES, NL) sought in particular equal treatment in the "essential conditions" of work and employment, i.e. working hours, overtime, breaks, pay, etc (Article 3 of the Common Position).
The 2002 proposal for a directive, tabled in the context of the Lisbon jobs and growth strategy, established the principle of non-discrimination between temporary workers and those of the employer company, for temporary workers hired for more than six weeks. An exception to this principle was provided for in the case of collective agreements.
MEPs won an undertaking that equal treatment must apply from the first day. Furthermore, any exceptions to this principle will be limited, and must be governed by agreements between the social partners, collective negotiations or agreements reached by the social partners at national level.
EP amendments on health, safety and hygiene at work were not deemed "essential conditions", but these are already governed by Council Directive 91/383/EEC of 25 June 1991, stressed rapporteur Harlem Désir (PES, FR).
In adopting this report, the Employment and Social Affairs Committee expressed the wish that this six-year old proposal for a directive should enter into force without further delay.
Common position of the Council
The common position includes a majority of the amendments (26 in total) resulting from Parliament's first reading of the Commission's proposal.
The general structure of the common position is in line with the general structure of the Commission's amended proposal. Specifically, the Council accepted an amendment to the title of the Directive, three amendments to the recitals as well as a number of amendments to the following articles: Article 1 on the scope, Article 2 on the aim of the Directive, Article 3 on definitions, Article 4 on the review of restrictions and prohibitions, Article 5 on the principle of equal treatment, Article 6 on access to employment, collective facilities and vocational training and Article 7 on the representation of temporary agency workers.
The main differences from the Commission's amended proposal are as follows:
Review of restrictions and prohibitions on the use of temporary workers (Article 4): while essentially following the spirit of the Parliament's amendment, the Council added a new paragraph concerning the review of agreements negotiated by the social partners. The Council considered that, in order to respect their autonomy, the social partners should themselves review whether the restrictions and prohibitions negotiated by them were justifiable on the grounds set out in the first paragraph of Article 4. The Council did not consider it necessary to retain an explicit reference to the discontinuation of unjustified restrictions and prohibitions.
Principle of equal treatment (Article 5): while generally following the Commission's amended proposal, the Council modified the text. The Council also considered that the principle of equal treatment from day one should be the general rule. Any treatment of temporary agency workers differing from that principle should be agreed by the social partners, either through collective bargaining or through social partner agreements concluded at national level. In the light of the modifications made to the text, a specific exemption for short-term contracts (six weeks or shorter), as envisaged in the Commission's amended proposal, was therefore no longer considered necessary or appropriate.
The common position reflects those of the Parliament's amendments which stress the importance of the role of social partners in negotiating arrangements on working and employment conditions. It also echoes the Parliament's concerns in relation to the prevention of misuse.
Penalties (Article 10): the common position includes a new paragraph concerning measures the Member States are expected to take in order to ensure compliance with the Directive by temporary work agencies and user undertakings.
Implementation (Article 11): the Council considered that the Member States would need three years to implement the Directive, while the Commission had proposed a two-year implementation period.
In addition, a number of recitals have been updated and modified, in order both to explain the modifications introduced by the Council to the Commission's amended proposal and to describe developments since the amended proposal was published in 2002. For example, references to the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy, in 2005, and to the agreed common principles of flexicurity, endorsed by the European Council in December 2007, were included in the recitals.
Entry into force
Member States must adopt and publish the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by three years after the entry into force, or must ensure that the social partners introduce the necessary provisions by way of an agreement, whereby the Member States must make all the necessary arrangements to enable them to guarantee at any time that the objectives of this Directive are being attained.

Transport
Towards a common charge system for EU airports
2008-10-16 - 10:04
Common principles for levying charges at Community airports are set out in a second-reading report, proposed by the Transport Committee on a directive to prevent individual airports abusing a dominant position on the market. MEPs in the committee want the rules to apply to airports with an annual throughput of over five million passengers per year, whereas the Commission had proposed one million. Safeguarding consumer interests
At Parliament's request, the proposal also provides for mechanisms for consulting airport users, and for resolving disputes between users and airports. MEPs say these are necessary to establish a level playing field for economic operators and ultimately also to safeguard consumer interests.
Small airports exempted
MEPs in the committee say (and the Council agrees) that applying the rules to smaller airports, with under one million passengers a year, would have imposed administrative and bureaucratic burdens, to no great effect, on airports that are not in competition due to geographic and structural factors. However, the Directive will apply to the largest airport in each Member State, irrespective of passenger numbers.
Clear, objective criteria
The committee also saw to it that any differentiation in airports' charges will have to be based on transparent and objective criteria. The Council Common Position, published on 23 June, also makes it clear that there should be a national independent supervisory body, rather than merely regional ones, which is also in line with Parliament's position. The Committee also won a tighter definition of an "airport network", which means one that is operated by the same management body.
Disadvantaged and outermost regions
Transport Ministers also accept that incentives should be permitted for new routes to disadvantaged and outermost regions and that uniform charging systems may be applied by management bodies serving the same network only on the basis of transparent criteria.
Disabled and reduced-mobility passenger charges excluded
In addition to the above, charges for the provision of services to disabled and reduced-mobility passengers mobility will be excluded from the scope of the Directive.
Amendments to the Common Position
The Council had already given a formal written commitment to accept a further series of parliamentary amendments if tabled at the second reading. These amendments deal with pre-financing of airport investments and link pre-financing to ICAO policies and the need for safeguards. Firm deadlines for the publication of decisions on charges are also laid down in the proposal.

Airport charges
According to the newest 2007 figures, 69 airports will come under the scope of the Directive (with more than 5 million passengers or being the biggest airport in a Member State), By the entry into force of the Directive in 2010, it is estimated by ACI, the Airport Council International, that 77 airports will be concerned.
What happens next?
Rapporteur Ulrich Stockmann (PES, DE) and the committee believe that the outcome of the vote should ensure fair and transparent competition among airports, without undue bias towards competition at airports (as opposed to safeguarding consumer interests) or towards competition among users who use different business models. This means that this co-decision procedure may now be concluded. Rapporteur Ulrich STOCKMANN PES DE A6-0375/2008 Airport charges Procedure : Codecision (2nd reading)

MEPs to vote on a resolution on sea piracy
2008-10-16 - 10:04
On Thursday 23 October, the House will vote on a resolution on sea piracy following the debate that took place on 23 September 2008. At the EU defence summit of 2 October, EU Ministers agreed that military contributions to maritime surveillance will be consolidated to respond to intensified illicit trafficking and acts of piracy. The minister’s proposal to create a European maritime surveillance network received support. The planning of an EU military naval operation to fight against piracy off the coast of Somalia will be accelerated.
Speaking in the debate Geoffrey Van Orden (EPP-ED, UK) said: "You may recall that in the days when Britain truly had an ethical foreign policy, the Royal Navy swept the oceans clear of pirates. It blew them out of the water and we got rid of the slave trade as well.
Now we seem helpless. Our navies have been run down and we are frightened to act lest we fall foul of some aspect of human rights legislation, or become embroiled in lengthy judicial procedures.
The EU response is to try and invent another military operation by setting up a committee, a so-called EU coordination cell, which says it will coordinate military operations in the seas off the Horn of Africa. But, there is already a military operation in those waters. It is Combined Task Force 150, involving the US Fifth Fleet and warships from other NATO navies, led by a Dane at the moment."

Deal on the promotion of clean road transport vehicles
2008-10-16 - 10:04
Dan JØRGENSEN (PES DK), for the Environment Committee, will be tabling a proposed first reading agreement with Council on the promotion of clean road transport vehicles. The most important point of the deal is that the directive stays mandatory, but that Member States are given some flexibility. The aim of the directive is to promote and stipulate the market for clean and efficient vehicles to prompt industry to develop and invest in environmentally-friendly vehicles. The proposal concerns the promotion of clean and energy-efficient road transport by obliging public authorities and certain operators to consider not only the cost, but the environmental impact, of the vehicles that they plan to purchase.

The compromise would require all contracting authorities and entities and certain operators to consider not only the purchase price of vehicles but also their lifetime energy and environmental impacts (including energy consumption, CO2 emissions and emissions of certain pollutants (including NOx, NMHC and particulate matter)), when purchasing road transport vehicles.
MEPs managed to keep this requirement mandatory but inserted certain flexibility in the directive giving Member states different options to fulfil the requirement. If a procurement procedure is applied, the environmental impacts shall be used as award criteria and the operational lifetime costs for energy consumption, CO2 emissions and pollutants emissions shall be monetised and calculates following a methodology specifies in the directive.
Scope
The directive covers not only public procurers but also road transport vehicles purchased by contracting authorities and contracting entities irrespective whether they are public or private. It furthermore covers the purchase of road transport vehicles used for performing public passenger transports under an public service contract giving the Member States the freedom to exclude minor purchases with a view to avoiding unnecessary administrative burden.
Member States, furthermore, have the possibility to exempt vehicles designed and constructed for special use (vehicles designed and constructed for use principally on construction sites or in quarries, port or airport facilities, armed services, civil defence, fire services and forces responsible for maintaining public order; and mobile machinery).
Exchange of best practices
The Commission shall facilitate and structure the exchange of knowledge and best practices between Member States for promoting the purchase of clean and energy efficient vehicles Support for through facilitating and structuring.
Figures
Given that the total annual vehicle procurement by public authorities in the EU is estimated at 110,000 passenger cars, 110,000 light commercial vehicles, 35,000 lorries and 17,000 buses for the EU, the new directive is expected to ensure a sufficiently substantial demand for clean and energy-efficient vehicles to prompt industry to develop and invest in environmentally-friendly vehicles
Date for entry into force and transposition in national law.
Member States must transpose the directive 18-month after entry into force of the directive into national law. Entry into force is 20th day after publication.
Background
In June 2006, the Environment Committee rejected a similar Commission proposal. The new proposal incorporates several of the committee's requests, e.g. on the proposal's scope, technology neutrality and the inclusion of CO2 emissions.

Consumers
Timeshares: Parliament and Council agree new rules
2008-10-16 - 10:04
The timeshare holiday rights of some 1.5 million European families will soon be better protected, as MEPs in Strasbourg are expected to endorse a compromise reached between Parliament and Council on the new Timeshare Directive. The directive seeks to enhance consumer confidence and legal clarity, which are essential to the growth of this sector, via simplified EU-wide rules. Timeshare deals, which allow buyers to occupy holiday accommodation for specific periods in alternation with others, have won millions of takers worldwide since the 1970s. They are often sold as a cost-effective alternative to renting, hotels or a second residence. According to the Organisation for Timeshare in Europe, in 2001 there were 1.452 holiday centres in 25 European countries, 1.4 million families using this kind of accommodation and 200,000 Europeans employed in the sector, with sales totalling €2.3 billion per year. Most timeshare holidaymakers are from Germany or the UK, where most of the agencies are located, while most of the holiday centres are located in Spain, Italy, France and Portugal.
Why a new directive?
Since 1994, an EU directive has helped to harmonise timeshare rules across the EU, but litigation between operators and holidaymakers is still frequent, notably over conditions and quality of service.
Furthermore, new holiday products and services, similar to timeshare but not covered by the directive, have emerged. These include new types of holiday clubs giving holidaymakers reductions in the cost of their stays if they take out a subscription. Some of these new contracts clearly circumvent consumer protection rules.
The revised draft directive, which supplements the general rules introduced by the recent directive on unfair commercial practices, will cover both timeshare packages and new products that so far have escaped any legislation. Consumers will be better protected by rules that clearly state their rights, and will find it easier to go to court. Honest operators will no longer have to face unfair competition from fraudsters.
Content of the new directive
The directive lays down new rules on the right of withdrawal, choice of contract language, pre-contractual information and a ban on taking deposits during the cooling-off period.
The directive's scope is also broader than the old legislation. "Long-term holiday products" (holiday clubs), which were less common at the time the original directive was adopted, will fall within its ambit, as will re-sales and exchanges of timeshares.
It will cover not just traditional property timeshares but also boats, caravans and cruise ships marketed under timeshare or holiday club contracts.
The legislation applies to contracts for "more than one period of occupation" of the accommodation (i.e. repeated visits) concluded for a period of more than one year (previously three years). Any ancillary contracts will be cancelled if the consumer withdraws from the main contract.
A key point introduced by MEPs is a provision for staggered payments for holiday clubs: buyers will pay equal yearly instalments rather than a lump sum up-front.
MEPs also successfully defended the 14-day cooling-off period granted to buyers after signing a timeshare contract, as proposed by the Commission, against Council's wish to shorten it to 10 days.
Lastly, Member States will have to encourage the creation of effective out-of-court complaints and redress procedures for settling consumer disputes and must encourage traders to inform consumers of such procedures.

Statistics on trade within the EU
2008-10-16 - 10:04
MEPs will vote on a series of changes to the EU’s system for collecting statistics on the trade in goods between Member States. The proposals aim to reduce the administrative burden on businesses involved in reporting data to statistical bodies, while at the same time, maintaining access for policy-makers to high quality statistical information. In a report by Eoin Ryan (UEN, IE), the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee is proposing that Parliament adopt the reforms with a few additional changes, notably to set a threshold to ensure additional companies are exempted from reporting requirements and to strengthen data protection procedures.

Annual report on European Ombudsman's activities calls for more initiatives to raise citizens' awareness
2008-10-16 - 10:04
Dushana Zdravkova (EPP-ED, BG) will be tabling a report for the Petitions Committee on the 2007 annual report of the European Ombudsman's activities. Nikiforos Diamandouros, the European Ombudsman from April 1, 2003, will take part in the debate. The report calls for all EU institutions and bodies to be given the necessary budgetary and human resources to ensure that citizens receive prompt and substantive responses to their enquiries, complaints and petitions. Citizens need more information
The report stresses the need to further enhance the public profile of the Ombudsman. Although the number of inadmissible complaints received by the Ombudsman was lower in 2007 than in 2006, the report calls for a further reduction in the number of complaints which do not fall within the Ombudsman's remit. It considers that high-quality information may help and suggests that a common website be put in place to assist citizens.
Similarly, the report welcomes the development of an interactive manual which helps citizens identify the most suitable forum for resolving their problems. This is in recognition of the fact that citizens are not always able to distinguish between institutions when it comes to filing a complaint or petition.
More on responsibilities of Ombudsman and EU institutions
With regard to complaints that do not fall within the Ombudsman's terms of reference, Mr Diamandouros will be asked to commit himself to directly forwarding each complaint to the national or regional ombudsman concerned.
With regard to the Commission, the report calls on the Ombudsman to ensure that the it makes proper use of its discretionary powers to initiate infringement proceedings, while taking scrupulous care to avoid delays or unjustifiable failure to take prompt action, which are incompatible with the Commission's powers to oversee the application of EU law.
It also repeats its call for all EU institutions and bodies to adopt a common approach with regard to the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour. The Code, which is addressed to European citizens and civil servants, informs citizens of good administration procedures and advises civil servants on what principles to observe in their activities.
In general, the report considers that Mr Diamandouros has "continued to exercise his powers in an active and balanced way". Rapporteur Dushana ZDRAVKOVA EPP-ED BG A6-0358/2008 Annual report on the European Ombudsman's activities in 2007 Procedure : own-initiative

A safer internet for children
2008-10-16 - 10:04
Children and teenagers are keen internet users - 12 to 15-year-olds spend at least three hours a day on screen - but are not always aware of the dangers: not just sites showing child pornography or violence but also the risk of bullying or grooming. Parliament will vote in Strasbourg on a proposal to ensure better protection for children against these dangers. The proposal seeks to introduce a new "Safer Internet" programme to run from 2009 to 2013, following on from the success of the current programme (2005-2008). The aim is to anticipate discernable trends in the online environment. With a budget of €55 million, the programme will combat illegal content, promote a safer online environment, raise public awareness and establish a "knowledge base" for research purposes. Parliament is working on this legislation in co-decision with the Council of Ministers.
The programme will provide for:
- national contact points for reporting illegal content and harmful conduct;
- involvement of children and young people in initiatives to create a safer online environment;
- greater public awareness (information campaigns, exchange of best practice);
- a knowledge base, bringing together researchers engaged in child safety online.
A report for the EP Civil Liberties Committee, drafted by Roberta Angelilli (UEN, IT), supports the Commission proposal with a number of amendments including greater emphasis on combating new developments such as the electronic harassment and psychological manipulation of children and the showing of physical and/or psychological aggression. The committee suggests setting up a common "child-safe" label for webpages, as well as information packages for teachers, carers and parents.
MEPs also say hotlines should be available for reporting illegal online content, and filters should be set up to prevent offending content from passing through on-line technologies. In addition, they wish to facilitate information exchange between Member States, since illegal content can be uploaded in one country and viewed in another.

Questions raised about accord with Australia on passenger name records
2008-10-16 - 10:04
The House will vote on a draft recommendation by the Civil Liberties Committee criticising the Council for concluding an agreement with Australia on the processing and transfer of passenger name records (PNR) without consulting or even informing the European Parliament. MEPs are concerned about the consequences of the agreement for EU citizens' right to data protection. In its draft recommendation, by Sophie In 't Veld (ALDE, NL), the committee says the procedure followed for the conclusion of the agreement lacks democratic legitimacy, as at no stage was there any meaningful democratic scrutiny or parliamentary approval. Despite repeated requests, Parliament has at no point been informed or consulted. The committee questions the legal base chosen by the Council for the agreement and says Parliament "reserves its right to intervene before the Court of Justice".
Data protection
The text "welcomes the fact that the Australian Privacy Act applies unabridged to EU citizens, but is concerned about any exceptions and exemptions that may leave EU citizens with incomplete legal protection".
Indeed, the committee points out that the agreement covers "a wide range of purposes", "making it impossible to establish if the measures are justified and proportional". As a result, the agreement "fails to meet EU and international data protection standards".
The committee also believes that "an exchange of diplomatic notes is an unacceptable method for amending the list of departments and agencies that may have access to PNR data".
Lastly, the draft recommendation reminds the Council that "in the event of entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon all the PNR agreements should be reviewed by associating the European Parliament on a fair basis".

Clarifying rules on divorce for international couples
2008-10-16 - 10:04
Where should international couples be able to divorce? Parliament will vote in Strasbourg on a draft report by the Civil Liberties Committee which voices support for plans to reduce the number of disputes over the choice of country for the roughly 170,000 cross-border divorces that take place every year in the European Union. Oral questions to Council and Commission will also be debated in a joint debate with the report by Evelyne GEBHARDT (PES, DE).
The draft regulation on which the EP will give its opinion does not seek to create a standard EU-wide divorce system but to harmonise the rules on disputes, which until now have been unclear: most Member States do not allow couples to choose the law that applies to their divorce. The result is sometimes a form of "shopping around", with one partner launching divorce proceedings in the country where he/she thinks their interests will be best served.
The aim of the draft EU regulation is to allow couples to choose by common accord the Member State where they wish to divorce, if they have defined links with it, such as it being their country of residence, of nationality or where the divorce application is lodged. MEPs suggest adding the country where the marriage took place.
The proposal provides for the two parties to be informed of their rights, to prevent the choice of law applicable creating a disadvantage for the weaker member of a couple.
Ensuring better information for partners
However, MEPs are proposing amendments emphasising the need to inform couples of the practical repercussions of their choices, and seeking to ensure that they receive full, reliable information before signing any act. For this purpose, they suggest the creation of an information system on the internet.
Making use of enhanced cooperation
The legislation being considered by Parliament is unlikely to be adopted in its original form of an EU regulation. The Commission originally put forward a draft regulation, which required consultation of the European Parliament. However, this draft also needed unanimous approval in Council and, since it has encountered firm opposition from Sweden, seems unlikely to go ahead in that form. Nevertheless, at least nine countries (France, Italy, Spain, Romania, Austria, Hungary, Greece, Slovenia and Luxembourg) have agreed to use the "enhanced cooperation" method for this matter, which would enable them to proceed on their own.
Parliament still wishes to take advantage of the original consultation procedure in order to make its views known and is doing so in this report by Evelyne Gebhardt (PES, DE).
The United Kingdom opted out of this legislation from the start. Ireland is not taking part in the enhanced cooperation procedure.

Deal on the marketing authorisations for medicinal products
2008-10-16 - 10:04
Françoise GROSSETÊTE (EPP-ED, FR) will be putting forward a first-reading agreement concerning a Commission proposal to harmonise the regulatory system used to change marketing authorisations for medicinal products (changes subsequent to the placing on the market, such as change in the production process, change in the packaging or change in the address of the manufacturer, update of patient information leaflet). The Commission will make a statement on the counterfeiting of medicines.
It will ensure that all medicinal products placed on the Community market - including those authorised at purely national level - are subject to the same criteria for the approval and administrative handling of changes, regardless of the procedure under which those medicines have been authorised (national or EU procedure). All operators within the European Community will thus be subject to the same rules for the approval, administrative treatment and supervision of changes to medicinal products, thereby eliminating, and diverging, redundant and contradicting requirements.
A compromise at first reading has been agreed with Council taking on board many of the demands of the Environment Committee
Within the European Community, medicinal products are regulated throughout their entire lifetime. Changes subsequent to their placing on the market, are governed either by national provisions or by Community rules: "Variations Regulations".
However, the current Variations Regulations do not apply to changes to marketing authorisations for medicinal products which have been granted at a national level by a Member State competent authority under a national procedure. In the absence of Community harmonisation, changes affecting purely national authorisations are therefore subject to national rules, which differ quite substantially.
The objective of the proposal is, therefore, to empower the Commission to extend the scope of the corresponding Variations Regulation to ensure that all medicinal products placed on the Community market -including those authorised at purely national level - are subject to the same criteria for the approval and administrative handling of changes, regardless of the procedure under which those medicines have been authorised.
- In certain cases MEPs want to give Member States the possibility to continue to apply national provisions
- MEPs want to extend the possibility of submitting a single application in certain cases
- MEPs want to prolong the transition period from 12 month to 18 month after entry into force. Rapporteur Françoise GROSSETÊTE EPP-ED FR A6-0346/2008 Variations to the terms of marketing authorisations for medicinal products Procedure: Codecision (1st reading)

Recovery of cod stocks - Celtic Sea plan to get green light
2008-10-16 - 10:04
The Fisheries Committee is proposing a report on the Commission's proposal aimed at strengthening a recovery plan for cod stocks. MEPs in the committee say that all cod caught ought to be landed, rather than discarded, so as to enable proper scientific evaluation of stocks, stress that new mechanisms must be introduced to encourage fishermen and Member States to engage in cod-avoidance programmes and agree with the inclusion of the Celtic Sea in the recovery plan. The cod recovery plan, established in 2004, is aimed at ensuring the reconstitution of cod stocks within a ten-year period to precautionary levels advised by scientists. The cod stocks covered by this plan were those in the North Sea, Kattegat and Skaggerak, the Eastern Channel , the Irish Sea and West of Scotland.
Recent scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) has indicated that the reductions in cod catches arising from the collective effect of total allowable landings (TACs), technical measures and complementary effort management measures have been far from sufficient to reduce fishing mortalities to levels required to allow the cod stocks to rebuild. None of the four cod stocks covered by the recovery plan show clear signs of recovery, "although Committee MEPs say that stocks in the North and Celtic Seas are showing some signs of improvement.
Last April, the Commission submitted a proposal to improve several aspects of the plan, given that cod stocks remain under severe pressure. The main proposed changes are:
revision of the plan's long-term objectives, so as to take account of the effects of global warming on ocean conditions;
inclusion of an objective on fishing mortality;
simplified and more efficient implementation of a management system to regulate fishing effort;
a modulated approach for the adjustment of fishing opportunities where recovery is already achieved for a given stock;
measures to reduce cod discards and to encourage fishermen to engage in cod-avoidance programmes;
inclusion of the Celtic Sea in the recovery plan, as this stock has also proved to be equally overexploited as the other cod stocks in Community waters.
"The success of the recovery plan is also dependent on not landing fish caught through illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. Monitoring and control are, therefore, important instruments to ensure the enforcement of fishing regulations", says Fisheries Committee rapporteur Niels BUSK (ALDE, DK).
"Owing to the importance of cod fisheries, its impact on fishing for other species and the major economic and social interests at stake, the recovery plan for cod stocks must be successfully implemented", he adds.
In proposing, under consultation, several amendments to the Commission's proposal, the Fisheries Committee stresses that:
all cod caught ought to be landed, rather than discarded, so as to enable proper scientific evaluation of stocks;
Member States (not only fishermen) should be encouraged to introduce measures to reduce fishing mortality and discards;
Member States should exercise their power to allocate access to fishing for cod stocks so as to encourage their fishermen to fish in ways that result in more selective fishing and are less harmful to the environment;
as is the case in other management plans, the margin of +/- 15% of the TAC established in the previous year should be generally applicable;
to ensure that the data used are of high quality and reliability, 2004-2006 should be used as the reference years, instead of 2005-2007;
account should be taken of the fact that the fishing effort can also be increased provided fishing mortality is less than the target (cod mortality rate of 0.4);
MEPs delete a provision which, according to them, impedes restructuring of the fleet in relation to 2007 - for example, it would not be possible to replace beam trawl vessels with gill net vessels, which consume less fuel compared with the fleet structure in 2007;
MEPs specify, as "other relevant sources of cod mortality", cod being killed by seals and the impact of climate change on cod recovery;
when cod stocks have substantially improved, the Commission should review the system of regulating the fishing effort. Rapporteur Niels BUSK ALDE DK A6-0340/2008 Recovery of cod stocks Procedure : Consultation

Management of fishing fleets registered in the outermost regions
2008-10-16 - 10:04
The Fisheries Committee defends the extension until end of 2011 for the entry into the fleet of the fishing vessels receiving national State aid for renewal. The aim of the proposal on the management of fishing fleets registered in the outermost regions analysed in Pedro Guerreiro's (GUE/NGL, PT) report is to extend the deadline for the entry into the fleet of the fishing vessels receiving national State aid for renewal.
The Regulation (EC) No 639/2004 on the management of fishing fleets registered in the Community outermost regions lays down derogations from the entry/exit scheme provided by Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy and from the prohibition to use public funds to modernise or renew the fleet set out in Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 on Community structural assistance in the fisheries sector.
The deadline for such derogations had been extended for one year following the political agreement reached in the Council on 19 June 2006 concerning the European Fisheries Fund (EFF). However, the late adoption of the Commission's legal instrument allowing Member States concerned to grant State aid, together with the limited capacity of shipyards, has made it impossible to comply with the deadline for the entry into the fleet of the fishing vessels receiving national State aid for renewal by 31 December 2008, as stipulated in Regulation (EC) No 639/2004.
The purpose of this proposal is to extend until 31 December 2009 the deadline for the entry into the fleet of the fishing vessels receiving national State aid for renewal and amending Regulation (EC) No 639/2004.
The Fisheries Committee propose compromise amendments on the extension of the deadline:
It is, therefore, appropriate to extend up to 2011 the deadline for the derogation set out in Article 2(5) of Regulation (EC) No 639/2004.
In Article 2(5) of Regulation (EC) No 639/2004, "31 December 2008" shall be replaced by "31 December 2011".
There are fleets in the outermost regions consisting mainly of ageing vessels (dating back over 30 years in some regions), and it is therefore necessary to ensure Community support for those fleets' renewal and modernisation, especially for the small-scale fleets, this being a sine qua non for improving the conditions for conservation of fish stocks and fishermen's working and safety conditions, MEPs say. They also add that the Commission shall submit a report on the implementation of this regulation no later than the end of the derogations and that it shall suggest adjustments that may be required in the light of changes in the social and economic needs of the regions concerned and the state of the fish stocks fished by their fleets.

Gerardo GALEOTE (EPP-ED, ES), on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, will be asking the Commission the following questions on the European Union Solidarity Fund and obstacles for its reform: The European Commission proposal COM(2005)0108 – 2005/0033 (COD) modifying Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002 on the European Union Solidarity Fund has been kept on hold by the Council for more than two years since the European Parliament gave it its first reading. The European Parliament considers it to be of paramount importance to have a Solidarity Fund Regulation which meets the challenges and allows the Union to deliver prompt and effective assistance when Member States suffer a disaster.
Could the European Commission explain to Parliament what are the causes of Council’s inability to reach a Common Position?
Which Member States are in favour of Parliament’s and the European Commission’s approach and which are reluctant to agree to the reform of the Solidarity Fund and on what grounds?
Does the European Commission foresee any action or political initiative in the future which will successfully unblock the situation?
Michel Barnier’s report ‘For a European civil protection force: Europe Aid’ was published back in 2006 and received the full support of Parliament in so far as it proposed the creation of a European civil protection force. This proposal is intimately related to the revision of the Solidarity Fund but as yet we have seen no follow-up.
Does the European Commission envisage any legislative initiative in this field? Gerardo GALEOTE EPP-ED ES Oral question to Commission

MEPs to vote on a report on governance in regional policy
2008-10-16 - 10:04
Regional development spending from various EU funds needs to be better planned and co-ordinated, and regional and local partners enabled to take part in development planning from the outset, says this own-initiative report by Jean-Marie Beaupuy (ALDE, FR), on governance and partnership at national, regional and project levels in regional policy, unanimously proposed by the Regional Development Committee on 9 September. Key points
- Better exploiting and co-ordinating funding : to help integrate spending from all Community funds used to promote regional and urban development (Structural Funds, R&D funds, and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development - EAFRD), the report calls on the Commission, Member States and regional and local authorities to exploit and co-ordinate them better.
- Maximising efficiency and quality of public services : the report calls on national, regional and local authorities to step up their use of the "integrated approach" to ensure that good governance provides practical solutions e.g. for public transport, drinking water, social housing and public education. Says this approach should be made compulsory.
"Governance" involves firstly the allocation of powers and budgets between state, regional and local authorities, and secondly partnership among all the public and private bodies concerned by a topic in a given territory.
- Merge funds after 2013 ? It also proposes a study on the feasibility of merging these funds, and in particular the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund and the EAFRD, after 2013.
- Simplifying procedures : to reduce bureaucratic burdens, it urges the Commission, Member States, regional and local authorities to examine together how to simplify procedures and divide responsibilities more clearly, taking due account of potential beneficiaries' suggestions.
- Allow contributions in kind : it also calls on Commission to promote the use of Article 56 of the Structural Funds regulation, which, where money is short, permits contributions in kind to EU co-funded projects and on Member States to support and facilitate volunteering.
- Effective partnerships - Partnership can enhance effectiveness, efficiency, legitimacy and transparency at all stages of structural fund planning and implementation, says the report, which calls on Member States and managing authorities to involve partners early on and more closely in all planning and implementation phases, so as to make better use of their experience and know-how.
- Good or bad governance ? The Commission is asked to assess how EU Member States implement partnership when devising national strategic reference frameworks and operational programmes, so as to identify factors in successful and unsuccessful governance and ascertain whether they take account of partners' suggestions.
Partnership guide - the Commission is asked to draw up a guide to ensuring effective partnerships, in keeping with the each Member State's institutional framework and including good practices and clear criteria for selecting partners.
- Public-private partnerships - The also report urges Member States to ensure closer co-operation between public and private sectors by establishing public-private partnerships to implement structural funding.
- Multi-level governance - the report says that to succeed, multi-level governance must be based on a "bottom-up" approach. It calls on local and regional authorities to look at how to step up their co-operation with national governments and the Commission, and recommends regular meetings of officials representing national, regional and local authorities.
- Subsidiarity - it urges Member States to decentralise the implementation of cohesion policy, so that multi-level governance can work effectively in keeping with the subsidiarity principle, and calls on them to take the necessary decentralisation measures at both legislative and budgetary levels.
- Cross-border co-operation - the report calls on Member States that have not yet amended their national law to provide for the establishment of the European Grouping for Territorial Cooperation (EGTC) to do so as soon as possible.
- Governance and partnership training - Finally, the report calls on the Commission and Member States to support the development of governance and partnership training measures, involving all public and private education and training organisations, with a view to addressing all the major challenges facing the Community. It proposes creating a programme, similar to ERASMUS, for regional and local elected officials.
