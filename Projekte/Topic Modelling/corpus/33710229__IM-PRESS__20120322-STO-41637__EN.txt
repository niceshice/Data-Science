Read on to find out more about what will happen in Parliament this week.
Brussels plenary
March's second plenary will start on Wednesday afternoon with a debate on the accession reports of Turkey, Serbia, Kosovo and Montenegro , mapping the progress these countries have made towards joining the EU over the past year. Parliament will vote on the reports the following day as well as on a resolution on the situation in Belarus.
On Thursday, MEPs will vote on new EU rules on the trade in "over-the-counter" derivatives to make the derivatives market safer for investors and more transparent to regulators. They will also appoint the members of the new special parliamentary committee on organised crime.
MEPs will also vote on a resolution calling for a stricter enforcement of air passengers rights , including people's right to be flown home when stranded due to their airline's bankruptcy, something that still ruins hundreds of travellers' holidays every year.
In committee
On Tuesday, the members of the "Troika" mission to Greece , composed of European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund representatives, will discuss the Greek rescue effort and the current financial and economic situation in the country with members of the EP's economic affairs and employment committees.
The new agreement to transfer p assenger name record (PNR) data to the US will be put to a vote on the same day. Dutch Liberal Sophia in 't Veld , who is responsible for steering the agreement through Parliament, says it should be rejected due to the lack of progress in the negotiations with the US on better safeguards for EU citizens in processing the data collected. On Tuesday, the committee will question experts on the alleged CIA rendition flights and the illegal detention of suspects on European soil.
Anti-counterfeiting trade agreement ACTA will be discussed on Monday by the civil liberties committee and on Tuesday by the international trade committee.
EP president Martin Schulz will present Parliament's position on the Citizens' Initiative in a press conference on Wednesday, ahead of its entry into force on 1 April.
