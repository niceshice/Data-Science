The Budgets Committee approved the political agreement struck in Strasbourg earlier this month when it voted on Tuesday on a draft report by FP rapporteur Reimer Böge. The text broadly welcomes the agreement but also pinpoints a number of shortcomings which will have to be addressed in the future, notably in the course of the review of the EU budget set to take place in 2008-09.
The committee's report stresses the main points of the deal of 4 April: four billion euros will be redistributed to a range of programmes and, following the 2009 European elections, Parliament will have the chance to vote on the budget review carried out by the Commission, a review in which Parliament will be closely involved (see our press release of 5 April - link at bottom of this page).
A key point, say MEPs, is that the political agreement reached on 4 April is the "only possible compromise that Parliament could achieve…with a view to guaranteeing the continuity of EU legislation" . However, the deal will also ensure that the EU budget is soundly managed and will preserve Parliament's legislative and budgetary powers over the period 2007-2013. The committee comments on the outcome of the European Council of December 2005 and makes clear its belief that national interests overrode common European goals when the Member States adopted their position on the FP.
Among the shortcomings identified by the draft report is the system of own-resources, which MEPs say should be revised to "avoid the same painful experience of national bargaining for the next Financial Perspective" . Lastly, the committee adds that it still believes the higher figures adopted in June 2005 offered the best way of funding Community policies.
Mr Böge's report will be debated and put to the vote at the plenary session in May in Strasbourg. It will be accompanied by a recommendation from the Constitutional Affairs Committee on whether the Interinstitutional Agreement complies with the current Treaties.
