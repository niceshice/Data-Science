EU budget impasse: debate with Barroso and Belgian presidency
2010-11-22 - 14:00
MEPs will debate the deadlock over the 2011 EU budget with Commission President José Manuel Barroso and the Belgian Council presidency, and will vote on a resolution drawn up by the political group leaders. Negotiations between Parliament and the EU Council of Ministers on next year's budget reached an impasse on Monday after a refusal by a minority of governments to discuss how to involve Parliament in talks on the EU financing system.
The EP negotiating team had reiterated its willingness to accept the level of spending proposed by the Council (an increase in 2011 payments of 2.91 per cent), while it had already capped commitments (which determine payments) at a below-inflation figure of 1 per cent.
However, the MEPs also repeated their desire to open talks about how Parliament can be involved in a review of the EU budget financing system in order to make it less crisis-prone, as well as to include some flexibility in the budgets.
Parliament’s negotiating team was led by President Jerzy Buzek. The rapporteurs were, for the general budget, Sidonia Jędrzejewska (EPP, PL), for the budget of the institutions, Helga Trüpel (Greens/EFA, DE) and, for working methods regarding the long term budget framework, Reimer Böge (EPP, DE).

A ban on disguised advertising of prescription drugs
2010-11-22 - 14:00
Patients are set to be given better information on prescription drugs, under new draft EU legislation. The EP Environment Committee has tabled amendments to draw a clearer line between advertising and information on such drugs, in order to foil disguised advertising. But pharmaceutical companies will have to provide reliable, non-commercial information when asked. MEPs wish to specify which data must be made available to the public by pharmaceutical firms, which information is to be optional and through which channels it is to be supplied. They also want Member States to be required to provide information on medicines on dedicated websites.
The basic aim of the legislation is to ensure the availability of good-quality, objective, reliable and non-promotional information on medicines. Parliament deals with the proposals in two reports drafted by Christofer Fjellner (EPP, SE).
Compulsory and optional information to be supplied by pharmaceutical firms
The Environment Committee says pharmaceutical companies should be required to provide the latest authorised summary of a product's characteristics, the latest authorised labelling and package leaflet and the latest publicly accessible version of the assessment report by the competent authorities. All this would be optional under the Commission proposal.
In addition, pharmaceutical companies may provide the public with other well-defined non-promotional information, for example on the environmental impact of the product or on prices or pack changes, although they would need prior approval from the relevant authorities.
All this information would have to be supplied both in printed and electronic form (notably on approved websites). MEPs want it to be available in formats appropriate for the blind and partially-sighted as well.
No unsolicited information
The Commission is proposing that information from pharmaceutical companies on prescription drugs should not be broadcast on radio or TV. The Environment Committee voted that it should also not be published in newspapers or magazines.
Printed material from drug manufacturers may be sent to members of the public only if they have made a specific request for information, says another committee amendment.
Member States' obligation to provide information
MEPs add a new article to the legislation, obliging Member States to ensure that "objective, unbiased information" is available to the general public on medicinal products sold in that Member State. This information too would have to be made available in electronic form (on dedicated websites set up by the Member State) and in printed form and in a format accessible to people with disabilities.

Keeping toxic substances out of electrical goods
2010-11-22 - 14:00
Parliament is set to vote on Tuesday on improving safety rules for the many electronic gadgets and electrical appliances sold in the EU. The new rules will mean blacklisted substances will be banned from a wider range of these goods. The update to the directive on the restriction of hazardous substances directive (RoHS), recently agreed in principle by Parliament and Council, now awaits formal approval by the two institutions.
A number of hazardous substances, such as lead and mercury, are already banned from certain types of electrical and electronic goods. Under the new rules, following a transition period to allow industry to adjust, these will apply to all such appliances except those specifically excluded from the scope of the legislation (such as photovoltaic solar panels). The rules will also allow for certain hazardous substances to be permitted if there is an absence of effective alternatives.
Some MEPs, including rapporteur Jill Evans (Greens/EFA, UK), are concerned about the possible long-term health effects of nanomaterials - an emerging technology already applied in some electrical goods (for example, nanosilver is used as an anti-bacterial agent in some new fridges). While the agreement does not follow the EP Environment Committee's recommendation to ban certain nanomaterials from electrical goods, it does state that the Commission should pay specific attention to very small substances.
The updated legislation will be relevant beyond Europe's borders, since manufactured goods imported to the EU will need to meet the requirements. Furthermore, many electrical goods bought in the EU later end up in developing countries, either for reuse or illegally as waste. Improved safety rules here can therefore also provide health benefits elsewhere.
Separate draft legislation to update rules on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) has not yet found agreement between Council and Parliament and will not be up for a plenary vote in Strasbourg as originally scheduled.

Trichet on the ECB's 2009 work and on currency war
2010-11-22 - 14:00
As the debt crisis continues to pressure some Eurozone countries, European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet will participate in Monday's plenary joint debate on the work of the ECB in 2009 and latest developments on the international currency exchanges. On Tuesday MEPs will vote on a resolution on the ECB's performance and particularly its reaction to the economic crisis.
In view of the persistent problem of indebtedness, the draft resolution urges the ECB to purchase government debt in a similar way to what is happening in the UK and the US. It also highlights the problems caused when credit rating agencies judge Member States' indebtedness and calls on the Commission to be more ambitious with its proposal for controlling how these agencies operate.
The draft text also stresses that a robust economic governance system is essential for true economic and monetary union and that the emphasis has until now been too narrowly focused on monetary aspects.

Georgia's relations with the EU will come under the spotlight when President Mikheil Saakashvili addresses a formal sitting of MEPs on Tuesday. Mr Saakashvili is also due to meet Foreign Affairs Committee MEPs. Mr Saakashvili was elected Georgia's third President in January 2004 and re-elected in 2008.
Georgia is negotiating visa facilitation and readmission agreements with the EU. The Civil Liberties Committee recommended in October that the European Parliament approve these agreements in plenary session. The vote will probably be taken in December.

State aid to coal mines must be halted more gradually
2010-11-22 - 14:00
Member States should be allowed to grant state aid to ease the closure of uncompetitive coal mines for longer than the European Commission is proposing, says the Economics Committee. MEPs suggest prolonging the deadline for closing the coal production units until 31 December 2018 - four years later than the Commission wants - to reduce the social impact of the closures. Parliament is being consulted on this legislation and will vote on the committee's report on Tuesday.

Climate: MEPs urge can-do attitude in Cancun
2010-11-22 - 14:00
Major progress is needed at the upcoming UN climate talks in Cancún, Mexico, according to a draft resolution by the Environment Committee. Agreement is needed in particular on forest protection, climate aid to developing countries and technology transfer. The resolution will also address the current debate within the EU on stepping up its target to 30% greenhouse gas reductions by 2020, a move that would yield economic benefits, according to the Environment Committee.
The European Parliament's official delegation of 15 MEPs will attend the latter stages of the climate conference in Cancún. They are led by delegation chair Jo Leinen (S&D, DE) and vice-chair Karl-Heinz Florenz (EPP, DE).

EU aid for unemployed in Netherlands and flood victims in Ireland
2010-11-22 - 14:00
On Tuesday Parliament will vote on plans to grant financial assistance to former print and publishing employees in the Netherlands and people hit by the 2009 floods in Ireland. An amount of €10.5 million from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is being proposed to aid over 3,000 people in the Netherlands who lost their jobs in the printing and publishing sector last year due to the economic crisis.
A figure of €13 million would come from the EU Solidarity Fund to compensate people in Ireland hit by the severe floods in November 2009.
The reports were drafted by Barbara Matera (EPP, IT) on the Netherlands, and Reimer Böge (EPP, DE) and Lásló Surján (EPP, HU) on Ireland.

Democracy in Ukraine back on the agenda
2010-11-22 - 14:00
Parliament will vote on Thursday on a resolution on the political situation in Ukraine. A resolution drafted jointly by the EPP, ALDE, Greens/EFA and ECR groups, which spoke of "worrying signs of erosion of democracy", was on the agenda for Parliament's October session but a majority of MEPs decided to postpone the vote until after Ukraine's local elections on 31 October.
In a discussion on 27 October with Ukrainian foreign minister Kostyantyn Gryshchenko, MEPs of the Foreign Affairs Committee repeatedly voiced concern about transparency and fairness in the local elections, the recent restrictive law reforms and the growing lack of media freedom in the country.

Anti-counterfeiting accord: MEPs to set conditions
2010-11-22 - 14:00
The controversial Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) will once again come under the spotlight next week when Parliament adopts resolutions on the final agreement reached by negotiators in Tokyo (from 23 September to 2 October). The aim of the new multilateral ACTA agreement between the EU, the US, Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and Switzerland is to strengthen the enforcement of intellectual property rights and to help combat the counterfeiting and piracy of goods such as luxury clothing, music and films.
However, critics of the agreement say that since China and Russia – the largest sources of international counterfeiting and piracy – have not signed up, this makes the deal almost worthless.
Parliament's consent is needed for the agreement to take effect. Following a debate on latest developments with EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht on 20 October, MEPs will vote on a resolution in which they will set out conditions for their final approval.

2010-11-22 - 14:00
The Economics Committee is recommending that Parliament support an extension of the temporary minimum VAT rate of 15% until 2015 but also that the EU move towards a definitive system by the end of this period. The opinion by the Economics Committee also addresses the wider picture of the review of the general VAT strategy. It urges the Commission to launch this procedure by 2013 and to develop a system that boosts the single market and effectively tackles VAT fraud, currently amounting to around €100 billion per year.

EP verdict on Ombudsman's 2009 activities
2010-11-22 - 14:00
On Thursday Parliament will give its annual verdict on the work of the European Ombudsman over the previous year. The Ombudsman's role is to investigate cases of maladministration in the EU institutions, such as refusals to grant citizens access to documents, abuses of power and cases of discrimination.
MEPs welcome the fact that in 56% of the 318 cases closed by the Ombudsman in 2009, the institution concerned settled the matter, compared to 36% in 2008. Parliament will also vote on a draft resolution on a complaint received by the Ombudsman concerning the Commission's refusal to disclose information on an exchange of letters with the car manufacturer Porsche AG.
Nikiforos Diamandouros of Greece has been the European Ombudsman since January 2003. The Ombudsman's office was established in 1995.

Removing legal barriers facing individuals and businesses
2010-11-22 - 14:00
Obstacles thrown up by differences between national legal systems must be tackled so that Europe's citizens can benefit fully from European integration, says a draft report by the Legal Affairs Committee. Family law and the need to cut red tape for small businesses are among the main issues, believe MEPs. This report is Parliament's response to the Action Plan Implementing the Stockholm Programme presented by the Commission in 20 April 2010, which seeks to deliver an area of freedom, security and justice for Europe's citizens.

Haiti cholera outbreak: MEPs to debate need for urgent aid
2010-11-22 - 14:00
MEPs will hear a Commission statement on Monday afternoon and debate developments in earthquake-ravaged Haiti, where the cholera death toll recently topped 1,000 people. Haiti is to hold presidential and legislative elections on 28 November, but voters are proving hard to identify, because many deaths went unrecorded after the 12 January 2010 earthquake, which killed over 250,000 people. Without a death certificate, no name can be removed from the electoral list.

Bees and CAP reform
2010-11-22 - 14:00
MEPs will call on the Commission to step up support to beekeepers when the EU common agricultural policy is next revamped. They will also ask what the reforms carried out so far have done to reduce red tape for EU farmers. Bee mortality is rising just as the number of beekeepers in Europe is falling. These developments are particularly worrying as 84% of plant species and 76% of EU food production depend on bee pollination.

EU energy strategy: MEPs to debate priorities
2010-11-22 - 14:00
Parliament votes on Thursday on proposed priorities for the EU's future energy strategy. It is likely to argue that these should include applying existing legislation in full, promoting energy projects and strengthening EU external energy policy. MEPs view success in creating a single energy market as essential, and stress that energy efficiency is a cost-effective way to cut energy dependency, combat climate change, create jobs and curb energy bills.

Western Sahara: MEPs to look at alleged human rights abuses
2010-11-22 - 14:00
On Wednesday Parliament will discuss alleged human rights violations in the Western Sahara. The debate will be followed up with a resolution at the plenary session in December. The Moroccan security forces are reported to have launched an assault on the Gadaym Izik camp on 8 November, resulting in a number of casualties and disappearances. Journalists, NGOs and MEPs have since been prevented from entering the area.

Public service broadcasters need more money and less political interference
2010-11-22 - 14:00
Public service TV and radio channels in some EU Member States need proper financial backing, as well as safeguards for their editorial independence, says a draft resolution to be put to the vote in Strasbourg. The draft resolution calls on EU Member States "to end political interference regarding the content of services offered by public broadcasters", noting that some "still fail to respect European standards on freedom of expression, media pluralism, and the independence, remit and funding of public service media".
EU Member States should "provide appropriate, proportionate and stable funding for public service media", and those that do not should be held accountable, say MEPs. They also call for EU measures to guarantee the transparency of ownership of private broadcasters and ensure that "all individuals in all regions have equal access to public service broadcasting".

Annual review of ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly
2010-11-22 - 14:00
Parliament will vote on Tuesday on a resolution on the work done by the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2009. In the annual review for 2009 of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, drafted by the Development Committee, MEPs welcome the past efforts of this body as a forum for dialogue but urge it now to monitor closely the ongoing negotiations for Economic Partnership Agreements between EU and ACP countries, which envisage the mutual opening up of markets.
In addition, looking ahead to the EU-Africa summit being held in Libya in late November, MEPs deplore the fact that "the JPA was not properly consulted during the drafting of the Joint EU-Africa Strategy and hope that the Assembly will be actively involved in the implementation of that strategy."
The Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) is the parliamentary forum for open, democratic and in-depth dialogue between the European Union and the African Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries.
