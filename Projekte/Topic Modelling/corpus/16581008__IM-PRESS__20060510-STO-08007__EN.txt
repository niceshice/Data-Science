Tradesmen from new EU members set to benefit from new work opportunities
"Old" and "new" Europe took a step closer on 1 May as Spain, Portugal, Finland and Greece opened their labour markets to workers from the 8 Central and Eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004. They join Britain, Ireland and Sweden who opened their labour markets when the new members joined two years ago. With 2006 being the European year of workers' mobility the news received a cautiously optimistic response from some MEPs closely involved in the issue.
Jan Andersson the Swedish Social democrat who chairs Parliament's Employment and Social committee, welcomed the move saying, "the EU has a set of rules on how to deal with transitional restrictions and the Member States need to respect it. At the same time I believe that the EU states who have not yet abolished the restrictions on access to their labour market for workers...should do so as soon as possible."
This was echoed by Hungary's Csaba Őry from the European Peoples Party. As a leading member of the Employment committee he drafted a report on workers mobility that was adopted by the Parliament in April. The report states that "continued denial of opportunities for workers from the new member states...has fuelled more illegal work, promotion of the black economy, and worker exploitation". It also calls for an end to restrictions to send a "clear message of solidarity between Western and Eastern Europe".
Deadline of 2011 for last restrictions
The economic migration of workers is a delicate subject, explaining why, after the last enlargement of the European Union in 2004, all but 3 of the 15 old Members maintained "transitional periods" for the access of labour to their markets. The maximum time period allowed for this is seven years - although a "2+3+2 years" formula allows worker mobility to be introduced in stages. The deadline to remove all restrictions is 2011.
France, Italy and Luxembourg have indicated they may lift certain restrictions for jobs where it is difficult to find recruits. This also applies to Belgium where in Brussels the local authorities have asked for privileged treatment for nurses, plumbers, electricians and car mechanics. The Parliament of the Netherlands is due to consider the issue before the end of the year.
Germany and Austria will maintain restrictions until 2009 although Germany has already issued 500,000 work permits to migrants from the new EU members.
From Warsaw to London, Dublin, Stockholm..
Since 1 May 2004 just over 500,000 people have travelled to the UK and Ireland in search of work, 60% of whom are from Poland - the largest of the new members.
The issue is given greater sensitivity as the "free movement of persons" is one of the fundamental freedoms guaranteed under European law. In fact it is enshrined in the 1957 Treaty of Rome. Article 39 lays down the right to look for a job in another member, right to work, right to reside and the right to equal access to employment and equal working conditions.
Those planning to work abroad will be hoping for this to be applied by all EU members as soon as possible.
