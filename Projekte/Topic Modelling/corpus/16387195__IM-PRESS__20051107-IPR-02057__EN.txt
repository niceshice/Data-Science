European Parliament President Josep Borrell has condemned the statement about Israel made by the President of Iran.
Following the claim by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that "Israel must be wiped off the map" , Mr Borrell said:
"We are all deeply shocked, sickened and revolted by this statement from the Iranian president. This morning the political group leaders of our institution expressed their total condemnation of his words. The European Parliament will hold a debate on the subject at its next plenary session.
In the name of us all, I wish to express deep indignation at a statement which rekindles the concern of the international community.
I wish to say to Israelis, Europeans and the entire international community that the European Parliament will always be at the forefront of the fight against discrimination, intolerance and those who seek to heighten international tensions."
