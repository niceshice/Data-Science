The EU Solidarity Fund must be made available as swiftly as possible to help the regions stricken by the torrential floods in Central Europe and France, say MEPs in a resolution adopted on Thursday.
Poland , the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Germany, Austria and France have been hit over the last two weeks by a series of devastating downpours, leading to the death of at least 10 people and serious economic damage.
MEPs call on the Commission to ensure that the necessary financial resources are disbursed as swiftly, effectively and flexibly as possible by the EU Solidarity Fund (EUSF).
They insist that new rules are urgently needed to speed up EUSF payments. Currently, Member States must first submit a request to the Commission and wait for budgetary approval before receiving the funds. Council, MEPs say, is to blame for hindering progress on the new rules.
The European Solidarity Fund intervenes in cases of major natural disasters in EU or EU-candidate countries. It was set up after severe floods hit central Europe in the summer of 2002 and operates with a budget of â‚¬1 billion per year.
Parliament's resolution, which was adopted by 530 votes to 7 with 5 abstentions, also insists Member States and the Commission should review planning, sustainable land use policies, and ecosystem absorption capacities in the light of the increased risks of flooding caused by the way land, habitats and drainage systems are managed.
