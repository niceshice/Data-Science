Smoke from forest fires in the Greek Peloponnese
With over 60 people dead and 130 towns and villages destroyed it was hardly surprising that forest fires in Greece featured highly in the first plenary debate since the summer. As the fires continue to rage in Greece the causes of the conflagration and what to do about them took centre stage. MEPs deplored the criminality of the arsonists, expressed sympathy with the victims and called for the EU solidarity fund to be used to compensate some of the estimated €5 billion losses.
The fires that have taken lives, consumed houses and damaged archaeological sites were described as a "disaster of a biblical scale" by Greek EPP-ED member Nikolaos Vakalis. His party colleague Rolf Berend supported use of the EU's solidarity fund to help the "return to normality" and a sign "the EU wants to help citizens in difficult situations".
Pöttering pays tribute to Gaston Thorn and Raymond Barre
Over the summer two prominent European statesmen passed away and Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering used his opening remarks to pay tribute to them. They were former MEP, Luxembourg PM and Commission President Gaston Thorn and Raymond Barre, a former French Prime Minister and Vice President of the European Commission.
He also made a statement marking the hundredth anniversary of the birth of Altiero Spinelli, who he called "one of the great architects of European Integration".
President Pöttering finished his remarks by leading a one minutes silence in the House for the victims of the forest fires in Greece, the earthquake in Peru, continuing violence in Iraq and the lives lost at sea as immigrants struggle for a new life in the EU.
Solidarity to fight fires
Whether the EU should have a "disaster agency" or rapid reaction force to deal with such events was dismissed by Socialist leader Martin Schulz. He told the House the best way to deal with disasters was in a decentralised way. Liberal ALDE speaker Vittorio Prodi of Italy stressed the need for prevention against hot summers and drought - namely action against climate change.
Vladimir Špidla - European Commissioner for Employment and International Assistance - told the House he would use a fast-track procedure to release assistance under Solidarity Fund, LIFE+ and the European Social Fund
Mr Špidla called the assistance to Greece ”striking example of solidarity” as not only had other EU states responded with offers of help but also Switzerland, Serbia, Russia and Israel had pledged assistance. He said the challenge now was to mobilise further resources to deal with the continuing requests for help. This followed MEPs observations that the EU had been unable to cope with Bulgaria's request for help. During the debate MEPs also urged the Council to reach a decision on the new EU Solidarity Fund regulation.
Finally, several Members drew attention to the wider picture - this year alone seeing severe forest fires in Spain, Bulgaria, Italy as well as in Greece and catastrophic floods in the UK - linking these events to changes in the climate caused by global warming.
Vote today on better regulation reports
On Monday evening MEPs also debated four reports related to making EU laws clearer and more straightforward. They will vote on these today (Tuesday).
This is far from a purely technocratic issue, according to rapporteur (Ms) Katalin Lévai (PSE, Hungary): it is "fundamental to ensure a fair and competitive market place, citizen's welfare and the effective protection of public health and the environment".
She also emphasised the inherent value of legislating at European level, pointing out that it "has reduced much red tape. One common rule to apply in all Member States is much simpler and more efficient than a complex web of varying rules at national and regional level. European legislation has been effective in removing harmful barriers to competition and conflicting national rules".
