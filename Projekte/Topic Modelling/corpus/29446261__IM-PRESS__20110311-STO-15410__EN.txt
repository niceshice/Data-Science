Stereum sanguinolentum is a plant pathogen which attacks conifer trees, in particular the Douglas-fir. Coniferous forests are expected to decrease in area and productivity throughout continental Europe - the spruce is expected to become unsuitable as a crop species in lower elevations. © Andreas Kunze In the boreal area birch forests are expected to shrink to 1/10 of their present area by 2100. ©Orcaborealis This map by the European Forest Institute shows the proportion of total forest in relation to land area. As one might expect certain regions are less green than others but even within certain countries and regions the differences can be remarkable © European Forest Institute Beech trees are expected to decrease dramatically and eventually disappear in the more arid parts of the Mediterranean region. They remain fairly common in Northern Europe. © Malene Thyssen Satellite view of the 2007 Greek forest fires. The inferno that broke out in August 2007 in numerous parts of Greece claimed several lives and seriously damaged the Greek ecosystem. © NASA Forests and wooded land cover 42% of the EU's surface Provide more than 2 million jobs Europe's forests face huge threats from global warming: fires, droughts and forest diseases. Some trees are expected to disappear from certain areas. How can we protect European forests and prepare them for climate change? Greek Socialist MEP Kriton Arsenis has written a report on a Commission Green Paper on the issue which will be voted by the Environment Committee on Wednesday, 16 March.
Forests and wooded land cover 42% of the EU's surface. They provide more than 2 million jobs, protect soil and human settlements and regulate freshwater supplies. Forests act as 'sinks' that absorb carbon dioxide and even regulate local and regional weather.
Threats for the forests from the climate change
The rapid climate change endangers the European forests, extreme events such as storms, forest fires and droughts are expected to become much more common. Some forests type will shrink dramatically, some tree types may disappear in some areas in Europe.
Did you know that Beech is expected to disappear in the Mediterranean zone and production of mushrooms and herbs will be drastically reduced throughout Europe?
See the slide show for more sad statistics.
What we can do?
Some suggestions from the Kriton Arsenis report include:
Active Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) should be made mandatory in the EU in the context of five-year National Forest Programmes
Possible introduction of payments for ecosystem services taking into account the role of forestation
A legislative proposal for Forest Fire Prevention and for Forest information
