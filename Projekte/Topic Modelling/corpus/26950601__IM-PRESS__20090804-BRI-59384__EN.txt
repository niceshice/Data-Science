Milk prices: public aid to be prolonged until February 2010
2009-09-10 - 17:33
MEPs will vote on a Commission plan to prolong public aid to buy up butter and milk powder until February 2010 rather than ending this support from 31 August. The Agriculture Committee wants the measures on butter private storage to be extended to also include cheese.
The fall in milk prices and the broader emergency in the dairy market, primarily consequences of the economic crisis, are a cause of concern across Europe. EU institutions are currently discussing the best way to help farmers through, without hampering the long-term restructuring of the European agriculture sector.
MEPs will also question the Commission on dairy market developments and vote on a political resolution to propose possible further interventions.
Rapporteur: Paolo de Castro (S-D, IT)

G20 summit in Pittsburgh: holding financial institutions to account
2009-09-10 - 17:33
Bankers' salaries and bonuses, the supervision of financial markets and restrictions on the size of banks are the practical issues likely to be discussed when the Commission and the EU Presidency make statements to MEPs next Wednesday in Strasbourg.
Ahead of the European Council's extraordinary session on 17 September to discuss the EU's position on the G20 summit, the Commission and the Swedish Presidency will present to Parliament their positions on the management of the global financial crisis.
At the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh on 24-25 September, the heads of 19 industrialised and emerging states, including China, India and Brazil, and the EU, will discuss the compensation packages and bonuses paid by financial institutions as well as the question of tighter supervision and regulation of financial markets. They will also look at the resources and governance of the IMF, job creation, energy efficiency, the Doha trade talks and aid to low-income countries.
Parliament advocated linking bankers' bonuses to their long-term performance and discouraging irresponsible behaviour in a resolution which was adopted by Parliament in April, following the G20 summit in London, and was discussed by G20 finance ministers last week in London.

Privacy: New EU-US data transfer agreement challenged
2009-09-10 - 17:33
MEPs are challenging the proposed agreement between the EU and the United States on the transfer of bank data via the SWIFT network. A bone of contention is the choice of legal base by the EU governments: MEPs are demanding to be involved in the drafting of the agreement. A resolution will be voted on Wednesday.
The question of SWIFT first arose in 2006 when the media revealed that the US administration was accessing data held by the Belgium-based financial network SWIFT on European citizens without their knowledge. Following pressure by the European Parliament, guarantees regarding privacy were given to ensure that the data collected was used purely for anti-terrorist purposes. In July this year, media articles appeared saying that a new agreement was to be negotiated following a change in the structure of the SWIFT company, which is building a new storage centre for its European data in Switzerland.

Possibly anti-gay Lithuanian law challenged
2009-09-10 - 17:33
A controversial Lithuanian law seen by some as discriminatory will come up for scrutiny in the Parliament on Wednesday. The Lithuanian parliament recently approved changes to children protection legislation. The law now bans "public information that agitates for homosexual relations" from any place where it can be accessed by children, as it may cause "a detrimental effect on the development of minors".
Members of several political groups have called in oral questions for sanctions if necessary to ensure the law meets European human rights obligations. MEPs will also adopt a resolution on this.

Visa policy
MEPs warn that plans to lift Schengen visas could threaten regional stability
2009-09-10 - 17:33
Parliament will debate the European Commission's decision to lift visa requirements for Serbia, Montenegro and FYROM citizens but to retain them for Bosnia-Herzegovina and Albania, criticising it as a risk to the region's stability. The Foreign Affairs Committee has said that the decision means that Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats, who have dual nationality, will be able to travel freely to the EU, whereas other Bosnians cannot.
Citizens of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia would be able to travel freely around the Schengen zone from 1 January 2010, provided they have biometric passports, the European Commission proposed in July.
The European Commission could review the situation of Bosnia and Albania in mid-2010, depending on progress made by these countries on border controls, combating organised crime and introducing biometric passports.

Regional policy: A new plan to revive Baltic area
2009-09-10 - 17:33
An wide-ranging strategy to boost the Baltic Sea region will be outlined Wednesday when Council and Commission report back their proposals to Parliament.
The ambitious plan aims to: - clean up the maritime environment - foster prosperity, - improve accessibility, and - enhance security.
If agreed, the strategy could be the first of several Europe-wide macro-regional plans.
The strategy, announced in June 2009, should halt the deterioration of the Baltic, improve transport links, remove barriers to trade and address energy supply concerns. Key to the strategy is the coordination of measures taken by Member States, regions, the EU, pan-Baltic organisations, financing institutions and non-governmental bodies to promote more balanced development of the region.
A total of €50bn euros is being made available for the Baltic from EU cohesion and other funds, for the period 2007-13.

Energy security: debate on Nabucco pipeline
2009-09-10 - 17:33
Moves to push forward the EU-backed Nabucco gas pipeline over its Russian South Stream rival will be tackled when Commission and Council answer MEP questions Thursday. Turkey's role will also be addressed.

They also wish to know how the Commission and Council plan to address this issue with Turkey, which plays a crucial and strategic role as regards the development of the South Corridor.
