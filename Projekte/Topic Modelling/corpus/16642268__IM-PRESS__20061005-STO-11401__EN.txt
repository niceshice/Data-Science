Greener, cleaner towns and cities is the aim
The protection of Europe's rural landscape has long been a priority of the EU - but policy makers are increasingly turning their attention to the urban environment where most of us live. New plans to improve traffic management and reduce pollution are at the forefront of their ideas. In particular encouraging people to walk and cycle around towns and cities and use environmentally friendly forms of transport are at the forefront of thinking.
At present 4 out of 5 people in the EU live in urban areas - and keeping these areas clean, habitable and "green" is a daunting task. In particular the impact of traffic on urban areas is substantial - both in terms of congestion and pollution. The growing level of household waste is another issue.
Last week MEPs passed a resolution in favour of a "thematic strategy on the urban environment" targeted at towns and cities above 100,0000 people. That means it will apply to some 500 town across the European Union. The resolution was based on a report by Hungarian Socialist Gyula Hegyi.
The resolution calls for the creation of "urban management plans" and a sustainable "urban transport" plan. These should take into account waste management, air pollution and noise levels. They should also be used to collect data on the local environment - such factors as population growth, greenhouse gas emissions, health problems and drinking water levels. This data could be used to determine what future course of action to take to improve urban areas.
