Brok, Barón Crespo and Duff: 3 MEPs on the IGC
As EU leaders gather in Lisbon to wrap up negotiations on a new "reform treaty" for the Union, we have a look at the key issues and key players. After agreement in June, an intergovernmental conference attended by MEPs from the 3 largest groups has been drafting the treaty. In a recent debate one of them - Elmar Brok (EPP-ED) - said the treaty would give Parliament "equal rights over justice and home affairs, agriculture and the budget". A new treaty will also fix the number of MEPs at 750.
Reform Treaty
Lisbon marks the end of the intergovernmental negotiations on a "reform treaty". Should agreement be reached this week, then EU leaders will sign the new treaty in December and ratification will then begin in all countries in the Union. The reform treaty replaced the draft European Constitution after it was rejected by referenda in France and the Netherlands two years ago.
During the negotiations the MEPs defended the idea of European citizenship and pushed for the inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the treaty. Some countries would prefer it remain just an annex or protocol.
Directly elected Parliament gets greater role
As mentioned earlier by Mr Brok the reform treaty stands to give greater powers over justice and home affairs, agriculture and the budget to the European Parliament. This would make the only directed elected EU body equal in legislative weight in these areas with the Council of Ministers (where government representatives meet). The extension of EP powers will be done principally by extending the co-decision legislative procedure.
The number of MEPs is also a crucial issue. To adapt to more counties being EU members its sets the maximum number of Members at 750 for the next Parliamentary term of 2009-2014. The previous limit set by the Nice Treaty was 736. At present - due to the accession of Bulgarian and Romania in January this year - the number of MEPs stands at 785. On October 11 the whole house adopted a report with proposals on the necessary new distribution of seats between EU members.
Who is making the decisions at Lisbon?
The European Parliament will be represented by its President Hans-Gert Pöttering. He will be joined by the three MEPs who helped draft the treaty; German MEP Elmar Brok (EPP-ED), Spaniard Enrique Barón Crespo (Socialist PSE) and British Liberal Andrew Duff.
They will join the Heads of State and government of the Union's 27 countries in Lisbon as well as European Commission President José Manuel Barroso. Also there will be Javier Solana - the EU High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy. Under the proposed treaty the role of the "high representative" responsible for EU foreign policy will be considerably empowered.
Why Lisbon and not Brussels?
Portuguese capital Lisbon will host the informal summit on 18-19 October as Portugal currently holds the EU's 6-month rotating Presidency.
The summit is classed as an "informal" one and therefore is usually held in the country holding the Presidency. "Formal" European Councils always take place in the Belgian capital Brussels.
On 10 October the Plenary of the Parliament debated the issues involved. MEPs broadly supported the draft treaty and called for the European agenda to return to more citizen-based issues.
