Poverty and social exclusion among women infringe on their human rights, this is one of the conclusions in a report adopted by the European Parliament. The report by Anna Záborská (EPP-ED, SK) draws attention to the wage and employment gender gap. It also highlights the number of single-parent households (85%) which are headed by women and that two thirds of the over 65s in the EU are female. Both groups are disproportionately prone to poverty.
The European Parliament adopted the report the which looks at four main areas:
- the development of gender-based indicators and methodology, so as to measure the differing impact of poverty and social exclusion on women and men;
- the importance of involving poor women and families at all levels of decision-making;
- measures to improve the balance of family life and work in a disadvantaged environment;
- the contribution of civil society.
MEPs emphasise that " poverty has various manifestations " and that " new forms of poverty and marginalisation exist " . Poverty is not only about lack of income, it can also be related to ill-health, limited or non-existent access to education, unsafe environments and social discrimination and exclusion. A job is not in itself enough protection against extreme poverty.
MEPs call on Member States to take targeted action to ensure that disadvantaged women have access to "fair access to public health systems - in particular to primary health care (including the protection of mothers and children) as defined by the World Health Organisation - and also to gynaecologic and obstetric health care , decent housing, justice, education, training, life-long learning, sport and culture. They also draw attention to serious consequences of poverty, stressing that extreme poverty situations are " conducive to trafficking in women, to prostitution and to violence ".
The EP argues that " extreme poverty is more prevalent among women ", saying that in seventeen of the Member States the risk of extreme poverty amongst women greatly exceeds the risk of extreme poverty amongst men. The majority of single-parent families, who run a greater risk of falling into poverty, are headed by a woman. A study of six EU Member States showed that female-headed households earn between 9% and 26% less than their male counterparts, the biggest disparity being in the UK (26%), followed by Sweden (14%), France (12%), the Netherlands (11%), Germany (10%) and Italy (9%). Moreover, the wage gap between men and women in Europe is still on average between 16% and 33%. More working women (30%) than men (6.6%) have a part-time job - a choice often forced upon women by a lack of affordable childcare facilities. In view of all this, MEPs call on the Member States to take practical steps to address pay differentials and promote working conditions that will enable both women and men to participate fully in the labour market.
On Tuesday, four European Parliament committees organised a hearing to raise awareness on the effectiveness of microcredit for fighting poverty and empowering women. Access to information technologies and micro financing for poor women is also highlighted in the report adopted .
