On 1 July Finland will take over the rotating six-month Presidency of the EU from Austria. This will be Finland's second turn at the helm in its 11-year EU membership. We asked Finnish MEPs about the aims and objectives of Finland's Presidency, as well as their expectations for the coming months.
Finnish MEPs drew some comparisons between the 1999 and 2006 Presidencies. According to Alexander Stubb (Conservative, EPP Group), Finland is taking over in a situation totally different from that of 1999, and the change is not necessarily for the better. "In 1999 the climate of the EU debate was good. Now anti-EU feeling is rearing its head in most Member States, including Finland."
Henrik Lax (Liberal, ALDE) agreed "It's not easy to find things in common for Narva, London and the Canary Islands. That is why this Presidency will be more difficult than the previous one. The Finnish Presidency comes at a time when a new grip is needed in Europe." But Socialist Riitta Myller thinks the Finnish Presidency will deliver. "Finns are expected and trusted to bring issues forward. The general assumption is that we don't talk much, but do what we promise to do."
Not everyone is quite so positive . Esko Sepp√§nen (European United Left, GUE) thinks that the government will continue its federalist line in the face of public opinion. "Only 22% of citizens support the government's decision to ratify the rejected EU Constitution in the Finnish Parliament."
Climate change, Energy cooperation on agenda
The European Parliament will have a bigger role this time around. "In 1999 the Amsterdam Treaty had just entered into force. It was up to Finland to pioneer the extension of the co-decision procedure, including the enhanced role of the EP," Stubb said. "Now the Parliament is much stronger, which is reflected in the preparations by Finland."
Turning to what concrete action is expected, Satu Hassi (Greens/EFA) hopes Finland will continue to increase openness and make public everything it can. "Finland should take action both on protecting the Baltic Sea from agriculture emissions and on climate protection, as the Kyoto agreement comes to an end in 2012."
Ms Myller added, "Energy will surely be on the agenda. We should strengthen the long-term perspective together with enhancing energy efficiency and research and the use of renewables." However, she expects the focus to be on energy co-operation with Russia . "REACH (the EU-wide Chemicals directive) will certainly be the most important single piece of legislation," she said.
As well as the future of Europe, Finland has said its priorities include "competitiveness, external relations, strengthening the area of freedom, security and justice and transparency and efficiency in decision-making." Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen will present the Presidency programme to the European Parliament on 5 July during the Strasbourg Plenary. Watch him speak live here from 9 AM CET on " EP Live!"
