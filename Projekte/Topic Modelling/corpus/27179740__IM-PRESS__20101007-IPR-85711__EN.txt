Extending social security to non-EU nationals
Employment policy
Plenary sittings
2010-10-07 - 16:28
Non-EU nationals and their families who are legally resident in one EU Member State but staying or working in another will be entitled to social security benefits in the same way as EU nationals under new EU rules approved in plenary session on Thursday.
EU citizens who are legally resident in one Member State, but staying or working in another, are already entitled to social security benefits under two EU regulations on the co-ordination of social security systems.
The new rules approved today extend these entitlements to third country nationals and members of their families who are legally resident in the territory of an EU Member State. Parliament hasn't amended this regulation and wants that it takes effect quickly.
Derogation for Denmark and the United Kingdom
Denmark and the United Kingdom have opted out of the new coordination arrangements for third country nationals.
