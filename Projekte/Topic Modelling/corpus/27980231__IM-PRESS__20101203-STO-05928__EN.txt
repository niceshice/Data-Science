©European Union 5th European Development Days on December 6-7 Role of children crucial for tackling poverty The 5th European Development Days on December 6-7 brought together more than 6,000 representatives from all over the world, sharing ideas on how to tackle poverty and meet development goals. A panel organised by European Parliament looked at Children Rights in Development Policy for the next generation.
Speaking in the Opening Ceremony EP President Jerzy Buzek said development is an obligation by "the people of Europe, to the people of the least developed regions of our world, to the future generations." José Manuel Barroso, the head of the EU's executive, the European Commission, stressed the importance of looking into innovative ways of financing. He said that "European Union development policy needs to modernise aid."
Making children's voice heard
After the entry into force of Lisbon Treaty, the protection of the rights of the child has become a specific objective of the EU external policy.
Hilde Johnson , a senior official from UNICEF said that "the EU has a powerful voice on the world stage. You can make children a priority in important agendas such as the Millennium Development Goals, security and climate change".
Green MEP Eva Joly who chairs Parliament's Development Committee said that "children and adolescents comprise one third of the world population and constitute more than half of the population in a significant number of developing countries. Unfortunately, their voice remains generally unheard in discussions and decision-making processes that affect their lives".
The "wall of Poverty between North and South can tumble"
Irish MEP Gay Mitchell (EPP) said that in many developing countries it is children who suffer the most and are "left at the bottom of the ladder". He went on to say that "it is therefore the case that they know what is needed to make their life that little bit easier. We need to listen to them." He concluded by saying that "just like the Berlin Wall, the wall of Poverty between North and South can tumble if we really believe that it is possible."
Belgian MEP Véronique De Keyser (S&D) said the fight for children's rights is universal and EU also faces problems of children exploitation. She said that EU development aid turns around a number of key issues - notably sufficient financing, efficiency, empowerment through strengthening family and community structures and assuring implementation on the ground.
Patrick Watt of the Save the Children from the United Kingdom told those present that "children are a key to breaking intergenerational poverty" and he urged EU as a largest donor to take child–centred development approach in 2011
