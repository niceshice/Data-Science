MEPs debated the stability of the Euro with the head of Europe's Central Bank
The last day of Plenary saw the announcement that the leader of Belarus's opposition, Alexander Milinkevich, is to be awarded Parliament's Sakharov prize for freedom of thought. MEPs also discussed the EU budget for 2007 - they want more money for the European Social Fund and migration. The stability of the Euro and more €500 notes were debated with the head of the European Central Bank. Members also approved a report which highlights a lack of social protection for workers posted abroad.
Alexander Milinkevich was awarded the Sakharov prize by the leaders of Parliament's Political groups - the Conference of Presidents. The presentation will be on 13 December in Plenary.
Parliament backs "coherent and prudent" budget for 2007
Parliament approved amendments to the EU’s draft budget for 2007 which is still in its "first reading stage". It wants to reverse budget cuts the Council of Ministers are proposing on agriculture and administration, while increasing allocations for the European Social Fund and management of migration. Parliament supported cutting allocations for foreign and security policy by 50% and reallocating them to other aspects of the EU's activities outside its borders.
MEPs are concerned about cuts to the budget that the Council of Ministers had called for in July. They therefore raised several budget lines by a total of €8 billion, bringing the draft budget to €122 billion. This is about 1.04% of the combined Gross National Income of the 27 (as they will be when Romania and Bulgaria join next year) EU members.
James Elles, the British conservative who acted as Parliament's rapporteur for the 2007 Budget said that in terms of value for money this was a "coherent and prudent” budget.
Next month, delegations from the Parliament and the Council meet to try and find agreement ahead of the second reading in the Council and the Parliament. Parliament’s second reading is scheduled for 14 December.
MEPs praise central bank but concerns remain
MEPs approved a report that praised the performance of the European Central Bank (ECB) in achieving its main objectives of maintaining purchasing power (price stability) and interest rate policy in the 12 member Euro zone. However, members recommended caution when raising interest rates as it could endanger economic performance. The report was in response to the 2005 annual report into the bank.
The report followed a debate between MEPs and the chairman of the ECB Jean-Claude Trichet. MEPs wanted to know why there had been a 21% increase in the number of €500 banknotes in circulation. (The bank issues the notes and the 500 has been a favourite of drug smugglers and money launderers). Members also want minutes of the banks governing council published and stressed that nationality should not be a factor in appointing people to the board. They also called for full coordination between the ECB, Europe's central banks and finance ministers in exchange rate policy.
Posting of workers directive
Workers posted to other countries are not being afforded the legal protection they deserve. That was the conclusion of a report approved Thursday. The 1996 "Posting of Workers" directive covers social protection and workers rights when they work abroad. The report says that some EU members are either not enforcing the directive or that it is being interpreted very differently. It calls on the European Commission to look into the matter. The report was drawn up by German Green member Elisabeth Schroedter.
Other issues discussed and voted on Thursday include:
Resolution on Hungarian uprising
Toxic Waste Shipments to Africa
preparation of Climate Change Conference
Human Rights: Tibet, Guatemala, Uzbekistan,
South Ossetia, Transnistria
EU-Syria Agreement
The next plenary session will take place 13 to 16 November.
