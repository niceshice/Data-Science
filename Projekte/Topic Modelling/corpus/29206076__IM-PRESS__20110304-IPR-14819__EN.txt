Austria's nomination of Dr Harald Wögerbauer's to join the European Court of Auditors was approved by the Budgetary Control Committee on Thursday 3 March. Dr Wögerbauer would replace Mr Hubert Weber, who resigned from the Court after serving on it for 15 years. Parliament will put the nomination to a plenary vote on Tuesday 8 March.
In preparation for the committee hearing, Mr Wögerbauer replied to a written questionnaire, which is included in the draft report on his nomination. He gave the committee a five-minute presentation, after which he replied to MEPs' questions.
Given that Dr Wögerbauer is an active member of the Austrian People's Party, many questions concerned his independence. He assured MEPs that he would resign from politics if his nomination to the Court is approved.
Committee vote: 13 were in favour, 4 against and 6 abstentions.
