Hans-Gert Poettering and Angela Merkel in Strasbourg
Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel used her address to MEPs at the start of her countries Presidency of the EU to restate her commitment to European values like "tolerance" and "diversity". She also said that installing a roadmap for the Constitution to "move forward towards completion" was a priority. Wednesday also saw MEPs debate arms exports, road safety and the case of the Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor given death sentences in Libya for allegedly infecting children with HIV.
"Europe is a continent of tolerance"
Chancellor Merkel began her remarks by reminding MEPs that he had spent the first 35 years of her life outside the EU in East Germany. However, she said she preferred seeing this "unparallel historic success" from the inside. On her priorities for the 6 months ahead she also stressed action to boost jobs and growth in the EU as part of the "Lisbon Strategy". She also stated that foreign policy challenges like Kosovo, the Middle East and the Iranian Nuclear programme would be priorities.
MEPs reactions
MEPs welcomed the pro-European nature of her remarks. For the main parties: the European People's Party stressed the need for the EU to work more effectively - a clear endorsement the need for Treaty reform. The Socialist PSE group reiterated that real freedom could only come with freedom from social threats.
For the Liberal ALDE the issue was one of open markets that could ensure a proper supply of EU energy. The Union of Europe for the nations (UEN) said they were "alarmed" at bilateral energy deal between EU countries and Russia whilst the Greens urged that any progress on the Constitution should not be "secret huddles in smoke filled rooms".
