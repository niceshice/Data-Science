President Hans-Gert Pöttering got a warm reception from the House after his farewell speech In his farewell speech, President Pöttering urged people to vote in the June elections. Parliament backed new legislation aimed at avoiding future financial crises, but rejected new rules regulating telecommunications and internet use. It also sent proposals for minimum maternity leave back to committee.
n the last plenary of this term Hans-Gert Pöttering speaking after two and a half years as Parliament's President, highlighted the 2004 enlargement, legislation, internal reform, support for the Middle East peace process and cultural exchange. On the coming elections, he said, the campaign is the chance to "speak with citizens about why the EU is necessary. I should like to call upon all citizens to vote in the elections."
New rules to avoid future financial crisis
The European Parliament adopted a report by Austrian Christian Democrat Othmar Karas amending the "Capital Requirements" directives to improve risk management and avoid a repetition of the current banking crisis, where bank failures have put pressure on other banks and left the whole financial system at risk.
The legislation aims to enhance both the efficiency and effectiveness of bank supervision and crisis management by facilitating cooperation among national authorities dealing with cross-border financial institutions.
No agreement on telecoms regulation
MEPs don't want users’ internet access to be restricted without a prior ruling by the courts, so they overturned an informal agreement reached with ministers, meaning the telecom package will be delayed. The a reform of the regulatory framework for electronic communications, including mobile and fixed telephones, broadcasting, wireless and fixed internet is likely to be subject of fresh negotiations between MEPs and EU Ministers in the next Parliament's legislative term after the European elections.
