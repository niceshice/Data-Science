The report calls for more use of online "e-commerce", especially for those who struggle to get to shops. ©BELGA/Imagebroker/Michael Weber Supply chain: questions over fairness of contracts High energy usage & a lack of appreciation of impact The importance of shops with essential services, different labour laws and a lack of rules governing commercial trading is the state of Europe's retailing today according to a report. Shops came under the spotlight Wednesday (29 September) as a European Commission report was discussed by MEPs on the Internal Market Committee.
The Swedish MEP charged with drawing up Parliament's response is Anna Maria Corrazza Bildt of the centre right European People's Party. She has identified the domination by big retail chains of smaller ones as a key problem.
The report also deals with the issue of accessibility of shops - especially now that many also contain banks and post offices and pharmacies. It says that older people, the disabled and those who live in remote areas in particular could be vulnerable to a lack of access. Moreover, the report makes the case that shopping online ("e-commerce") should be encouraged to help people access shops if they cannot do so physically.
Supply chain: questions over fairness of contracts
Speaking at the Committee's discussion of the report, Catherine Stihler, a British Labour MEP who sits with the Socialist group in Parliament noted that labour law differs widely between countries in Europe which leads to different working conditions. However, she noted that the supermarkets had the ability to create jobs for low skilled workers.
The Commission's report - which MEPs will formally react to in the next few weeks, also identifies a lack of rules on unfair practices and contracts between various parties in the supply chain. That finding will be welcomed by many farmers who have protested at the power of large supermarkets to determine prices and effectively force down the amount paid at the farm gate to the farmer.
High energy usage & a lack of appreciation of impact
The environmental sustainable of the sector was also examined. The report found that the retail sector was high in energy consumption and that there was insufficient consideration given to the environmental impact of products. In addition there is no clear way of identifying the lifecycle of products between different counties.
German Green MEP Heide Rühle told fellow MEP at their discussions that "we need to focus on sustainability and transparency of food chain particularly when it moves across borders".
Anna Maria Corrazza Bildt also stressed the need to reduce barriers to trade by one country to another in the European Union: "I always strive for full harmonisation" she said.
