New Community measures to reduce traffic congestion, improve the environmental performance of the transport system and boost intermodal transport were backed by Parliament's Transport Committee on Tuesday when it voted at first reading to approve the Marco Polo II programme.
The programme seeks to promote "motorways of the sea" - whose purpose is to shift traffic from land to short sea shipping routes - as well as measures to cut traffic volumes, including rationalisation of traffic, logistics and supply chains. It will run from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013 and receive €740 million in funding from the EU budget, although this depends on the adoption of the financial perspective. The committee gave the programme the green light when it adopted a draft report by Reinhard RACK (EPP-ED, AT) by 40 votes to 2 with 1 abstention.
MEPs adopted amendments aimed at lowering the financial thresholds for companies to be eligible for support under Marco Polo, so as to make it more accessible to small and medium-sized companies. They also voted for more consideration to be given to environmental aspects and for priority to be given to sensitive regions, including urban areas. Other amendments seek to support projects in the outermost regions of the EU.
This programme follows on from Marco Polo I, which was designed to shift an anticipated increase in international road freight transport to the three alternative modes: short sea shipping, rail and inland waterways. To achieve this objective in an enlarged EU, a new programme was needed.
