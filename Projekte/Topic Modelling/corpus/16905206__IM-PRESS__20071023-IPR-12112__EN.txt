Job qualifications earned in any EU Member State should be comparable throughout the EU by 2012, but Member States should be given a year longer than planned to implement the proposed European Qualification Framework (EQF) and it should be accompanied by a system of vocational training credits, says the European Parliament. The EQF aims to ease cross-border mobility for workers and learners, and help meet labour market needs, by using a common language to describe qualifications.
Under the EQF proposal, all qualifications, from school-leavers' diplomas through vocational training certificates to the highest academic degrees are to be assigned to one of eight reference levels, based on knowledge, skills and competence acquired.
A year more to build mutual trust
The House says that Member States should be given until 2010 - a year longer than the Commission proposed - to relate their national qualifications systems to the EQF and to build the "mutual trust" needed to implement the proposal (which, as a European Parliament and Council recommendation, would not be binding upon Member States).
EU-compatible by 2010
By 2012, all new qualification certificates, diplomas and "Europass" attestation documents issued by the competent authorities "should contain a clear reference to an EQF's reference level, says the report, by Mario MANTOVANI (EPP-ED, IT).
