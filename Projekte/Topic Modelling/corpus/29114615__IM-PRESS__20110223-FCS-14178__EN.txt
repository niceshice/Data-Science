Women's rights/Equal opportunities
2011-03-01 - 09:01
EP will hold a series of events between the 3-8 March 100 years of International Women's Day The European Parliament celebrated International Women's Day 2011 with a series of events held between the 3-8 March in Brussels and in Strasbourg. While celebrating the economic, political and social achievements of women so far, the events also drew attention to the inequalities still to be redressed, including female poverty, differences in pay and access to jobs as well as maternity issues.
To mark the occasion we spoke to six leading Members of Parliament's all party Women's Rights and Gender Equality Committee;
Portuguese MEP Edite Estrela (S&D) was rapporteur on extending paid maternity leave for men and women.
Greek MEP Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou (EPP): Parliament's Vice President and member of the Women's Rights Committee who is preparing a report on "Women and Business Leadership".
Barbara Matera (Italian, EPP): Vice-Chair of the Women's Rights Committee who is preparing a report on the situation of single mothers in the European Union.
Bulgarian Mariya Nedelcheva (EPP) : Member of the Women's Rights Committee responsible for this year's report on equality between women and men in the EU 2010.
Rovana Plumb (S&D) is a Romanian MEP preparing a report on "the face of female poverty in the European Union".
Swedish MEP Eva-Britt Svensson (GUE/NGL): The Chair of the Women's Rights and Gender Equality Committee. She is behind a non-legislative report with suggestions on how to protect women against crime directed against them simply because they are women.
As well as women on the Women's Rights Committee there are some male Members who offer their views. We spoke to French MEP Philippe Juvin , Spanish Member Raül Romeva i Rueda (Greens/EFA) and Belgian Socialist Marc Tarabella . Speaking to us he said that "the fight for equality between women and men, rightfully claimed by many women, is also a men's business".
We also spoke to former Irish President Mary Robinson.
3 March: Women in politics in the European Union
On 3 March, the Women's Rights and Gender Equality Committee held an interparliamentary meeting on "Women in politics in the European Union", which will focus on how to enhance women's participation in politics.
Jerzy Buzek, President of the European Parliament opened the event, which included the participation of Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland and President of the Mary Robinson Foundation on Climate Justice. Nicole Fontaine, former President of the European Parliament, MEPs and members of national parliaments also participated.
One of the issues that was under discussion will be on elected assemblies around the world can bear more relation to the composition of society.
8 March: Parliamentary Session
On 8 March the European Parliament debated the reports by Mariya Nedelcheva MEP (Equality between women and men — 2010) and Rovana Plumb MEP ("Face of female poverty in the European Union") as well as formally marking International Women's Day. Prior to the debate Ms Nedelcheva told us: "Despite all the efforts outlined, the numbers speak for themselves: women - often with diplomas - fail in practice to overcome the glass ceiling that prevents them from attaining positions of responsibility ".

Women's rights one hundred years on: the fight continues
Some of the sights as the European Parliament celebrated a centenary of International Women's Day Parliament marked the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day (Tuesday 8 March) with a debate and vote on two resolutions tabled by the Women's Rights Committee: one on gender equality and the other on female poverty. A third resolution, on reducing health inequalities, was also adopted.
In a special ceremony held on Tuesday to commemorate 100 years of campaigning for women’s rights, EP President Buzek said "There are too few women in the EP: 35% is not enough, even though this is slightly more than in national parliaments. It is up to national parliaments to ensure higher representation in the EP. Member States should therefore adopt relevant decisions and a legal framework to boost the presence of women in the EP".
European Commission President José Manuel Barroso, the Hungarian Presidency's secretary of state for European affairs Enikő Győri, EP Women's Rights Committee chair Eva-Britt Svensson (GUE/NGL, SV) and speakers for Parliament's political groups also took the floor.
Tackling inequality
The need to narrow the gender pay gap, to get more women in decision-making positions and to raise the female employment rate are among key points in the resolution accompanying the 2010 annual report on equality between women and men in the EU, drafted by Mariya Nedelcheva (EPP, BG) and adopted by 366 in favour, 200 against and 32 abstentions. The importance of better child care facilities and child-related leave is also highlighted.
If women’s employment, part-time employment and productivity rates were similar to men’s, GDP would increase by 30%, says the resolution.
Only 3% of major companies are chaired by a woman. Member States should therefore take effective measures, such as quotas, to ensure greater representation for women in major listed companies and on the management boards of companies in general, say MEPs, citing Norway as a positive example, followed by Spain and France.
Parliament also calls for binding targets to ensure equal representation of women and men in politics, saying further efforts must be made at EU, national, regional and municipal levels.
Enforce equal pay
The pay gap between men and women still averages 18% in the EU and even exceeds 30% in one Member State, noted MEPs, urging EU Member States to implement equal pay for equal work laws properly and calling on the European Commission to impose sanctions on those that fail to do so.
Eliminating poverty
Nearly 85 million people in the EU were living below the poverty line in 2008, and 17% of all women in the EU were living in poverty, notes the second resolution - on the face of female poverty - drafted by Rovana Plumb (S&D, RO).
Macroeconomic, social and labour-market policies should be reformed, to guarantee a minimum income as well as economic and social justice for women. All EU common policies should have a gender perspective, stresses the resolution, adopted by a show of hands.
Economic crisis could widen health inequalities
In a third resolution adopted today, Parliament underlines that everybody should have access to healthcare systems and affordable healthcare. The specific needs of vulnerable groups such as women, older patients, undocumented migrants, ethnic minorities, need to be taken better into account.
Life expectancy has been shown to vary across EU Member States by 14.2 years for men and 8.3 years for women (Eurostat figures for 2007 and 2010 respectively), says the resolution, which was drafted by Edite Estrela (S&D, PT) and adopted by 379 votes to 228 with 49 abstentions. Also within countries, groups of different education levels and social situations have widely differing health prospects.

Edite Estrela: "The fact that the law defends women does not mean that they're defended by society"
Portuguese MEP Edite Estrela (S&D) "It's a message of hope but also of great responsibility" "The financial and economic crises that we are living through are used as an alibi" "If there is political will, it's possible to reach a balanced result that takes into account not only the economic situation of the EU but also the expectations of citizens and the rights of children". Those words the Portuguese MEP Edite Estrela (S&D) has seen her report (on extending paid maternity leave) approved by the EP in one of the most high profile issues of last year. The proposal for a directive is now before the EU governments.
What is your message for International Women's Day?
It's a message of hope but also of great responsibility. The fact that the law defends women does not mean that they're defended by society, because society always comes after law. It's important to have progressive legislation so that it can have an impact on society. We don't change mentalities by decree, but legislation helps a lot in the formation of opinion and we should be aware that we cannot take anything for granted.
The path we have taken over the last decades has allowed us to make extensive steps forward. I believe that we will reach a society where both sexes have equality at least in Europe, where there will not be a pay gap of 18% which is absolutely unacceptable.
The proposed directive is now before EU governments in the Council of Minsters. Which obstacles stand in the way of it being approved by European governments?
The financial and economic crises that we are living through are used as an alibi when there is no political will. We see that there has been support for banks and companies, but when it comes to helping families, especially in fundamental areas like help for people having children, we understand that the crisis is used as an alibi.
I see some incoherence if not hypocrisy here. Many of us complain, and there are studies and reports expressing this worry about the ageing of the population and the low birth-rate which jeopardises the sustainability of social security systems and has very negative consequences for economic development. My report is an incentive to promote higher birth-rates and more natal care. If there is political will, it's possible to reach a balanced result that takes into account not only the economic situation of the EU but also the expectations of citizens and the rights of children.
Which practical solutions do you suggest?
Traditionally, society gives women the responsibility for looking after the family, looking after children both in their education and health, taking care of other dependents, the elderly and the bedridden. These responsibilities must be shared. Women do have the same rights as men, to a professional career with no "guilt complex". It is not acceptable that we inculcate in women the feeling of guilty for being professionally successful and it is not acceptable that women are obliged to choose between being a mother or a director. Why does society have the perception that women are "inconvenient workers" as they have been called, that they are second choice or it is a risk to hire them? It is exactly because family responsibilities are not shared with men.
What interferes with their career is that women have to stay home when their children are sick and women have to leave their jobs when the children get sick and go home whilst men do not do this. It's a vicious circle because as the pay gap is 18%, it's more expensive to have the man at home than the woman.
This has an extremely perverse effect because when retirement age comes, female poverty is even greater than during their working life and they get much lower pensions than men because they stayed home taking care of their children or worked part time in order to reconcile work-life balance. In order to reach a fairer and more equal society, one of the priories is to adopt measures to reconcile professional and family lives - both for men and women.

Women and business leadership
Rodi Kratsa-Tsagararopoulou Rodi Kratsa-Tsagararopoulou preparing a report on "Women and Business Leadership" "We must remember that this year marks the 100th edition of the International Women's Day: 100 years of fighting" Rodi Kratsa-Tsagararopoulou, Parliament's Vice President and member of the Women's Rights Committee is preparing a report on "Women and Business Leadership" planned to be voted this coming June by MEPs in their Parliamentary session. How can women reconcile a professional career with a family life and what measures should be taken to help them are some of the main problems raised by the Greek centre right MEP (EPP).
With regard to the celebrations of International Women's Day she said: "We must remember that this year marks the 100th edition of the International Women's Day: 100 years of fighting, 100 years of dreams and claims and successes. We must welcome the results and work toward achieving our goals of equal opportunity and parity. "
Which are the main obstacles preventing women from business leadership?
A career within an enterprise requires serious requirements . However , women traditionally have known obstacles such as a lack of time or lack of motivation to invest in corporate life and adapt to the competitive climate that prevails , particularly given the difficulty reconciling family and professional life . However , we find little by little the arrival of ambitious and determined women in governing bodies of companies .
What is the object for your report "Women and Business Leadership"?
Our goal is to promote qualified and competent women who want to reach the top of the hierarchy of medium and large businesses, make them accessible to positions where women are now a minority.
The balanced participation of men and women in the boards of companies is not only a question of ethics or social justice is also a matter of corporate economic performance and in achieving better business results and economics. There has been awareness and action has been taken, such as the exchange of best practices between firms or the creation of professional networks of women framework. But these initiatives have proved inconclusive and have not really given women new opportunities or ease of access to leadership positions. I think now it is imperative to consider more ambitious and effective ways in order to achieve tangible results.
Indeed, in parallel with these initiatives, a trigger is now necessary to reverse the situation. That is the purpose of my report, which proposes that the European Commission carries out an inventory of the situation of women occupying positions of executive bodies of companies in different member states, encourage initiatives and then where appropriate take adequate measures which are measurable and binding.
What do you think about quotas?
A solution could indeed be that the legislatures establish quotas if companies fail to take initiatives and implement their roadmap . But we must first take into consideration the diversity of Europe to expect to reach the threshold of 40 % by 2015 for example , because all countries are not moving at the same rate in this area. Some are very far this threshold , while others have practically achieved it through proactive measures taken by the companies themselves or by Member States . In addition , do not forget that in some professional sectors , women are traditionally under-represented : in the absence of women , it is difficult to impose 40% , it is necessary that this objective is accompanied throughout career , a proactive policy . To this , the role of the media and educational systems may influence the evolution of minds .
What are your practical suggestions for young women who want to make a career?
Women who have the ambition to reach the summit should make sacrifices , to believe in their potential and assert their ambitions . It is imperative to consider measures that allow women to reconcile work full time and family life , but women are expected to make concessions such as moving regularly , have no fixed schedules , coping to contingencies and so on.
However, we are not alone . Men, like women, who opted for such a career should do so knowingly.
The situation of single mothers in the EU
Italian MEP Barbara Matera (EPP) 1 in 3 children in the EU are born out of wedlock 9 out of 10 of single parents are women Italian MEP Barbara Matera (EPP), Vice-Chair of the Women's Rights Committee, is preparing a report on the situation of single mothers in the European Union, a reality that touches more and more parents who, for different reasons, have sole responsibility for at least one child. In a recent public hearing organised by the Women's Rights Committee, experts said that about 1 in 3 children in the EU are born out of wedlock and 9 out of 10 of single parents are women. "Women can be peace bringers", Ms Matera says, "and we need to value women much more, specially taking into account the context of the situation we're living".
What's the situation of single mothers in the EU?
The number of single mothers is dramatically growing in the EU, and it has to take this into account. The main risk, in many Members States, is the poverty they can run into. It's not the same to be a single mother in the Nordic countries, where you are protected and helped, or in countries like Germany or the UK, where you are exposed to social exclusion - eventually with heavy consequences on the children too. We have to consider that single mothers suffer a double discrimination: being women, and being mothers.
Which practical solutions do you suggest?
The EU and the Member States can do a lot: facilitating access to work, adapting their welfare system to this new configuration of families. In my report I will particularly insist on what we can do on the children, for them not to be excluded by the society.
The interview was conducted in the European Parliament in Strasbourg on 16 February 2011.

Equality between women and men in the European Union — 2010
Bulgarian Mariya Nedelcheva (EPP) Bulgarian Mariya Nedelcheva (EPP), member of the Women's Rights Committee is responsible for this year's report on equality between women and men in the EU 2010 "The situation of women has changed a lot" Bulgarian Mariya Nedelcheva (EPP), member of the Women's Rights Committee is responsible for this year's report on equality between women and men in the EU 2010. "The situation of women has changed a lot", she says, but "there is still much to be done". Pay gaps, access to jobs, protection of maternity, and discrimination at work are some of the tough realities women still face in the 21st century. In her report, scheduled to be voted in March plenary, the Bulgarian MEP stresses that "education plays a key role in inculcating in children the notion of gender equality as early as possible", and calls on governments to see the current crisis "as a chance for governments to ask the right questions and look at their policies in a new light".
Women's Day has been celebrated for 100 years, what is the situation concerning equality between women and men in the EU today?
For 100 years, much has changed. We started from very low to achieve relative equality, but much remains to be done. The European Union has done much in this area through the establishment of a significant body of legislation, ranging from equal access to employment between men and women, the fight against discrimination at work through the protection of motherhood.
But unfortunately - and the economic crisis we are facing today does not help - women still do not have the same opportunities in the labour market than men. The unemployment rate for women is higher than men, although they are more likely to have a university degree. Similarly, if we look at the figures of the European Commission, women earn on average 17.8% less than men for each hour worked. By calculation, we arrive at a figure quite absurd: a woman in Europe should work 418 days a year to earn the salary of a man. This inequality is also very visible in positions of responsibility: only 3% of large companies in Europe are headed by a woman. We're still counting!
What are the main achievements ?
It seems to me that beyond the very specific measures that were implemented, one of the major successes of recent years is to have brought the goal of gender equality on a cross in all policies. I think that is what has moved us forward. Whatever the area in which we operate, we have a red light comes on and reminds us to order as soon as we deviate from this goal of equality. Obviously, this framework is not sufficient, but it is necessary to take concrete and targeted measures.
Why are the challenges we still face ?
At the moment , women are more vulnerable than men in the labour market . This leads to situations of greater poverty among women than among men. The economic crisis has made things worse . Initially , the first affected areas ( automotive, construction ) were made up mostly of men , but the crisis spread sustainable services sector consists mainly of women. Therefore , we find ourselves facing a situation which has deteriorated and is unfortunately here to stay if we do nothing .
How can we overcome these challenges ?
The crisis, despite its negative effects, gives us the opportunity to review our copy, reflecting on why and how our failure, and in doing so by offering innovative measures. It is high time to think about retraining in new growth sectors, such as areas of environment, new technologies, or the social economy organizations, such as mutual societies, foundations and cooperatives.
On the other hand, women and young girls are not sufficiently geared towards the sciences, so the issue of orientation is crucial. Member States must at all costs reflect a new way of steering children toward the sciences, for science faculties are more representative of our societies.
But despite all the efforts undertaken, the numbers speak for themselves: women, often with diplomas fail in practice to overcome the glass ceiling that prevents them from attaining positions of responsibility. Enterprises should be guided by good students who reach this goal of gender equality, both in terms of pay but also representation in positions of responsibility for achieving true equality.
What do you think / hope the situation will be in 30 years?
I hope that the measures taken today will have a snowball effect over the long term, we can say that Europe , with its strong values was a pioneer in the field . And besides , I hope we can be taken as an example by our partners in thirty years , perhaps , will face the same challenges . For equality between women and men do not stop at Europe 's borders , it goes far beyond .
What would be your main message for International Women's Day ?
In thirty years we will remember 2011 as the year of revolutions. What is happening now in Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen, Bahrain, and recently in Libya, gives me hope that women will seize the opportunity of renewal for emancipated socially, economically and politically.

The face of female poverty in the EU: "Let's make things happen"
Women's Rights Committee Member Rovana Plumb Rovana Plumb preparing a report on "the face of female poverty in the European Union" Ms Plumb underlines that "almost 17% of European women are ranked as living in poverty". "We have to find appropriate solutions and measures to prove that men and women in equality can contribute to a stronger social Europe to the benefit of all" says Women's Rights Committee Member Rovana Plumb. In her report on "the face of female poverty in the European Union" Romanian Socialist MEP Ms Plumb underlines that "almost 17% of European women are ranked as living in poverty".
A genuine social dialogue, support services like child and elderly care facilities, specific programmes aimed at promoting active inclusion or reintegration of women on the labour market are some of the measures suggested by Romanian Socialist MEP Ms Plumb. She also supports specific training programmes.
Why are women poorer than men and why is there a pay gap?
The economic and financial crisis affected the most vulnerable groups, especially women and children, their families, the elderly the ethnic minorities . The measures taken by national governments focused mostly on those industrial sectors where the rate of male employment is higher for men than for women (e.g. cars, construction, heavy industry). Women are more engaged in sectors like education and health sector, which were also affected by the economic and financial crisis.
What practical solutions do you suggest?
Firstly, I would like to say that we all want economic recovery projects (by the EU and member states) to take into account the gender dimension. We on the Women's Rights Committee are calling on countries to promote specific programs for active inclusion and reintegration of women in the labour market and for specific opportunities for life-long training, providing the skills and qualifications such as empowerment, confidence and building capacity needed for the EU 2020 strategy (growth and jobs). This can be achieved by using the European Social Fund and the lifelong learning program.
What about the role of children?
We have to promote policies that promote reconciliation between private and professional life. That means that we have to focus on child care assistance. We also have to make sure that the work of women at home - taking care of people (the elderly, dependants and children) is recognised by society. Turning to maternity leave (Rovana Plumb she is the shadow rapporteur for the Employment Committee), why should the mother be punished? During maternity leave the salary and indemnity are only a percentage of the real salary, meaning maternity is penalised.

Priorities and outline of a new EU policy framework to fight violence against women
Eva-Britt Svensson (GUE/NGL, Sweden) Despite the fact that violence against women has been a topic of debate over several decades, the international community has not managed to put an end to this extremely destructive form of criminality. The Chair of the Women's Rights and Gender Equality Committee, Ms Eva-Britt Svensson (GUE/NGL, Sweden) is behind a non-legislative report with suggestions on how to protect women against crime directed against them simply because they are women and to guarantee women a decent life.
What's the situation regarding violence against women in the EU: are there any signs of improvement?
There is a much greater knowledge and information about violence as the questions have been raised in EU and also in Member States. It has helped to visualise that this is a crime and that means that more people report crimes. Therefore statistics cannot yet show that there has been an effect. We cannot accept that women's lives and life choices are limited because of this violence. I think about young girls who might want to go to the movies but are not doing so because they are afraid of walking home alone. Also think about working life, if you cannot concentrate because you are living with a fear of going home. The more you think about it the more you realise how affected we all are, and we should not have to be.
Which practical solutions do you suggest?
In my report I demand "a criminal-law instrument in the form of a directive against gender-based violence" - it is very important. I also want to highlight the support and help that victims need to get, for example women shelters and also the training of police, prosecutors and people working in the social services. I also want to emphasize that children living in these conditions also must be made visible and get support so that this violence will not be inherited. This violence should be subject to public prosecution in all EU Member countries, it is an important signal to give that domestic violence is a crime and it must be subject to public prosecution (it avoids the pressure on women to withdraw her complaint).
Message for International Women's Day: An equal society is a better society!
International Women's Day celebrates 100 years. We have celebrated the day for 100 days and we cannot wait any longer: Equality now! "An equal society is a better society for men, women and children" - gender issues should not be made into something that applies only for women, we all have to help to create a better society for everyone involved.

Men supporting women
Women's Day 2011- Mr Juvin, Mr Romeva, Mr Tarabella Male MEPs show their support for women Stress that equality is a male and female issue As well as women on the Women's Rights Committee (FEMM) there are some male Members. We spoke to French MEP Philippe Juvin, Spanish Member Raül Romeva i Rueda (Greens/EFA) as well as Belgian Socialist Marc Tarabella.
Philippe Juvin
Why did you choose to be a member of the Women's Rights Committee?
It is now time to recognize and fully respect the fundamental role women play in all spheres of life: politics, family, professional, social, cultural and scientific research. So I wanted to get involved as MEP to give women the place they deserve. As Leo Tolstoy said, "Women, you hold in your hands the salvation of the world." But my investment in the Women's Rights Committee is also and above all to fight for gender equality, for the benefit of men and woman. And it is certain that women are victims of multiple discrimination, it is clear that men also suffer inequalities, notably in health. In 2005 men had a life expectancy of 78 years against 83 years for women.
How far are we from complete equality and what needs to be done so it can be achieved?
Since the first part of the twentieth century, women have conquered in most European democracies, many social rights but also rights to vote and be elected. A huge step was taken in terms of parity, especially in politics. For example, for the 2009-2014 term of Parliament, the proportion of women as MEP is 34.9%.
However, the road ahead for full gender equality in all public policy is still long. While in Sweden, 27% of women sit on boards of large firms, France reached the modest score of 10% in 2009.
Finally, it seems important to remember that gender equality in favour of women is possible if and only if measures are realistic and achievable put in place. And unfortunately this is not always the case. For example, the report Estrela on maternity leave 20 October 2010 adopted by the European Parliament, calls for measures unrealistic in the current economic climate.
The establishment of a maternity leave of 20 weeks full pay is an absolutely irresponsible. Many people consider this decision as a breakthrough for women. But this is not the case since such a requirement could achieve nothing concrete. The additional financial burden will not be borne by companies, at least not yet Member States. And if implemented, this measure could it not be an impediment to the recruitment of women in business? If it is urgent to enable women to reconcile work and family life through innovative measures, these should be realistic, achievable and balanced. Otherwise this quest for gender equality will be futile.

Raül Romeva i Rueda
Why did you choose to be a member of the committee?
I understand equality as a social and collective responsibility and not as something that only women have to take care of. FEMM is not a Women's Committee, but a Committee for Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, and this is something everyone needs to be involved in.
How far are we from complete equality and what needs to be done so that it can be achieved?
Full equality will only come when men assume totally their part of responsibility in the private and domestic sphere as well as when women assume their role in the public domain. This is the only way we can seriously talk about eliminating the pay gap, socializing the care tasks, promoting women in decision making bodies.
Marc Tarabella
Why did you choose to be a member of the Women's Rights committee?
I chose to be a member of the FEMM committee because the fight for equality between women and men, rightfully claimed by many women, is also a men's business. As a socialist, I fight for equality in society in general, and I think that the best way to improve the society is to reach true gender equality. Equality between women and men is the business of all of us.
How far are we from complete equality and what needs to be done so that it can be achieved?
The European Union has regulated a lot in the past years to improve the situation of women in the workplace. It has also funded many projects regarding violence against women. However, I think that we still need to fully implement this legislation. The principle "Equal pay for equal work" exists since 1957 in the Rome Treaty and is still not fully respected! I think we need to fight against stereotypes and to change the mentalities, for the sake of both women and men.

Mary Robinson: "Encourage European countries to get excited about the transformative impact that women can have"
Mary Robinson at the European Parliament on Thursday 3 March 2011 The Women's Right's Committee kicked off this year's celebrations of the International Women's Day on 3 March with an interparlamentary meeting on how to enhance the role of women in politics. After the meeting we spoke to former Irish president Mary Robinson, who together with former EP President Nicole Fontaine was one of the key speakers.
You are the example of a woman who has been leading for more than 20 years. Did you have to face any particular obstacles because of being a woman?
MR: There were barriers, but when I was elected the first woman President of Ireland, I was determined that it was an advantage to be a woman. I would show that a woman President could do it differently, could in many other ways connect to the Irish people and connect to people abroad, have a friendship with people in Northern Ireland, be more sensitive to those who are marginalised in society. So I'm not saying that there were not barriers. For example, there are home responsibilities: I have three children and four grandchildren. The family is always important and, unless there's more sharing of home responsibilities, women won't be able to fully surmount those barriers.
However, I was sure that, as a woman, I had qualities of leadership to offer that were important to society and sure too that other women also have these qualities. On the whole I think we're more problem solving, less hierarchical, more sensitive to those who are in need of support and often more practical. It's not that women are better than men, but we do have great strengths and I was very conscious of those when I was elected.
Were there any significant achievements since you were elected Irish President in 1990 regarding equality and access of women to politics?
MR: I think that in Ireland itself, the fact that there was a woman President elected was very symbolic. It encouraged a lot of other women and we had more women standing for parliament, although, I am sorry to say, we still have a relatively small percentage after the recent elections.
What I am now linked to as an "Elder", brought together by Nelson Mandela, is women internationally, women in the informal sector who organise themselves, for example, in self-employed women's associations in India.
In politics, Rwanda has the largest percentage of women in Parliament in the world, because they put women in the centre of their post-genocide development. There is great work going on also in Liberia. This morning (in the conference on women in politics) I was trying to encourage European countries to get excited about the transformative impact that women can have. We tend to have a mindset of incremental change: put a woman here and another few there. But that won't do - we need transformative change.
Do you, in principle, support the imposition of quotas?
MR: I think that quotas can serve a very good purpose in a short term. What I was recommending this morning is that for the European Parliament, national parliaments and in local level elections we look at a ten year period in which we try to be really transformative and get to parity or near parity. We won't do that unless we have quotas. A number of countries do have them and they're working. In other countries, like my own, there is a strong resistance, but I think we need to be logical and look at the evidence. It is transforming India, it is transforming lots of countries around the world and, in the countries that have quotas, you have a higher percentage of women.
Why is that important? For one reason in particular, you need a critical mass of women in parliaments to affect the agenda, to affect the priorities, to have a different kind of leadership. I witnessed that myself in the Irish Senate. We were only six when I was first elected and then we were up to 13 out of 60, we had a critical mass. We need every parliament to have more than 25% and yet 17 out of the 27 parliaments in Europe have less than 23%. We do need quotas, in the short term at least.
