Equality rapporteur Liz Lynne (ALDE) "Need to get message to citizens"
MEPs discussed the EU's progress in ensuring equal opportunities and non-discrimination on Tuesday morning. "Legislation is effective only when citizens are aware of their rights and have easy access to the courts," rapporteur, British Liberal Liz Lynne told us in an interview ahead of the debate. A vote following the debate led to the report being adopted by MEPs.
Which are the main concerns expressed in your report?
The employment directive is very patchy in its implementation in a lot of EU states, as is the race directive. I am calling for the setting up of independent, equality bodies to make sure that the employment directive is properly implemented. But more importantly, I am calling for a comprehensive anti-discrimination directive to halt discrimination in access to goods and services in areas that aren't covered: disability, age, religion or belief and sexual orientation. We already have the race directive, the gender directive and the employment directive, but these are areas that have been left behind.
I've been campaigning for years on disabled people's rights and on age, but I am now totally convinced that we need a comprehensive directive so that no-one is left out. Every person should be treated as an equal EU citizen. So I hope the Commission will honour its 2008 work programme commitment and bring forward the legislation.
What should be done to better inform citizens?
We need to make sure trade unions, employers and all the different organisations alert people to their rights under the employment directive. This must be transposed and implemented properly by all EU members. There are still problems, but I believe we need to get the message out to the citizens.
Too often, individuals are left to bring cases themselves; countries ought to be helping them to bring these cases. Independent equality bodies set up by states should be helping them to do that and to make sure that people know their rights.
