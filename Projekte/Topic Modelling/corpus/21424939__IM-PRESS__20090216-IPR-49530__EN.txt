Food aid programme for Europe's poorest people set to expand

The EU food distribution programme for the most deprived people in Europe must continue within the CAP, be fully funded by the EU and consist purely of food products of Community origin, says the Agriculture Committee.
Since the programme came into being in 1987, millions of needy Europeans have received food from intervention stocks of the common agricultural policy (CAP), distributed via charities and social services. In the mid-1990s, the rules were changed to allow food to be bought on the open market to supplement this source, in certain circumstances.
Keep the programme within the CAP
The consultation report drafted by Czesław Adam Siekierski (EPP-ED, PL) and adopted on Tuesday by the Agriculture Committee approves the European Commission's proposal to allow more buying of food on the market for this purpose, given the declining food stocks following successive reforms of the CAP and the increased need for food aid in the wake of successive EU enlargements and the economic crisis.
The committee rejected by a comfortable majority a number of amendments seeking a change in the legal basis of the proposal. German Social Democrat Heinz Kindermann had argued that the programme had lost its "agricultural dimension" because of the increase in buying on the market, and that it should henceforth be part of social policy.
Full Community funding
MEPs also approved an expansion in the range of products to be made available, to promote a more balanced diet, as well as longer-term distribution plans from 2010 so that the funding can be used more efficiently.
However, because of the economic difficulties faced by many Member States, MEPs oppose the idea that national governments should help pay for the scheme, calling instead for full Community funding to be preserved. The Commission had proposed that the Community budget should contribute 75% for 2010/2012 (85% in Member States that receive Cohesion Fund money) and that these rates be subsequently reduced to 50% and 75% respectively from 2013/2015.
Only European products to be used
Among other amendments adopted, the committee wants the programme to distribute only products of Community origin, preferably fresh and local ones.
Background
In the 27-member EU, 80 million people (16% of the population) live below the poverty threshold, according to Eurostat, a figure expected to rise considerably because of the economic crisis.
In April 2006 the European Parliament asked the Commission and the Member States to continue this programme, which it said had become vital for millions of Europeans. And in May 2008, in a resolution on food price rises, MEPs described the right to food as a basic right.
At an initial round table meeting with Council of Agriculture Ministers in November 2008, seven Member States forming a blocking minority (Germany, UK, Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Czech Republic and Latvia) opposed the Commission proposal, arguing that the distribution of food should be funded via national social programmes rather than the CAP budget (and therefore calling for a change in the legal basis).
According to the Commission, over 13 million people benefit from the programme, whose budget has been raised from slightly under €100 million in 1987 to €305 million in 2008 and €500 million in 2009. Participation in the programme is voluntary (in 2008, 19 Member States took part, the non-participants being Germany, UK, Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Austria, Cyprus and Slovakia).
