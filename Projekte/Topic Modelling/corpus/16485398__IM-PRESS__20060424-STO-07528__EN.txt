Parliament keen to make local government cross-district co-operation easier

Construction of swimming pools is just one area likely to be affected.
Local authorities, at district and regional level, are increasingly working on joint infrastructure projects. While EU public procurement laws must ensure that public spending is transparent and effective, they should not however prevent such co-operation from taking place. Two new directives are just starting to come into force. What will be their effect? This was the issue that was examined at a public hearing held by Parliament’s Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee
A swimming pool worthy of the name, high quality sports facilities and a modern cinema. Some people believe that indicators like these only apply to community life in the big cities. But are they wrong to think so? Such impressions cannot be easily changed overnight, but more and more councils serving smaller populations are succeeding in getting these sorts of facilities. How do they do it? The answer is that they form cross-district consortia by setting up public interest organisations, where finance and expertise is pooled for carrying out a joint project. There is a long list of cross-community initiatives such as: waste incinerators, waste water purification plants and the redevelopment of land that was formerly used for military or industrial use. A further example is provided by the five local authorities who came together from both sides of the Rhine in a project which involved both French and German pre-school nurseries.
What these projects all have in common is their use of public funds. As long as co-operation does not go beyond services being provided mutually, then only so-called “in-house” procedures are applicable. However, it is often necessary to bring in a public or private company as another partner. In that case, local authorities are bound by the procedures governing the awarding of public sector contracts. The aim of these procedures is to ensure openness and accountability of public spending and fair competition in the market. But local authorities regard these procedures as overly burdensome. There is of course a special responsibility when it comes to managing public money and that market rules should not be flouted. But, at the same time, local representatives’ margin for manoeuvre should not be unduly constrained by excessive bureaucratic procedures. So, without losing sight of the main issue of ensuring good quality and cost-effective public services for local residents, how should the right balance be struck? This was the issue that dominated the public hearing held on April the 20 th by Parliament’s Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee.
The hearing was concerned with the effectiveness and working of the directives on public sector awards and contracts. Indeed, two years ago Parliament and the Council passed two directives dealing with this area, which were aimed at modernising EU law by making it simpler and more flexible. The directives were due to have been incorporated into Member States’ national laws by the 31 st of January 2006. Three months after the deadline, less than half had managed to accomplish this.
At the same time, in the opinion of a number of experts, the judgements of the European Court of Justice were taking too orthodox a view of the law by not taking account of the special circumstances of local authority cross-district co-operation. They also said that the abundance of case law also showed that the required legal clarity was not being provided for by the law. However, we will have to wait and see how the directives are working in practice before coming to any conclusion. After that, it may be necessary for Parliament, the Commission and the Council to reach agreement on how to interpret the regulations in force so that the hoped-for benefits can be realised. In the meantime, the Commission has announced the publication of its interpretative communication and that action is being taken against those countries which are delaying the implementation of the directives.
