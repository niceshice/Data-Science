Schengen: MEPs to debate plans to allow border checks
2011-05-05 - 16:04
Plans to create a mechanism allowing Member States to reintroduce border controls in the Schengen area temporarily will be the subject of a debate with Commission President Barroso and the Council on Tuesday. MEPs will respond to the plans put forward by the Commission on 4 May and outline their own priorities on migration and asylum. The Commission is proposing that a Member State should be allowed to impose border checks if another Member State fails in its duty to patrol its part of an EU external border or if there is strong and unexpected migration pressure.
The impact of migration flows on the Schengen border-free area is a matter of great concern to MEPs. The Commission's announcement, after the Italy-France summit, therefore prompted suspicion among Civil Liberties Committee MEPs, who said that Schengen must not be weakened and that all internal border checks must be strictly justified.
Decisions on border controls: European approach needed
Members of the committee also stressed that decisions on introducing border controls should be taken at EU rather than national level, as happens today. The Commission also favours this position.
The Commission proposals presented on 4 May cover various aspects of migration such as tighter border controls and Schengen governance, better targeted legal migration, more exchange of best practice on the integration of legal immigrants, completion of the Common European Asylum System and a strategic approach for relations with third countries on migration.
Procedure: Council and Commission statements
Debate: Tuesday 10 May MEPs suspicious about Schengen rules review (press release 02.05.2011) Don't use immigrants as a pretext to undermine Schengen (press release 04.05.2011) Commission communication on migration (04.05.2011)

EU diplomatic service and global role under the spotlight in debate with Ashton
2011-05-05 - 16:04
Six months after the EU External Action Service was launched, MEPs will hold their first general debate on foreign, security and defence issues with EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton.
The EU's role in the Arab spring, in particular in Syria, the reconciliation of Palestinian rivals Hamas and Fatah and the situation in Camp Ashraf (Iraq) are set to be discussed during the debate, which starts at 9am on Wednesday.
Parliament is using one of the two annual debates on EU foreign policy that it must hold under the Lisbon Treaty to review the overall performance of the External Action Service (EEAS) in its first few months of operation since it was launched on 1 December 2010.
A fresh approach to external relations needed
A new road map is needed for the EU's foreign, security and defence policies, argues the Foreign Affairs Committee, which has prepared three non-legislative resolutions to be put to the vote on Wednesday.
A call for an arms embargo by EU Member States on Syria, Yemen and Bahrain is among demands made in the first two resolutions, drafted by Gabriele Albertini (EPP, IT) and Roberto Gualtieri (S&D, IT). MEPs also call for the release of political prisoners in Belarus and an investigation into organ trafficking allegations in Kosovo.
The EU must learn lessons from the past and place human rights at the top of its agenda, notably in international agreements such as those being negotiated with Russia and India, adds the committee.
Seeking to strengthen the EU's presence in key multilateral organisations, the third resolution, drafted by María Muñiz de Urquiza (S&D, ES), calls for a permanent EU seat on the United Nations Security Council. The UN General Assembly voted on 3 May to grant the EU enhanced status, entitling EU officials to address the Assembly but without voting rights.
Key debate: 09.00-12.20, Wednesday 11 May

Budget discharge 2009: Police College, Medicine Agency and Council risk postponement
2011-05-05 - 16:04
Parliament is likely to approve the lion's share of the EU's budget spending for the financial year 2009 when it votes on 39 reports on Tuesday under the "budget discharge procedure". Only the discharges for three agencies are likely to be held back. Approval for the budgets of the Council of Ministers, the European Medicine Agency and the European Police College are set to be postponed. In all other cases, MEPs are expected to follow the Budgetary Control Committee recommendations to grant discharge.
The European Parliament is the EU budget discharge authority. This means that once the annual accounts are audited, Parliament decides - on a recommendation by the Council of Ministers - whether or not to give final approval to the Commission and other EU bodies for their spending of EU funds in 2009. The discharge for budget implementation is the decision by which the European Parliament "releases" the Commission from its responsibility for managing a given budget, thereby marking the end of that budget's operation.
European Police College
Parliament will be voting in Strasbourg on the basis of recommendations made by its Budgetary Control Committee. The committee was unanimous in recommending postponement of the budget discharge for the Director of the European Police College (CEPOL), located in Bramshill (United Kingdom), due to its "persistent lack of compliance with the Financial Regulation". CEPOL was the only agency for which a discharge was refused in 2008.
European Medicines Agency
The committee also believes Parliament should postpone the discharge for the London-based European Medicines Agency (EMEA). It says there is no proper guarantee of the independence of experts hired to carry out scientific evaluations of human medicines. Some MEPs believe that some experts had conflicting interests in the case of the evaluation of the anorectic Benfluorex. The committee also criticises the EMEA's management of procurement procedures and its lack of criteria for recruiting staff.
Council
The committee unanimously suggested postponing the discharge for the Council of Ministers until the autumn as the Council was not co-operating sufficiently in providing information to Parliament.
Parliament's own budget
On Parliament's own budget, MEP Ville Itälä (EPP, FI), who prepared the committee's draft report, said that due to "the current economic situation, the European Parliament should set an example in cost-cutting." Amongst savings measures, the committee voted to have interpretation services for committee meetings provided automatically in only six languages (French, German, English, Polish, Spanish and Italian), with further languages to be made available only at the request of MEPs.
Other demands include rules to limit long-distance journeys with Parliament's official cars and to prevent MEPs from employing members of each other's families as parliamentary assistants. The Budgetary Control Committee also calls on EP President Buzek and MEPs negotiating the 2012 budget to raise with the European Council the issue of Parliament having various workplaces, the cost of which is estimated at around €160 million per year, or about 9% of the EP's total budget.

Lobbyists and interest groups: Parliament set to back common register plan
2011-05-05 - 16:04
Parliament and Commission registers for lobbyists and other interest groups will be merged if a deal negotiated by the two institutions is approved by MEPs on Wednesday. MEPs want the Council of Ministers to join it, too. A proposal that MEPs amending draft laws should list their contacts with lobbyists will also be put to the vote. The proposed "transparency" register would combine the existing Parliament and Commission ones, as agreed by the two institutions in November 2010. The name change, from "lobby" to "transparency", will make it easier for other bodies and individuals influencing EU policy-making, such as think-tanks or churches and religious communities, to sign up.
Many MEPs say listing all lobbyists in the common register should be mandatory, although the current proposal would only make it voluntary. But getting accreditation to Parliament itself is impossible without registering first.
The draft resolution welcomes the fact that the Council of Ministers has indicated it will join the register, event though it did not take part in the negotiations.
MEPs will also vote on a proposal that all lobbyists whom MEPs meet whilst working on amendments to draft legislation should be listed in a "legislative footprint" annex to their reports. Finally, the resolution also proposes that MEPs should update their financial interest declarations as soon as any changes occur.

Radio spectrum: extra frequencies for new mobile internet services
2011-05-05 - 16:04
Full broadband coverage all over the EU by 2013 and universal high-speed internet access by 2020 are the main goals of the Radio Spectrum Policy Programme being proposed by the Commission and broadly supported by Parliament's Industry Committee. New rules for carving up the "digital dividend" - the radio frequencies freed up after the switch from analog to digital TV - and using it for mobile internet services will pave the way for 100% internet coverage of EU territory, including remote and rural areas.
Demand for mobile data traffic is doubling every year, and services such as video calling, mobile TV, distant health diagnosis, smart energy grids and shipment tracking are changing the lives of billions of people. For these services to run smoothly, wireless broadband internet is essential. However, it needs extra radio frequencies, so Europe has to free up more of the available radio spectrum.
A competitive digital single market with nearly 500 million people connected to high-speed broadband would also improve productivity, competitiveness and boost the EU telecoms industry, claims Gunnar Hökmark (EPP, SE), who is steering the draft legislation through Parliament for the Industry Committee.
Under the Commission's plans, EU countries would have to make the 800 MHz waveband available for harmonised use of wireless broadband services by 1 January 2013. This would set the ground for 100% internet coverage of EU territory, including remote and rural areas, thus bridging the digital divide among inhabitants of different regions.
MEPs would allow Member States to ask for a postponement to apply the law until the end of 2015, or even longer if they have problems in cross-border frequency coordination with neighbouring third countries. They also want the spectrum allocated for mobile data traffic to reach at least 1200 MHz by 2015.
While backing the Commission's plans, the Industry Committee is tabling amendments to the draft decision calling on regulators to encourage effective and efficient use of frequencies, while preventing market distortions. For example, Member States could limit the scope of the spectrum per operator or reserve part of it for future new providers.

Textile labels to mention fur and leather
2011-05-05 - 16:04
Consumers will no longer run the risk of inadvertently buying textile products containing real fur or leather, under new rules on textile labelling set to be approved by MEPs on Wednesday. Fur is often used as trimming in relatively inexpensive garments and it is often difficult for consumers to distinguish between real fur and good quality fake fur.
The original purpose of the new legislation was to simplify existing labelling rules and allow for faster introduction of new fibres and innovative products on the market.
Parliament's negotiators, led by rapporteur Toine Manders (ALDE, NL), have won important concessions from the Member States in this second reading agreement. Allergy sufferers, for whom fur is a potential health hazard, will be among the beneficiaries.
Any use of animal-derived materials will have to be clearly stated on the labels of textile products. Textiles containing such products must be labelled "non-textile parts of animal origin", to enable consumers to identify them.
In addition, thanks to Parliament, two studies will be conducted on possible links between allergic reactions and chemical substances used in textiles (e.g. colourings, biocides or nanoparticles) as well as the feasibility of an origin labelling scheme to ensure the full traceability of textile products. The European Commission will also look into ways that new technologies, such as micro-chips or radio-frequency identification, could be used instead of traditional labels in future.

Bailout for Portugal and the need for further financial regulation
2011-05-05 - 16:04
The EU's response to the ongoing debt crisis will be discussed by MEPs with the Council and Commission on Wednesday. The conditions of the Portuguese bailout are likely to dominate the debate but MEPs are also expected to bring up the need for further banking regulation, particularly in the area of crisis management and resolution. A separate debate on banking stress tests, based on questions to the Commission, will be held on Tuesday night.

Investing in education and mobility
2011-05-05 - 16:04
MEPs want more funding for education and mobility schemes, from a compulsory nursery school year through to EU-wide recognition of qualifications. This should be seen as investing in Europe's future, not just an extra burden on budgets, even in hard times, say two non-legislative resolutions to be debated and put to the vote on Thursday. One resolution, drafted by Milan Zver (EPP, SI) advocates easier university timetables easier for working students, popularising on-line education and bringing curricula closer to labour market needs. Universities and vocational schools are asked to introduce paid traineeships for students, but these "must not take the place of real jobs". MEPs call for legally-binding rules "to prevent trainees from being exploited".
The ability to access education and travel abroad must not depend on a person's social background or wealth, stress MEPs, who advocate teaching at least two non-native languages from an early age. Extra support should go to disabled young people, young parents and those seeking to return to education, they add.
The other resolution, drafted by Mary Honeyball (S&D, UK), says early education "should ideally be universal to all parents and children regardless of their background or financial status" and be "fully participative, involving all staff, parents and, where possible, children themselves".
Member States are asked to introduce a compulsory nursery school year before the start of schooling and to provide more integrated advisory services for parents. MEPs also call for measures to ensure the quality of early childcare staff, including recognising their professional qualifications and guaranteeing them adequate pay.

Culture to spur EU diplomacy and single market
2011-05-05 - 16:04
The EU should make more use of culture to foster democracy, development, education, human rights and freedom of expression abroad, whilst stepping up copyright protection and funding for cultural creative industry at home, say two resolutions to be put to the vote on Thursday. Some MEPs will also back Sarajevo's bid to become European capital of culture in 2014. Setting up a cultural diplomacy directorate within the EU External Action Service, appointing an EU ambassador-at-large and cultural attachés to each EU overseas representation, and introducing EU cultural visas for artists and other professionals are among the ideas set out in a resolution drafted by Marietje Schaake (ALDE, NL). The text also backs calls for a free and open global internet, and condemns its censorship and monitoring by repressive regimes.
To expand the EU single market for on-line cultural content whilst protecting copyrights and authors' earnings, MEPs call for an EU copyright system, easier access for artists to credit and other funds, and public-private partnership incentives such as tax relief, in a resolution drafted by Marie-Thérèse Sanchez-Schmid (EPP, FR). They also call for a specific budget line to support the digitisation of European cinema.
MEPs will also suggest that the Commission and Parliament consider allowing a likely bid by Sarajevo to be named European Capital of Culture in 2014, on an exceptional basis.

EU measures for freezing and disclosure of debtors' assets
2011-05-05 - 16:04
New laws on the freezing and disclosure of debtors' assets are needed to improve debt recovery throughout the EU and thus encourage trade between Member States, says a draft resolution by the Legal Affairs Committee. MEPs want the Commission to draft two new EU regulations: one for a European Order for the Preservation of Assets and the other for a European Order on the Disclosure of Assets. They also suggest in some detail what shape the legislation should take. The requests are set out in a draft resolution by Arlene McCarthy (S&D, UK) that will be put to Parliament for a vote on Tuesday.
The European Commission has already informed Parliament that it plans to submit a draft law on the freezing of debtors' assets by July 2011. Draft legislation on the transparency of debtors' assets is planned for 2013.

25 years after Chernobyl, a focus on nuclear safety today
2011-05-05 - 16:04
Recent weeks have seen the 25th anniversary of the tragic nuclear accident at Chernobyl and constant efforts to stabilise the earthquake-stricken nuclear plant at Fukushima. On Tuesday, MEPs will remember the victims and discuss forthcoming action to improve nuclear safety. The EU has just committed further funds to seal the site at Chernobyl. Attention now turns to conducting safety "stress tests" of all nuclear plants in the EU, and potentially those in neighbouring areas. Procedure: Oral question with debate (no resolution)

Blocking the EU's toxic waste exports
2011-05-05 - 16:04
MEPs from across the political spectrum want to know what action will be taken to enforce and improve the rules on exporting toxic waste to developing countries. Large volumes of the EU's hazardous waste are being illegally exported to countries with laxer safety and processing standards. The Commission's own estimate is that one in five waste shipments contravenes a 2006 EU regulation Procedure: Oral questions to Commission

Worldwide measures to tackle illegal fishing
2011-05-05 - 16:04
On Tuesday Parliament will vote on EU ratification of an international agreement to combat illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing. If Parliament backs the recommendation of its Fisheries Committee, the EU will become the third entity to ratify the agreement out of the 25 needed for it to enter into force. The agreement is sponsored by the Food and Agriculture Organisation.
The new rules will apply to all port states - or entities such as the EU - which ratify the agreement. It will apply to all their ports and will cover vessels that do not fly the flag of the state whose port they seek to enter and use.
Measures will include denial of entry or use of ports for, inspections on board of, and exchange of information on those vessels that are believed to have engaged in illegal, unregulated or unreported fishing.

Squaring EU investment policy with Member States' bilateral investment treaties
2011-05-05 - 16:04
The European Commission's power to review, as well as withdraw authorisation from, Member States' bilateral investment treaties is the subject of a controversial report to be put to a vote on Tuesday. These treaties were a matter for Member States until the Lisbon Treaty made investment policy an exclusive EU competence. The two key points of contention are the Commission's review process and its power to withdraw authorization from existing bilateral investment treaties (BITs). The draft report opts not to make reviews of all BITs mandatory, and would require them only when treaties "constitute a serious obstacle to the conclusion of future Union agreements with third countries." The draft also narrows the range of cases in which the Commission may withdraw authorization of BITs.
However, the International Trade Committee vote on the report was very close (15 in favour, 13 against, no abstentions), with a narrow majority of EPP, ALDE and ECR MEPs winning the necessary votes for their compromise amendments. This means that additional amendments and a close vote are likely in the plenary session too, so the draft report may change quite substantially.
Background
The current legal framework for foreign direct investment (FDI) consists of over 1,200 bilateral investment treaties between EU Member States and third countries. Since the Lisbon Treaty took effect, however, foreign direct investment has become an exclusively EU competence. This raises the question of what should happen to this collection of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) in the future.
The Commission has proposed a regulation that would require all Member States to notify the Commission of all of their BITs, in exchange for which they would be authorised to keep these agreements in force. After reviewing these treaties, the Commission could then withdraw its authorization if the BIT in question conflicts with EU law, overlaps with an EU investment agreement with the same country, or conflicts with EU investment policy more generally.

Trade with India and Japan
2011-05-05 - 16:04
A resolution on EU trade with India and Japan will be debated Monday and put to a vote on Wednesday, with a view to an EU-Japan summit in Brussels in late May, and an EU-India trade agreement which the Commission aims to finalise this summer. Last month, the Japanese ambassador told the International Trade Committee his government wishes to start negotiations for an Economic Partnership Agreement. MEPs replied that further progress in dismantling non-tariff barriers, restrictions on foreign direct investment and discriminatory public procurement rules were necessary before any trade agreement could be negotiated.
In current negotiations, India's concessions on duties on passenger cars and wines and spirits do not appear sufficient for the Commission.

Preferential trade deal for Pakistan
2011-05-05 - 16:04
Emergency EU trade preferences proposed to help Pakistan to deal with the humanitarian and economic disaster caused by floods in summer 2010 will be debated Monday and put to a vote Tuesday. MEPs are likely to add a safeguard clause ensuring that any trade preference that would seriously threaten an EU producer could be revoked. Parliament broadly favours waiving import duties for around 75 Pakistani products until the end of 2013, at the latest. MEPs are also likely to insert a safeguard clause in the preferential trade regulation, so that any serious market disruption can be remedied.
To take effect, the regulation needs not only Parliament's backing in the plenary vote, but also a subsequent agreement with the Council. A World Trade Organization waiver would also be required. Although, a month ago, a WTO waiver looked unlikely, there has since been more optimism that the EU might win one.

Macro-financial assistance to Georgia
2011-05-05 - 16:04
A second, €46 million, financial assistance package to Georgia will be put to a vote on Tuesday. The aid itself is not controversial, but because a dispute with the Council over the details of how to oversee its delivery has not been resolved, the plenary vote is likely to lead to a second reading of the proposal. The macro-financial assistance, which is the second half of a previous EU commitment, would be offered half in grants and half in loans.
Parliament has argued that the release of funds should be dealt with in the same spirit as previous EU macro-financial assistance under the Lisbon Treaty, and will therefore adopt the Commission proposal as it stands.
The Council, however, insists that it should have a larger say in overseeing the release of funds. If the Council sticks to its demands, the financial assistance cannot be mobilized, and a second reading will begin.

Parliamentary immunity votes for Messrs De Magistris and Gollnisch
2011-05-05 - 16:04
Requests for the defence of parliamentary immunity of Mr Luigi de Magistris (ALDE, IT), who is being sued for libel, and Mr Bruno Gollnisch (NI, FR), who is being investigated further to a complaint alleging incitement to racial hatred, will be put to a vote Tuesday. The Legal Affairs Committee recommends defending the immunity of Mr de Magistris, but waiving that of Mr Gollnisch. Luigi de Magistris
The case against Mr de Magistris was filed by Clemente Mario Mastella, further to an interview that Mr De Magistris gave an Italian newspaper on 31 October 2009. Mr Mastella argued that a fragment of that interview constituted libel. The Legal Affairs Committee recommends defending his immunity, on the grounds that Mr de Magistris "was acting in performance of his duties as an MEP and carrying out political activities by expressing his opinion on a matter of public interest to his constituents".
Bruno Gollnisch
The other complaint was that a press release issued on 3 October 2008 by the Front National group in the Rhone-Alpes Regional Council, of which Mr Gollnisch was President, constituted an incitement to racial hatred. The French authorities have begun a judicial investigation, and requested that Mr Gollnisch's immunity be waived. Mr Gollnisch is requesting the defence of his immunity, but the Legal Affairs Committee recommends waiving it, on the grounds that that the complaint relates not to Mr Gollnisch's activities as an MEP, but rather to his role as a Rhône-Alpes regional councillor.
All reports are by Bernhard RAPKAY (S&D, DE).

The need for an integrated European innovation policy is the focus of a draft resolution by the Industry Committee. Innovation can generate solutions to the challenges Europeans face, such as an ageing society, sustainable resource management and economic recovery, believe MEPs.
