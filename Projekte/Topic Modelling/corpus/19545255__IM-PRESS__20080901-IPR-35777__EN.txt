MEPs debated the reform of the regulatory framework for electronic communications - including mobile and fixed telephones, broadcasting and the internet. The telecoms package seeks to strengthen consumer rights and privacy protection, to ensure a consistent application of regulatory measures and to modernise radio spectrum use. The entire European Parliament will vote on the package during the second September plenary (22-25 September 2008)
The revision of the framework directive must be justified, by benefits to consumers (easier, cheaper, faster access) and industry (fair competition, investment-friendly climate), said rapporteur Catherine Trautmann (PES, FR), who not ed that electronic communications account for 3% of EU GDP.
Ms Trautmann said she had sought to build trust among stakeholders, in order to build an appropriate "eco-system" for electronic communication technologies. This should help to stimulate industry, innovation and job-creation by enhancing the competitiveness of big and small companies, inter alia by encouraging investment in fibre-optic networks, she said, adding that the industry and the Council had generally responded positively.
She also stressed the need to build certainty as to the law, and to foster co-operation, both among regulators and between regulators and the Commission.
On remedies, Ms Trautmann observed that most people wanted rules to be applied more consistently, but opposed a Commission veto. Functional separation should require the agreement of both the Commission and the European regulators body, she added.
Finally, Ms Trautmann regretted that the intellectual property rights issue had arisen now, and felt that it should be resolved without substantially changing the proposal.
Mr Chatel (French minister) was absolutely right about the importance of electronic communications in developing a knowledge-based economy - already, they account for 25% of overall growth and 40% of productivity growth, said rapporteur Pilar Del Castillo Vera (EPP-ED, ES).
The "consistent, coherent and powerful concept" underlying Parliament's position is that of shared responsibility, she stressed. Shared, or co-responsibility, combined with ex-ante support for developing competitive potential, is the right response to telecoms market needs, she said, stressing the need clearly to define the structure, tasks and responsibilities of the body of regulators.
Furthermore, co-responsibility entails co-funding - funding by the Community alone would undermine consistency and coherence, she added.
Patrizia Toia (ALDE, IT), rapporteur on "reaping the full benefits of the digital dividend in Europe", stressed that an EU policy was needed to make the best use of the "digital dividend" (the new resources that will become available as radio spectrum is freed up by the switchover to digital). Radio spectrum, she argued, was "a public good" with "social value" that could be used to benefit all citizens, such as those in remote areas. In this way, the "digital dividend" can be used to overcome the "digital divide". Coordination at EU level was essential in this area.
Malcolm Harbour (EPP-ED, UK), rapporteur on "universal service, users' rights relating to networks and services, processing of personal data, protection of privacy, consumer protection cooperation", spoke of the need to give consumers clear information on prices, tariffs and contractual conditions as well as on ways of protecting themselves against threats to the security of their personal data. Good quality universal emergency services and the needs of disabled users were other points emphasised by Mr Harbour. In addition, "consumers are entitled to be informed about some of the problems they might encounter, whether it is potential for infringing copyright, whether it is potential for unauthorised use, whether it is potential for example for buying things that could damage their health like counterfeit medicines".
To help consumers, he asked "why should we not demand that electronic service providers carry public service messages in the same way that television channels do at the moment?"
