The European Parliament is seriously concerned that the political dialogue between the Ethiopian government and the opposition has broken down due to the ruling party's stance. It urges all parties to resume the talks immediately and work towards a functioning democracy with the rights of the opposition fully respected.
In a resolution adopted it also calls on the Ethiopian government to end the persecution and intimidation of opposition parties and to release immediately thousands of people who were arrested at an opposition demonstration in June. MEPs praise the opposition for having called off a demonstration on 2 October that could have led to serious clashes.
Parliament refers to the findings of the EU Election Observation Mission that the elections of 15 May, the first that were freely contested, were marred by serious irregularities, although the run-up to the elections was peaceful. It asks its president to write to the speaker of the Ethiopian parliament expressing its strong concern over the refusal to opposition members to take the floor, over the bill to strip parliamentary immunity from all elected opposition MPs who did not take their seats and over the bill to extend the previous administration of municipalities, in disregard of electoral results. Parliament also calls on the government to provide the opposition with access to the media and expresses its concern at a measure pushed through by the government which requires an absolute majority in parliament for introducing topics for debate.
Parliament asks the EU and the international community to stay vigilant and to continue support for the democratic process. If necessary, the European Commission should step up its humanitarian policy towards Ethiopia and adjust its non-humanitarian aid.
