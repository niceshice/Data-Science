MEPs then turn their attention to breast cancer as part of breast cancer awareness month. Parliamentarians will compare best practice among Member States. Every two minutes a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer and every six minutes someone dies of it somewhere in the EU. Every year it claims 88,000 women and 1,000 men. The House will also vote on a resolution on this topic.
The House then turns to a series of culture and media reports with votes on several legislative programmes including the Erasmus grant for students and support for European cinema.
In the afternoon, Parliament will focus on the EU budget for 2007 . The budget for 2007 is some €127 billion in commitment appropriations and €121.7 in payment appropriations. The House will vote its first reading position on Thursday.
President BORRELL and a Minister representing the Finnish Presidency will formally sign the conciliation agreement text on the European capitals of culture . The ceremony will take place on Tuesday 24 October between 2.30 and 3.00 pm on the left side of the hemicycle (LOW, level 1, side canal).

Wednesday afternoon from 3pm, Parliament will debate the situation in Transnistria and Georgia . The House will also vote two separate resolutions on these subjects.
MEPs then turn their focus to Syria with a debate on the EU-Syria association agreement. The Foreign Affairs Committee is convinced that the association agreement could give a decisive impetus to the political, economic and social reforms needed to improve the country’s situation. The committee reiterates, however, that respect for democratic values, human rights and civil liberties are prerequisites, and that, to this end, an effective control mechanism should be included in the agreement’s human rights clause.
In the evening, the House holds a joint debate on toxic waste and the protection of the environment , including Commission and Council statements on the exporting of toxic waste to Africa.
Parliament will also debate the posting of workers directive as the last point of the agenda on Wednesday evening. Members of the Employment Committee are concerned that the Posting of Workers directive is not being implemented properly in some Member States and is, therefore, failing to achieve its aims. In the context of the dispute over employment in the ferries industry in Ireland, the committee calls on the Commission to submit a proposal for a directive on the conditions required for the crews of vessels providing regular passenger and freight ferry services between Member States.
Thursday 26 October
The Conference of Presidents will declare the winner of the 2006 Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought and human rights. The winner will receive the award from President Borrell during the December plenary in Strasbourg.
Jean-Claude TRICHET , the President of the ECB will be present in Strasbourg to participate in the annual debate on the European Central Bank. MEPs will be considering a report from the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which praises the ECB’s handling of interest rate policy, while warning of the need for caution when raising rates to avoid endangering growth.
The House will also debate and vote on funding for rural development and CAP payments.
The session ends as usual with three debates and votes on resolutions relating to human rights. On this occasion the topics are: Tibet, the trial of Rios Montt (former dictator of Guatemala) and Uzbekistan.

MEPs to mark 1956 Hungarian uprising
2006-10-24 - 09:55
To mark the 50th anniversary of the Hungarian uprising against the communist regime and the Soviet occupation of 1956, the President of the EP and the political group leaders will make statements in the House on Tuesday 24 October. Hungarian President László Sólyom will address a formal sitting of Parliament on Wednesday 25 October at 12 noon.
During the plenary week, Parliament will commemorate the uprising in other ways, including a photo exhibition in the EP building in Strasbourg at which original black-and-white pictures of the 1956 uprising will be coupled with colour photos taken half a century later at the same location.
Budapest, 23 October 1956
The events in Hungary began on 23 October 1956 with a peaceful demonstration in Budapest against the communist regime, expressing solidarity with the democratic reform movement in Poland. Protesters demanded the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Hungary. Imre Nagy, a former ‘reforming communist’ Prime Minister, set up a new government.
Soviet intervention
At the request of Hungarian communist leaders, Soviet tanks entered Budapest on 24 October ‘to quell the rebellion’. After a massacre of peaceful demonstrators by the Hungarian security services outside the Parliament building on 25 October, armed resistance intensified.
Imre Nagy transformed his cabinet into a coalition government which declared Hungary independent and neutral and announced that it would leave the Warsaw Pact.
The revolution was finally crushed by the Soviet Red Army after a second invasion on 4 November. János Kádár, a nominee of Soviet party leaders, became prime minister of a new government and head of the Communist Party, now renamed the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party.
Restoration of communism
Over 2,500 Hungarians and 700 Soviet troops were killed and thousands more wounded during the fighting. In subsequent months over 10,000 revolutionaries were imprisoned and hundreds more executed. Around 200,000 Hungarians fled the country.
On 16 June 1958 Prime Minister Imre Nagy (who had never resigned) was hanged after a secret trial. His body was placed in an unmarked grave.
Rehabilitation of the events of 1956
In 1988 János Kádár was removed from power and the following year Hungary began its transformation into a democratic state. In January 1989 Imre Pozsgay, minister of state, described the events of 1956 as a 'people's uprising' instead of the officially used term 'counter-revolution'.
Imre Nagy’s ceremonial reburial took place on 16 June 1989, 31 years after his execution. He was officially rehabilitated on the very day of János Kádár’s death, on 6 July 1989.
Hungary was proclaimed a Republic (instead of a People's Republic) on 23 October 1989, 33 years after the outbreak of the revolution. Since then, 23 October has been a national holiday in Hungary. The last Soviet troops left Hungary in 1991.
László Sólyom, President of Hungary
The National Assembly of Hungary elected László Sólyom President of the Republic on 7 June 2005 for a five year term.
Mr Sólyom was born on 3 January 1942 in Pécs, Hungary. A former law professor and legal advisor to civil and environmental movements, he was appointed judge on the newly established Constitutional Court on 24 November 1989, subsequently becoming president of the court three times between 1990 and 1998. He took part in the National Roundtable Negotiations in 1990 which laid the foundations for the establishment of Hungary's new democratic state.

He started working on Torts and Damages. From the eighties onwards he worked in the field of the Right of Personality and Privacy, and introduced the right of data protection in Hungary, thus shifting the focus of his activity to constitutional rights and later to theoretical questions of constitutional jurisdiction too. In 1978 he was associate professor and between 1983 and 1998 university professor at the Department of Civil Law of the Eötvös Loránd University Budapest.
Since 1995 he has been university professor at the Faculty of Law of the Pázmány Péter Catholic University Budapest. He is currently Head of the Department of Comparative Private and Public Law and of the Doctoral Degree Programme.

Since the early 1980s he has been a legal advisor to civil and environmental movements, and has been a member of Duna Kör (Danube Circle). In 1988 and 1989 he was member of various civil organisations which played a significant role in the transition to democracy (e.g. Nyilvánosság Klub [Club for Freedom of the Press] and Független Jogász Fórum [Independent Lawyers’ Forum]). He was a founding member of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) and a member of its presidency between March 1989 and November 1990. He attended the sessions of the Opposition Roundtable on behalf of MDF and participated in the National Roundtable Negotiations in 1990.
On 24th November 1989 Parliament elected him a justice to the newly established Constitutional Court. He was deputy president of the Constitutional Court until the summer of 1990 and was elected by his peers president of the Constitutional Court three times between 1990 and 1998, a position he held until the end of his mandate.
He has been a member of the Védegylet (Protect the Future, Society for Our Natural and Cultural Heritage) since it was founded in March 2000.
In 1998 he was awarded the Grand Cross with Star of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. In 1999 he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary. In 2003 he received the medal of the Nagy Imre Order of Merit. His wife is a secondary school teacher with an M.A. degree in Hungarian and psychology.

Peace process in Spain
2006-10-24 - 09:55
On Wednesday 25 October Parliament will hold a debate and vote on two resolutions on the Peace Process in Spain. Taking part in the debate will be the Council and Commission, Parliament's President Josep Borrell and representatives of the political groups. Of the two resolutions tabled, one is supported by the PES, ALDE, GUE/NGL and Green/EFA groups, the other by the EPP-ED.
ETA has killed around 800 people since it was set up in July 1959 (45 of them during Franco's dictatorship). The last was in May 2003. On 18 May 2005 the Spanish Chamber of Deputies adopted a resolution (see below) authorising the government to enter into a dialogue with ETA. On 22 March 2006, ETA announced a permanent ceasefire and three months later, on 29 June, Prime Minister Zapatero announced at the Parliament (Cortes) the imminent start of a dialogue with ETA. However, the ceasefire has not put an end to extortion or street violence (some commentators say it has increased) nor to terrorist attacks (the last one dated 08.03.2006).
Draft resolution by the PES and other groups
This draft resolution says Parliament "condemns the violence as morally unacceptable and incompatible with democracy" and "expresses its solidarity with the victims of terrorism".
It refers to several statements and declaration of political leaders and institutions, saying Parliament "fully endorses the statement by the European Council of 23 and 24 March 2006", and "supports the statement by the President of the European Parliament, Josep Borrell, of 22 March 2006 and calls on the Council and the Commission to act accordingly".
Finally, it "supports the fight against terrorism as well as the peace process in Spain in the terms established by the Spanish Parliament in its resolution approved on 20 May 2005".
Draft resolution by the EPP-ED
The EPP-ED draft resolution states that "the fundamental question in this debate lies in the claim of a right to self-determination for the Basque country, which would involve a redrawing of the internal borders of European Union". It adds that "the European Union cannot approve of processes which endanger the principles of democracy and the rule of law, and consequently must categorically reject any attempt to modify the territorial integrity of a Member State".
The text also says that ETA are continuing "to develop their extortionist activities and other forms of street terrorism without renouncing violence". It stresses that "the necessary changes within the terrorist organisation ETA have not taken place, nor have the conditions as established in the resolution made by the Spanish Congress on 20 May 2005 which could justify a change in the counter-terrorist policy as defined by the Pact on Freedom and Against Terrorism, to which the two main political Spanish forces (Partido Popular and Partido Socialista) subscribed on the 8th of December 2000".
Divergent views
The political groups thus differ over the resolution adopted by the Spanish Chamber of Deputies on 18 May 2005, which authorised the government to embark on a dialogue with ETA within a precise framework and under the following conditions:
• Politics may and should contribute to put and end to violence;
• A process of dialogue should be supported "provided the proper conditions are met";
• This dialogue should only take place through the legal representatives of the people's will;
• No political price can be paid to put an end to violence: and no blackmail can be accepted;
• Unity of democratic parties is indispensable for the success of the policy against terrorism;
• Solidarity with victims of terrorism and full support all Security Forces;
• International cooperation, especially within the European Union.
This resolution was adopted by the Spanish Parliament (350 seats) with the votes of all political groups except the Partido Popular (148 MPs), which voted against it.
The draft resolution by the PES and others calls for the EP to support the Spanish Parliament's resolution, while the EPP-ED text says the conditions it laid down have not been met. Council and Commission statements

Debate on conclusions on Lahti summit
2006-10-24 - 09:55
The centrepiece of this week's plenary session is a debate on Wednesday 25 October on the outcome of the informal meeting of heads of state or government of 20 October in Lahti, Finland. The Finnish prime minister and two other ministers will take part in the debate as will the president of the Commission, before MEPs take the floor. The main issues on the agenda of the Lahti summit are innovation policy and external energy relations. The summit, to be chaired by Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen , will also discuss EU immigration policy.
After their meeting, the EU leaders will be joined for dinner by the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin. Discussions at the dinner will focus on the development of the strategic partnership between the EU and Russia, including cooperation on energy issues.
Wednesday's debate in Strasbourg will be opened by the Finnish prime minister. In addition, Paula Lehtomäki, minister for foreign trade and development, and Ulla-Maj Wideroos, coordinate minister for finance, will be present. Commission president José Manuel Barroso will speak on behalf of his institution. Parliament's political groups will then each have the opportunity to give their verdict on the summit's achievements.
Parliament has already held a debate ahead of the summit (see link below) at which all the groups expressed their views. While most group speakers agreed that the summit was focusing on issues crucial to Europe's future, several urged the EU leaders to press Mr Putin on the state of democracy and freedom of expression in his country, with some making explicit reference to the murder of the journalist Anna Politkovskaya.
An Informal Tripartite Social Summit also takes place in Lahti on 20 October, ahead of the main summit. The social summit will discuss ways of improving the quality of working life and labour market efficiency in Europe, focusing on the management of change through "flexicurity" (flexibility and security on the labour market). It will be chaired by Finnish prime minister Vanhanen and Commission president Barroso and will enable the social partners to convey their views on the issues on the main summit agenda.

Breast cancer awareness month - MEPs to vote on a resolution
2006-10-24 - 09:55
MEPs will debate and vote on a resolution on the issue of breast cancer in Europe. Every two minutes a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer and every six minutes someone dies of it somewhere in the EU. Every year it claims 88,000 women and 1,000 men. October is "International Breast Cancer Awareness Month". Anna ZÁBORSKÁ (EPP-ED, SK) and Karin JÖNS (PES, DE), on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality will be asking the Commission the following questions on the follow-up to Parliament's resolution of 5 June 2003 on breast cancer in the European Union
1. In view of the fact that breast cancer is the most frequent form of cancer among women in the EU, and given that Parliament's resolution of 5 June 2003 on breast cancer in the European Union calls on the Member States to create, by 2008, the conditions required for a 25% reduction in the average breast-cancer mortality rate in the EU and of reducing to 5% the disparity between the Member States in the five-year survival rate, what measures has the Commission taken to assist the Member States in achieving those targets and when will the Commission's progress report, which Parliament requested for the Spring Summit of 2006, be available?
2. The fourth revised edition of the guidelines on mammography screening now contain - as called for by Parliament in its resolution of 2003 - EU guidelines on specialist breast units. The guidelines recommended two nurses for the care of breast disease per unit, although no consensus has been reached on the training required for these nurses. Does the Commission therefore wish to support current activities to develop professional standards for nurses specialising in the care of breast disease and to publish the standards and recommendations in a supplement to the fourth edition of the EU guidelines, instead of waiting until the fifth edition is completed?
3. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), breast self-examination promotes a state of vigilance to a large degree, but does not constitute a suitable alternative to early detection of breast cancer by means of mammography screening. Does the Commission, therefore, intend to use regularly repeated information campaigns on healthy life-style, aimed at women, to highlight the fact that breast self-examination cannot be a substitute for mammography screening?
4. The implementation of organised breast cancer screening programmes in some of the 15 EU Member States required substantial professional, material and technical assistance through the 'Europe against Cancer' programme. What plans does the Commission have to provide appropriate support, together with the option of using the Structural Funds, in order to implement high-quality screening programmes in the new Member States and the applicant States ?
Jan ANDERSSON (PES, SE) and Karin JÖNS (PES, DE), on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, will be asking the Commission the following questions on the reintegration of breast cancer patients into the job market and use of social funds for continued training of health professionals in the field of breast cancer.
" Given the Lisbon strategy, which aims for a women's employment quota of 60% by 2010 and the large number of breast cancer cases diagnosed annually in women in the European Union (275 000 as currently estimated on the basis of the cancer registry data of the International Agency for Research on Cancer), the reintegration of breast cancer survivors into the job market is an urgent priority. This is underlined by the fact that an increasing number of women are diagnosed with breast cancer in the prime years of gainful employment: 35% of new breast cancer cases are currently diagnosed in women younger than 55 years. 12% are even diagnosed in women under age 45. Studies show, however, that around one fifth of former cancer patients do not return to work.
Could the Commission provide reliable information on the proportion of breast cancer patients who give up gainful employment during illness and treatment, for example by ordering a study on this subject?
How does the Commission intend to make employers aware of the need for patients to have the opportunity to resume full- or part-time employment while undergoing treatment regimes as this can be essential to maintain personal finances and stabilise patients' psychological condition?
How does the Commission intend to encourage employers to reintegrate breast cancer patients into the job market when the treatment is finished, to restructure their workplaces and to offer flexible working schedules?
Does the Commission see the need for, and will it support development of, a charter to protect the chronically ill in the workplace?
Implementation of mammography screening according to European guidelines for optimal early detection and treatment requires special training of medical staff. Does the Commission intend, particularly in the new Member States and the applicant countries, to promote use of the EU social fund and the pre-accession fund for training ?"
Karl-Heinz FLORENZ (EPP-ED, DE) and Karin JÖNS (PES, DE), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, will be asking the Commission the following questions on early detection and treatment of breast cancer in the enlarged European Union.
Given that breast cancer is the leading cause of death in women aged between 35 and 59 in the EU, breast cancer mortality rates vary between Member States by over 50%, rates of mastectomy for early-stage breast cancer differ between Member States by up to 60%, only 10 of the 25 EU Member States have implemented organised, nationwide mammography screening programmes, and even fewer Member States have fully implemented the EU guidelines on breast cancer screening, the Commission is requested to provide the European Parliament with the following information:
1. Is the Commission willing to take all necessary steps to obtain current and accurate data on the incidence, early detection and treatment of breast cancer in women and men in all Member States of the enlarged European Union? When will this information be available?
2. How will the Commission take into account in the Seventh Framework Programme the increasing awareness that, in addition to genetic factors, environmental factors and lifestyle also promote development of breast cancer?
3. How will the need for research to improve standards and protocols for quality assurance in breast cancer screening, particularly technico-physical aspects and alternatives to conventional mammography, such as digital mammography, be taken into account in the Seventh Framework Programme?
4. How does the Commission intend to use benchmarking and 'best practice' principles to influence the Member States which have made little or no progress in implementing the Council Recommendation on Cancer Screening of 2 December 2003 and in following the EU guidelines on specialist breast units?
5. What steps has the Commission taken in drawing up the Seventh Framework Programme to provide research funding to develop a serum-based test for early breast cancer detection (biomarker test)?
6. Is the Commission convinced that in the current age of modern communication it is more practical for physicians and patient groups in all EU Member States to order printed versions of the EU guidelines rather than to have the document available on the Internet for reading and downloading ?

Economic and monetary affairs
Trichet to debate ECB policy with MEPs
2006-10-24 - 09:55
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet will participate in the debate in Thursday morning's plenary on the performance of the ECB. MEPs will be considering a report from the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which praises the ECB’s handling of interest rate policy, while warning of the need for caution when raising rates to avoid endangering growth. The own-initiative report is a response to the ECB's 2005 annual report and calls for the publication of minutes of rate setting meetings and stresses that nationality should not be a factor in appointments to the Executive Board.
The committee praises the ECB’s policy of “concentrating on its most important objective, preserving price stability,” and says it was correct to increase rates in 2005. MEPs stress that the Bank must be aware of the risks to growth of continuous rate rises, but also continue to anchor inflationary expectations.
Board appointments and transparency
On appointments to the ECB Executive Board, MEPs stress that nationality should be irrelevant. While stressing the treaty requirement for candidates with experience of monetary and banking matters, they also argue that it is important for a variety of backgrounds to be represented on the Board.
MEPs in the committee call, once again, for the publication of summary minutes of rate setting meetings, with clear statements of the arguments in favour and against decisions taken and the reasons why these decisions were taken. This should not, they say, replace the current press conferences by the ECB President after such meetings, which provide “an invaluable and timely insight for observers and market participants”.
Money supply and 500 euro notes
The report asks the ECB to take action with regard to the “persistently high values of the M3 money supply” and to investigate developments in the mortgage and mergers and acquisitions markets. It also calls for a freeze on the number of 500 euro notes in circulation at its current level in the light of the nearly 21 per cent increase, which needs to be analysed.
Exchange rates and hedge funds
The report emphasises the risks of rapid adjustments in international disequilibria, and notes that Council has responsibility for exchange rate policy under the treaty, which does not however set out how that power should be exercised. MEPs in the committee invite the Eurogroup, ECB and Council to use their powers to the full, and step up coordination of their action in exchange rate policy.
The committee says the EU should “take the initiative in the debate which is getting underway globally – especially in the light of developments in the US – about the need to better control the activities of hedge funds” and calls for the ECB to carry out analyses of the issue.
Although many points in the report, originally drawn up by the Committee's chair, Pervenche Berès (PES, FR), result from a compromise between the political groups, some contentious issues remain, which led MEPs from the Socialist group to abstain in the final vote at committee stage. A number of amendments are likely to be tabled to the plenary. Rapporteur Pervenche BERÈS PSE FR A6-0349/2006 European Central Bank: annual report Procedure : own-initiative

Level 2 measures under Transparency and Prospectus Directives
2006-10-24 - 09:55
MEPs will vote on two draft resolutions from the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee concerning two sets of Level 2 implementing measures for directives falling under the Lamfalussy procedure for financial services legislation. One resolution deals with the issue of accounting standards used by third country issuers covering both the Transparency and Prospectus directives. MEPs in the committee propose changes to the Commission's draft implementing measures, notably to ensure real progress is made over the next two years in talks with the authorities of the United States and other jurisdictions on achieving equivalence between their accounting standards and the IFRS used in Europe.
The second resolution deals specifically with the detailed implementing measures proposed for the Transparency directive, where again MEPs are proposing a number of changes.
The Lamfalussy procedure, agreed between Parliament, Commission and Council for legislation covering financial services, involves the main political issues being dealt with via directives adopted as usual under co-decision, with the Commission being empowered to adopt the technical detail needed to put them into action via a simpler procedure, which nevertheless involves scrutiny from the Council and Parliament. While Parliament cannot insist on its amendments to these implementing measures being adopted, the Commission has undertaken to “take the utmost account of Parliament’s position” in such cases.

Budget
2007 budget: higher expenditure but with better value for money
2006-10-24 - 09:55
At the first reading of the EU budget for 2007, Parliament's Budgets Committee is proposing total budget expenditure of around €5 billion more than the Council, although with a new emphasis on obtaining value for money. It also wants to slash spending on the CFSP but is against the staff cuts at the Commission being urged by the Council. MEPs will vote on Thursday. at 11.30am. MEPs say the overall payments figure for next year's budget should be around €121.6 billion (1.04% of the gross national income of the EU-27), as compared with the €114.61 billion (0.98% of GNI) proposed by the Council at its first reading in July. This difference will be the key issue at the conciliation negotiations in late November.
Delivering "value for money"
The committee backed the new strategy of ensuring “value for money” proposed by James ELLES (EPP-ED, UK), the general rapporteur on the budget. For a number of budget lines, accounting for around €400 million, 30% of their funds should be placed in reserve, say MEPs. The funds would be released only when the European Commission has proved that the programmes are providing good value.
According to James Elles, "At the start of a new financial perspective, it is vital to tackle seriously those areas in the budget where particular lines are suspected to have weaknesses in implementation".
Mr Elles has proposed that cost-benefit studies be carried out in policy areas including the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) and communication policy. Questions have also been asked about the value for money of policies and programmes such as the European Neighbourhood and Partnership policies, research for small firms and Euratom/nuclear fusion and radiation protection.
This strategy will also enable Parliament to emphasise its own policy priorities. In particular, the committee is calling for increased funding for the Lisbon agenda, cohesion and external action.
Programmes which would benefit include transeuropean networks, nuclear safety and Life+.
Lastly, the value for money strategy is intended to pave the way for the mid-term review of the budget scheduled for 2008-2009 which was agreed during the negotiations on the 2007-2013 financial perspective.
External action
MEPs believe the heading used to fund EU action outside its borders (The EU as a global partner) is likely to be underfunded in 2007-2013, as it was in the last financial perspective.
However, the Budgets Committee does not want the flexibility instrument to be used, by contrast with previous years. Instead it voted for funds to be redeployed between budget lines.
The committee is seeking increases in areas including financial assistance for Palestine (+ €15 million in commitments, making a total of €173 million) and for the countries "to the east of Jordan" (+€15 million). In addition, €100 million is earmarked for reconstruction in Afghanistan and placed in a special line created for this purpose.
This money would be found by slashing by €86.6 million - i.e. by 50% - the total CFSP budget. It should be noted that Parliament is still calling on the Council for an ongoing dialogue between the institutions on the main issues and fundamental choices of the CFSP.
"No" to major staff cuts at the Commission
For Heading 5 (Administrative expenditure), the Budgets Committee wishes to restore the level of funding suggested in the Commission's preliminary draft budget. MEPs thus oppose the Council's proposal to reduce the number of posts at the Commission over the next few years. However, they want to place €50 million in reserve. The release of these funds would be subject to a number of conditions, including a "screening" exercise, or assessment, of the Commission's staff needs.
Pilot projects
As regards "pilot projects and the preparatory instruments", members of the committee have at this stage adopted a list of projects, including Euroglobe (a pilot project for an itinerant Globe theatre designed to promote a European public forum for debate, culture and study), an anti-terrorism database and better business and scientific links with China and India.
Agencies
Lastly, turning to the EU agencies, the Budgets Committee proposes setting their budget at the level agreed for 2006, plus an increase of no more than 2%. The increase for 2007 will go into the reserve pending receipt of a justification for the rapid increase in the agencies' budgets. A notable exception is the Frontex agency, whose budget would be increased by €14 million to fund patrols on the EU's borders.

Sakharov Prize - Conference of Presidents to decide on this year's winner
2006-10-24 - 09:55
On Thursday 26 October, the Conference of Presidents will decide on this year's winner of the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought and human rights. This year, MEPs selected the shortlist of three candidates for the 2006 Sakharov Prize, which is awarded every year by the European Parliament to individuals or organisations who have stood up for human rights or fought against intolerance. The prize will then be presented at the December plenary session by Parliament's President Josep Borrell. The three candidates are, in alphabetical order: - A joint nomination: All those fighting for the hostages kidnapped in Colombia, represented by Ingrid Betancourt and the Pais Libre Foundation; - Alexander Milinkevich, leader of the opposition in Belarus and an ex-presidential candidate who was jailed for 15 days for taking part in an unauthorised rally in Minsk; - Ghassan Tueni , a Lebanese journalist and diplomat, who has been nominated for the prize to commemorate the sacrifices of several prominent Lebanese figures who were assassinated: Rafiq Hariri, Basil Fuleihane, Samir Kassir, Georges Haoui and Gebrane Tueni. The European Parliament has awarded the Sakharov Prize every year since 1988 in memory of Andrei Sakharov (1921-1989), the Russian physicist and inventor of the hydrogen bomb, who in the 1970s set up a committee for the defence of human rights and political victims. His efforts were honoured in 1975 when he received the Nobel Peace Prize. 26.10.2006 More on 2006 Sakharov Prize

EU-Syria Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement - MEPs to highlight human rights issues
2006-10-24 - 09:55
Véronique DE KEYSER (PSE, BE), for the Foreign Affairs Committee will be putting forward an own-initiative report on EU-Syria Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement. The committee is convinced that the association agreement could give a decisive impetus to the political, economic and social reforms needed to improve the country’s situation. The committee reiterates, however, that respect for democratic values, human rights and civil liberties are prerequisites, and that, to this end, an effective control mechanism should be included in the agreement’s human rights clause. The report calls, in particular, for greater respect for ethnic minorities and reiterates the need to maintain freedom of religion.
MEPs in the committee believe that anchoring Syria firmly within the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership will reinforce Syria’s relations with the Member States of the European Union and its partners in the Southern Mediterranean, and facilitate the Middle East peace process.
The committee asks the Council to strengthen its initiatives with a view to deepening the cooperation between the EU and Syria and ultimately signing that agreement, while taking account of the following recommendations:
· encourage and support actions by the Syrian Government towards the establishment of a democratic system;
· call on Syria to respect Lebanon’s sovereignty and abstain from interfering in its internal affairs, in particular by stopping arms supplies and preventing Hezbollah militias from rearming in full cooperation with UNIFIL, and make renewed efforts so as to restart a credible peace process in the region leading to a comprehensive settlement and the restitution to Damascus of the Golan Heights;
· take account of the political signals emanating from the tenth regional congress of the Baath Party, of which the most conspicuous is the change in the leadership team to include younger figures close to President Al-Assad, as is shown by the appointment of Abdallah Dardari as deputy prime minister;
· give particular attention to the application of the clauses in the agreement seeking to make public contracts more transparent; call on the Commission to ensure that other bilateral or multilateral agreements follow that approach;
· call on the Syrian Government to adopt measures in the fields of democracy and human rights so as to comply with international human rights law as regards respect for freedom of expression, the protection of human rights defenders, the prevention of and the fight against torture and the abolition of the death penalty; in particular, draw attention to the necessary reform of the Syrian associations law so as to end all major restrictions as regards the activities of human rights organisations;
· nevertheless, put to the Syrian Government its serious concerns about the absence of progress in such areas as opening up to multi-party politics and respect for human rights and civil liberties;
· point out that respect for human rights constitutes a vital component in this association agreement and call on Syria to respect its commitments within the framework of the Barcelona Process and along the lines of the European Neighbourhood Policy; call on Syria in this perspective to do what is needed to immediately lift the state of emergency;
· call on the Syrian Government to reconsider the case of political prisoners and release all prisoners of conscience and peace activists, and to allow the existence of groups such as the signatories of the Damascus Declaration, signed on 16 October 2005 by five proscribed parties and by independent personalities, and the signatories of the Beirut-Damascus/Damascus-Beirut Declaration of 14 May 2006; call on Syria to ensure that detained or imprisoned persons are well treated, not subjected to torture and are given prompt, regular and unrestricted access to their lawyers, doctors and families;
· denounce before the Syrian Government – as Parliament has done in its above resolution of 15 June 2006 – the wave of arrests in response to the Beirut-Damascus/Damascus-Beirut Declaration, the first joint initiative by Syrian and Lebanese intellectuals and human rights defenders, and call for their immediate release;
· address the concerns of the European Union with regard to respecting the rights of religious and other minorities, and of the Kurds in particular; call on the Syrian Government to report on the state of progress with these issues;
· re-open a genuine dialogue with Syria with a view to involving it in peace efforts towards an overall settlement of the Middle East conflict;
· urge Syria to play a constructive role in the implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions 1559 and 1701, and call on it specifically to step up controls on its side of the Syria-Lebanon border so as to prevent the supply of arms to non-state entities;
· point out that cooperation by the Syrian authorities with the UN International Independent Investigation Commission headed by judge Brammertz has improved, but insist that it is further stepped up and that practical action is taken to follow up the investigation and comply with its findings;
· insist that Syria fully complies with UN Security Council Resolutions 1559, 1562, 1680 and 1701 and with the European Council’s declaration on Lebanon of 16 and 17 June 2006, which call on Syria and Lebanon to delineate their common frontier to reinforce regional stability; call on Syria to make a positive contribution to the clarification of the final status of the Shebaa Farms area in accordance with the UN Secretary-General’s recommendations of 12 September 2006 and in compliance with international law;
· note positively in this connection the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanese territory; yet call firmly on the Syrian Government to establish formal diplomatic relations with Lebanon, which has so far been refused, and to stop supporting Hezbollah;
· call on the Syrian Government to give an account of its practical actions to combat the proliferation of weapons and against terrorism and al-Qa’ida and on the control of its frontiers to prohibit the smuggling of weapons and the crossing of terrorists into neighbouring countries;
· deplore in this connection the signing of a military agreement concluded with Iran on 15 June 2006 on strengthening mutual cooperation in the face of American and Israeli ‘threats’;
· draw the attention of Syria to the importance of its potential role in the Near and Middle East for the peaceful resolution of conflicts in the region; address the concerns over Syrian support to Damascus-based Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad at the expense of moderate Palestinian forces that seek coexistence and peace with Israel;
call on the Syrian Government to improve the living and environmental conditions of Palestinian refugee camps in Syria in accordance with international human rights standards;
· call on the Syrian Government to release Yacoub Hanna Shamoun, an Assyrian Christian who has been incarcerated for over twenty years without due process or a release date in the near future;
· exercise caution in the repatriation to Syria of immigrants and refugees belonging to religious minorities as long as repression continues; and, in any event, improve coordination of the different Member States’ national approaches to this issue;
· call for support for a dialogue between Syria and Parliament on these various points, so as to go forward with the cooperation between the EU and Syria with the expectation of signing the association agreement.
Finally, the Foreign Affairs Committee requests the Council to consider additional incentives and benefits for Syria, going beyond those granted through the association agreement, in order to encourage Syria to review its current foreign policy and regional alignment in ways that will help promote regional peace, stability and prosperity and, in particular, recognition of the State of Israel’s right to exist and support by Syria for progress in the Middle East peace process.

Statements on South Ossetia and Transnistria
2006-10-24 - 09:55
MEPs will debate and vote on developments in South Ossetia and Transnistria.
In South Ossetia , (part of territorial Georgia), over recent weeks relations between Georgia and Russia have deteriorated, especially over the alleged spying by Russia. Russia announced it was suspending all air, road, rail, sea and postal links with Georgia, which is heavily reliant on trade ties with Russia.
In early September, four people are reported to have been killed in clashes in Georgia's breakaway region of South Ossetia. Georgian police said they were fired upon as they tracked smugglers. One of their number died and two were hurt. However South Ossetian police said they came under fire from Georgian forces using heavy small arms and mortars, and that three of their number died. South Ossetia is under a tense stand-off between Georgian forces and separatists, who are backed by Russia. A helicopter carrying Georgia's defence minister over the region was shot at.
Georgia’s relations with Russia since independence have been complicated by three interconnected sets of issues: Russia’s perceived support for the separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the lack of agreement on a timetable for the withdrawal of the remaining Russian bases in Georgia following the commitments of Russia at the OSCE Istanbul Summit of 1999, and Russia’s perception of Georgia as a safe haven for Chechen rebels.
Transnistria
On 19 September 2006, the Council made the following statement on Transnistria: "The European Union is aware that a "referendum" in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova has taken place on 17 September 2006. This "referendum" contradicts the internationally recognized sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova. The EU considers that the situation in Transnistria does not allow the free expression of popular will. The EU reiterates that it recognizes neither the "referendum" nor its outcome.
The European Union calls upon the mediators and observers in the OSCE-led 5+2 talks to make public statements to the same effect.
The European Union fully supports Moldova's territorial integrity and calls on both parties to the conflict to return immediately to the negotiating table in the 5+2 format and work towards a speedy and transparent solution of the Transnistria conflict.

Culture
Funding for culture and education programmes to be sped through
2006-10-24 - 09:55
Parliament will vote on five second-reading reports by the Culture Committee concerning education, culture and citizenship programmes for 2007-2013.
Although all five rapporteurs regard the funding for the programmes as inadequate, they are keen to get the programmes up and running in January 2007. They are therefore recommending that the Council common position be approved in four cases, while in the case of the Citizenship programme Parliament will adopt a few amendments which have been pre-negotiated with the Council.
The Lifelong Learning Programme consists of six subprogrammes: Comenius (school education), Erasmus (higher education) where MEPs in the committee and Council have agreed to increase the monthly scholarship for Erasmus students from €150 to €200, Leonardo da Vinci (vocational training) and Grundtvig (adult education) plus a Transversal Programme (focusing on policy development, language learning tools, e-learning and the spread of best practice) and the Jean Monnet Programme (study, research and teaching about European integration, including grants for the College of Europe and the European University Institute in Florence).
Rapporteur: Doris PACK (EPP-ED, DE).
Budget agreed with Council and Commission: €6200 million for 2007-2013.
MEDIA is a programme to support the European TV and cinema industries. Previous MEDIA programmes have made major contributions to Europe's audiovisual sector and have delivered good value in doing so. Approximately 90% of non-national European films have been supported by the MEDIA programme. For every euro invested, the MEDIA Plus programme (2001-2006) has generated €5.75 in follow-up investment, €2.83 in education, €7.2 in distribution and €4.19 in development.
Rapporteur: Ruth HIERONYMI (EPP-ED, DE).
Agreed budget: €671 million.
Youth in Action is intended to foster active citizenship and a feeling of belonging to Europe among young people and to encourage young people to take part in the democratic life of Europe.
Rapporteur: Lissy GRÖNER (PES, DE).
Agreed budget: €785 million.
Culture 2007-2013 seeks to promote the mobility of workers active in the field of culture, to encourage the cross-border circulation of works of art and of culturally significant objectives and to foster inter-cultural dialogue.
Rapporteur: Vasco GRAÇA MOURA (EPP-ED, PT).
Agreed budget: €354 million.
Citizens for Europe is a programme to promote active European citizenship. Thanks to Parliament's first reading amendments, the programme's general objectives will include enhancing tolerance by promoting intercultural dialogue and the programme will be open to legal residents from third countries. Measures to keep alive the memories of the crimes committed by the Nazi and Stalinist regimes have also been supported by Council.
Rapporteur: Hannu TAKKULA (ALDE, FI).

Civil Liberties committee backs compromise to extend Schengen Information System to new Member States
2006-10-24 - 09:55
The Civil Liberties Committee is signalling that it wants a first reading agreement with the Council on legislation to allow the enlargement of the Schengen Information System to the ten new Member States. It is proposing a package of three reports on proposals and amended Commission plans for SIS II. The committee is putting forward over 200 compromise amendments in two co-decision reports and one consultation report by Carlos COELHO (EPP-ED, PT) on proposals for the establishment, operation and use of SIS II as well as the access to SIS II by the services in the Member States responsible for vehicle registration.
The compromise texts are the result of negotiations with the Council Presidency and had been agreed with the European Commission. The changes should improve SIS II's security and personal data protection standards, and they also give Parliament a stronger supervisory role.
SIS is a common information system allowing cooperation between competent authorities in the Member States, through the exchange of information for the implementation of various policies. The integration of the new Member States in the SIS relies on the availability of a new version, SIS II.
One of the compromise proposals is for a Management Authority, funded by the EU budget, to manage the operation of the SIS II central data base. The Management Authority's personal data processing activities would be monitored by the European Data Protection Supervisor, who would be required to ensure that they are audited to international standards at least every four years.
Personal data processing at national level would be audited by national supervisory authorities, but in co-operation with the European Data Protection Supervisor so as to ensure co-ordinated supervision.
Each Member State would be responsible for setting up and maintaining a national data system that can communicate with the central SIS II and must designate an authority for that purpose. It would also have to take steps necessary to protect personal data.
Mr Coelho noted that all negotiators had made concessions, and said he hoped the Council would honour the agreement. The Finnish Presidency representative said that the results of the committee vote would be submitted to the Council for further reflection.

Go-ahead for European Payment Order
2006-10-24 - 09:55
The House is expected to approve the Legal Affairs Committee's recommendation for second reading on the European Payment Order, a procedure designed to speed up the settlement of cross-border payment claims.
The aim of the European Payment Order (EPO) is to enable individuals and businesses to enforce uncontested payments using an EU-wide standard procedure. Under the new regulation it will be possible, for example, to claim payment of unpaid bills for purchases made via mail orders or Internet retailers through a simple procedure.
The current situation is a burden on many businesses, which find it difficult to deal with unfamiliar legal procedures in foreign countries. They experience delays and unexpected costs in recovering debts.
Small businesses in particular should benefit from a simpler and cheaper procedure for pursuing payments across the EU. The EPO will only apply to cross-border cases and cannot be used for property disputes arising from a matrimonial relationships and wills.
At first reading, MEPs amended the Commission proposal to further simplify the procedure. They wanted to ensure that the application forms to introduce a European Payment Order, annexed to the regulation, were user-friendly, suitable for on-line use and required a minimum of free text.
The Legal Affairs Committee is satisfied with the outcome of negotiations with Member States, as the Council accepted all Parliament's first-reading amendments. If the full Parliament accepts the committee's recommendation, the draft regulation will become law at this second reading stage.

Posting of workers directive: clarifications and better enforcement needed
2006-10-24 - 09:55
Members of the Employment Committee are concerned that the Posting of Workers directive is not being implemented properly in some Member States and is, therefore, failing to achieve its aims. They call on for urgent action by the Commission and Member States to change this situation. So far, however, they are not asking for changes in the directive. The Directive applies to companies which send employees to work temporarily in a Member State other than the one under whose laws they are employed. It seeks to guarantee the free movement of persons and services while ensuring that posted employees benefit from certain minimum protective provisions of the Member State in which they are working.
In an own-initiative report by Elisabeth SCHROEDTER (Greens/EFA, DE), MEPs in the committee stress that there is not necessarily a contradiction between the freedom to provide services and the upholding of fair competition on the one hand and ensuring workers' protection on the other. They say many difficulties result from differences of interpretation of key concepts, the fact that many workers are unaware of their rights under the directive and the difficulty for the host Member State to monitor compliance with the directive due, amongst others, to a lack of information flow between the two Member States concerned.
Information, cooperation and guidelines
The report says the solution includes increased information and simple procedures that enable people to know their rights. The Commission should actively support these measures, and take an active position to make the cooperation between Member States more effective and efficient, particularly to counteract unfair competition and social dumping.
Following the deletion by Parliament of Articles 24 and 25 from the proposed services directive, the Commission has drawn up guidelines on the interpretation of European Court of Justice case law on posting of workers. MEPs in the committee welcome this move, but are concerned that in some cases the Commission goes beyond the Court's judgements. Among other points, in contrast to the Commission, MEPs in the committee say that the employer must have a person available in the host country in those cases where the social partners share responsibility for enforcing the directive.
Sham self-employed workers and subcontracting
One strategy to circumvent the minimum standards of the directive is so-called "sham self-employment". While MEPs in the committee agree this directive is not the place to deal with self-employment issues, they perceive a growing problem and ask the Commission discuss with Member States ways to ensure transparency and uniformity in the criteria for determining the status for workers as self-employed persons.
The report says many abuses exist in the subcontracting and outsourcing of cross border workers. MEPs in the committee ask the Commission to close the existing loopholes - especially regarding the question of liability.
Ferries
The Employment and Social Affairs Committee calls on the Commission to submit a proposal for a directive on the conditions required for the crews of vessels providing regular passenger and freight ferry services between Member States.

Environment
Funding for LIFE+ environment programme
2006-10-24 - 09:55
In a report drafted by Marie-Anne Isler-Beguin (Greens/EFA, FR), the Environment Committee will be suggesting a number of amendments to the Council common position on the regulation on the Financial Instrument for the Environment (LIFE+).
The main focus at first reading was the level of funding for Natura 2000 (the network for conserving, protecting and managing European biodiversity, which is a subprogramme of LIFE+.
At second reading the key issue is the way in which EU funding for the entire LIFE+ programme should be distributed. The Environment Committee voted against the Council's proposal to allocate at least 80% of the LIFE+ budget for 2007-2013 to the Member States. This would mean that all the European added value would be lost, and above all it would give a blank cheque to Member States to pursue national objectives. For example, says the rapporteur, EU funding should not be used to pay Member States' staff costs for environmental policy but to carry out EU projects.
If the Environment Committee's proposal on funding for LIFE+ is accepted, the programme will receive a total of €1911 million (in 2004 prices) for the period 1.1. 2007 to 31.12.2013. This figure is less than the Commission's original figure but more than the Council's.
Background
EU policies such as agriculture and regional development are nowadays supposed to take account of environmental policy. As a result, some environmental projects are financed through the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund.
However, because a separate financial instrument for environmental policy is also needed, LIFE was set up in 1992. Its successor is LIFE+, which will include programmes such as Forest Focus that were previously separate but complementary to LIFE.
LIFE+ will primarily support the goals of the 6th Environmental Action Programme. This programme aims at combating climate change, halting the decline in bio-diversity, improving environment, health and the quality of life, promoting the sustainable use of natural resources and developing strategic approaches to policy development, implementation and awareness raising.

Environment
Tighter limits on industrial chemicals
2006-10-24 - 09:55
The Environment Committee is seeking to tighten up Commission plans to cut the use of perfluorooctane sulfonates. These are chlorinated compounds used in everyday materials well as industrial applications. They contribute to the greenhouse effect and also pose a health risk because they accumulate in the body. MEPs want to limit their use as far as possible, although some derogations will be allowed. The chlorine chemistry industry has in the past produced substances such as DDT, PCBs and CFCs whch caused havoc in the environment but today are either banned or tightly controlled. Perfluorooctane sulfonates (PFOS) are members of a relatively new class of perfluorinated compounds which have also proved hazardous. A new directive is therefore needed to deal with these chemicals.
The European Commission is suggesting that PFOS should not be placed on the market or used as a substance or constituent of preparations in a concentration equal to or higher than 0.1% by mass. However, in a report by Carl SCHLYTER (Greens/EFA, SE), adopted in committee by 50 votes to 1 with 1 abstention, the Environment Committee adopted an amendment lowering this figure to 0.005%.
The Environment Committee also voted to extend the directive's scope to include perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), which has a similar structure and toxicity to PFOS, according to a recent OECD study. MEPs say concentrations of this substance too should be limited to 0.005% by mass.
The directive will apply to new products only and thus excludes those already in use or on the second-hand market. However, under an amendment adopted by the committee, fire-fighting foams could be used up to 18 months after the legislation enters into force, although Member States must take steps to prevent further emissions from such products.
Under another amendment, controlled closed systems where the concentration of PFOS released into the environment and the workplace is less than 1μg per kg of these PFOS may be used in the system until six years after the directive enters into force.
MEPs also granted derogations for photoresists or anti-reflective coatings for photolithography processes until eight years after the directive enters into force, provided they are used in controlled closed systems. Industrial photographic coatings applied to flims, papers or printing plates will be allowed an extra six years.
There is no substitute for PFOS in hydraulic aviation fluids, which are vital for aircraft safety. The committee therefore proposes a ten-year derogation, which can be extended to allow the development of alternatives.
The above derogations may be extended for a limited period of time on a case-by-case basis if manufacturers can prove they have made every effort to develop safer alternatives or alternative processes and if these are still not available.

Budgetary control
Recovery of Community Funds - OLAF should be fully independent
2006-10-24 - 09:55
Paulo CASACA (PES, PT), for the Budgetary Control Committee, will be tabling an own-initiative report on the recovery of Community funds. This technical report highlights the possibility of closer cooperation with Eurojust and Europol needs to be explored in order to strengthen the real protection of the Union’s financial interests, as well as an evaluation of the possibility of OLAF’s full administrative independence from the Commission and the other institutions. OLAF inquiries and national procedures
The committee notes that OLAF does not possess suitable information on the quantities of incriminated products, while undertaking the inquiries in a criminal law context has proved disastrous from the viewpoint of recovery, even if it is true that in strictly legal terms OLAF is entitled, on behalf of the Commission, to contest a national decision. MEPs in the committee also recall that, while in some countries recovery proceedings may be initiated even if a criminal action is under way, in others the criminal law has precedence over the civil law, so that the existence of an action on the part of a judicial authority makes it impossible to recover the disputed sums. The committee deplores the fact that in some Member States irregularities and frauds are admitted only in respect of individually proven sums, that is, lot by lot, and that where no lot is present the operator is automatically deemed innocent.
The European Public Prosecutor
MEPs in the committee consider that the creation of the office of European Public Prosecutor will be a decision of major importance, since it will facilitate direct access to the national public prosecutor’s offices, thus working in the interests of a more ‘joined-up’ procedure. The committee believes that this should help reduce complexity, since the result should be a converged use of the European Prosecutor’s services; recalls that, while OLAF enjoys powers of intervention in the context of its inquiries, it does not enjoy judicial powers.
The committee notes that the project to establish a European Public Prosecutor must be regarded more as a long-term undertaking, and that, in order to achieve an improvement in the short term, coordination between Member States' public prosecutors must be central to plans to create added value, reducing OLAF's workload and protecting the financial interests of the Community.

Transport
Making better use of inland waterways
2006-10-24 - 09:55
Europe should exploit more of its free capacity on inland waterways as part of the multi-modal transport links across the EU and neighbouring countries, says the Transport Committee. MEPs are asking the European Commission to draw up a European Development Plan for the sector which should include an up-to-date inventory of the European inland waterway infrastructure. Corien WORTMANN-KOOL (EPP-ED, NL) is putting forward an own-initiative report by on NAIADES, the Commission's proposals for an integrated Inland Waterway Transport sector, the committee stresses that the Commission should designate as soon as possible - and not later than the end of 2006 - a European Trans European Transport Network coordinator for inland waterway transport to support the implementation of priority projects, drawing on experience with existing coordinators.
The committee says the reliability of the waterway network and the availability of multi-functional inland ports are the most important conditions for this vital transport sector. Improving infrastructure and the fleet is also crucial, so, in 2007, the Commission should submit a proposal for a European Waterway Transport Innovation Fund. MEPs also stress the need for the development of clean and efficient vessels under the 7th Framework Programme on Research and Development.
Finally, the committee asks the Commission and Member States to provide incentives to accelerate the introduction and use of fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly engines in order to respect stricter limits for SOx, PM, NOx and CO2 emissions.

Agriculture
Support for rural development
2006-10-24 - 09:55
Jan MULDER (ALDE, NL), for the Agriculture Committee, will be putting forward a non-binding report on support for rural development recommending that Parliament's approves the Commission proposal. EAFRD - December 2005 Financing Agreement
All rural development payments from 2007 - 2013 will be made out of the EAFRD (European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development) – the single fund which will replace the two current sources of rural development funding (the EAGGF Guarantee and Guidance funds).
The December 2005 European Council financing agreement did agree certain parameters for the overall Rural Development fund of €69.75 billion before modulation. At least €33.01 billion will be shared between the ten New Member States, plus Romania and Bulgaria, which are expected to join the EU on 1 January 2007. The remaining €36.74 billion will be divided up among the EU-25, with at least half (€18.91 billion) being guaranteed for the EU-15.
Within this total, some €4.07 billion will be allocated to national envelopes for certain countries - i.e. €1.35 billion to Austria, €460m to Finland, €500m to Ireland, 500m to Italy, €20m to Luxembourg, €111m to France, €820m to Sweden and €320m to Portugal. In Portugal’s case, the Council concluded that the money should not be subject to co-financing, making reference to the particular constraints that Portuguese agriculture faces, as described in Commission's report 10859/03.
The total amounts for rural development have been agreed on a considerably lower level compared to the initial Commission proposal for the Financial Perspectives.
European Commission's Proposal
The European Commission's proposal COM (2006) 237 proposes, in line with the December 2005 Financial Council Agreement, to exempt Portugal from the application of the co-financing requirement for the amount of EUR 320 million.
Commission proposal COM (2006) 237, amending Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005, is necessary in order to bring the "capping provision" in line with the December 2005 European Council Agreement as well as with the relevant provision in the Community legislation governing the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the period 2007–2013.
Capping means the maximum total spending of all structural and rural development funds in a particular Member State, as a percentage of its GDP. As the total amount of funds at a European level has been agreed by the Council on a much lower level, as compared to the initial Commission proposal, the capping provisions in the corresponding legislation have to be altered accordingly.
The committee proposes to exceptionally accept the proposal to exempt Portugal from the application of the co-financing requirement for the amount of EUR 320 million assuming that this concerns a once-off operation. The proposed changes to the capping provisions seem to be rather technical amendments.
The committee understands the need to realign rural development legislation with the December 2005 European Council Agreement. However, budgetary decisions should normally follow legislative decisions and not the other way around. Moreover, the practice by which individual Member States are being persuaded to vote in favour of an agreement, by including particular extra amounts or preferential treatment for them (the so called Christmas gifts) is highly undesirable. Also for reasons of transparency, unity and sound financial management the practice of this kind of horse treading should be prevented.

Reform of direct payments under the CAP - proposal to be rejected?
2006-10-24 - 09:55
Lutz GOEPEL (EPP-ED, DE), for the Agriculture Committee, will be recommending that Parliament reject the Commission proposal on laying down rules for voluntary modulation of direct payments, establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers. The Commission proposal on the introduction of voluntary modulation goes back to a Council decision of December 2005. The background was the cuts in rural development funding which were agreed in the Council at the insistence of the 1% States, particularly Britain (around € 69 billion instead of 88 bn), which were to be partially compensated by voluntary modulation. Parliament had immediately expressed strong reservations about this (see Declaration 9 on the Interinstitutional agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management (IIA)).
The Council decision also provides for the EU's total expenditure, including that on agricultural policy, to be subjected to a 'health check'. The European Parliament is to participate fully in the preparation and implementation of the results (cf. Declaration 3 on the IIA).
The Commission proposal, which partially deviates from the Council decision, contains the following essential elements:
- Member States may cut up to 20% of all direct payments under voluntary modulation (the Council also wished to include market expenditure).
- Modulation is not subject to any conditions, except that small recipients (i.e. those receiving less than € 5000 in direct payments) are exempt from it.
- The funds may be used freely in accordance with the provisions of the EAFRD Regulation; the rules on minimum expenditure per axis must be complied with (this was not what the Council advocated).
- Co-financing is not compulsory.
- Member States must decide the rate of reduction for the whole financing period within two months.
No impact assessment has been performed.
Member States are strongly in favour of a further increase in flexibility, i.e. in particular the abandonment of the earmarking of funds for particular axes, an extension of the declaration period, the possibility of adjusting modulation rates during the financing period, greater regionalisation, etc.
Assessment
The committee cannot agree to the proposal because:
- it jeopardises the survival of many farms,
- it distorts competition and discriminates against farmers in individual Member States in a way which violates the Treaty,
- it entails the abandonment or renationalisation of the CAP and abandons the principle of solidarity enshrined in the CAP,
- it disregards Community objectives in rural areas,
- it is unbalanced and incoherent, and
- it violates the EP's rights of participation.
In the absence of an impact assessment or reliable figures, Parliament cannot consent to such a far-reaching paradigm shift.
The rapporteur observes that, in the Böge report, Parliament proposed that the financing problems of the CAP be solved by means of compulsory national co-financing of first-pillar expenditure. That would have made it possible to honour the pledges which the Heads of State and Government gave to farmers in October 2002 without calling into question the common agricultural policy, i.e. a policy decided jointly at European level.
The Council decision restricts the debate on the structure of agricultural expenditure in connection with the health check to modulation issues, as the statement by the Commissioner on the expansion of compulsory modulation after 2008 shows. There will evidently not be any sincere consideration of the proposals made by Parliament in the Böge report.
Individual retrospective improvements are not sufficient: rather, a comprehensive examination of all possible alternatives is needed, on the basis of which coherent and consistent measures could then be worked out.

Civil protection
Community Civil Protection Mechanism
2006-10-24 - 09:55
The Community civil protection mechanism was established in 2001 with the sole purpose of supporting the mobilisation and co-ordination of civil protection assistance in the event of a major emergency taking place either inside or outside of the EU. In light of increased emergencies since 2001 there is a growing recognition on the need to develop the mechanisms beyond its current mandate. Thus the main objective of the proposed Council Decision is to strengthen the mechanism and to provide a legal basis for additional Community actions in the field of civil protection.
Dimitrios PAPADIMOULIS (GUE/NGL, GR) will be putting forward a non-binding report on the community civil protection mechanism.
The proposed recast, while respecting the overall philosophy of the Community civil protection mechanism, as created in 2001, consists of introducing a number of improvements in the existing Council Decision in order to strengthen the supporting and complementing actions that will allow the Community as a whole to come to the aid of those affected by major emergencies. At the same time the recast complements the earlier proposal for a Rapid Response and Preparedness Instrument. While the latter provides the legal basis for the financing of civil protection actions in the new financial perspectives period, the new proposal amends the operational rules governing the operation of the Community Civil Protection Mechanism and provides a legal basis for new Community action to be undertaken in the field.
Although emergency services will always act at local level during accidents or disasters, many elements concerning the different phases of civil protection activities have a European dimension (e.g. standardization) especially in specific sectors such as chemicals, transport, construction, telecommunications and health.
The committee welcomes the suggested changes in the proposed Decision but would like to see the issue of informing citizens of potential risks as an important element of preparedness, especially in disaster prone zones. Furthermore, land management and land use are important tools in preventing and mitigating disasters. It should be an integrated part of disaster risk reduction plans and management.
The Environment Committee regrets the fact that neither the initial nor the recast Decision contain definitions of the terms «major emergency», «early warning», “rapid response” and “preparedness”. The committee considers that these terms should be considered in the context of the definitions given in the «Internationally Agreed Glossary of Basic Terms Related to Disaster Management» United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA) Jan 1992, as well as in the context of the definitions given in the European Parliament legislative resolution on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a Rapid Response and Preparedness Instrument for major emergencies.
The committee considers that the public health component of all civil protection interventions should be given the importance it deserves bearing in mind that all disasters affect humans both physically and psychologically, and as a consequence both health and social security systems bear a heavy burden of disasters a long time after the intervention phase is completed.
The committee also supports the reference to the use of military assets supporting civil protection, as leaving out such a reference gives room for the military to mount their own operations outside the existing Mechanism and civil protection framework .
The reality on the field is such that fire-fighter forces in some countries are considered to be part of the military (as they have a military structure and hierarchy) and in many countries, the military has the know-how for interventions in major disaster, such as chemical, biological or nuclear disasters.
The deployment of military equipment and staff are most efficient and needed at the initial phase of a major disaster. Securing an overview and the use of such resources can help to save lives, avoid duplication of resources and thereby making scarce resources available in other areas.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Call for action against double discrimination faced by immigrant women
2006-10-24 - 09:55
The two-fold discrimination immigrant women suffer based on origin and gender is highlighted in an own-initiative report put forward by the Women’s Rights Committee, which proposes ways to promote their access to economic, political, social and cultural life in the host country as well as actions to combat human rights violations against immigrant women and girls. Women immigrants represent the majority (54%) of those migrating to the EU for an increasing variety of reasons: economic, refugee, asylum, family reunification.
The report, drafted by Rodi KRATSA-TSAGAROPOULOU (EPP-ED, GR), calls on the Member States to strengthen the structures and social services which enable immigrants to settle in smoothly and to provide them with information about their rights and obligations in accordance with the principles and legalisation of the Member States, noting that integration is a two-way process which requires mutual commitment on the part of the host society and the immigrants.
The report calls on the Member States to incorporate measures to create favourable conditions for immigrant women to access the labour market and to balance their professional and private life, fight undeclared work, ensure respect for women's social rights, language education and promote access of young women immigrants to education and training systems in the host countries.
The report urges the Member States which have not done so "to ensure that effective and deterrent penalties apply under their criminal codes to all forms of violence against women and children, particularly forced marriage, polygamy, crimes of honour and female genital mutilation".
MEPs call on Member States, on the basis of their national legislation and the International Conventions, to "guarantee respect for the fundamental rights of immigrant women, whether or not their status is regular, particularly access to justice, legal aid, accommodation facilities and healthcare."

External/international trade
Anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard actions against the EU
2006-10-24 - 09:55
Cristiana MUSCARDINI (UEN, IT) will be putting forward an own-initiative report on the anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard actions against the EU for the International Trade Committee. The committee is concerned at the abnormal increase in the number of trade defence cases involving both 'traditional' users of trade defence instruments and other, more recently-developed WTO members. MEPs in the committee consider that, in many of these cases, the WTO's rules and case law have been partially or completely disregarded, thus causing unjustified damage to the Community's industry. Nevertheless, the committee welcomes the help provided by the Commission to Member States and European industry in trade defence cases brought by third countries. The report urges the Commission to constantly monitor the action taken by third countries to ensure that it is appropriate and fair.
The committee calls on the Commission to campaign at the WTO for a radical revision of the rules governing the imposition of safeguard measures to avoid the excessive and unjustified use of such measures. The report urges the Member States to maintain a 'communal' approach to these issues which would enable the measures in question to be applied more harmoniously in the Community context and reduce the number of actions taken against the Community by bringing sustained pressure to bear at political and technical level on WTO members which intend to apply trade defence measures, while constantly endeavouring to raise awareness of the issues involved. MEP in the committee say, however, that 'communal' action must not be used as an excuse to support unfair trading practices by individual Member States.
The committee recommends that the Community refrain from granting preferential treatment to trade partners which are not acting in accordance with WTO rules and case-law, if such action is damaging Community industry. MEPs in the committee also urge the Commission to take the principle of reciprocity into account when dealing with trade defence cases involving those trade partners.
Finally, the International Trade Committee stresses that, if the new rules on international trade are to win public support, they must be applied transparently and consistently, in compliance with the principle of the rule of law, both within and outside the Community.
