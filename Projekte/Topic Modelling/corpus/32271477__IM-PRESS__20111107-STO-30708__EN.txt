This year's winner was UK entry " Europe and Me ", an online lifestyle magazine by and for young Europeans. A short film from Greece - " Balkans Beyond Borders " - came second and third prize went to the Spanish theatrical venture " Escena Erasmus Project ". The prizes were awarded in Aachen in May. During the ceremony Buzek commended the winning project as an extremely original one that shows the different aspects of what being European means.
The most European Brit
Mathew Shearman, who represented this year's winning project, joked, "I am probably the most European British person I know and now I have an award to prove it."
The "'Europe and Me' online lifestyle magazine looks at Europe as a state of mind not as a set of institutions. We have editors in seven countries and authors from all over Europe, all of whom are volunteers. Our aim in the long run is to become a learning platform for young journalists, where they can discover a new approach to cover European affairs," he said.
Learning about each other in the Balkans
"Balkans Beyond Borders" aims to foster cooperation between young people in the Balkans. "We live so close to each other, yet we know so little about each other," explained Konstantinos Ntantinos.
"This award recognizes our efforts and gives credibility to our project. I would encourage other young people that if they have a good idea they be dedicated and make it come true."
Arts in the spotlight
The "Escena Erasmus Project" is a cultural exchange programme for Erasmus students. "The centre of our project is the University of Valencia, a very popular destination for Erasmus students. Each year more than 300 students want to take part in our theatre project. We have even won national theatre prizes with our performances," said José Daniel Tormo Martínez , representing the group in Brussels.
