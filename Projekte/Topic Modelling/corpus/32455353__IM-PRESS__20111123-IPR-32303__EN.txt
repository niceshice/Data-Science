The EU-ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly took place in Lomé, Togo, from 19 to 23 November.
Consequences of indebtedness for development financing in ACP countries
MEPs and their ACP counterparts called on the EU and ACP countries to work out a model for a debt offsetting mechanism for indebted countries. This could take the form of debt cancellation, rescheduling, or repayment. One-third of ACP countries are either in debt distress or at a high risk of getting into it. The resolution underlines that any additional funds obtained through debt cancellation should be allocated to increase social expenditure in areas such as basic education, primary health care and HIV/AIDS.
Food and security crisis in the Horn of Africa, especially Somalia
The Assembly was "acutely concerned at the unprecedented and still deteriorating humanitarian situation in the Horn of Africa", and "regarded the famine death toll in as unacceptable”. MEPs and ACP MPs urged the international community to redouble its efforts to deal with the emergency, meet the growing humanitarian needs and prevent any further worsening of the situation. The food and security crisis currently affects 13.3 million people, and tens of thousands of people, more than half of them children, are already dead.
Consequences of the Arab Spring for Sub-Saharan Africa
In a resolution on the "Arab Spring", the Assembly condemned the violence in Syria and Egypt and voiced concern that Libyan weapons in al-Qaeda hands could pose a threat to the entire world. The Assembly called on the EU, the African Union and the UN to help tackle the humanitarian crisis affecting hundreds of thousands of refugees who have fled Libya to neighbouring Tunisia, Egypt, Niger, Mali and Chad and to Europe.
Impact of the Lisbon Treaty on ACP-EU partnership
The Assembly believes the EU and ACP countries should take advantage of the changes brought about by the Lisbon Treaty, such as the establishment of the European External Action Service and the European Parliament's new powers, to take their partnership "beyond the donor-recipient relationship and into a partner-partner relationship". To this end, the Assembly urged the partners to define areas of common interest, such as energy, climate change and migration.
Integration of disabled people in developing countries
The majority of disabled people live in developing countries, where they cannot find jobs to escape poverty. Furthermore, the risk of becoming disabled increases with the degree of poverty. MEPs and their ACP counterparts underlined that the social and economic costs of excluding the disabled are enormous. The resolution stresses the need for positive discrimination and to combat stereotypes so as to strengthen social inclusion.
Debates without resolution
Among other topics, the Assembly discussed the democratic transition in Togo with Prime Minister Gilbert Fossoun Houngbo and Togolese ministers. Members welcomed the progress made by Togo so far, and urged Togo to continue the reforms.
The ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly brings together elected representatives of the European Union and the ACP countries, that is MEPs and MPs, from 78 states that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement, which is the basis for ACP-EU development cooperation. JPA meetings are held twice a year, alternately in an EU and an ACP country. The previous session was held in Budapest, Hungary. The next JPA will take place in Denmark on 28 to 30 May 2012.
