This session of the European Parliament will be remembered for personality and policy. It saw a vote by Members to give Commission President Barroso a new mandate as well as the inaugural speech of EP President Jerzy Buzek. The week also saw Members vote to support draft legislation to extend aid for buying up butter and skimmed milk powder until February to help the beleaguered milk industry. Enclosed are 10 things we learned this week and a photo slideshow of some of the week's events.
1. Barroso gets a new mandate
MEPs elected José Manuel Barroso as President of the European Commission for the next five years. Now he has to propose his team of Commissioners to Parliament.
2. Buzek: 'a dream come true'
Parliament’s first president from behind the Iron Curtain spoke of the remarkable journey of former Soviet bloc countries and announced his top priorities: financial crisis, energy, Europe’s place in the world and a livelier, more open Parliament.
3. G20: the world needs 'a complete revision of the financial system'
MEPs demanded stricter rules and more supervision of global financial system ahead of G20 summit next week in Pittsburgh.
4. Visa-free travel is likely for the Balkans...but not for all.
Easier travel is coming for some in the Balkans. The Commission wants to scrap visas for citizens of Serbia, Montenegro or the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, but not yet for Bosnians and Albanians. Some MEPs worry about opening up new divisions. The Commission will re-open the dossier with the two missing countries soon next year.
5. SWIFT: MEPs see data protection at risk?
MEPs concerned by the possible privacy violations implied by the use of SWIFT banking data by US authorities. A new agreement on data protection between EU and USA will be negotiated next year.
6. It happened again this summer: forest fires
Parliament wants better EU coordination to deal with fires and support for reforestation and rebuilding in areas hit by fires this summer. They also condemned property speculation in fire affected areas.
7. Milk crisis: the EU should do more
MEPs approved draft legislation to extend aid for buying up butter and skimmed milk powder, which was due to end in August, to at least February next year and that the aid should also apply to cheese.
The Commission should immediately introduce measures to stimulate demand for dairy products, along the lines of the funding for the school milk programme say MEPs. They also want an EU Dairy Fund of EUR 600 million to be set up to aid producer organisations and cooperatives and to support farm modernisation.
Members also said the Commission should improve price transparency within the food supply chain, according to the resolution, which was approved by 462 votes in favour, 78 against and 40 abstentions. A code of conduct governing the relations between producers and retailers was also proposed by MEPs. In many EU countries, prices paid by consumers are still high despite the fall in producer prices.
8. 2010 should bring a budget for recovery
The Commission says economic recovery is at the heart of its spending plans for 2010, with 45% of EU budget to go into growth and employment measures. Have they got it right? MEPs will decide on the budget by the end of the year.
9. Lithuanian gay law preoccupies MEPs
Many Members were concerned about fundamental rights, warning against "all forms of discrimination" reacting to the draft Lithuanian law that would prohibit 'dissemination to minors of information whereby homosexual, bisexual or polygamous relations are promoted'.
10. Plans are afoot for more secure, cleaner energy: Nabucco and Desertec
MEPs looked at two huge projects for secure, sustainable, competitive energy supply in Europe: The Nabucco pipeline to import gas from Caspian Sea and Desertec to provide solar energy from the Sahara.
