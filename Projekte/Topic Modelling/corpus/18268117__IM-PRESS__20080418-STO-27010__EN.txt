Rising global food prices were debated by MEPs Tuesday
Attention focused on spiralling food prices around the world in Tuesday's plenary sitting. MEPs grappled with the complexity of the problem and called for a global response. Parliament also signed off the accounts of all the EU's institutions and agencies for the financial year 2006, debated a proposal to make the satellite navigation system Galileo operational by 2013 and voted on measures to curb organ shortage and trafficking.
Parliament grants budget discharge for 2006
The European Parliament on Tuesday granted the discharge for all the EU's institutions and agencies for the 2006 financial year, thereby giving overall endorsement of the management of EU funds in that year.
Numerous recommendations for improvement were nevertheless made: on the key issue of control of structural funds, MEPs called for better supervision through a new reporting mechanism to Parliament. MEPs also backed plans to introduce a formal statute for MEPsâ€™ assistants by 2009.
Food prices spread alarm: MEPs call for urgent response
In Tuesday afternoon's debate on rising food prices MEPs stressed the problem's global dimension and the combination of causes behind it - namely climate change, lack of supply, higher demand and consumption and record oil prices. The House was united in a call for an urgent global response. Among issues raised in the debate were bio fuels and the role played by financial speculation in the current crisis.
The rising price of food in particular has triggered global alarm. World food prices have risen 45 % in the last nine months and there are serious shortages of rice, wheat and maize. In many parts of the world - Haiti, Egypt, the Philippines and parts of West Africa there have been protests and riots against the soaring prices of food products.
Speaking in the debate the leader of the right of centre EPP-ED group Joseph Daul stressed the need for agricultural reform, noting that "only a worldwide solution will work". He also pointed the finger at financial speculators, who he described as "playing with people's lives".
For the Socialist PSE group Martin Schulz called for greater control over world economic systems, raising the issue of large investment funds taking over the food sector: "We should not allow the financial system to contribute to hunger!" he told MEPs.
For the Liberals Graham Watson stressed the multiple reasons for of high food prices. In his view "rather than using the bio fuels as a scapegoat we must move to end agricultural protectionism and export restrictions."
Call for moratorium on biofuels
Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf for the Greens said the EU is the world's biggest importer of food and foodstuff; and criticised the dumping of European food products on developing countries markets destroying any viability for agriculture in those countries. He said that "agrifuels will not be the panacea for everything, but we have to ensure that the waste stuff can be converted into energy".
Luisa Morgantini (GUE/NGL) welcomed a UN proposal for a "five year moratorium on bio fuels".
The European Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid - Louis Michel, warned MEPs of "economic, political and social destabilisation" and stressed the need for both humanitarian action and longer term structural measures.
MEPs will vote on a resolution on food prices when they meet in Strasbourg between 19-22 May.
MEPs back Galileo as technological boost for Europe
MEPs also discussed a possible deal with Council which that would make Galileo, the European satellite radio navigation system, operational by 2013.
MEPs have supported the implementation of Galileo right from the beginning said parliament's rapporteur Etelka Barsi-Pataky (EPP-ED). She said it will help new technologies, entrepreneurship and job creation. The EU will invest 3.4 billion euro for Galileo's deployment phase (2008-2013). In a vote on Wednesday MEPs endorsed this report.
EU-wide organ donation card supported
MEPs adopted a report on measures, including a European donor card and reinforced cooperation between countries to curb organ shortages and trafficking. Cypriot MEP Mr Adamos Adamou (GUE/NGL) acted as the rapporteur on the issue. He told the House that "every day 10 people die, waiting for an organ donation". Referring to organ trafficking he said that "all we know is that the rich tourists of the West exploit the financial needs of persons that emanate from the poorer countries".
Posting of workers: ECJ, China's growing influence
On Tuesday evening there was also a debate on the implementation of the posting of workers directive following the judgements of the European Court of Justice, and the effects of China's growing presence in Africa a policy a report says helps perpetuate human rights violations.
