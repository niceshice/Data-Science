The indefinite postponement of the second round of Guinea's presidential elections is a cause for "very grave concern" said Belgian MEP Louis Michel and his Zambian counterpart David Matongo, who co-chair the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, at a meeting of the Assembly's Bureau in Brussels on Tuesday.
The Bureau urges the Guinean authorities to fix a new date at the earliest opportunity for the second round, originally scheduled for Sunday 19 September 2010.
This postponement risks aggravating political tensions in the West African country, especially since the first round, on 27 June, was said to comply with international standards, notes the Bureau.
