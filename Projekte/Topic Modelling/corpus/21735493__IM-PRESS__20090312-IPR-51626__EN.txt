Parliament adopted a resolution on the situation in Sri Lanka calling for an immediate ceasefire by the Sri Lankan army and the Liberation Tamil Tigers of Ealam (LTTE) in order to allow the civilian population to leave the combat zone. MEPs condemn the LTTEâ€™s violence and intimidation which are preventing civilians from leaving the conflict area.
It is estimated that 170 000 civilians who are trapped in the battle zone between the Sri Lankan army and the forces of the LTTE without access to the most basic aid.
Parliament condemns the attacks on civilians as documented by the International Crisis Group.
The House is concerned about reports of serious overcrowding and poor conditions in the refugee camps established by the Sri Lankan Government.
MEPs call on both sides to respect international humanitarian law and to protect and assist the civilian population in the combat zone, as well as in the safe zone.
Unhindered access
The House demands that international and national humanitarian organisations, as well as journalists, be granted full and unhindered access to the combat zone and to the refugee camps.
Parliament calls on the Sri Lankan Government to cooperate with countries and aid organisations that are willing and able to evacuate civilians.
