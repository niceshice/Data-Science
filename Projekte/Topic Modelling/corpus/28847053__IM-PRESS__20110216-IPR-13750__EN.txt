The European Parliament decided on Wednesday to postpone the vote on the proposed "single permit" allowing people to live and work in the EU. The vote on the draft directive, which was expected to take place this week, was rescheduled due to procedural issues relating to the interpretation of the EP's Rules of Procedure.
On Monday the Constitutional Affairs Committee backed the Employment Committee's interpretation of the EP Rules of Procedure. Consequently, the two-month deadline has been extended and the vote postponed to a forthcoming plenary session.
