Newsletter Making cross-border inheritances easier
Avoiding legal disputes and lengthy procedures to settle inheritances where the laws of more than one EU country may apply is the aim of draft legislation to be debated Monday and voted Tuesday.
Gender pay gap and quotas for women in boardrooms and political bodies
Proposals to reduce the gender pay gap and use quotas to boost the numbers of women on company boards and in political bodies will be debated Monday and voted Tuesday. Legislation to ensure a gender balance on boards moved one step closer when the Commission opened a public consultation on 5 March.
Iceland, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina
MEPs will debate and vote Wednesday on the progress of Iceland, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina towards joining the EU.
MEPs to scrutinise Dutch discriminatory web site
EU citizens' basic rights, such as free movement and non-discrimination, will be under the spotlight on Tuesday afternoon, in a debate sparked by the launch of a web site inviting Dutch citizens to post complaints about central and Eastern Europeans living in The Netherlands. A resolution will be put to the vote on Thursday.
Conclusions of the 1-2 March European Council
On Tuesday Parliament holds its regular post-European Council debriefing with Council President Herman Van Rompuy and Commission President José Manuel Barroso. The 1-2 March summit was hailed by Parliament's President Martin Schulz as the first in two years not to have focused exclusively on crisis management, but many MEPs are nonetheless likely to criticize its pledges to restore growth as too timid.
Budget 2013: MEPs to reiterate payments shortfall worries
EU governments should not "artificially" cut the 2013 budget by ignoring real budget needs and outstanding payments, MEPs will warn EU Member States in a budget guidelines vote on Wednesday. MEPs mean to ensure that Member States do not again place the European Commission in a position where it can no longer honour its contractual obligations, as they did in December last year.
Chocolate without exploiting child workers
As the world's leading consumer of chocolate, the EU must see that children are not exploited as forced labour to harvest the cocoa beans to make it, say MEPs in a draft resolution to be voted on Wednesday. Parliament also votes Wednesday on whether to give its assent to the new International Cocoa Agreement, which says signatories should seek to improve cocoa industry working conditions.

Opening: remembering victims of Fukushima, terrorism, and Syria's uprising
A minute's silence in remembrance of the Fukushima disaster The 11 March 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster was caused by humans, and could have been prevented, said EP President Martin Schulz in his plenary opening address. Marking the 11 March remembrance day for victims of terrorism, he condemned "cowardly, anonymous" attacks like that on Madrid in 2004. He also condemned the killing of thousands of Syrians by President Bashar al-Assad's "brutal dictatorship" since the start of the Arab Spring.
Though the earthquake and tsunami in Japan were tragic natural disasters, the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl was caused by humans. Fukushima could have been prevented, said Mr Schulz.
On 11 March 2011, Japan was devastated by a triple catastrophe a massive earthquake, then a 20-metre high tsunami which destroyed a 400 km-long coastal strip, and a day later, the explosion at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, which led to a reactor meltdown.
The President voiced Parliament's sympathy for the 19,000 people who lost their lives, the thousands more who lost family members and friends, and the many thousands more who, fleeing radiation, had lost their homes forever. He praised the courage of the anonymous workers who risked their lives to get the damaged reactors under control.
Turning to Europe, Mr Schulz noted that 30% of its energy comes from nuclear power. Although energy decisions are a matter for each member state, power grids are interconnected, and nuclear safety concerns us all, he said.
Mr Schulz reiterated his demand that any of the 130 EU nuclear power plants that fails the current stress tests should immediately be removed from the network.
Terrorism
Marking the 11 March remembrance day for victims of terrorism, Mr Schulz voiced Parliament's solidarity with all victims of terrorism, from Bologna to London, and in particular the families and friends of the 200 killed and several thousand injured in the 11 March 2004 terrorist attack on Madrid.
He condemned these "disgusting, cowardly, anonymous" attacks and said that everything possible should be done to support their victims.
Syria
Mr Schulz also remembered the thousands of people killed in the "open war" unleashed by the "brutal dictatorship" of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad against its own people since the start of the Arab spring. "The bloodshed is not stopping," he added, urging Mr al-Assad to at least allow humanitarian assistance to reach civilians.
The EU's foreign policy high representative and international society should also back the efforts of Kofi Annan and the UN Security Council to ensure that "the right things are done" he added.
A minute's silence was held for all these victims.
Incoming MEPs
Mr Schulz noted that the legal affairs committee had approved the credentials of Emer Costello (S&D, IE), Phil Bennion (ALDE, UK) and Nikos Chrysogelos (Greens/EFA, EL).
Mr Schulz also noted that Roger Helmer had switched from the ECR to the EFD group.
Agenda changes
Tuesday 13 March
A report by Mrs Lichtenberger on the waiver of immunity of Mrs Morvai is now included in Tuesday's voting time.
The Quisthoudt-Rowohl report on common commercial policy will be taken with full debate as the last item of Tuesday's night sitting, after the Quisthoudt-Rowohl report on autonomous tariff quota for imports of high-quality beef. It will be included in Wednesday's voting time.

Making cross-border inheritances easier
Document MEPs pass law with 589 votes in favour, 21 against, and 79 abstentions Law expected to prevent legal conflicts over inheritances Choice to apply law from place of origin or habitual residence An Italian woman who marries a German and settles in Belgium would have the option of choosing whether her heirs inherit under Italian or Belgian law, under new rules backed by the Parliament on Tuesday.
The new regulation aims to make it easier to settle inheritances and avoid disputes when someone dies and leaves a will and the legal systems of more than one Member State are involved. According to Kurt Lechner (EPP, DE), who steered the proposal through Parliament, cross-border inheritances make up 10% of all successions in the EU, i.e. almost 450,000 a year, involving some €123 billion. EU-wide criteria would it make clear which Member State's legal system applies when an inheritance could arguably be subject to the laws of more than one, thus avoiding costly legal disputes and cutting red tape for heirs. The new regulation would also introduce a European Certificate of Succession designed to make the legal position clearer for the person who draws up the will and to safeguard the rights of heirs, as well as other parties, such as creditors. A choice of two new rules The proposed regulation would introduce two new principles for dealing with international successions. First, if someone dies in a Member State that is not their home country, their succession would generally be dealt with under the law of the Member State where they last had their place of "habitual residence", by the courts and authorities of that Member State. This would avoid conflicts that could otherwise arise if several courts in different Member States declared themselves competent. Second, the person drawing up a will would also have the option of having his or her will read under the law of his or her Member State of origin. This would give EU citizens a new right, which MEPs believe would be a major improvement, as it would allow anyone living abroad within the EU to retain close links with their home country and ensure that specific national provisions, such as rules governing gifts made during a lifetime, are respected. In the example of the Italian woman who marries a German and lives for a long time in Belgium, Belgium is more likely to be her centre of interests. Without the proposed regulation, there could be a conflict between the courts in her heirs' home country (Germany), in her own country (Italy), and in the country where she has property (Belgium). European Certificate of Succession The European Certificate of Succession would be created to ensure that the heirs, creditors and competent authorities apply the terms of the succession directly, using swifter and cheaper procedures. Use of this certificate would not be mandatory. No impact on national law The new regulation would have no impact on the situation of people who remain resident in their home country. It would not change national laws governing succession, property, or tax arrangement and it would not introduce any harmonisation of national laws. The regulation would not apply in UK and Ireland, as their respective governments decided to exercise their right to opt out, nor in Denmark, as it is always the case for these matters. The Lechner report was passed with 589 votes in favour, 21against and 79 abstentions. Next steps Parliament and Council have reached an informal agreement that will have now to be confirmed for the legislation to enter into force.

Parliament calls for quotas to step up women's participation in politics and business
Group photo of political leaders Legislation to reduce the gender pay gap and quotas to boost the numbers of women on company boards and in political bodies are among several proposals approved by Parliament on Tuesday to tackle gender inequality in the EU.
Parliament reiterates its call for new laws introducing quotas to boost female representation in corporate boards, should national measures fail to achieve this, in a resolution drafted by Sophia in't Veld (ALDE, NL), on Parliament's 2011 annual report on gender equality in the EU.
In a debate on Monday, Ms in't Veld urged Parliament and the European Commission to take tough initiatives to tackle inequality. "Spontaneously it ain't gonna happen: colleagues, it is now time to act!" she said.
In the same debate, Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding, said proposals to this end may be put forward later this year. Parliament last called for such mandatory measures in a July 2011 resolution.
Corporate board quotas
To boost the numbers of women in executive positions in EU companies, the in't Veld resolution calls on the European Commission to assess national measures taken so far, and if it finds them inadequate, to table a legislative proposal to introduce quotas to step up corporate board quotas to 30% by 2015 and 40% by 2020.
Electoral quotas
Electoral quotas have been successfully introduced in France, Spain, Belgium, Slovenian, Portugal and Poland, and should therefore be considered as an option, notes the in't Veld resolution.
To ensure gender parity in political decision making, including electoral lists and top EU positions, binding measures and sanctions are needed at national and EU level, says a second resolution, drafted by Sirpa Pietikäinen (EPP, FI) and also voted on Tuesday.
To improve the gender balance within the EU institutions, MEPs urge national also governments to propose, after the 2014 European elections, both a woman and a man as their candidates for European Commissioner.
While 35% of MEPs are now women, average female representation across the EU's national parliaments remains unchanged at 24%. Only 23 % of ministers are women.
EU equal pay target
The gender pay gap has closed only slightly in recent years. On average, women in the EU still earn 17.5% less than men, only 12% of executives are women, and only 3% chair a board.
The in't Veld resolution calls for an EU equal pay target to reduce the gender pay gap by 10% in each EU country. The Pietikäinen one calls for regular monitoring of measures taken, and binding corrective action where the targets set are not met.)
Paid maternity leave
MEPs also call on the Council to move forward on the Maternity Leave Directive proposal to ensure paid leave across the EU.
The resolution on the annual report on gender equality was passed with 361 votes in favour, 268 against and 70 abstentions. The resolution on women's representation in political decision making was passed with 508 votes in favour, 124 against and 49 abstentions.

Debate about EU summit: growth, tax evasion and Schengen
Debate The need to tackle tax evasion at a time when the EU shows signs of turning the corner on the debt crisis was highlighted during Tuesday's Plenary debate on the EU summit of 1-2 March. The debate, in the presence of European Council and Commission presidents Herman Van Rompuy and José Manuel Barroso, also focussed on the situation in Greece and recent French comments on a possible renegotiation of the Schengen agreement on passport free travel.
Council President Herman Van Rompuy called the last EU summit meeting a positive step forward towards further fiscal consolidation and economic stability. Although the biggest fiscal stimulus since the 1930s had been an efficient tool for short term recovery, overcoming the crisis would require creating trust in the long-term structure of the European economy. "That's why the rules agreed in the new treaty of Stability Coordination and Governance signed at this European Council are so important," he said. Mr Van Rompuy also stressed the importance of investing. EC President José Manuel Barroso said the EU was not yet out of the crisis but may be on a path towards renewed stability and growth. He added that the €1 trillion lost to tax evasion in the EU each year could have solved many problems. On Greece, Mr Barroso announced that the Commission would soon present a plan on growth and jobs for that country. He aksi said austerity needed to be complemented by growth and called on governments to implement the EU 2020 strategy: "Member states must close the gap between declarations and policies." Joseph Daul , the French chair of the Christian-Democrat group, said that although signing the new fiscal treaty was an achievement, it would be more important to actually apply it. The new fiscal treaty, six pack and two pack are useful tools, but some member states have been slow to apply the rules they have signed up to. "Citizens today need jobs, young people need jobs, our economy needs growth not just now but all the way to the future," he said. Hannes Swoboda , the Austrian chair of the Social-Democrat group, concentrated on Schengen, saying: "I would like to have some words about what president Sarkozy said about temporally suspending the EU's document-free travel agreement. Should we have to show our passports to visit Strasbourg? Is this the way that things have to be? Surely, it is not." He also commented on the crisis: "We react too late to youth unemployment. It is scandalous that we have people emigrating to Argentina. It is a scandalous too that we have citizens working for a one thousand euros or less." Guy Verhofstadt , the Belgian chair of the Liberal-Democrat group, was sceptical about whether the recent summit was a turning point of the crisis in Europe. "Do you really believe that the fiscal compact will put an end to the mess," he said. Mr Verhofstadt also criticised European Central Bank president Mario Draghi for "printing new money", which he described as an "insufficient solution to the crisis" and called for a redemption fund mutualising debt over 60% of GDP, which he considered as the only true long-term measure to stabilise the economy. Combating tax evasion and tax havens by forcing banks to declare all deposits by EU citizens if they are to operate in the EU, as the US has done, was proposed by the French Green co-chair Daniel Cohn-Bendit . He also called for a "triple golden rule" in the EU that will cover not only budgetary discipline but will also be "a social and environmental golden rule". Martin Callanan , the British chair of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, disputed that the worst of the crisis was over. "Europe is not ok, the economic weakness is the problem and the new (fiscal) treaty is simply irrelevant." He also talked of a "collapse in living standards and levels of unemployment unseen in Europe since the 1930s. Measures are required so that Greece can organise an orderly default and leave the euro." Paul Murphy, Irish member of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, said: "Trying to meet fiscal deficit targets means €5.7 billion in extra cuts and taxes in Ireland and more than ten billion across the euro zone. It doesn’t mean growth, it means more unemployed, more crisis, worse public services and worse work conditions." Nigel Farage, co-chair of the Europe of the freedom and democracy Group, said he was shocked by talk about how positive the last Council meeting was. "You are determined but delusional, to keep the euro propped up". When commenting on Greece and talk of a potential third bailout, he said: "It is going to crucify Greece."

MEPs call for more money and support for higher education in Europe
Student ©Belga/EPA MEPs adopted on 13 March a report calling for more funds and support to encourage student mobility and make European higher education more attractive and competitive. This would involve reinforcing the Bologna Process, which aims to create a European Higher Education Area by making quality standards and degrees more compatible throughout the continent. In addition to the EU, the Process is also implemented in 20 other European countries.
The Bologna Process required European universities to revise and reorganise their teaching activities in a three-cycle system (Bachelor, Master, and Doctorate) and also assist in creating wealth. If is to contribute to achieving the goals of the EU's 2020 strategy for kick-starting Europe's economy, then more efforts will need to be made by universities, member states and the European institutions. Italian Social-Democrat Luigi Berlinguer, the author of the report,stressed in the text: "It is a requirement for a full integration of the internal EU market and an indispensable tool for tackling the challenge provided by the economic and financial crisis." Universities need financial support from member states and the EU to support their efforts to change and develop their education practices. Member states have to strengthen the funding system, while it is also necessary to develop new funding mechanisms. In addition more needs to be done to harmonise academic standards, promote mobility and employability, remove administrative obstacle, improve the mutual recognition of qualifications (through the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System), and promote social cohesion.

Parliament pays tribute to the victims of tragic road accident in Switzerland
A minute's silence for the victims of the bus accident in Switzerland On 13 March 28 people, including 22 children, died in a tragic road accident in Switzerland. The European Parliament observed a minute's silence for the victims on Wednesday afternoon. "I extend our deepest sympathy to the families of the victims and to all those affected by this disaster," said EP President Martin Schulz.
A Belgian coach was carrying children on their way back from holiday when the crash happened. "Everyone of us in this House - if we have children or if we remember our own relationship with our parents - can certainly comprehend what it means to send your children on a holiday trip and see coffins come home," said Mr Schulz before asking members to observe a minute's silence.

EP to vote on agreement governing the bittersweet trade in cocoa
Infograph about cocoa Cocoa is not only essential to creating delicious chocolate, but it is also a commodity millions of people depend upon for their income. On 14 March the European Parliament voted in favour of the 2010 International Cocoa Agreement which aims to improve market transparency and strengthen co-operation between exporting and importing countries. MEPs will also approved a separate resolution to condemn the use of child labour for cocoa production.
The agreement
The International Cocoa Agreement, which replaces the existing 2001 agreement, will be in force for 10 years and can be extended twice for additional two-year periods. The new agreement sets objectives for a sustainable cocoa economy, recognises the need for fair cocoa prices and equitable returns, promotes quality and develops food safety procedures. It also aims to strengthen the role of the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO). The organisation collects, processes and distributes market data and works together with industry and NGOs. ICCO members represent 85% of world cocoa production and more than 60% of consumption. Exporters and importers hold identical shares in its highest governing body, with the EU as a single party holding over half of importing members' votes.
Following the Lisbon Treaty, Parliament must grant consent before the agreement is concluded by the Council. The international trade committee, which is the committee responsible, recommended approving the agreement.
Child labour concerns
The use of child labour for cocoa production remains a concern, which is why there was a resolution on it. Portuguese Social-Democrat Vital Moreira, who is responsible for steering the agreement through Parliament, commented: "Child labour is not an isolated issue. It is the result of tradition, poverty, a lack of alternatives for generating income, a lack of opportunities for young people outside of school, rigid community structures and prevailing attitudes, inadequate legal protection of children's rights and a failure to put in place mandatory public education for all children. An adequate framework to address the root causes of child labour will therefore have to consider all of these issues."
Cocoa - a global affair
Some 90% of world cocoa is cultivated by 5.5 million smallholders with the help of an additional 14 million rural workers. Outdated farming techniques are still widespread in cocoa cultivation. African countries account for about 70% of cocoa production while Latin America and Asia together with Oceania are each responsible for 13% of cocoa crops. The European chocolate industry, which processes cocoa and makes chocolate, is the largest one in the world. The EU imports more than 80% of its cocoa from West Africa.

Iceland, former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina
Enlargement vote In three resolutions adopted by an overwhelming majority on Wednesday, Parliament says it wants Iceland to join the EU and it calls for a date for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to start accession talks. However, it is concerned at the limited progress of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) as a potential candidate.
Iceland Parliament notes the political divisions in Iceland over EU membership but hopes that it will join. Iceland is one of Europe’s oldest democracies and MEPs are pleased with its progress towards meeting EU standards. "Progress is visible," said rapporteur Cristian Dan Preda (EPP, RO) in the debate. "This last year has shown that the discussions have gained momentum." MEPs point out that the Icesave dispute has not been settled but say it should not hold up Iceland’s membership. They point out that the EU and Iceland still disagree on mackerel fishing quotas and on whale-hunting, which is banned in the EU. They also call for more progress in tackling state intervention, particularly in the banking, energy, air and transport sectors. Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Parliament wants this country, an EU candidate since 2005, to be given a date to start accession negotiations. It says the Council’s failure to set one is causing "legitimate frustration and dissatisfaction" in public opinion. "This is a country which belongs inside the EU and accession talks must start without delay", said rapporteur Richard Howitt (S&D, UK). MEPs regret that its accession prospects are blocked by the name dispute with Greece. They welcome Enlargement Commissioner Štefan Füle's initiative to launch an informal "high-level accession dialogue" on 15 March to boost reform momentum. They welcome the election of the new parliament and swift formation of the coalition government but are worried about fundamental freedoms, pointing for example to media concentration. Corruption is a "serious concern", says Parliament, though it is pleased with the efforts to tackle it. Parliament also wants greater efforts to combat the segregation of children from different ethnic groups in the education system. The country’s economic performance is good, it says, though unemployment and poverty levels remain high. Bosnia and Herzegovina Parliament is concerned at the limited progress of BiH with the reforms needed for potential EU membership. It says its future lies in the EU but insists that it can only have a prospect of EU membership as a single, sovereign and united country, with the state powers needed to meet EU accession criteria. MEPs welcome the formation of the new state government, hoping that this will spur the necessary constitutional and other reforms. Rapporteur Doris Pack (EPP, DE) said: "In six weeks, more has happened than we could have expected in Bosnia and Herzegovina." Now that the EU has reinforced its presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Parliament wonders about the international community's future role. It invites it "to consider the necessity of, and find solutions" to "pave the way for the dissolution of the Office of the High Representative (OHR)." Parliament is concerned about extremist threats in the Western Balkans region and calls on the BiH authorities "to combat extremism, religious hatred and violence in close collaboration with the international community".

Win-win ending to the "hormone beef trade war"
Charolais cows EU concessions to help put an end to the 20-year hormone beef trade war with the USA and Canada were approved by MEPs on Wednesday. The deal allows the EU to keep its ban on imports of hormone-treated beef, in return for increasing its quota for imports of high-quality beef from the US and Canada.
The deal would raise the EU's quality beef import quota to 48,200 tonnes. The US and Canada, for their part, have already suspended duties, imposed in retaliation against the EU's hormone-treated beef ban, on previously "blacklisted" products originating in 26 EU Member States (all except the UK), worth over US $250 million at today's prices.
"This long-lasting trading dispute will end today. This is a win-win resolution for the EU. Parliament has taken a step that will enable the EU agricultural industry to plan ahead again and that will strengthen transatlantic trade links," said rapporteur Godelieve Quisthoudt-Rowohl (EPP, DE).
Parliament made no substantive amendments to the text proposed by the European Commission. The deal, approved at the first reading with 650 votes in favour, 11 against and 11 abstentions, had already been informally backed by the Council. The increase in EU import quotas will take effect from August 2012.
History of a trade war
The beef hormone dispute has affected transatlantic trade relations since 1988 when the EU, concerned for the health of its citizens, banned imports of beef treated with certain growth-promoting hormones. In 1996, the US and Canada, which were worst affected by the ban, challenged it under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) dispute settlement system and were subsequently authorised to impose trade sanctions on EU produce worth respectively US $ 116.8 million and C $ 11.3 million a year.
These duties hampered EU exports and led to a loss of market share for EU producers. The EU products affected by the sanctions included bovine and swine meat products, Roquefort cheese, chocolate, juices, jams and fresh truffles.
A win-win solution
In May 2009, an agreement negotiated by the European Commission and the US government provided for a phased reduction in US sanctions on EU products and a gradual increase in the EU tariff quota for high-quality, hormone-free beef. The US has already agreed to lift its sanctions against the EU products in May 2011.
The main beneficiaries of the lifting of the US and Canadian sanctions are Italy, with produce worth over US $99 million, Poland, (US $25 million), Greece and Ireland (US $24 million each), Germany and Denmark (US $19 million each), France (US $13 million) and Spain (US $9 million).

Mafias: special committee to probe organised crime in the EU
Suspect A special parliamentary committee on organised crime, corruption and money laundering was created by Parliament on Wednesday. It has a year to investigate infiltration of the EU's legal economy, public administration and financial systems by organised crime, including mafias, and propose ways to fight it.
Misappropriation of public funds, infiltration of the public sector, and contamination of the legal economy and financial system are some of the key threats posed by criminal organisations in the EU.
Within the time limit of its mandate, the committee is to evaluate the extent of organised crime's impact on the EU economy and society and recommend legislative and other measures to enable the EU to respond to these threats at international, European and national levels.
The decision to set up the committee was approved by a show of hands.
"The establishment of the anti-mafia committee at the European Parliament represents a real turning point in the history of European Union policies. Finally, Europe is sending a clear message to criminal organisations and gangs: the institutions are not going to back down in the face of organised crime" said Sonia Alfano (ALDE, IT), Parliament's rapporteur on this issue.
MEPs to hear judges, victims, civil society bodies and institutions
The committee, with a one-year mandate extendable once, will have the power to make on site visits and hold hearings with EU and national institutions from all over the world.
MEPs may invite representatives of business and civil society and victims organisations, and officials, including judges, involved in the daily fight against organised crime, corruption and money laundering.
Next steps
Parliament will vote on the committee's composition at the 28-29 March mini-plenary in Brussels. The special committee is to start work by the end of April this year.

From prevention to treatment: EP calls for an EU-wide strategy for diabetes
Diabetes ©Belga/Science A drop of blood suffices for the diagnosis, but many people are still unaware they have diabetes. It is the leading cause of heart attacks and other serious illnesses and affects 32 million Europeans between the ages of 20-79. This number is expected to grow due to an ageing European population. To improve prevention, diagnosis and treatment, the EP is calling for an EU-wide diabetes strategy.
Telling numbers Every year 325,000 deaths in the EU are attributed to diabetes, which eauqls one every two minutes. About 10% of people between 20-79 in the EU live with diabetes and this is expected to go up to 16.6% by 2030. Half of all people with diabetes are not aware that they have it. In most member states, diabetes is responsible for 10% of healthcare expenditure. Prevention is key There are two types of diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is caused by an auto-immune reaction when the body's defence system attacks the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas and the body can no longer produce the insulin it needs. However, the most common form of diabetes is type 2 diabetes. This means the body is able to produce insulin but it is either not sufficient or the body is not responding to its effects. The main risk factors are smoking, a poor diet, a lack of physical activity, and alcohol consumption. It can be prevented by leading a health lifestyle. Aims of the strategy On 14 March MEPs adopted with an overwhelming majority a non-legislative report calling for an EU-wide diabetes strategy. The strategy should focus on prevention, diagnosis, treatment and research. National diabetes programmes should be created and there should be coordination and funding of European diabetes research, especially to identify the risk factors for Type 1 diabetes.

MEPs urge Dutch government to condemn PVV website
Confused young man working on laptop The Dutch government should condemn a Dutch Freedom Party (PVV) website which invites complaints against citizens from Central and Eastern Europe living in the Netherlands, because it openly incites discrimination, said the European Parliament on Thursday.
In a resolution a passed by a show of hands, MEPs say the Dutch authorities should investigate whether the invitation to post complaints about Central and Eastern Europeans living in the Netherlands is an incitement to hatred and discrimination, and that EU government leaders should formally condemn it as undermining the rights of EU workers. MEPs also contend that the site goes against the fundamental European values of human dignity, freedom, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights and is an "ill-intentioned initiative" aimed at creating divisions within the society and obtaining political gains. Parliament specifically urges the Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, to condemn and distance himself from this "deplorable" initiative. The Dutch government should not turn a blind eye to PVV policies that contradict basic EU values, say MEPs. The resolution says that the Dutch government's commitment to European integration has significantly decreased in recent years, as shown by its position on issues such as enlarging the Schengen area and the free movement of workers. Positive economic impact Workers from the countries that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007 have had a positive impact on EU Member States' economies and have made a significant contribution to sustained economic growth in the EU, underlines the European Parliament. MEPs also stress that many citizens, political parties, the media, employers and civil society leaders have condemned the PVV site, launching counter-initiatives such as a website on which Dutch citizens can report positive experiences with Polish people. No to xenophobic behaviour The European Parliament calls on the European Commission and the Council to do their utmost to stop the spread of xenophobic attitudes like those expressed on this website and to ensure that the EU Framework Decision on Racism and Xenophobia is properly enforced in all EU countries.

Russia: MEPs want Mr Putin to engage in dialogue with protestors
Man voting in Russia The European Parliament has condemned shortcomings and irregularities in the preparation and conduct of Russia's 4 March presidential elections. In a resolution passed on Thursday, it called on Vladimir Putin to tone down his rhetoric against the protestors and begin a "sincere dialogue" with them.
MEPs point to the continuing concern "about developments in Russia with regard to human rights and commonly agreed democratic principles, electoral rules and procedures". Irregularities in the electoral process Parliament regrets that the choice of voters was limited in the recent elections and demands comprehensive analyses of "all irregularities with a view to strengthening democratic rules for future elections". It points out that international election observers from the OSCE/Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) and the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, found that the presidential elections were "deeply skewed in favour of one candidate through shortcomings in the registration process, unequal media coverage and the use of State resources in favour of one candidate". Call for reform MEPs ask President Medvedev to turn words into deeds and guarantee that the necessary reforms to the political system are made. They also "expect that the new Russian President Vladimir Putin will be ready to take them forward, including the much needed simplification of rules governing the registration of political parties". The resolution urges all sides to take the opportunity, before the new president is inaugurated, to decide on a comprehensive reform package. It expects president-elect Putin as well as political parties represented in the State Duma to start a dialogue with the protestors and opposition on the country's future. Finally, Parliament encourages Russian democratic opposition groups to unite more closely around political reforms, thus affording Russian citizens a credible alternative.

MEPs discuss how to protect water resources
6th World Water Forum ©Belga/MaxPPP Only 60% of the world population has access to clean drinking water and it also remains a problem in parts of Europe. On 12 March the 6th World Water Forum, the largest international event dedicated to water issues, starts in Marseille to discuss how to achieve water security. On Thursday MEPs will debate how the EU can use water management to fight poverty and mitigate the effects of climate change. This will be followed by a parliamentary resolution.
Access to water remains a problem MEPs discussed Europe's water challenges with experts on 8 March during a workshop organised by the EP's environment committee. A recent study on the current state and future challenge of Europe's waters was also presented. Austrian Christian-Democrat Richard Seeber, who chaired the workshop on 8 March, said: "Water is at the heart of all life and all economic development in the world." He stressed that only 2.5% of all water in the world is usable. Portuguese Social Democrat Edite Estrela, who like Mr Seeber is a member of the environment committee, commented: "The EU already has a significant policy framework, but much work remains to be done." She said more and more Europeans are victims of draught and water scarcity due to climate change, the energy sector and agriculture. This year the EU is reviewing existing water legislation to see if there is any need to update and reinforce it, for example because of new kinds of water pollutants such as antibiotics and hormones. World Water Forum Since 1997 the Word Water Forum has attracted thousands of stakeholders every three years to discuss, debate or share best practices in order to find concrete solutions for water issues. This year 25,000 participants are expected to take part. This includes 140 ministerial delegations and representatives from more than 180 countries. The goal of this year's forum is to put water high on the political agenda. The right to water, which was recognised by 189 states at the UN two years ago, must be guaranteed for everyone and implemented everywhere. 6th World Water Forum in Marseille Parliamentary question on World Water Forum Motion for resolution on World Water Forum Video of the workshop on Europe's water challenges
Chris Davies: "setting targets drives change"
Chris Davies Member states such as Poland have become concerned that if the Commission's roadmap for moving to a low carbon economy becomes official policy, it will lead to factories relocating outside the EU. On 15 March a report broadly supporting it was approved in Plenary. We spoke to British Liberal Democrat Chris Davies who is guiding the plan through Parliament. He understands why some might be uneasy but points out that "setting targets drives change".
The Commission adopted its "Roadmap for moving to a competitive low carbon economy in 2050" in March 2011, which aims to reduce domestic carbon emissions by 80 to 95%. However when EU environment ministers met on 9 March, Poland rejected the road map saying the EU should wait for other countries to take similar measures first. What does a low carbon economy look like? Last week I went to a construction site in Carlisle where they were building a new supermarket. They were drilling holes of about 56 meters deep for pipes that will be used to pump water in. The water would be naturally heated by passage through the earth at that depth. It is a very simple system that will provide heat for the supermarket and save more than €100,000 a year. It will pay itself back in five years. That is a beautiful example of applying the principles of the low carbon economy. It's the low carbon agenda that has changed mindsets and adjusted priorities. It is astonishing to see how many savings businesses have made by improving their energy efficiency, which could been made decades ago. In your report you claim that Europe must develop a sense of urgency or it will risk losing the race to maintain a competitive economy. How do you suggest to speed up the decision making process? In the case of Europe, this is a very difficult matter. We are a series of advanced democracies that promote public participation which slows down the decision-making process. In China, for instance, the government set a number of goals for factories to reduce their energy consumption and those that did not meet the targets simply had to stop production by the next month. We do not have this kind of command and control system to push things on. There has to be a greater sense of urgency. In order to turn the oil tanker, we need to slow down and put it into reverse as quickly as possible. What is the impact of current crisis and austerity measures on the willingness of countries such as Poland to commit to carbon-reduction milestones? Climate issues are not a great priority at the moment. There is a danger in this. We need to make these changes and there have to be international agreements. A power station will be operational for 20-30 years, so to reach energy efficiency goals set for 2050 you have to start planning now. You should give a clear framework to investors who are planning to make a return over that long period of time. Investors won't believe you if you allow for power stations to be built now and in five years' time you apply new regulations to reduce CO2 emissions. It will make the EU look bad The Polish environment minister had some very fair arguments on 9 March. We boast about the fact that we will reduce our emissions by more than 20% by 2020, but this will be achieved by exporting some of our carbon-emitting manufacturing, while still importing the products. So in global terms, we make no difference at all. However, setting targets does drive change. You see this in the car industry more than anywhere else. We set targets to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars. Four years after the legislation came into force the car industry is ahead of the game by reducing CO2 levels every year. Everyone buying a new car gets more kilometres per litre of fuel and the prices have come down. So for consumers it is a win/win situation..

10 things you should know about the March plenary
Four photos showing a minute's silence for the victims of the Swiss bus accident, Schulz speech on Fukushima, one of the entrances to the Parliament building, Van Rompuy arrives at the Chamber How to get out of the economic slump? This was the question MEPs tried to answer in their plenary debate on the recent European Council that formalised the deal on the EU fiscal pact. They also approved the creation of a special committee on organised crime and gave a green light to the agreement between the EU and US ending the so-called beef war.
At the opening of the plenary on Monday, a minute's silence was held for the victims of the Syrian repression, of terrorism in Europe and of the Fukushima nuclear disaster one year ago. Parliament also observed a minute's silence on Wednesday for the 28 victims, mainly children, of the bus accident in Switzerland. President Martin Schulz expressed the "deepest sympathy to the families of the victims and to all those affected by this disaster". Together with European Council and Commission presidents Herman Van Rompuy and José Manuel Barroso, MEPs debated on Tuesday the conclusions of the EU summit of 1-2 March that focused on solving the economic crisis. The Parliament approved the creation of a special committee on organised crime , corruption and money laundering, with a mandate of one year on Wednesday. The "anti-mafia committee" will look into how organised crime has infiltrated the EU's economy, public administration and financial systems On Wednesday, Parliament approved a deal allowing the EU to keep its ban on imports of hormone-treated beef , in return for increasing its quota for imports of high-quality beef from the US and Canada. Diabetes -related problems already account for about 10% of EU healthcare expenditure so the EU must develop a dedicated strategy focusing on prevention and early diagnosis of this growing problem, MEPs said in a resolution Wednesday. On Thursday MEPs condemned a recently launched website in the Netherlands that invites people to post complaints about migrants from Central and Eastern Europe and called on the Dutch government to speak out against it. MEPs condemned shortcomings and irregularities in the preparation and execution of Russia's presidential elections on 4 March and called on the winner of the elections Vladimir Putin to begin a "sincere dialogue" with protesters. The legal and societal implications of raids by Israeli forces on Palestinian TV stations in the occupied Palestinian territories were in the spotlight during the EP's human rights debate on Thursday afternoon After Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and LinkedIn, the European Parliament is now on Foursquare so why not check in.
