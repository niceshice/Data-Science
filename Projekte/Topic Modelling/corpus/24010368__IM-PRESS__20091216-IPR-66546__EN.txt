Elections likely to be observed
In the first half of 2010, MEPs are considering sending delegations to observe parliamentary elections in Tajikistan (28 February), presidential elections in Togo (28 February), presidential elections in Ivory Coast (February/March); presidential and parliamentary elections in Sudan (11 April), parliamentary elections in Sri Lanka (April, date not yet fixed), and parliamentary elections in Ethiopia (23 May).
MEPs are also likely to observe parliamentary elections in Afghanistan and presidential and parliamentary elections in Palestine (dates not yet fixed).
Before undertaking electoral missions, MEPs will have to sign a code of conduct requiring them, inter alia, to "maintain strict political impartiality" and "to refrain from making comments to the public or to the media" before election day.
