Parliament's role in the EU accession of Bulgaria and Romania

2006-09-22 - 07:04
The EU Accession Treaty of Bulgaria and Romania, signed in 2005, was ratified by all Member States before entering into force on 1 January 2007. The accession of Bulgaria (18 MEPs) and Romania (35) increased the total number of MEPs from 732 to 785 for a 27-Member State EU. For the next legislative term, after the June 2009 elections, Romania and Bulgaria will have 33 and 17 MEPs respectively, and the total number of MEPs will be reduced to 736.
In a resolution adopted in April 2005, Parliament gave its assent for Bulgaria and Romania to join the EU on 1 January 2007, but also pointed out that they had work to do in order to be ready by that date. With a 27-member EU just around the corner, MEPs stressed the need for both sides to stick to their commitments. Bulgaria and Romania must pursue their reforms, including those of their judicial systems, even after accession.
The negotiations to bring Romania and Bulgaria into the EU on 1 January 2007 were completed in December 2004. The accession treaty, signed on 25 April 2005, lays down conditions similar to those for the ten new Member States that joined on 1 May 2004, apart from an extra clause that would have allowed for their accession to be postponed if they had clearly not been ready.
Romania had lodged its membership application on 22 June 1995 and Bulgaria on 14 December 1995.

Parliament's assent
Parliament's assent is required for any new country to join the EU (Article 49 of the EU Treaty). This power is only exercised at the final stage, after the negotiations have been concluded. The EP followed the accession process for Romania and Bulgaria closely and adopted several resolutions in favour of their joining on 1 January 2007, provided all the conditions were met.
Parliament also asked to be involved in any decision on the use of the postponement clause. In a letter to EP President Josep Borrell on 7 April 2005, Commission President Jos√© Manuel Barroso promised that "the Commission will consider with the utmost care Parliament's position on any use of the postponement clause before publishing any recommendation on this matter, so as to involve Parliament fully in any decision to postpone." The Commission was also questioned by MEPs about the application of the safeguard clauses (see below) in April 2006.
MEPs gave a formal reaction to the Commission's September assessment in reports drawn up by Geoffrey Van Orden (EPP-ED, UK) and Pierre Moscovici (PES, FR) for Bulgaria and Romania respectively. These were put to the vote in the Foreign Affairs Committee in early October 2006, ahead of a plenary debate at the session of 11-12 October 2006 in Brussels.
In addition, Parliament plays a key role to play in the financial aspects of accession, as it is one of the two arms of the EU budgetary authority.
Number of MEPs after the accession of Bulgaria and Romania
From 26 September 2005, 35 observer MEPs from Romania and 18 from Bulgaria sat at the European Parliament.
Following the two countries' accession on 1 January 2007, the observers became full MEPs (under Article 21.1 of the Accession Treaty). Bulgaria and Romania must nevertheless hold European elections before the end of 2007 (Article 21.2). Bulgaria did so, on 20 May. The total number of Members of the European Parliament will be 785.
For the next legislative term, after the elections of June 2009, Romania and Bulgaria will have 33 and 17 MEPs respectively, and the total number of MEPs will be reduced to 736.
EP resolutions
On 13 April 2005, by large majorities, Parliament gave its assent to the accession of Bulgaria (522 votes in favour, 70 against, 69 abstentions) and Romania (497 in favour, 93 against, 71 abstentions).
In a resolution adopted on 14 June 2006, following previous monitoring reports by the Commission on the progress made by Bulgaria and Romania, Parliament stated that it "notes with satisfaction that the Commission maintains the deadline for both countries to enter the European Union by 1 January 2007 on condition that the necessary measures are taken to resolve the outstanding problems". MEPs noted the "considerable progress" made by Bulgaria and Romania to meet the EU's political and economic criteria and to gradually adopt and implement the acquis communautaire .
However, they highlighted the need for both countries to "consolidate" reform of their justice systems and to "demonstrate further substantive results in the fight against corruption, with special emphasis on the fight against organised crime in the case of Bulgaria".
The resolution also "stresses the utmost important of taking all the measures required to combat the trafficking of human beings and to substantially enhance the degree of social inclusion of Roma communities" .
Joint parliamentary committees
In addition to the work done in its plenary sessions and by its Foreign Affairs Committee, Parliament worked on enlargement issues through its joint parliamentary committees with the two candidate countries.
The EU-Bulgaria JPC, chaired by Catherine Guy-Quint (PES, FR) adopted a statement at a meeting in Brussels on 13 and 14 September 2006 reiterating "its strong support for the accession of Bulgaria to the European Union on 1 January 2007" and saying it believed that the "energetic actions of the Bulgarian authorities in recent months towards meeting the requirements for achieving full EU membership will be fully reflected" in the Commission's report of 26 September.
The final meeting of the EU-Romania JPC, chaired by Guido Podesta (EPP-ED, IT), was held in Bucharest on 28 to 30 May 2006.
Safeguard and postponement clauses
If, despite all the efforts made - including the assistance provided by the EU under the Phare, Sapard (agriculture) and ISPA (environment and transport) programmes - serious difficulties still arise, the Commission may deploy a range of safeguard clauses . Articles 37 and 38 of the protocol to the accession treaty state that, in the fields of the economy, internal market or justice and home affairs, safeguard clauses can be used up to three years after these countries have joined the EU. Similar clauses were included in the accession treaties of the ten latest Member States.
For Bulgaria and Romania, an extra clause was added allowing for accession to be postponed by one year if either country is clearly not ready for accession (Article 39 of the protocol to the accession treaty). Under this article the Commission was entitled to recommend to the Council, before the accession treaties entered into force, that accession be postponed until 1 January 2008. Postponement would have required the Council's unanimous agreement.
For Romania, Annex IX of the Act of Accession laid down specific commitments (listed in Article 39 of the protocol) regarding competition and justice and home affairs. To have postponed accession by one year on these grounds would have required a majority vote in the Council.
