The European Parliament adopted, at second reading, the report drafted by Inger SEGELSTRÖM (PES, SE) on the Council common position for the specific programme "Drug prevention and information" as part of the General programme "Fundamental Rights and Justice" 2007 -2013. Parliament approved the Council common position as soon as was possible in order to ensure the timely launch of the specific programme.
The House expects the Commission to confirm in plenary its commitment to transmit the necessary information relating to the draft annual work programmes to Parliament. There will be a reference to the statement of the Commission in the legislative resolution as there has been a reference to the Commission's statement in the legislative resolution concerning the specific programme "Civil Justice" adopted by Parliament on 11 July 2007.
The general objectives of the programme are re-defined: to prevent and reduce drug use, dependence and drug related harms; to contribute to the improvement of information on drug use; to support the implementation of the EU Drugs Strategy.
It should be noted that the financial envelope for the implementation of the instrument from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013 is €21.35m.
