The role and power of the European Parliament's political parties
2006-03-21 - 12:59
Jo Leinen, (PSE, DE), for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, will be tabling a non-binding report on the status of European political parties. The report discusses the current structural conditions for political parties in the European Union and makes suggestions as to how to promote the stability and financial autonomy of these parties.
The Political Parties of the European Parliament
The report discusses the functions and powers of the "European political parties " of the European Parliament. These political parties are supra-national groups of MEPs formed around common policies rather than a common nationality.
The report opens with the concept that political parties play a vital role in the procedure of promoting democracy within the EU - they are fundamental to the endorsement of the values of "freedom, tolerance, solidarity and gender equality". It remarks that they are the key element in the linking of public opinion with the actions of the European institutions. Correspondingly, it advises that political parties must "take on a further role than that of umbrella organisations and become active proponents of European policy options " in order to minimise the "gulf" between the European public and its institutions.
Bearing in mind the important role that political parties play, the committee makes some suggestions as to how to strengthen the stability and autonomy of political parties as tools of representation. It notes the importance for any organisation - whether profit making or not - to have financial stability so that it can make long-term decisions with economic certainty. In correlation with this notion, the report notes that such financial stability is lacking for European political parties in that the grants given to them are subject to change every year, discouraging any proper financial self-management. In so doing, the current structures make the parties "financially highly dependent on the European Parliament ", diminishing their power of autonomy. As do the limitations applied to the transfer of funds between the five budget categories. The disparity between the treatment of parties and that of institutions is also noted.
In view of their critique, the committee advises some changes, including the following: a change in the timing of the payment of funds so that they are "in tune with the way the recipients work" ; funding plans prepared for several years should be agreed; the political parties must be put in the position to make financial decisions in view of long-term planning; the regulations should allow for higher amounts of money to be transferred between the different budget categories; and an increase in the financial support that parties receive should be realised.

Criteria for EU peace-keeping operations, especially in the Democratic Republic of Congo
2006-03-21 - 12:59
Parliament will debate and adopt a resolution on the criteria for EU peace-keeping operations, especially in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
The EU's Peacekeeping Force
In June 2000, at the European Council in Feira, the EU committed itself to creating an international peacekeeping staff composed of civilian personnel, as part of the project of developing an independent "European Security and Defence Policy" (ESDP). The force was formed in order to contribute to the management of international crisis situations. It gave the EU the capacity to draw on up to 5,000 personnel from police forces from across Europe. The Council will also make a statement on the necessary policies that should be made regarding the development of this force.
Peace-keeping for the Democratic Republic of Congo
In February, Ambassador Gerhard Pfanzelter , Permanent Representative of Austria to the United Nations, made a statement on behalf of the European Union, declaring the EU's determination "to contribute to DRC stability". He said that "the EU is considering, in close co-operation with the UN, how best to provide support to the UN in this endeavour". Nevertheless, after a two-day meeting held in Innsbruck, Austria, on the 6-7 March this year, the European Defence Ministers disagreed on the nature of a peace-keeping mission to the Congo, but decided that Javier Solana , EU High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), should meet with the DCR's leadership to discuss what type of operation is desired, if at all.
Situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo
Since 1960, when the Congo obtained its independence from Belgium, it has been plagued by conflict. The peacekeeping troops, currently in the country, mainly come from other developing countries, thus it is hoped by some that an EU force would help to deter any potential disruptions in the upcoming Congolese elections.

Energy
Security of energy supply in the European Union
2006-03-21 - 12:59
Giles CHICHESTER (EPP-ED, UK), Chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy will be asking questions to both the Commission and Council on security of energy supply in the European Union. MEPs are also due to adopt a resolution on this subject.
EU energy consumption is projected to grow by 22% in the period 1990 to 2020. In particular, EU consumption of oil is increasing despite a 50% decrease in energy intensity of oil appliances and the use of renewable fuels in industry, transport, heating and the generation of electricity. EU gas demand has risen markedly in both absolute terms and relative to other fuels, where its market share has risen over ten years from 18% to 24% in 2003 and is projected to be 27% by 2020. EU import dependency is projected to rise to 71% by 2030, and there will be an increased demand from third countries which will compete for the energy required by EU Member States.
What will the Commission do in order to react appropriately to recent developments on the growing energy demand on the one hand, and to geopolitical strategic and diplomatic stability risks, on the other? Furthermore, how can the EU's future independent supply of energy (oil and gas needs) be secured?
Having regard to sustainability, competitiveness and security of supply, what other sources of energy can be used if the oil and gas supplies decrease or if supply is vulnerable to geopolitical risks?
What is the Commission's opinion on the impact of post-2012 Kyoto negotiations on the security of energy supply and the competitiveness of the EU (Lisbon objectives)? Giles CHICHESTER EPP-ED UK Oral questions to Commission and Council

Revision of the Cotonou Agreement and setting the amount for the 10th European Development Fund
2006-03-21 - 12:59
Margrietus van den Berg (PES, NL), on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, will be asking the Council questions on the revision of the Cotonou Agreement and setting of the amount for the 10th European Development Fund. MEPs are also due to adopt a resolution on this subject.
The amended Cotonou Agreement did not contain, unlike the previous agreements, provisions concerning the financial framework. Agreement could not be reached on this point, partly owing to the fact that the debate on the budgetisation of the EDF and on the financial perspectives was still open. Nevertheless, ACP countries agreed to sign the revised agreement because Annex 1(a) stipulated that " the European Union will maintain its aid effort to ACP Countries at least at the same level as that of the 9th EDF, not including balances; to this should be added, based on Community estimates, the effects of inflation, growth within the European Union, and enlargement to 10 new Member States ".
In its working document, the Commission calculated initially for the 10th EDF an amount of €24.948 million but the European Council, meeting in Brussels on 15-16 December 2005, agreed on € 22,682 million in current prices for the period 2008-2013 (six years). Some clarification is needed before the Parliament can give its assent to the amended Cotonou agreement.
Could the Council explain the reason for this sizeable reduction, which seems in contradiction with the political commitments made in 2005 to increase substantially official development aid (European Council in June 2005 and the G8 Summit in July)? In particular, could the Council indicate whether or not the average yearly individual contribution of each of the 15 "old" Member States in constant prices 2004 has been maintained, and possibly increased, in relation to the 9th EDF?
Could the Council further clarify the question of the contribution of Romania and Bulgaria, which were made part of the contribution key between Member States by the December 2005 European Council, whereas their contribution ought to be additional once their EU membership becomes effective? On the other hand, how is the enlargement of the ACP partnership to East Timor taken into consideration?
Finally, could the Council give indications on the future breakdown of the 10th EDF? In particular:
Should the financial protocol guiding the 10th EDF include a specific amount for financing the development dimension of EPAs or will this funding be additional to the 10th EDF?
Should the 10th EDF include a programming document on the African Union? Margrietus VAN DEN BERG PES NL Oral question to Council

Development impact of Economic Partnership Agreements
2006-03-21 - 12:59
"If long-term sustainable development is to be the overall outcome of Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs)" then the Commission must "act in accordance with the Cotonou objective of poverty eradication". This is the view expressed in a non-binding report on the development impact of Economic Partnership Agreements put forward by Luisa Morgantini (GUE-NGL, IT) for the Committee on Development and Cooperation.
Between 1975 and 2000, the trade relationship between EU countries and those of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) was determined by the rules set out in the Lomé Conventions. This agreement granted ACP countries unilateral preferential (non-reciprocal) access to the European market. However, in September 2002, the ACP countries began to negotiate Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) that would make their trade-relationships with the EU compatible with the guidelines of the WTO. These guidelines stipulate that a trade relationship should be reciprocal: "countries at different levels of development can enter into a reciprocal free trade agreement providing that the liberalisation of substantially all trade occurs within a reasonable length of time”. Thus, under the proposed EPAs, the new trade relationship between the EU and ACP countries is reciprocal and aimed at the progressive liberalisation of trade.
The report opens by expressing the understanding that there is a necessity to make compatible the rules governing ACP-EU trade relations with those of the WTO. Nevertheless, it urges the Commission to ensure that the goals of liberalisation do not take precedence over the goals of development. In correlation with this, it advises caution when considering the liberalisation of public sectors in the ACP countries. Moreover, "too rapid a reciprocal trade liberalisation between the EU and the ACP could have a negative impact on vulnerable ACP economies and States" . With a view to promoting economic integration, trade and investment, the committee encourages the development of EPAs that concentrate on the principle of asymmetry in favour of ACP regions.
The committee laments the lack of progress that there has been in the pursuit of "development-friendly" policies so far, and calls on the Commission to "pursue ambitious new initiatives to stabilise the price of commodities which are essential to developing countries" and to "support mechanisms for producers to be involved and participate in price determination where feasible" . It also asserts the need for effective trade-related assistance and for an improvement in the infrastructure of ACP countries. The report calls for greater transparency in the negotiations, a real public debate on the issues, and a deeper involvement of other sectors. On the part of the ACP countries, it asks their governments to work within a framework of democracy, responsibility and good governance.
The main objective of the Cotonou Agreement was to reduce and eventually eradicate poverty along with the nurturing of sustainable development. The concept of "reciprocity" represents "a major shift in the EU's approach to development and trade policies with ACP partners". Members believe however, that the EU and ACP countries combined represent a substantial number, "large enough to demand eventual reforms of the WTO rules ".

Social policy
Demographic challenges and solidarity between the generations
2006-03-21 - 12:59
In view of the Commission's Green Paper "Confronting demographic change: a new solidarity between the generations" the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs adopted a report on 22 February 2006 concerning the new challenges in the wake of an ageing European population. The report, drafted by Philip Bushill-Matthews (EPP-ED, UK) suggests an increase in employment and the prioritisation of family needs are the key issues for MEPs to consider.
Particularly with regard to the Lisbon Agenda and its aim to increase economic growth, the demographic change has to be taken seriously - the Commission notes that "never in history has there been economic growth without population growth" and considers there to be three basic trends concerning demographic change: a continuing increase in longevity; a continuing growth in the number of workers over 60; and continuing low birth rates. The committee's report points out that although demographic change demands adequate political measures, it "should not just be treated as a problem, but also represents a positive challenge to societies to engage those in all age groups and to offer opportunities which previously did not exist".
MEPs in the committee emphasise that these three basic trends require certain political measures to be taken: a better promotion of families; further attention to be paid to the importance of a balanced immigration policy; and the encouragement of older people to participate in the labour market. Further measures should be taken in order to foster a reconcilability of work and family life: "The improvement of work-life balance for individuals should be a perpetual priority for governments." The report suggests that this could be achieved, for example, through more flexible working hours, higher equality in the work-place, family-friendly tax policies and better accessibility to childcare and dependent-care facilities. They call upon the Member States to take such measures into account, and adapt their policies accordingly.
MEPs believe that solidarity between the generations means not only a better integration of young people - e.g. regarding their access to the labour market - but also the promotion of access to lifelong education and training for people of all ages. In this context "the emphasis should be to encourage and enable people to work longer."
The committee calls on the Commission to underline the importance of demographic change and its challenges by understanding it as a horizontal task, with a view to mainstreaming it as an issue in all the Union's activities. Furthermore, the Commission should decide on a more intensive exchange of views at the Spring Summit. Appropriate studies, analyses and a peer review relating to demographic change and its impact on society should be carried out within the context of the Community programme PROGRESS.
MEPs in the committee underline the fact that numerous issues relating to demographic change in society fall exclusively within the sphere of competence of the Member States and that therefore there is no general Community competence for establishing European rules in this area.

Agriculture
Promotion of crops for non-food purposes
2006-03-21 - 12:59
Neil Parish (EPP-ED, UK), for the Agriculture Committee, will be tabling an own-initiative report on the promotion of crops for non-food purposes. The report was passed unanimously in the Committee, and suggests a long list of ways in which the Commission should further the production of crops for non-food purposes.
MEPs in the committee stress " the importance of making the targets in Directive 2003/30/EC on biofuels obligatory ," and asked the Commission to promote " the production of energy crops in the form of suitable plants ," such as willows and poplars for the purpose of generating heat.
In order to ensure that a healthy European renewable energy sector can spring forth, Members argued for " an internal market for renewable energy sources ," and called on the Commission " to consider putting into place qualified market access arrangements for biofuel imports from third countries such as Brazil ," in order to further European development in this area.
MEPs int the committee also ask for " measures to encourage the production of speciality chemicals from agricultural raw material ," and suggested that the Commission " make the use of...plant-based products compulsory ," in the plastic, lubricant and insulation industry, " in the event that they form good alternatives to conventional products. " They also underline the potential in producing pharmaceutical crops.
The committee is interested in " organising publicity campaigns targeting the young generation, in particular, in whom an ecological awareness must be cultivated ."
Nevertheless, MEPs in the committee also highlight " that, in the longer term, non-food crops must become economically viable ," and called for " the use of existing control mechanisms, such as cross-compliance to ensure that biodiversity is not compromised by bio-based production of fuel, energy and materials ."

Consumers
EU consumer protection programme
2006-03-21 - 12:59
To promote the interests of consumers, reads the EC's founding Treaty, the Community is to take "measures which support, supplement and monitor the policy pursued by the Member States." The Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee is calling for €233 million worth of such measures -- by supporting the 2007-2013 programme of Community action in the field of consumer protection.
Following the debate, which took place in Strasbourg on 16 March 2006, on a report on consumer protection, MEPs will vote on this subject.
The programme's objectives, to be achieved with a range of Community-financed actions and instruments, are fourfold: to aim for a better understanding of consumers and markets; to ensure better consumer protection regulation and greater participation of civil society stakeholders; to guarantee better enforcement, monitoring and redress; and lastly, to help produce better educated, responsible consumers.
The Commission had originally suggested a single action programme for health and consumer protection in hopes of achieving more synergies between the two areas. MEPs, however, did not agree with this approach and the Parliament decided last year to separate the programme into two. See the link below for details of the separate report on the health programme.
Given that MEPs decided to split the joint programme, it was only logical that they would do the same with its budget. 233 million euros, out of a total budget of €1,203 million, was consequently earmarked for consumer protection. However, with a view to the pending negotiations between Parliament and the Council over the 2007-2013 financial framework, the committee decided not to introduce any other amendments relating to the cost of the action programme.
The committee voted to decrease some ceilings for Community financing for " actions in pursuit of the aims and objectives " of the programme -- from 60 to 50 percent. It also approved an amendment defining the eligibility criteria for bodies and legal persons seeking to qualify for such financing, all while expanding the list of actions eligible for Community support. Lastly, MEPs in the committee are proposing amendments to strengthen assistance to consumer organisations in the new Member States.
