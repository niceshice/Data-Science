In a statement at the opening of this week's Strasbourg session, EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering warmly welcomed the release on 2 July of Ingrid Betancourt and other hostages who were being held by guerrillas in Colombia.
After reading out the names of all the hostages, who were liberated "thanks to a successful military operation by the Colombian army", Mr Pöttering said "The European Parliament shares their happiness and that of their loved ones. ( …) Their release clearly indicates that one must never give up hope."
He said he had congratulated President Uribe on the success of the military rescue operation and had stressed "that democracy should never give in to terrorism and that the rule of law must prevail".
He had also invited Ingrid Betancourt to visit the European Parliament when she has recovered. Lastly, the President issued "an appeal to FARC and to all terrorist groups to lay down their arms and to cease all irrational violence which does not lead anywhere. They should liberate all hostages and accept the offers of the Colombian authorities to seek peace".
