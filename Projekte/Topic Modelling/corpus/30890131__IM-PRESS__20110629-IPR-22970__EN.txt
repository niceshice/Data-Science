Reactions of EP President Jerzy Buzek and Budgets Committee chair Alain Lamassoure to the proposals on future budgets (2014-2020) and new own resources as presented by Commission President Jos√© Manuel Barroso and Budgets Commissioner Janusz Lewandowski in the European Parliament Thursday evening.
President Buzek: "The Commission's proposal on the long-term budget for the EU is an intelligent starting point for negotiations. The next MFF will be one of the most important in the EU's history. It will set the direction for the Union at an exceptional time when the European project is under pressure from the sovereign debt crisis and from external instability.
A system of real own resources would be fairer, more transparent, simpler and equitable. We should also see an end to rebates, exceptions and correction mechanisms that have accumulated within the current system."
Alain Lamassoure: "No salvation today without budgetary austerity, no growth tomorrow without investing in the future. I am glad to see that the Commission's proposals reflect the main priorities of the European Parliament: spend better where Europe is necessary to save money elsewhere. And above all, finding new, modern and European sources of income so that the national contributions can be lowered".
Mr Lamassoure added that "a debate of such importance should not be held in the secrecy of ministerial meetings behind closed doors. This should become the subject of as wide a possible public debate, including a conference with full involvement of national parliaments. In the coming days we will make an effort toward realising this".
