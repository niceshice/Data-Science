14 December is the deadline for applications As the year draws to a close we are taking the opportunity to start a new project and invite you to submit your photos for publication on this website. We'll have a different topic each month and the best one will be published along with an article. The first topic is "Resolutions for 2009".
This project allows you to be our "guest photographer" and have your work published on each of the 22 separate language pages of the site.
The entries should have a European theme and the deadline for photos and entry forms is 14 December. The winner will be announced on 19 December.
One photographer will be invited, with their camera, to the July session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg. This will be the first sitting of the newly elected chamber after the European elections in June.
For more details on the rules, photo requirements and copyright conditions please read the rules below.
Please send your photo and application form to the following address. The application form will soon be available in 22 languages.
