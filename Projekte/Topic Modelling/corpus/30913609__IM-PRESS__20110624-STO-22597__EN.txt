LGBT people still face discrimination Â©BELGA/EPA/I.Langsdon UK Socialist Michael Cashman urged the EU to suspend relations with "those countries that do not respect human rights" during a hearing on Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Intersex rights in the world 30 June. The co-chair of the intergroup on LGBT rights stressed that sexual minorities are the sons and daughters of ordinary people but are made extraordinary by the preoccupations of countries.
Discrimination against LGBT people is still commonplace in many parts of the world, and according to the International Lesbian and Gay Association, no EU country can claim to provide full legal equality for LGBT people. In addition there are significant variations across Europe.
"There are still five states in the world with the death penalty for LGBT and 76 where homosexuality is criminalised," said co-chair of the intergroup, Austrian Green Ulrike Lunacek . "So there is still a lot of courage to be taken and things to be done to give everybody the freedom to love...without fear and with equal rights."
Argentine transsexual human rights activist Mauro Cabral said EU countries have a key role in ensuring that human rights are not violated. He was optimistic. "We are seeing a historical moment in which the LGBTI style of life is no longer seen as a disease."
Public hearings, like this one organised by the Human Rights Sub-Committee are a way for the European Parliament to promote awareness and discussion on LGBTI rights, in addition to resolutions condemning human rights violations and raising questions. Ms Lunacek also welcomed EP President Jerzy Buzek's support for the international day against homophobia.
