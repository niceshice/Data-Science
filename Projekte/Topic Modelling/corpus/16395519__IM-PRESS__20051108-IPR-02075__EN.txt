Sakharov Prize winners - fighting for freedom of expression
The Cuban opposition movement "Damas de Blanco", the Nigerian human rights lawyer Hauwa Ibrahim and the international organisation "Reporters without Borders" are this year's joint winners of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. The Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament decided to award the prize to all three short-listed candidates.
The Sakharov Prize will be presented to the winners in Strasbourg at midday on Wednesday 14 December during the plenary session of the European Parliament.
Three winners:
"Women in White" holds peaceful demonstrations every Sunday against the detention of their husbands and sons who are imprisoned for political reasons. Hauwa Ibrahim is a lawyer defending women who face being stoned to death for adultery and young people who face amputation for theft under Islamic Sharia law. Reporters without Borders campaigns for press freedom throughout the world and their defence of journalists against censorship and harassment.
Nigerian lawyer Hauwa Ibrahim has built up what can only be described as an extraordinary practice: defending women condemned to death by stoning. In those Nigerian states which apply Islamic law, adultery carries the death penalty. A Muslim herself, Hauwa Ibrahim works tirelessly - voluntarily and despite intimidation - to fight religious fundamentalism. Will the provisions of her own country’s Constitution and international support be enough to win the battle? She believes so.
"Reporters Without Borders" - a group that campaigns for press freedom around the world - is the third and final nominee for Parliament's Sakharov prize for freedom of thought. The group, celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, defends and supports journalists and others working in the media from persecution and censorship.
They call themselves the "Ladies in White" ("Damas de blanco") and were formed in early 2004. By wearing white to symbolise innocence and purity they echo Argentine women in the 1970's who used a similar tactic to demand information about their missing children during the military dictatorship. The arrest of political dissidents in 2003 continues to cast a shadow over Cuba. Most of the 75 men detained are still in jail - imprisoned for criticising the lack of political freedom in the country. However, the attempt to silence them has failed as their wives and daughters have brought international attention to the issue by their peaceful protests every Sunday.
Frequently Asked Questions
1. Who was Andrei Sakharov?
The prize is named after Andrei Sakharov (1921-1989), who achieved world renown as one of the inventors of the Soviet hydrogen bomb. Realizing the dangers of its potential abuse, he spent a lot of time raising awareness of the nuclear arms race. In the Soviet Union he was seen as a dissident and was jailed for his beliefs. He also founded a committee to defend human rights and the victims of political trials in 1970. Five years later his efforts for international peace won him the Nobel Prize.
2. So, who picks the winner?
Every year MEPs and Political Groups in the Parliament nominate candidates - from this list the Committee on Foreign Affairs select three "finalists". The chairpersons of the political groups (the "Conference of Presidents") then select a winner. The prize is formally awarded by the President of the Parliament during the December Plenary session. The winner receives a certificate and a cheque for 50,000 euros.
3. What is the purpose of the award?
By rewarding outstanding achievements in the fight to protect freedom of thought and expression against intolerance, fanaticism and hatred, the Parliament seeks to raise awareness about human rights. This reflects its conviction that fundamental freedoms include not only the right to life and physical integrity, but also freedom of expression and of the press, two of the most effective means of fighting oppression and key yardsticks by which to judge whether a society is democratic and open.
4. Who won last year?
The 2004 Sakharov prize went to the Belarusian Association of Journalists for their work in promoting press freedom in Belarus. The first award was in 1988 and was awarded jointly to Nelson Mandela and Anatoli Marchenko.
