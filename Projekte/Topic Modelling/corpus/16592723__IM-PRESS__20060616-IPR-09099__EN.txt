The ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly is calling for arms and oil embargoes on Sudan, in reaction to the “unprecedented genocide” in Darfur. Delegates also asked the UN Security Council to take targeted action against those responsible for human rights abuses and other atrocities, without adding to the suffering of the population of Sudan.
Meeting in Vienna, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA), composed of representatives of the 78 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries (ACP) and 78 MEPs, drew to a close on Thursday with the adoption of a resolution “welcoming the call by Kofi Annan for a technical assessment mission to be sent to Darfur in preparation for the UN force with the aim of establishing safe conditions for and protecting the population, which has been the victim of an unprecedented genocide, in accordance with Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.”
The Assembly stresses the extreme gravity of the findings of the third report of the International Criminal Court Prosecutor which states that some of the groups involved in the commission of crimes in Darfur did so “with specific genocidal intent”.
Avian Influenza
The JPA also adopted an urgent resolution on avian flu, with delegates urging the ACP States to further integrate public health into their national economic and social development strategies. Delegates recommend doing this through the establishment and improvement of effective public health mechanisms, in particular networks for disease surveillance, response, control, prevention and treatment, information exchange and recruitment, training and retention of national public health personnel.
The Assembly adopted a further three reports from its standing committees - on the role of regional integration in the promotion of peace and security, on energy in the ACP countries and on fisheries and its social and environmental aspects in developing countries.
The twelfth meeting of the ACP-EU JPA is due to take place in Barbados from 18 to 24 November 2006.
