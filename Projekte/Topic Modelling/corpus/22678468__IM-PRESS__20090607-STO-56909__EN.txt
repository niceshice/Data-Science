The Press Centre is the nerve centre of journalists' work on election night A journalist prepares her report on the press centre Every available work station is occupied It's likely to be a long night for many journalists Extra work stations have been set up in meeting rooms to cope with demand The chamber has been transformed into a huge audiovisual set TV interview points occupy every corner Photographers are also having a busy afternoon Eyes glued to the monitors as the debate progresses Everyone keeps an eye on the latest projections Face to camera in the Parliament's chamber Still a demand for the latest updates on paper On the elections Super Sunday a large part of Europe's media have gathered in Brussels to record the results of the 7th euro-election in 30 years. Different branches of the media are present with TV stations, the online press and the print media all being heavily represented. With Members from all 27 countries being elected, every national result tells not just a European story but a national and local tale about which parties and personalities are in the ascendancy and which are in decline.
Here is just a flavour of what is happening from Brussels tonight. The full results will not be known until after 22.00 CET.
