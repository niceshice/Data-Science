Better protection for pedestrians and cyclists, sooner

8 000 pedestrians and cyclists are killed and 300 000 injured across the EU each year. The Transport Committee - in a vote on Wednesday - is backing Commission proposals to reduce this number via requirements for road vehicles covering systems for collision avoidance, frontal protection, brake assistance and other obligations for car manufacturers.
Rapporteur Francesco Ferrari (ALDE, IT) says he expects that the number of fatal accidents could now be reduced by 2 000 thanks to these proposals alone. MEPs want to implement them more quickly that the Commission proposed, demanding, for instance, the introduction of anti-lock brake systems and passive safety measures increasing pedestrian protection a year earlier than the Commission is proposing.
Performance tests introduced in two phases
New vehicles are required to pass a number of performance tests in two phases: phase I, based on recommendations from the Joint Research Centre, set out in existing legislation, and phase II, based on European Enhanced Vehicle-safety recommendations, which is being adapted by the present proposal to ensure its requirements are feasible and in line with current technology.
Compulsory brake systems by September 2010, new timetable on introduction of standards
Compulsory brake systems on cars should be fitted by September 2010 instead of 2011, say MEPs in the committee. Phase I should be effective for new vehicles by 31 December 2012 instead of a year later as now proposed by the Commission. They say Phase II should be introduced by September 2012 for new types of vehicles, for new vehicles below 2.5 tonnes by September 2017 and for new vehicles above 2.5 tonnes by February 2019 (instead of June 2020).
Background
The requirements aimed at improving the safety of pedestrians and other vulnerable road users in case of injuries resulting from a collision with a motor vehicle are currently covered by Directive 2003/102/EC. An independent study has, however, concluded that not all requirements in this directive were feasible. The Commission, therefore, is now proposing a new Regulation which will form the basis for a combination of feasible passive safety requirements such as the design of cars with active safety issues such as active brake systems.
