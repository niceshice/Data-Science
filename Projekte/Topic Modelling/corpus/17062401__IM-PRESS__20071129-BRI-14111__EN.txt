Monday 10 December 2007
MEPs face a packed agenda for the last plenary of the year. The 35 new Romanian MEPs will formally take their seats on Monday 10 December after the European elections of 25 November.
The session opens with two second-agreements on environmental legislation . On marine environmental policy , Member States have to take the necessary measures to achieve or maintain good environmental status in the marine environment by the year 2020, if the plenary confirms the agreement on the Marine Strategy Framework directive, reached between delegations of the EP and the Council. Marine strategies will have to be developed in order to protect and preserve the marine environment, prevent its deterioration, restore marine ecosystems and prevent and reduce inputs in the marine environment.
On ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe , the text provides for maximum concentration levels for the atmospheric microparticles or dust most hazardous to human health, the PM2.5, which were not regulated until now. Under the second-reading deal reached in late November with the Portuguese presidency, the amount of PM2.5 and other gases in ambient air which are the suspected cause of the growth in respiratory illnesses such as asthma, bronchitis and emphysema, would be reduced.
Monday evening sees the Parliament debating on population and housing censuses . The Employment and Social Affairs Committee is backing a proposal to establish a census for collecting data on population and housing in the EU. MEPs in the committee deleted from the Commission's proposal a range of categories Member States were advised to collect including a critical one on "the beginning of consensual unions of women".
There will also be Commission statements and debates on: toy safety, safety of hotels and the risk of fires, and on European contract law .
Tuesday 11 December 2007
MEPs will first vote on an urgent procedure on o vine and caprine animals: electronic identification.
Tuesday morning's main debate is on the reform of the wine sector . The aim of the reform is to bring the EU wine sector more into line with market trends such as shifting consumption patterns, enabling European wines to become more competitive on internal and world markets. The committee voted against the automatic liberalisation of planting rights in 2014 and the transfer of funding to rural development. It is also in favour of a grubbing up campaign limited to three years (instead of five); the retention of sugaring as well as aid for grape must; increased sales promotion and stricter rules for wine names and labelling. The vote takes place on Wednesday.
At midday, Sudanese human rights lawyer Salih Mahmoud Osman will receive this year's Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought.
MEPs vote on a report by Christopher Heaton-Harris (EPP-ED, UK, East Midlands Conservative) on a paperless environment for customs and trade . The purpose of the proposed legislation is to create an instrument for the implementation of interoperable and accessible automated customs systems, both under the current and the future modernised Customs Code, and for coordinated processes and services.
The afternoon is dedicated to debating the second-reading of the EU budget for 2008 . At a budgetary conciliation meeting with the Council on 23 November, Parliament won a number of victories, notably on the Galileo project, the European Institute of Technology and EU missions to Kosovo and Palestine, while also safeguarding programmes belonging to the Lisbon strategy. The vote takes place on Thursday.
On Tuesday evening, MEPs debate a second-reading report on the European aviation safety agency which is the centrepiece of the European Union’s strategy for aviation safety. The proposal seeks to address a long-standing anomaly in the EU: while aircraft now enjoy complete freedom within a unified market, safety standards continue to vary between the Member States.
MEPs will also vote on a report on the interoperability of the EU's railways . Freight trains should soon run from Antwerp to Bratislava or Lisbon to Liverpool without stopping at borders or changing locomotives or train crews. So say three co-decision reports, debated by the House at its Brussels session on 28 November, on measures to revitalise the railways by removing obstacles to the free circulation of trains throughout the European network.
The last debate on Tuesday evening is on amendment of the legal protection of design. The Legal Affairs Committee is backing a Commission proposal to end design protection for spare car parts and other machinery components . Members of the committee propose a five year transitional period before full liberalisation of the market takes effect.

At 3pm, the House will debate " the rise of extremism in Europe " after hearing statements from the Commission and the Council. The House will also vote on a resolution on this subject on Thursday.

Thursday 13 December 2007
MEPs debate and vote on a resolution on the textiles sector after questions to the Commission. The WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing came to an end in 2005, at which point the last restrictions on textile trade inherited from the Multifiber Agreement lapsed. To manage the transition to free trade in textiles, the European Commission and China concluded a ‘Memorandum of Understanding’ in 2005. That Memorandum will expire on 1 January 2008.
The House also debates and votes on a report from David Martin (PES, UK, Labour, Scotland) on economic and trade relations with South Korea calling for the conclusion of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with South Korea that covers trade in goods and services, makes scientific and technical cooperation and intellectual property an essential element of bilateral agreements.

Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to be awarded to Sudanese human rights lawyer Salih Mahmoud Osman
2007-12-06 - 09:25
Sudanese human rights lawyer Salih Mahmoud Osman will receive this year's Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought at a formal sitting of the European Parliament at 12noon on Tuesday 11 December in Strasbourg. The prize comes with a cheque for €50 000 Announcing Mr Osman as the winner on 25 October, European Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering said "In the face of violence and arbitrary power, Mr Osman stands up for dialogue and justice. And there can be no democracy without justice. By granting the Sakharov Prize to Salih Mahmoud Osman, the European Parliament shows its support for the action of this courageous man who has become the voice of Darfur, and through him, for the establishment of the rule of law in Sudan".
Mr Osman is a lawyer who works with the Sudan Organisation Against Torture to provide legal assistance and other aid to victims of human rights abuses in Sudan. For over two decades he has provided free legal representation to people arbitrarily detained, tortured or otherwise abused in Sudan's various civil wars.
As violence in Darfur has worsened in recent years, he has worked to provide a record of the alleged war crimes in that region. He visits detainees and initiates legal action against human rights perpetrators. His interviews with witnesses and records of crime have been turned over to the International Criminal Court to assist the Court's prosecutions.
Mr Osman currently serves as a Member of the Sudan National Parliament, where he seeks to promote the rule of law through implementation of the interim constitution. His fight against injustice in Sudan has had a personal cost. Members of his own family have been killed, tortured or burned out of their homes by the militias. He himself was imprisoned by the Sudanese government for over seven months in 2004 without charge or a trial. Human Rights Watch has described Mr Osman as an "essential resource" for Darfurians facing persecution and a "thorn in the side of those who use violence to cling to power".
Purpose of the Sakharov Prize
Human rights, democracy and the rule of law are key priorities for the European Parliament. The Sakharov Prize, awarded since 1988 and named after Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov (1921-1989), is awarded to individuals or organisations who seek to:
- defend human rights and fundamental freedoms, particularly the right to free expression;
- safeguard minority rights;
- foster respect for international law;
- promote democracy and the rule of law
Interview with Salih Mahmoud Osman
The following quotations are extracts from an interview with Salih Mahmoud Osman to be shown on Europe by Satellite on 10/11 December 2007: "This is a recognition of our work. It’s not me alone, there are tens of human rights defenders all over Sudan and in Darfur in particular, who are standing and voicing out on behalf of the victims and the survivors. It is a recognition of their work. I’m here to accept the honour on their behalf". "The West, Europe, are talking tough about the policies of the government of Sudan, but we don’t see acts to address the situation in a proper manner, at least to take the steps to protect the lives of people and help them go back to their communities". "The actual situation in Darfur and in Sudan is that the genocide in Darfur is still continuing. Yes, for some people this is controversial, some people don’t call it genocide, but for me as a lawyer, and as an individual, and as a native from Darfur, I know it is genocide when more than 400.000 people have been killed and more than 2000 villages have been destroyed". "This is what I am here to say today in Europe. This is an opportunity for me to remind the people of Europe that they have a moral and ethical responsibility to show some solidarity with the people of Darfur. It's not enough to send humanitarian relief: it is good also but we want to see solidarity rallies in the streets of Brussels, of Berlin, in Paris, Italy - Milan and Rome - everywhere in Europe. We want the people of Europe to go out in the streets and tell their government that it is not acceptable to leave the people of Darfur to the merciless government of Sudan".

EU Annual Report on human rights
2007-12-06 - 09:25
MEPs will debate the annual report of the EU on human rights after hearing statements from the Council and Commission. The Portuguese Presidency presented the EU Annual Report on Human Rights 2007 in the EP Human Rights subcommittee on 26 November. On 11 December Portuguese Minister Lobo Antunes and the Commission will present it to the plenary.
The purpose of this ninth EU Annual Report on Human Rights, covering the period from 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2007, is to provide an overview of the human rights-related work of the European Union. The report intends to illustrate how the common values on which the EU is based translate into human rights-related activities with regard to third countries, in multilateral fora and in relation to a number of thematic issues.
The report also continues, as in previous years, to address human rights developments within the EU, although the focus is on external relations. This is not only a question of coherence, but also of credibility. The Report further includes a section on the European Parliament's activities to promote human rights and democracy.
European Parliament and human rights
The report says "The EP has become an important voice on human rights and democracy issues. It contributes to the drafting, implementation and evaluation of policies in the field of human rights through its resolutions, reports, missions to third countries, human rights events, interparliamentary delegations and joint parliamentary committees with third countries, oral and written questions, special hearings on specific issues and its annual Sakharov Prize. Through public discussions in plenary, committees, subcommittees and working groups, it holds the Council and the Commission to account. The President of the EP as well as individual chairs of committees or subcommittees also regularly take up human rights issues with the representatives of third countries, in direct talks or in correspondence....

Fundamental rights
Proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights
2007-12-06 - 09:25
On Wednesday 12 December at 11.30am, Hans-Gert Pöttering, European Parliament President, José Manuel Barroso, Commission President, and José Sócrates, Portuguese Prime Minister and President-in-office of the EU Council, will sign the Charter of Fundamental Rights in a formal ceremony at the European Parliament in Strasbourg. This event will both raise the public profile of the Charter and provide a legal basis for the article which refers to the Charter in the EU Reform Treaty (the Lisbon Treaty). The proclamation will take place the day before the EU Heads of State or Government meet in the Portuguese capital to sign the new institutional framework.
Solemn proclamation sought by Parliament
The June 2007 European Council decided not to include the text of the EU Charter of fundamental rights in the new "Reform Treaty". In the Council's mandate for the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC), it was proposed that the Charter should simply be attached to the Treaty as a declaration.
Although this decision has no effect on the legal status given of the Charter, Parliament wanted a different approach, both for symbolic and formal reasons. At the initiative of the EP representatives in the IGC, the Charter will now be solemnly proclaimed at a plenary session of Parliament by the Presidents of the Parliament, the Council and the Commission on 12 December. It will then be published in the Official Journal.
Parliament's view is that the proclamation will reflect the Charter's specific nature and increase its public profile. Moreover, the Treaty article giving the Charter its legally binding character will now refer to this act and the proposed declaration will disappear from the new Treaties.
Concerns about the exceptions on the Charter
A Protocol annexed to the Lisbon Treaty introduces specific measures for the United Kingdom and Poland establishing exceptions with regard to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and national courts for the protection of the rights recognised by the Charter.
In its resolution of 29 November, the European Parliament urged Poland and the United Kingdom to make every effort to arrive, after all, at a consensus on the unrestricted applicability of the Charter.
Content of the Charter
The European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights sets out in a single text the whole range of civil, political, economic and social rights of European citizens and all persons resident in the EU, defined as the EU's common values. The purpose of this Charter is to make those principles more visible in order to strengthen the protection of fundamental rights in the light of changes in society, social progress and scientific developments.
These provisions apply to the EU institutions and bodies and to the Member States only when they are implementing Union law. The Charter does not establish any new power for the Union.
The European Court of Justice would be, if the Lisbon Treaty is ratified by all Member States, in charge of ensuring the respect of the Charter in all acts of the European Union.
These rights are divided into six sections:
1) Dignity: human dignity, the right to life, right to the integrity of the person, prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, prohibition of slavery and forced labour;
2) Freedoms: right to liberty and security, respect for private and family life, protection of personal data, right to marry and right to found a family, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and information, freedom of assembly and of association, freedom of the arts and sciences, right to education, freedom to choose an occupation and right to engage in work, freedom to conduct a business, right to property, right to asylum, protection in the event of removal, expulsion or extradition;
3) Equality: equality before the law, non-discrimination, cultural, religious and linguistic diversity, equality between men and women, the rights of the child, the rights of the elderly, integration of persons with disabilities;
4) Solidarity: workers' rights to information and consultation within the undertaking, right of collective bargaining and action, right of access to placement services, protection in the event of unjustified dismissal, fair and just working conditions, prohibition of child labour and protection of young people at work, family and professional life, social security and social assistance, health care, access to services of general interest, environmental protection, consumer protection;
5) Citizens' Rights: right to vote and to stand as a candidate at elections to the European Parliament, right to vote and to stand as a candidate at municipal elections, right to good administration, right of access to documents, Ombudsman, right to petition, freedom movement and of residence, diplomatic and consular protection;
6) Justice : right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, presumption of innocence and right of defence, principles of legality and proportionality of criminal offences and penalties, right not to be tried or punished twice in criminal proceedings for the same criminal offence
These rights are based on the fundamental rights and freedoms already recognised by the European Convention on Human Rights, the constitutional traditions of the EU Member States, the Council of Europe's Social Charter, the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers and other international conventions to which the European Union or its Member States are parties.

In 1998, as SOCCOM Commander, he was promoted to the rank of Major General and continued this command until the passing away of His Majesty King Hussein in February 1999.
In addition to his career as an army officer, King Abdullah II served Jordan many times in the official capacity of Regent in the absence of the late King Hussein, and regularly travelled on official missions. He was proclaimed Crown Prince on the 24th of January 1999 by a Royal Decree. He had also assumed the position of Crown Prince at birth by a Royal Decree until April 1st, 1965.
Since his ascension to the throne, King Abdullah II has continued his late father's commitment to creating a strong and positive moderating role for Jordan within the Arab region and the world, and has worked towards the establishment of a just and lasting comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. King Abdullah II is committed to building on the late King's legacy to further institutionalize democratic and political pluralism in Jordan. He has exerted extensive effort to insuring sustainable levels of economic growth and social development aimed at improving the standard of living of all Jordanians. He is also working towards modernizing Jordan's information technology and educational systems.
Under King Abdullah's reign, Jordan was admitted to the World Trade Organisation, and ratified agreements for the establishment of a Free Trade Area with the United States of America, the European Union, the European Free Trade Association countries, and sixteen Arab countries. King Abdullah II has also been involved in the drive for national administrative reform, as well as governmental transparency and accountability. He has been working on the advancement of civil liberties making Jordan one of the most progressive countries in the Middle East.

EU relations with Montenegro
2007-12-06 - 09:25
As part of the joint debate on Montenegro MEPs will debate with Commission and Council the latest development in the country. In July 2006 the Commission requested a mandate from the Council to negotiate a visa facilitation agreement with Montenegro. Negotiations by the Commission were concluded in April 2007. A European Partnership with Montenegro was adopted by a Decision of the Council of the European Union on 22 January 2007 (OJ, L20, 27 January 2007). The Montenegrin government adopted an Action Plan for its Implementation on 17 May 2007.
The process of opening a full-fledged Commission Delegation in Montenegro is ongoing. A host country agreement between the Commission and Montenegro was signed in July 2007. The Delegation is expected to be operational before the end of 2007.
On 21 May 2006 Montenegro organised a referendum on independence, in line with the provisions of Article 60 of the Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro and following a recommendation by the EU. Following the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence by the Montenegrin Parliament the EU Council adopted on 12 June 2006 Conclusions stating that "the EU and its Member States decided to develop further their relations with the Republic of Montenegro as a sovereign, independent state". On 19 October 2007 Montenegrin Parliament adopted a Constitution, largely in line with European standards. Joint debate - Montenegro

MEPs optimistic about Montenegro, underline need for judiciary reform and environmental regulations
2007-12-06 - 09:25
Marcello VERNOLA (EPP-ED, IT) for the Foreign Affairs Committee will be recommending that the European Parliament give its assent to the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EU and Montenegro. MEPs in the committee express their view on the current situation in Montenegro in a non-legislative resolution, focusing on the need for creating an independent and accountable judiciary, and protecting the coastal environment from a possible building spree. The committee considers the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), signed on 15 March, 2007 a "further example of the positive changes in the Western Balkans which EU membership prospects can achieve." The committee also welcomes the 18 September signing of the Visa Facilitation and Readmission Agreement, and gives a positive assessment of the Montenegro Parliament's adoption of a new constitutional text.
Political reforms still to be tackled: judiciary and the environment
Members in the committee remain cautiously optimistic, but urge the Montenegrin government to "guarantee the full independence and accountability of the judiciary," to "adopt and implement proactive policies against corruption," and to "implement reforms in the media laws" that would guarantee an independent and free press in the country.
The committee shows concern about Montenegro's environment, especially in the coastal areas, where foreign investment has bought up much land and immovable property. MEPs in the committee therefore stress that "the development of environmentally sustainable tourism is of capital importance to Montenegro's future," and insist on the need to "adopt a coherent environmental legislative framework and a master plan for coastal protection," especially by strictly enforcing building inspections.
Finally, the committee "regrets the signature of an agreement between the United States and Montenegro, under which the Montenegrins pledge not to hand over US personnel to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in return for which the US will provide military aid."

MEPs to vote on the Commission legislative and work programme for 2008
2007-12-06 - 09:25
On Wednesday 12 December 2007, the European Parliament will vote on a resolution on the Commission legislative and work programme for 2008. MEPs debated the work programme on Tuesday 13 November in Strasbourg (see link below) The Commission's priorities for 2008 are: "growth and jobs, sustainable Europe, an integrated approach to migration, putting the citizens first and Europe as a world partner."
The proposals presented illustrate many of the key features promoted by the Commission: they cover many cross-cutting themes, call for partnership with the Member States and other key actors, and look to tackle some of the longer-term issues facing Europe in the decades to come. They include a particular stress on better regulation, including a detailed list of simplification measures for the year ahead. The Programme also sets out the consequences in terms of communication, and includes areas foreseen as inter-institutional priorities for communication in 2008.

Budget
2008 budget: Parliament and Council reach agreement on funding of Galileo
2007-12-06 - 09:25
MEPs will debate and vote on the EU budget for 2008. The vote takes place on Thursday 13 December. At a budgetary conciliation meeting with the Council on 23 November, Parliament won a number of victories, notably on the Galileo project, the European Institute of Technology and EU missions to Kosovo and Palestine, while also safeguarding programmes belonging to the Lisbon strategy. The EP delegation will propose to the plenary a draft budget for 2008 that reflects the policy priorities adopted by Parliament at first reading.
The EU general budget for 2008 will be €120.3bn in payment appropriations, nearly 0.96% of the total GNI of the Member States.
The Parliament delegation, which came to the negotiating table with a mandate based on the outcome of the EP's first-reading vote on the 2008 budget, made it clear that, failing an agreement on Community funding of the Galileo project, there would be no deal on the common foreign and security policy (CFSP). The CFSP (together with the thorny issues of Kosovo and Palestine, and the use of the flexibility instrument) and, as usual, the level of payments, were the other key points in the negotiations. No fewer than twelve hours of talks were needed to hammer out a deal acceptable to all.
Galileo and EIT saved
"We came here to cut the Gordian knot", said Reimer Böge (EPP-ED, DE), chair of the EP delegation and of the Budgets Committee, at the start of the conciliation, referring to Galileo and the European Institute of Technology (EIT). By the close of the talks it was agreed, thanks to Parliament's insistence, that Galileo (the European satellite navigation system, which will be independent of the American, Russian and Chinese systems) will be funded entirely by the Community. The amount needed by 2013 (a shortfall of €2.4bn) will be found mainly from the revision of the Financial Perspective (€1.6bn of "new" money taken from agricultural expenditure not used in 2007). The rest will come from the redeployment of funds intended for a few programmes that do not come under co-decision (€200 million), the "re-prioritisation" (change in the order of priorities to be funded: €400 million) of certain amounts earmarked for research and the unused margins in Heading 1a (Competitiveness and growth: €300 million). Funding for the EIT (€300 million) is part of this financial package totalling €2.7bn (up to 2013).
Failing a satisfactory agreement on the Galileo programme, this project, which is politically, economically and symbolically crucial for the EU, might have collapsed. Since the start, the European Parliament has opposed a mixed financing system for Galileo, with funding drawn from both the Community budget and national budgets, pushing instead for it to be paid for entirely by the EU. For both the EIT and Galileo, Parliament called for a review of the Financial Perspective in order to protect the Lisbon agenda's multiannual programmes Lifelong education and training, Erasmus Mundus and the Transeuropean networks (TENs). The entire budget of these programmes was saved. "I welcome with all my heart the result of these negotiations, which is a great success for Europe, for European industry and for Europe's citizens", said Kyösti Virrankoski (ALDE, FI), Parliament's 2008 budget rapporteur.
Member States reached a compromise on the legal basis for Galileo at the Transport Council on 30 November.
Breakthrough on CFSP and guarantees of funding for Palestine and Kosovo
The CFSP will receive a total of €285 million from the EU budget, an increase of €125 million over 2007. Parliament has long drawn the attention of Council and Commission to the chronic underfunding of Heading 4 (The EU as a global actor), even though the EP achieved a significant increase for this heading during the negotiations on the multiannual framework. The 2008 budget will thus make it easier to conduct joint actions outside the Community's borders. Of this figure, €70 million will be deployed through the flexibility instrument, which is designed to finance unforeseen or exceptional expenditure, under the Interinstitutional Agreement (IIA) of 17 May 2006. This exceptional funding will be used in 2008 for EU action in Kosovo and measures for Palestine.
Increase in level of payment appropriations
Under the EP-Council agreement, the level of payments for 2008 will be €120 346 160 000, around 0.96% of the EU's gross national income (GNI). This is €300.35 million higher than the amended preliminary draft budget (PDB) proposed by the Commission. The Commission's initial PDB proposed a level of payments representing 0.97% of GNI, while the Council's draft budget figure was equivalent to 0.95%. The increase agreed by Parliament and Council for the 2008 budget is 5.7% higher than the 2007 figure.
During the conciliation, the EP delegation suggested improving the dialogue with the Commission in respect of democratic scrutiny and the coherence of the Union's external action through regular meetings at political level. The EP delegation also raised the issue of the Member States' responsibility for supervising Community funds in jointly managed policies, as laid down in the Financial Regulation (Art. 53) and the IIA of 17 May 2006. Parliament attaches great importance to commitment of the Member States to this matter.

Environment
Air quality: maximum concentration of microparticles to be set
2007-12-06 - 09:25
The European Parliament will debate and vote on a second-reading agreement with the Council on the future directive on air quality. The text provides for maximum concentration levels for the atmospheric microparticles or dust most hazardous to human health, the PM2.5, which were not regulated until now. Under the second-reading deal reached in late November with the Portuguese presidency, the amount of PM2.5 and other gases in ambient air which are the suspected cause of the growth in respiratory illnesses such as asthma, bronchitis and emphysema, would be reduced.
The aim of the directive is to reduce this pollution in order to minimise its harmful effects on human health. According to the agreed text, "emissions of harmful air pollutants should be avoided, prevented or reduced and appropriate objectives set for ambient air quality". Special efforts will be made for the most sensitive population groups, particularly children.
Member States will have two years after entry into force of the directive to transpose it into national law.
Particles - Fine particles (PM2.5)
For particles with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometres (PM2.5), which do the most damage to lungs, MEPs and the Council agreed on an initial target value of 25µg/m3 from 2010. From 2015, this figure would become a binding limit.
MEPs successfully pushed for a second limit value - an indicative one - of 20µg/m3 to be achieved by 1 January 2020, five years after the first limit. The European Commission must review this indicative figure in 2013 to confirm the value laid down (20µg/m3) or to propose that it be altered.
Parliament also managed to introduce the notion of an "exposure concentration obligation", meaning "a level fixed on the basis of the average exposure indicator with the aim of reducing harmful effects on human health, to be attained over a given period". When the Commission carries out its 2013 review of PM2.5, this exposure concentration obligation must also be reviewed.
Larger particles (PM10)
MEPs accepted the Council's common position regarding maximum concentrations of the largest microparticles (PM10). These are to be reduced to 40µg/m3 on average per year, although no precise date is set by which this level should be reached. This represents no change compared with the current directive governing PM10 (Directive 1999/30/EC), which lays down limit values for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter and lead in ambient air, and has been in force since 1 January 2005).
MEPs also agreed to the Council's position on daily limits of these same particles: a maximum of 50µg/m3 which must not be exceeded more than 35 times per year.
Derogation
The agreement allows a three-year exemption to the PM10 limit values for areas or cities which cannot meet the targets "because of site-specific dispersion characteristics, adverse climatic conditions or transboundary contributions". This exemption would be granted only if Member States submit a plan showing why the maximum figures cannot be met despite measures taken at national and local level.
Sampling points
Under the directive, Member States must set up "sampling points" in urban areas and cities (of more than 250,000 inhabitants) and also in rural areas, where a measuring station must be set up for every 100,000 km2.
In addition to particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), these sampling points will measure sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, lead, benzene and carbon monoxide.
The criteria used in the Member States for selecting sampling points will be monitored by the Commission to ensure harmonised EU-wide application of the criteria.
Binding measures for certain sources of pollution
Regarding the emissions which are the source of certain pollutants, MEPs secured the addition of a new recital stating that "The necessary Community measures to reduce emissions at source, in particular measures to improve the effectiveness of Community legislation on industrial emissions, to limit the exhaust emissions of engines installed in heavy duty vehicles, to further reduce the Member States' permitted national emissions of key pollutants and the emissions associated with refuelling of petrol cars at service stations, and to address the sulphur content of fuels including marine fuels should be duly examined as a priority to by all institutions involved".
In addition to this recital, the Commission has agreed to accompany the directive with a declaration in which it undertakes to put forward new legislative measures in 2008 to:
limit the exhaust emissions of engines installed in heavy duty vehicles;
further reduce the Member States' permitted national emissions of key pollutants and the emissions associated with refuelling of petrol cars at service stations;
address the sulphur content of fuels including marine fuels.
This declaration is a response to a request by MEPs, who asked that the Commission should submit, within two years of the directive's entry into force, binding measures to cut air pollution from motor vehicles, including boats and aircraft, as well as the application of Euro VI norms for heavy goods vehicles, new standards for domestic heating equipment and lower emissions for the latter as well as for emissions from farming. It will be published in the EU Official Journal on the same day as the directive. The Commission refused to have the list included in the text of the directive on the ground that this would impinge on its right of initiative.

Agreement on Marine Strategy Framework directive
2007-12-06 - 09:25
Member States have to take the necessary measures to achieve or maintain good environmental status in the marine environment by the year 2020, if the plenary confirms the agreement on the Marine Strategy Framework directive, reached between delegations of the EP and the Council. Marine Strategies will have to be developed in order to protect and preserve the marine environment, prevent its deterioration, restore marine ecosystems and prevent and reduce inputs in the marine environment. The directive sets up for the first time an overall, integrated policy for the protection of the marine environment which is faced with a number of threats including loss or degradation of biodiversity and changes in its structure, loss of habitats, contamination by dangerous substances and nutrients and the impact of climate change. Up until now, measures to protect the marine environment have been developed in a sector by sector approach resulting in a patchwork of policies, legislation, programmes and actions plans at national, regional, EU and international level which do not deliver a high level of protection of the marine environment.
Parliament's rapporteur Marie-Noëlle LIENEMANN (PSE, FR) welcomes the second reading agreement.
Member States' obligation to take measures for good environmental status
The compromise reached strengthens the objectives of the proposal, as stressed by the European Parliament since its first reading: Member States are obliged to take the necessary measures to achieve or maintain good environmental status in the marine environment by the year 2020 at the latest. In addition, Parliament achieved an overall tightening of the deadlines through the whole directive.
European Marine Regions
European Marine Regions and Sub-Regions as management units for implementation will be established by the directive. For their marine waters within each Marine Region, Member States will be required to develop Marine Strategies on the basis of the completion of a number of steps. By 2015 at the latest a programme of measures designed to achieve or maintain good environmental status shall be developed and entered into operation by 2016 at the latest. Member States sharing a Marine Region or Sub-Region, shall cooperate to ensure that the different elements of the Marine Strategy are coherent and coordinated.
Pilot Projects
The directive foresees a provision on the possibility to speed up implementation in so-called pilot project regions to be identified by Member States concerned. Thanks to the European Parliament, stricter protective measures are possible in these regions, provided that this does not harm another Marine Region or Sub-Region.
Exceptions
In order to take into account of the particular contexts of certain Marine waters, the Directive foresees special situations and areas where the environmental targets or good environmental status cannot be achieved in every aspect through measures taken by that Member State. Furthermore, when there is no significant risk to the marine environment, or where the costs would be disproportionate, no specific action is required by the Member State. But following a request by the EP, the Member State has to prove that there is no further deterioration of the marine environment and has to avoid that the achievement of a good environmental status is permanently compromised
Background
Two-thirds of the planet is covered by sea water. The marine environment is home to vital resources and its ecosystem provides essential services, for instance by regulating the climate, recycling nutrients, absorbing waste and producing oxygen. Marine ecosystems also account for 80% of life on our planet, making the marine environment crucial to our social and economic prosperity as well as our health.
Europe is surrounded by four seas and two oceans. From the (closed) Black Sea to the (open) northeast Atlantic Ocean, the waters are home to diverse ecosystems and cover several biogeographical regions. The European coastline is 100,000 km long and the Community's marine territory is larger than its land territory. At least 16% of European citizens live on the coast and for many of them the sea is their livelihood, while for others it is a place for relaxation and sport, and a source of food and of inspiration.
The deterioration of the marine environment has become evident all over the world and European waters are no exception. The threats are often cross-border and essentially come from overfishing, destructive fishing techniques, the disposal at sea of waste and pollutants from the coast, noise pollution caused by vessels, maritime transport infrastructures, degassing and underwater acoustic activity, but also from invasive species, the impact of climate change, gravel extraction, drilling for oil and coastal urbanisation. In the case of closed or partially closed seas, such as the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean, the risk of pollution is particularly high.

Agriculture
Wine: Parliament to vote on reform plans
2007-12-06 - 09:25
Parliament will debate and vote, under the consultation procedure, on the Commission's plans to overhaul the rules governing the wine sector. The aim of the reform is to bring the EU wine sector more into line with market trends such as shifting consumption patterns, enabling European wines to become more competitive on internal and world markets. On 21 November the EP Agriculture Committee, voting on a draft report by Giuseppe Castiglione (EPP-ED, IT), adopted by a large majority a set of compromises on most of the issues considered sensitive by producers.
The committee voted against the automatic liberalisation of planting rights in 2014 and the transfer of funding to rural development. It also voted in favour of a grubbing up campaign limited to three years (instead of five); the retention of sugaring as well as aid for grape must; increased sales promotion and stricter rules for wine names and labelling.
Main points of the report adopted by the Agriculture Committee
- Planting rights. The committee opposed the Commission's plan to fully liberalise planting rights as of 1 January 2014 for wines protected by designations of origin and geographical indications. For other wines, it believes the decision to liberalise should be taken in the light of a report, to be produced by 2012, on measures for balancing the market. However, the committee wants to introduce, through the "national reserves", the free movement of rights throughout the EU so that competitive producers can respond freely to market signals.
- Grubbing up. MEPs backed the rapporteur's view that the package of subsidies planned by the European Commission over five years should in fact be distributed in three years, so as to allow winegrowers wishing to stop production to do so as quickly as possible.
- Sugaring and grape must. The Agriculture Committee voted against the Commission's plans to ban sugaring (the adding of sugar to wine to increase alcohol content, as practised in northern Europe) and to abolish aid for grape must (granted to southern European producers to offset the competitive disadvantage of using must). At the same time, MEPs want to keep aid for concentrated or rectified grape must used to increase the alcoholic strengths of wine products as well as the possibility of adding sucrose in wine-growing areas where this is traditionally permitted because of adverse climate conditions.
- Spirits. MEPs also want to preserve aid for distilling "potable alcohol", which could be granted via national budgetary envelopes under the guise of quality improvement. - Crisis prevention. To replace the current distillation crisis aid, which the Commission wishes to abolish, MEPs propose that, to compensate for measures designed to prevent overproduction, aid may be established in the form of a payment proportionate to the reduction in the quantities of grapes or wine produced.
- By-products. For reasons of quality and environmental protection, the Agriculture Committee wants the compulsory collection and distillation of all winemaking by-products to be kept in the regulation. Only distillers should benefit from subsidies for this service, thus allowing a considerable reduction in Community intervention pay-outs.
- Designations. The committee considers it essential that the production, including processing and preparation - and, where appropriate, refining and bottling - of "protected designation of origin" (PDO) wines and "protected geographical indication" (PGI) wines should take place in the geographical areas in question.
- Labelling. The committee does not support the proposal to allow the harvest year and wine grape variety and other traditional details to be indicated on labels for table wines, on the grounds that this option must be reserved for quality wines in order not to confuse consumers. However, MEPs believe it should be compulsory for the bottler's name and district to appear on the label of PDO and PGI quality wines.
- Wine-making practices. The committee suggests a positive list of authorised wine-making practices and rejects the idea of transferring the power to authorise new practices from the Council to the Commission. It is also opposed to applying the wine-making practices of the International Organisation of Vine and Wine - which are less restrictive than those of the EU - to European wines intended for export.
- National budgets and promotion. The committee proposes that national aid programmes should be used to finance promotional measures within the EU (and not only in third countries) as well as other measures such as restructuring the sector, crisis prevention, research and development and quality improvement, with producers being able to benefit from several measures in any marketing year.
- Rural development. The committee is against redirecting part of spending previously allocated to the wine sector to rural development.
- Cross-compliance. Since the regulation on cross-compliance of aid will apply to winegrowers as soon as they are subject to the single payment system, the committee is against specific rules involving reductions in restructuring and conversion aid or grubbing premiums being added to the regulation.
- Implementation of the reform. The committee considers that the timetable suggested by the Commission - i.e. 1 August 2008, the opening date for the next marketing year - is unachievable, in particular as Member States have to set up their national programmes beforehand. It therefore suggests that this date should be deferred until 1 August 2009.
As Parliament is only being consulted on this legislation, it plenary vote is not binding on the Council, which meets on 17-19 December to discuss the outstanding issues.
Background
The European Union is the world’s leading producer, consumer, exporter and importer of wine. The EU wine sector is a vital economic activity, especially as regards employment and export revenue. With more than 1.5 million holdings using 3.4 million ha (2% of the EU-25 agricultural area), wine production in 2004 represented 5.4% of agricultural output. Wine production accounts for around 10% of the value of agricultural production in France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Luxembourg and Slovenia, and a little less in Spain.
Since 1996 the volume of wine imports into the EU-25 has been growing at a rate of 10% a year, reaching almost 11.8 million hl in 2005. New world wines have gained considerable market share from EU wines. The volume of wine exported from the Community has been increasing since 1996 but at a much slower rate than imports, to reach about 13.2 million hl in 2005. Overall, the EU remains a net wine exporter.
EU wine consumption has fallen significantly and steadily in recent decades, a trend which has particularly affected table wine, whereas consumption of quality wine is growing, so that now the two have almost equal shares.
The mid-term outlook for the EU wine sector until 2010/2011, on the assumption that the common market organisation for wine is unchanged and on the basis of expected trends in production, consumption and trade dynamics, is that excess wine production will increase up to 27 million hl (15% of production), or to 15 million hl (8.4% of production), if the quantities distilled with aid to the potable alcohol sector are not considered surplus. The surplus is a particularly serious problem for table wine but the situation of quality wines has also deteriorated.

Improved measures to promote European farm produce
2007-12-06 - 09:25
The Agriculture Committee is submitting to the House a draft report by Bogdan Golik (PES, PL) which calls for the EU to do more to promote its farm produce both inside and outside Europe. This would require more wide-ranging measures and increased funding. The wider context of this report is the prospect of a WTO agreement involving lower customs tariffs, the abolition of export refunds and a lower level of internal EU aid.
In May 2007, the European Commission proposed merging in a single text two regulations on the promotion of farm produce from the EU and third countries, the aim being to simplify matters. The consultation report adopted unanimously on 21 November by Mr Golik proposes going further, given the current situation.
The committee proposes :
- an increase in the Community co-funding ceiling from 50% to 60% for the programmes, and to 70% for organic products or crisis sectors;
- a reduction from 20% to 10% in the minimum financial participation of producer organisations;
- a broader range of products or sectors eligible for promotion;
- the compilation by the Commission of “a strategic Community list of export prospects”;
- the possibility for producer organisations to submit their requests for selection of programmes twice, rather than once, a year;
- more information and promotion campaigns for fruit and vegetables;
- special emphasis on regional and local production of products to protect the environment (by limiting long-distance transport) and the labour market. Rapporteur Bogdan GOLIK PES PL A6-0461/2007 Agricultural products: information provision and promotion measures Procedure: Consultation

Cross-compliance of CAP aid: a more flexible, efficient system
2007-12-06 - 09:25
Parliament will be asked to vote on a consultation report on farm support schemes tabled by the Agriculture Committee, which states that the system by which EU farm aid payments are tied to certain conditions should be made simpler and more flexible so that farmers can support it more easily. The committee backs the European Commission's proposals but calls for greater tolerance for minor infractions, the abolition of needless constraints and advance warning of certain inspections.
Since the last major overhaul of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in 2003, the granting of EU agricultural aid has been tied to compliance with criteria found in around 20 different regulations. These include environmental protection, maintaining land in good agricultural condition, animal welfare and livestock identification. Farmers are recompensed for services rendered to society if they put the accent on rural development and quality rather than productivity.
This system has proved very complicated to manage for small-scale farmers and local authorities. The Commission therefore proposed a package of measures in August to make the current regime more flexible, including abolition of the “10 month rule” (the minimum period that a piece of land must be held by the farmer), the introduction of a degree of tolerance in minor cases where Community rules are not complied with, and a gradual introduction period of three years for the system in the new Member States which apply the single area payment scheme.
Minor breaches to be tolerated
Most of the infractions of the legislation concern minor cases which could easily be corrected on site. Nearly seven out of ten such infractions concern livestock labelling and registration (e.g. animals which lose an ear-tag). The Commission proposes that the Member States could decide in such cases not to apply a reduction in aid for sums less than or equal to €50 per farmer per calendar year. MEPs believe this threshold should be set at €250 in order to reduce bureaucracy sufficiently. They also envisage provisions to avoid farmers being penalised more than once (reduction of European aid and national fines) for the same infraction.
Needless constraints on farmers to be avoided
The Agriculture Committee welcomes the plans to scrap the 10-month rule but believes the Commission's alternative solution - that pieces of land should be available to farmers on 15 June each year if they wish to be entitled to the single payments - would result in red tape. Instead the committee suggests that farmers should have to prove that they held the land on the deadline set by the Member State concerned. MEPs also want farmers to be given prior notification of inspections, except where this could enable them to manipulate the results.
The Agriculture Committee wants the Commission to carry out a progress report every two years and to bring forward proposals to resolve the “bottlenecks” in controls and to review the nitrates directive. And lastly, it wants the transition period for application of cross-compliance rules by new Member States to be extended: to 2013 for countries that joined the EU in 2004 and to 2016 for those that joined in 2007. Rapporteur Jan MULDER ALDE NL A6-0470/2007 Common agricultural policy CAP: common rules for direct support schemes and certain support schemes for farmers (amend. Reg.

MEPs to vote on a resolution on the fight against terrorism
2007-12-06 - 09:25
MEPs will vote on a resolution, prepared by the Civil Liberties Committee, on the fight against terrorism. The draft resolution says that governments and EU institutions have often responded to terrorist attacks by adopting laws that have not been sufficiently discussed and are some times in violation of basic human rights such as the right to privacy or to a fair trial. The draft resolution analyses EU counter-terrorism policy. Members call for further scrutiny of intelligence operations and for more proportionate and evidence-based legislation in the future.
Analysing specific activities related to Europe's current counter-terrorism strategy - based on the goals of "prevention, protection, preparedness and response" - MEPs in the committee stress the need for the Commission to carry out "an overall evaluation" on the effectiveness of legislation adopted, the degree of transposition by Member States, "and the positive and negative effects of these laws, both in terms of security and in terms of citizen's rights". Commissioner Frattini's recent proposals regarding the use of passenger name records (PNR) in Europe for law enforcement purposes and the directive on explosives will be assessed by Parliament "on an evidence based argumentation", say MEPs in the committee.
Avoid profiling
One of the major concerns of Members is the potential misuse by authorities of the personal information contained in numerous data bases - PNR, Eurodac, Schengen and Visa information systems - "to create profiles through data-mining techniques", which is not allowed at European level. MEPs in the committee said that profiling (the use of racial, ethnic or similar characteristics in determining whether a person is considered likely to commit a particular type of crime) should be avoided altogether and raised concerns in this regard on Mr Frattini's new proposal for an EU PNR system.
Democratic control of secret services
How can we avoid serious breaches of human rights in cases like the CIA illegal renditions in Europe? Although MEPs reiterate the importance of sharing intelligence information, both at EU level and among national secret services, further rules are needed to ensure the necessary democratic scrutiny and parliamentary control over their activities, the committee says.
Preventing radicalisation
The Committee believes that "cases such as the recent rejection of the US Supreme Court to deal with the Khalid Al-Masri complaint tend to reinforce the impression particularly by Muslim minorities in Europe that the anti-terror measures promulgate double standards". EU counter-terrorism policy should not only be based on police measures but should also support local actions aimed at "preventing violent radicalisation by fostering the integration of people through intercultural dialogue", says the committee. Measures are proposed to support democracy movements in Islamic countries, including the creation of more student exchanges and funding mass media stations which spread democratic ideas.
At the same time, staff involved in borders security and counter-terrorism activities should be trained about Islam, Muslim customs and Arabic languages, says the committee. Vote :

Ending design protection for car parts
2007-12-06 - 09:25
The Legal Affairs Committee is backing a Commission proposal to end design protection for spare car parts and other machinery components. Members of the committee propose a five year transitional period before full liberalisation of the market takes effect. In the first-reading report by Klaus-Heiner Lehne (EPP-ED, DE), the committee agrees to open up to competition the secondary market in spare parts intended to restore the original appearance of complex products, e.g. cars and industrial machinery. If adopted, the directive will allow suppliers to produce motor vehicle components which are identical to the original parts without infringing design protection.
Most EU Member States currently have a design protection regime for spare parts. Under the draft directive, design protection would remain for spare parts purchased for decorative reasons, i.e. to change the original appearance.
Five year transition period agreed
Members in the committee amended the Commission's proposal, to grant Member States a five year transition period before implementing full liberalisation. This provision followed an agreement between all political groups to guarantee a smooth transition to the new regime.
Consumers to be informed
The Legal Affairs Committee also proposes an amendment requiring consumers to be informed about the origin of the components by means of trade names or other appropriate forms. This would allow the public to make an informed choice between the available products.
Differences in national legislations
According to the Commission, Austria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Sweden still have design protection for spare parts.
In Belgium, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom, spare parts for repair or replacement are allowed in the after-sales market. Greece protects designs for 5 years. Rapporteur Klaus-Heiner LEHNE EPP-ED DE A6-0453/2007 Industrial property: legal protection of designs (amend. Dir. 98/71/EC) Procedure : Codecision (1st reading)

Textiles: oral question to the Commission and vote on a resolution
2007-12-06 - 09:25
Several MEPs will be putting the following question to the European Commission on textiles. The House will also vote on a resolution on this topic. The WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing came to an end in 2005, at which point the last restrictions on textile trade inherited from the Multifiber Agreement lapsed. To manage the transition to free trade in textiles, the European Commission and China concluded a ‘Memorandum of Understanding’ in 2005. That Memorandum will expire on 1 January 2008. As a follow-up, the European side and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade have decided on a system of joint importation surveillance for the year 2008.
In that context, could the Commission:
comment on the likely impact of termination of the quota system, both for the Community industry and for the developing countries concerned, and in particular the EU’s Mediterranean partners;
indicate how it intends to guarantee the external competitiveness of the European-based textile sector and secure better market access in third countries;
comment on the follow-up actions it has taken to comply with the mandate given by the ‘High-Level Group’;
indicate how it envisages taking initiatives to defend the European textile sector from unfair trade and counterfeiting and from a dramatic trade surge of the type experienced in 2005;
indicate whether any consultations are under way with the United States of America on the issue of textile imports from China;
explain how the system of joint importation surveillance will be set up, how proper implementation of that twin checking arrangement can be guaranteed, and how it will evaluate its effectiveness;
indicate how the EC will guarantee that imported textile products, in particular from China, entering the EU market are subjected to identical security and consumer protection requirements as textile products manufactured inside the EU;
ensure that it keeps the European Parliament fully informed on any significant developments in the context of the international textile trade. Oral question Oral question to the Commission on Textiles Debate : 13.12.2007

First population and housing census in 2011
2007-12-06 - 09:25
The Employment and Social Affairs Committee is backing a proposal to establish a census for collecting data on population and housing in the EU. MEPs in the committee deleted from the Commission's proposal a range of categories Member States were advised to collect including a critical one on "the beginning of consensual unions of women". The periodic statistical data on the population and the main family, social, economic and housing characteristics of individuals are necessary for defining future regional, social and environmental policies and for making annual population estimates. High quality annual estimates are e.g. needed for the qualified majority voting within the Council which shall represent at least 62 % of the EU's population.
The collection of data on population and housing has to meet the requirements of data protection, stresses the Employment and Social Affairs Committee's first-reading report on a proposed regulation for population and housing censuses. MEPs in the committee deleted from the Commission's proposal a range of topics for which data were to be collected.
The population and housing census shall take place in 2011 and thereafter at the beginning of each decade. The data should be collected at national, regional and local levels, says the amended text. Member States are requested to submit data on a range of obligatory topics on demographic, social and economic characteristics of persons, families and households as well as on housing. MEPs in the committee propose adding "job security", "the number of times a person has changed jobs" and "the environmental and energy classification" of houses to this list.
Meet data protection requirements
MEPs in the committee call on Member States to "take all measures necessary to meet the requirements of data protection". They deleted a paragraph from the proposal which said that in addition to aggregated data in the form of a table programme, the censuses might also include samples of so called "anonymised micro data". Anonymised micro data are "individual statistical records which have been modified in order to minimise [...] the risk of identification".
Background
The last EU population and housing census was conducted for the reporting year 2001 based on a "gentlemen's agreement" between the Member States. According to the Commission the reference dates, however, varied as widely - from March 1999 (France) to May 2002 (Poland) - that the comparability of the data was seriously reduced.

Call for greater flexibility on lower rates of VAT
2007-12-06 - 09:25
While supporting the extension of some temporary measures allowing specific Member States to impose lower than standard rates of VAT on certain goods and services, a report from the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee argues that all Member States should be able to use lower rates, if they wish, for locally supplied services and for basic goods and services where there is a clear social, economic or environmental benefit from doing so. For many years, the EU has been aiming to introduce a common system of VAT based on taxation in the country of origin, but the Commission now accepts there is no prospect of the Council reaching unanimity on this in the foreseeable future. What were originally seen as transitional arrangements (essentially the system as was in place in 1993, with goods and locally supplied services taxed in the country of the consumer) now look likely to remain in force for some time.
Existing derogations should be extended
With the long term structure undecided, some Member States have derogations allowing them to charge lower rates of VAT on certain goods and services which apply indefinitely, while others - countries which joined the EU in 2004 - have time limited derogations which are about to expire. On an experimental basis, some Member States have also been allowed to apply lower rates on certain labour intensive services. This experiment runs to 2010, when the current minimum standard rate of 15 per cent also expires.
Pending a new assessment by the Council of the application of lower rates of VAT, due in 2010, the Commission is proposing to extend most of the existing derogations due to expire this year until 2010. In adopting unanimously the consultative report by Ieke van den Burg (PES, NL), the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee gave its approval to this plan. Once Parliament as a whole has voted on the issue, the final decision - as usual with taxation matters - is for the Council, acting unanimously.
Member States should be able to set lower rates on local services and basic goods
MEPs in the committee also supported the rapporteur's proposal to use this consultation procedure to send a message to Council and Commission on the wider issues. Given that the "country of origin" approach seems to be indefinitely stalled, they say the Council should decide whether to abandon this goal altogether. They say that, on VAT rates, the EU should not go beyond what is needed to ensure the internal market functions properly.
Member States, says the committee, should therefore be allowed to apply reduced rates (or possibly even zero rates in particular circumstances) to basic goods and services, such as food and medication, for clearly defined social, economic and environmental reasons for the benefit of the final consumer. Given that locally supplied services, including services linked to education, welfare, social security and culture, which do not involve cross-border activities, have in principle no impact on the internal market, Member States should also be able to apply reduced rates to them.

Deposit guarantee schemes: non-legislative improvements enough - for now
2007-12-06 - 09:25
MEPs will debate a report which concludes that self-regulatory measures by the banking industry will suffice to improve deposit guarantee schemes for the time being, though changes in EU legislation could be needed if differences between the various national schemes are shown to cause distortions of competition or problems in risk management. In an own-initiative report drawn up by Christian Ehler (EPP-ED, DE), the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee backs the Commission’s view that the results of further research was needed before deciding whether any new EU legislation was needed. This research should cover cross-border risk and crisis management, as well as distortions of competition and unequal treatment between customers. If these analyses reveal problems, the question of harmonising these schemes in terms of their financing, competence and the role of supervisory authorities would need to be addressed.
Self-regulatory improvements
In any case, say MEPs in the committee, self-regulatory steps by the banking industry could already improve matters. They welcome the Commission’s dialogue with industry with this aim and suggest improvements should include better information for customers and faster reimbursement through more modern procedures, with a cross-border reimbursement taking no longer than a purely national one.
Managing a financial crisis together
The committee asks the Commission and EU finance ministers also to analyse the issue of burden-sharing before and after a potential crisis. It adds that it is necessary for procedures and interaction between all parties involved in financial crisis management to be determined in advance. Finally, it says principles should be developed for cross-border risk and crisis management which reduce the free-rider problem and the risk of moral hazard.
The committee was responding to a Commission paper reviewing the existing EU directive which was adopted in 1994, and under which Member States all had to put in place deposit protection schemes for bank customers. The way there operate varies considerably between Member States. Rapporteur Christian EHLER EPP-ED DE A6-0448/2007 Deposit guarantee schemes Procedure : own-initiative

Christopher HEATON-HARRIS (EPP-ED, UK) for the Internal Market Committee will be tabling a second-reading legislative report on a paperless environment for customs and trade. The report approves the Council common position with amendment. The purpose of the proposed legislation is to create an instrument for the implementation of interoperable and accessible automated customs systems, both under the current and the future modernised Customs Code, and for coordinated processes and services. This instrument is intended to create the necessary commitments to implementing different customs electronic systems and the conditions for future commitments to the 'Single Window' and 'One-Stop Shop' concepts. Its main objective is to determine what action needs to be taken and what deadlines met by all stakeholders in order to achieve the objective of a simple and paperless environment for customs and trade by the time the Modernized Customs Code enters into force.
The Council shares in its common position the proposal's objective which is to establish a paperless environment for customs and trade.
The common position introduces, in addition to technical modifications and a specific reference to the protection of personal data, changes concerning the deadlines for the establishment of the individual systems. Regarding some systems it creates a distinction between deadlines for the establishment of functional specifications and for the operation of the system.

European Aviation Safety Agency will be able to impose fines
2007-12-06 - 09:25
Jörg LEICHTFRIED (PES, AT) for the Transport Committee will be putting forward a second reading report on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Aviation Safety Agency. There is now an agreement between the European Parliament and the Council. The European Aviation Safety Agency is the centrepiece of the European Union’s strategy for aviation safety. Its mission is to promote the highest common standards of safety and environmental protection in civil aviation.
The amendments proposed at second-reading which are agreed with the Council introduce fines and periodic penalty payments. The report says at the agency's request the Commission may impose fines as an alternative for the outright withdrawal of a certificate. The report states:
(a) impose on the persons and the undertakings to which the Agency has issued a certificate, fines, where, intentionally or negligently, the provisions of this Regulation and its implementing rules have been breached;
(b) impose, on the persons and undertakings to which the Agency has issued a certificate, periodic penalty payments, calculated from the date set in the decision, in order to compel those persons and undertakings to comply with the provisions of this Regulation and its implementing rules.
The proposal seeks to address a long-standing anomaly in the EU: while aircraft now enjoy complete freedom within a unified market, safety standards continue to vary between the Member States. This, in spite of rapid growth in air traffic and the phenomenal success of low-cost airlines which now account for 12% of intra-Community traffic. Currently, responsibility for regulating air traffic standards in Europe falls on a number of bodies including the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) and the Joint Aviation Authority. In addition, there is the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). A further organisation, Eurocontrol, brings together 35 European States. It is responsible for developing, co-ordinating and planning pan-European air navigation strategies. These organisations, however, are inter-governmental in nature and the rules decided are only applied if the States concerned wish to apply them. They do not have any binding regulatory powers. The differences in standards can be considerable. Sometimes the highest standards are not applied.

Railway interoperability: non-stop freight trains from Lisbon to Liverpool
2007-12-06 - 09:25
Freight trains should soon run from Antwerp to Bratislava or Lisbon to Liverpool without stopping at borders or changing locomotives or train crews. So say three co-decision reports, debated by the House at its Brussels session on 28 November, on measures to revitalise the railways by removing obstacles to the free circulation of trains throughout the European network. Two of the reports were voted on in Brussels on 29 November. The vote on the report by Josu ORTUONDO LARREA (ALDE, ES) on interoperability of the European railways will take place in Strasbourg plenary.
MEPs stress that much needs to be done to improve the interoperability of the European railways. National procedures for the approval of locomotives are seen as the main barrier to creating an EU-wide railway system. So mutual acceptance of both existing and new railway stock specifications needs to be facilitated, says rapporteur Mr Ortuondo Larrea . His report deals with a Commission proposal which merges and recasts the two previous directives regarding interoperability of the railway system, covering both the conventional and high speed rail.
TSIs: Technical Specifications for Interoperability
In addition to the Commission proposals, the Transport Committee adopted a range of technical compromise amendments that restructure a proposal for authorising the placing in service of railway vehicles that comply with Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSIs) based on international standards and national rules.
Principle of mutual recognition
On 13 November, delegations of the Transport Committee and Council reached an agreement on outstanding points on this very technical issue, in order to achieve a first reading agreement in co-decision. The Committee proposed the principle of mutual recognition and the technical harmonisation of railway stock. It also sets clear time limits and criteria for granting authorisation, whilst for any refusal, a substantial safety risk had to be demonstrated by the national safety authority.
Towards an automatic authorisation procedure
The key point of agreement reached between the two institutions is the so-called automatic authorisation procedure. According to this procedure, railway vehicles will be automatically authorised to be placed in one Member State in the absence of a decision by a competent national safety authority within the prescribed time limits. The compromise proposal includes additional three months to the prescribed time limits. It takes into account the request of MEPs that there be a clear time limit for the authorisation of these vehicles. On the other hand, Council's concerns on safety implications with regard to the time needed by the national safety authorities were addressed as well.
Cross-community acceptance of rolling stock
This provision along with the others dealing with cross-community acceptance of rolling stock or vehicles streamlines the procedures of authorisations in the EU, thus promoting competitiveness of railways in Europe. Authorisations will now be accelerated while the administrative burden for the operators as well as for the Member States will be reduced. It has been agreed that the rules will be applied on the basis of two separate criteria: whether the vehicle is conform or not to the above-mentioned TSI or whether it concerns a first or an additional authorisation for placing the vehicle on EU tracks.
National and European vehicle registers
Other elements where Parliament and Council demonstrated a common approach are the provisions related to types of vehicles, the national and European vehicle registers and the register of infrastructure. Both parties have asked the European Railway Agency to prepare a reference document in which the classification of vehicles will be introduced according to three categories A, B and C.
The reports on Safety on the Community's railways and on the European Railway Agency
Reports adopted 29 November 2007
Directly linked with the interoperability reports are two reports drawn up by Transport Committee Chair Paolo Costa (ALDE, IT) on the revision of the Railway Safety Directive (RSD) and on the European Railway Agency (ERA). This issue is part of the so-called "cross-acceptance package" composed by these three reports. These reports were adopted by the 28-29 November plenary session in Brussels. (Link hereunder to adopted text).
Responsibility in the case of accidents
Ensuring the safety of railways in Europe but without hindering the cross-acceptance and the interoperability of railway rolling stock was the main concern of MEPs when debating in the November II plenary session the report on the revision of the Railway Safety Directive.
On the thorny issue of maintenance of vehicles, MEPs confirmed by a large majority in their vote that while a keeper for each vehicle should be designated of the maintenance, the responsibility for the operating safety of the keeper should be attributed to the railway undertaking, which was crucial for the responsibility in case of accidents. Members are in favour of a mandatory, instead of a voluntary as proposed by the Commission maintenance certification system for keepers of vehicles to be placed by 2010.
They also asked for a cost -benefit analysis before the drafting of Common safety targets. The advisory role of the ERA by delivering technical opinions for negative decisions taken by the authority on safety certificates was proposed as a first step towards a "court of appeal" in the rail sector.
The role of the European Railway Agency
Amending the regulation of the European Railway Agency was the second Costa report approved almost unanimously at the November II plenary session. Eight amendments were approved aiming at extending the Agency's competences and tasks on the cross-acceptance of railway vehicles.
A more European role is envisaged for the Agency, as the House voted that as from 2015 "the Agency shall be entrusted with the task of granting the authorisations" for railway vehicles conforming to TSIs, thus replacing Member States or the national railway agencies in their task of granting authorisations. MEPs also requested that the Agency shall draft a mandatory system of certification of vehicle keepers.

Public Private Partnerships for research and development
2007-12-06 - 09:25
The House will debate four consultation reports from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on the so-called joint undertakings. The Seventh Research Framework Programme foresees that for the first time public-private partnerships for research should be established. The four proposals are aimed at establishing joint technology initiatives (JTIs) in the following fields:
nano-electronics technologies ("ENIAC")
aeronautics and air transport ("CLEAN SKY")
innovative medicines ("IMI")
embedded computing systems ("ARTEMIS")
Joint Technology Initiatives are a major new element of the EU's 7th Research Framework Programme. They provide a way of creating new partnerships between publicly and privately-funded organisations involved in research, focussing on areas where research and technological development can contribute to European competitiveness and quality of life. The approach proposed by the JTIs signals a real change in how Europe promotes industry-driven research, designed to establish European leadership in certain technologies that are strategic to Europe's future.
Within FP7, the European Community will contribute EUR 1 billion to the Innovative Medicines Initiative, EUR 420 million to the ARTEMIS Initiative, EUR 800 million to Clean Sky and EUR 450 million to ENIAC. All JTIs shall have their seat in Brussels, and should cease working by the end of 2017.
The committee's suggestion valid for all proposals is that it should be ensured that after the last call for proposals in 2013 projects still in progress are implemented, monitored and funded until 2017.

Development and cooperation
Outcome of the EU - Africa Summit
2007-12-06 - 09:25
The House will debate the outcome of the second EU-Africa summit held under the auspices of the Portuguese Presidency. One of the main issues on the lead up to the key summit has been the possible attendance of Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe who has indicated he will attend. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has indicated that he will not attend if Mr Mugabe attends the summit. Seven years after the first meeting of Heads of State and Government from the European Union and Africa, in Cairo, the II EU-Africa Summit will be held in Lisbon on 8 and 9 December, where representatives from the 80 countries that comprise this partnership, as well as Heads of the regional institutions from both continents will be present. The Summit seeks to take into account the deep changes that affect Africa, Europe and the world during this period, by launching the basis for a long-term strategic partnership, and supplying the necessary tools for a joint work on the big global issues.
Besides the approval of the two documents that shape the new EU-Africa partnership - the Joint Strategy and the Action Plan -, it is hoped that during the Summit there will be an open discussion of the five central themes of this mutual relationship: peace and security; democracy and human rights; trade, infrastructures and development; migrations and energy and climate change.
On 7 December there will be an Inter-parliamentary conference with 25 MEPs and 25 Members of the Pan-African Parliament, ahead of the 2nd EU/Africa summit (preparation of a joint declaration by the President Pöttering and his counterpart Mrs Mongella to be addressed to the Heads of State and Government on the 8 December).

External/international trade
Intensified trade and economic relations with South Korea
2007-12-06 - 09:25
MEPs will debate and vote on a report by David MARTIN (PES, UK) calling for the conclusion of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with South Korea that covers trade in goods and services, makes scientific and technical cooperation and intellectual property an essential element of bilateral agreements. This FTA, with the EU’s fourth largest trading partner outside Europe in 2006, is also expected to tackle energy policy and climate change. The report considers that the size and rapid growth of the Southern Korean economy makes it a suitable candidate for a bilateral agreement. Korea has signed Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with the United States and a number of other leading trading partners and has further agreements under negotiation. The report reaffirms that a successful conclusion of the DDA remains a priority for MEPs.
On the scope of this FTA, the House believes that an agreement limited to tariff reductions would merely produce short term benefits. Any FTA with South Korea should take account of the four so-called Singapore Issues (foreign investment, competition, transparency in public procurement and trade facilitation).
Sectoral issues
On market access, the report considers that South Korea’s divergence from international norms and labelling requirements constitute major NTBs which present particular problems for the automotive, pharmaceutical, cosmetics and electronics industries.
On the TRIPs issue, the committee supports the Commission’s objective of assisting EU exporters of pharmaceutical products and medical devices by ensuring greater transparency in the Korean healthcare system. The future Agreement should not create any legal or practical obstacles to Korean firms using the flexibilities set out in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the declaration on the TRIPs agreement and public health.
MEPs in the committee are concerned that that the EU-Korea FTA could have a severe negative impact on the European automotive industry; requests therefore that the Commission considers a strategy of phasing out EU import tariffs with safeguards.
In the light of the EU's problematic experiences with the Korean shipbuilding industry, special attention should be given to this sector in the negotiations, says the report.
On intellectual property, the report attaches high priority to the effective enforcement of intellectual property rights, including through the introduction of adequate penalties for counterfeiting and piracy, especially in sound recordings.
The report recommends that the Commission seriously examines the extent to which trade relations between North and South Korea affect a FTA with the EU.
Parliament’s role in the negotiations
The report states that it wants Parliament closely involved in each stage of the negotiations and be given the chance to express its view on the acceptability of the negotiated text. It therefore expects the Commission and the Council to seek to present the agreement in a form that would require the assent of the Parliament.

Fisheries Committee asks for a far reaching revision of the COM in fisheries products
2007-12-06 - 09:25
"It is necessary, as a matter of urgency, to carry out a far-reaching revision of the common organisation of the market in fisheries products in order to boost its contribution to guaranteeing incomes in the sector, ensuring market stability, improving the marketing of fisheries products and increasing the value added generated", says the Fisheries Committee in a report. MEPs in the committee call on the Commission to submit, as soon as possible, a proposal for the revision of the common organisation of the market (COM) in fisheries products.
They emphasise that the contribution of the COM to the sector has fallen, especially since the 2000 revision. The reversal of this trend, notably by a significant reinforcement of financial resources, must be "one of the main objectives of a future revision of the COM in fisheries products", thus enabling it to guarantee Community funding at an adequate level for the fisheries sector's needs.
Average prices at the initial point of sale have stagnated or fallen since 2000, but this has not been reflected in meaningful fashion in a reduction in prices for the end-consumers of fresh fish. Those prices have, rather, been constantly rising, notes the rapporteur, Pedro GUERREIRO (GUE/NGL, PT).
The existing system of initial sales of fish in lots, as practised in most Member States, tends especially to penalise the producers, "who may end up with one-tenth of the gains of the end distributors", states the report.
Production and marketing
The Fisheries Committee calls on the Commission to determine whether the existing intervention mechanisms are the most suitable ones and whether they are sufficiently "flexible" to meet the needs of the existing structures of production/marketing in the Member States, with the aim of improving the marketing of fish and ensuring a fair income for producers.
The operational programmes should ensure - with suitable financial support - the possibility of the producers' organisations marketing their products directly, as a means of enhancing the value of their production, MEPs in the committee say.
The rapporteur supports the initiative of introducing a code of conduct for fisheries products in the EU, which would cover all participants in the sector, with the aim of defining "voluntary rules in order to ensure a fairer sharing of value added and marketing rules along the value chain."
Tuna and sardines
According to MEPs, the compensatory payment for tuna should be extended. They also call on the Commission to introduce a compensatory payment for sardines.
Labelling and ecological certification
The Fisheries Committee stresses the importance of labelling and of accurate consumer information, with a view to boosting the quality and value added of fisheries products: "commercial designations, notably for imported products, need to be examined and checked with all care to ensure that consumers are not misled".
The Commission should accelerate the process of ecological certification of fishery products, since "this is vital if competition between economic agents within and outside the EU is to take place on a sound and equitable footing", adds the report.
Imports
The committee highlights the "current dependence on imports for consumer needs", at a time when the Community's production is in free fall while world production continues to rise, and the existence of a "food deficit" as far as fish proteins are concerned
MEPs in the committee call on the Commission "to take a firmer line" in its evaluation of external trade relations, especially when activating the WTO safeguard mechanisms, adding that "it is vital to ensure the application to imported fisheries products sold on the internal market of the same rules and requirements as those applied to Community fisheries products", e.g. in terms of labelling, phytosanitary rules or the prohibition of fisheries products under the minimum sizes authorised for Community products.
The COM in fisheries products was the first element of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) to be created, in 1970, and has since become one of its four pillars, together with structural policy, the preservation of fishery resources and relations with third countries.
