The Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the EC and Madagascar is a tuna agreement which allocates fishing opportunities according to three categories of vessels from Spain, France, Italy, Portugal and the United Kingdom. It also introduces the possibility for an additional five vessels to carry out exploratory fishing for demersal species. The European Parliament approves the conclusion of this Agreement with some amendments.
According to the rapporteur, Margie SUDRE (EPP-ED, FR), this new agreement is "highly satisfactory, for both the European Community and the Republic of Madagascar", since "it provides fishery resources for community vessels whilst enabling Madagascar to receive income for stocks which the country would not have the technical capacity to exploit". She has, however, tabled some amendments, under consultation, aimed at improving the information forwarded to the European Parliament. Furthermore, the Commission is asked to submit a report on the application of the agreement to the EP and the Council during the final year of the protocol's validity and before another agreement is concluded on its renewal. These amendments were approved today in plenary.
The new Partnership Agreement was signed for a renewable period of six years, from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2012, and it grants the following fishing opportunities:

As financial contribution, The EC is paying Madagascar a sum of EUR 1.197.000 per year for a reference tonnage of 13.300 tonnes per year. This sum will be divided up into EUR 864.500 per year equivalent to the reference tonnage and EUR 332.500 per year for the support and implementation of Madagascar's sectoral fisheries policy. Payment of the financial contribution is to be made no later than 31 December 2007 for the first year and no later than 28 February 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 for the following years. 80% of the financial contribution and fees paid by shipowners will go towards supporting and implementing initiatives taken within the framework of the sectoral fisheries policy drawn up by Madagascar.
Licences are valid for one year and are renewable. The fee has been set at EUR 35 per tonne caught within Madagascar's fishing zone in the case of tuna seiners and surface longliners, against EUR 25 previously.
Owners of tuna seiners and surface longliners must employ at least 20% ACP nationals among the seamen signed on. For the first category of vessel, however, a minimum of 70 seamen out of the total European fleet must be from the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) member countries.
