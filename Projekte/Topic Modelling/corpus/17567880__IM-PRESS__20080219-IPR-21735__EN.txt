Population and housing census - agreement with Council
Social policy
2008-02-20 - 12:31
MEPs adopted a legislative report by Ona JUKNEVIČIENĖ (ALDE, LT) on population and housing censuses. The debate took place in Strasbourg on 10 December 2007 (see link below). There is now a first-reading agreement with Council. The controversial criterion on "consensual union" has been removed from the text. The report was adopted with 579 votes in favour 41 against and 18 abstentions.
The agreement says that each Member State should determine a date to which its data refer (reference date). This reference date shall fall in a year specified on the basis of this regulation (reference year). The first reference is 2011.
The aim of the regulation is to establish common rules for the decennial provision of comprehensive data on the population and on housing.
International, European and national institutions need to be in possession of sufficiently reliable information on the population and on housing in the European Union. The last Population and Housing Census in the European Union was conducted for the reporting year 2001. It was not based on any European legislation, but instead on a "Gentlemen's agreement". The wide variation in reference dates seriously reduced comparability. Furthermore, punctuality was not ensured. The last data were received in mid 2005, leading to a publication in September 2005, i.e. 44 months after the end of the reference year. The data initially provided were often incomplete, not fully validated or inconsistent. Numerous requests to recheck the data greatly delayed the production process. Given the important uses that are to be made of the census data, higher metadata and quality assurance standards are required.
The periodic statistical data on the population and the main family, social, economic and housing characteristics of individuals are necessary for defining future regional, social and environmental policies and for making annual population estimates. High quality annual estimates are e.g. needed for the qualified majority voting within the Council which shall represent at least 62 % of the EU's population.
The last EU population and housing census was conducted for the reporting year 2001 based on a "gentlemen's agreement" between the Member States. According to the Commission the reference dates, however, varied widely - from March 1999 (France) to May 2002 (Poland) - that the comparability of the data was seriously reduced.
