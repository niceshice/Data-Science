Committee on Fisheries
In a world in which fish stocks are declining and world demand for fish and seafood is constantly rising, aquaculture is becoming increasingly important.
The current situation in the sector plays an important socio-economic role in several European regions by enabling the development of a processing industry with a promising future.
The aquaculture sector in numbers
The EU’s aquaculture sector totals 1.3 million tons of fisheries products per year, representing some 3 billion euros. This corresponds to around one third of the total value of production in the EU’s fisheries sector and roughly one fifth of its volume. In some Member States the value of farmed products is higher than that of products landed. In others, aquaculture represents a significant proportion of total production. In Greece, for example, 100.000 of every 200.000 tons of fish are produced by aquaculture.
As well as encompassing important sources of products for European consumers, the aquaculture sector is also a substantial source of employment in regions dependent on fishing. European aquaculture provides more than 80.000 full and part-time jobs, which is the equivalent of 57.000 full-time jobs. 10:00 12:30 Brussels, ASP 1E2 Programme of the event Governance and Partnership in Regional Policy
Committee on Development
The hearing will examine a study on "Governance and partnership in Regional Policy" by Ms Herta TÖDTLING-SCHÖNHOFER, OÏR Managementdienste GmbH, Austria. This study looks at on governance and partnership in the processes that have been set up in Member States for programming the National Strategic Reference Frameworks.
It includes five national case studies (Austria, Denmark, Italy, Latvia and Romania), showing the structural and cultural differences that condition the role played by each layer of government, (federal, national, regional and local), as well as the role played by the public/private sector relationship.
10:30 12:30 Brussels, ASP 3E2 Programme of the event Digital Dividend: A Once in a Lifetime Opportunity
Committee on Industry, Research and Energy
In preparation of an own-initiative report on "Reaping the full benefits of the spectrum freed by the digital switchover" the Industry Committee is organising a mini-hearing on the digital dividend. The switchover from analogue to digital terrestrial TV by 2012 will release a large portion of spectrum known as the "digital dividend". At the hearing MEPs and experts will debate for which services (mobile TV, broadcasting, or broadband internet) the freed spectrum will bring the greatest benefits. 11:00 12:30 Brussels, PHS 1A2 Programme of the event Workshop on the Treaty
Committee on Budgets
As work begins on the EU budget for 2009, a working meeting on budgetary aspects of the Lisbon Treaty is being held at Parliament. The new treaty will alter relations between the institutions by strengthening the EP's powers. It abolishes the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure and makes the EU's multiannual financial framework (the financial perspective) legally binding. But the treaty does not settle the question of the transition to the new system, although the 2009 EU budget is due to be adopted under the financial perspective for the years 2007-2013. According to the Lisbon Treaty, the financial regulation will be subject to the co-decision procedure, thereby boosting the influence of Parliament, which until now has only been consulted. However, the regulation is to be revised before the treaty enters into force, and the division of budgetary provisions between the multiannual framework and the regulation is due to be negotiated and decided by Parliament and Council. These are only some of the questions that will be discussed at the Budgets Committee's working meeting. The debate will be launched by the rapporteur, Catherine Guy-Quint. Two experts, Giacomo Benedetto (London School of Economics) and Johannes Lindner (Adviser to the Board of the European Central Bank) will also give their views.
