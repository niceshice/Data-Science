MEPs have approved the appointment of Jürgen Stark to the Executive Board of the European Central Bank. Mr Stark, currently vice-president of the German Bundesbank, has been nominated to replace Otmar Issing. By voting in a secret ballot with 359 votes in favour to 110 votes against with 35 abstentions, MEPs agreed with the position of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, which, after a hearing on 18 April, recommended the endorsement of Mr Stark.
According to Article 112 of the EC Treaty, members of the ECB Executive Board are appointed "by common accord of the governments of the Member States at the level of Heads of State or Government, on a recommendation from the Council, after it has consulted the European Parliament and the Governing Council of the ECB." The ECB Governing Council has already given a positive assessment in this case.
