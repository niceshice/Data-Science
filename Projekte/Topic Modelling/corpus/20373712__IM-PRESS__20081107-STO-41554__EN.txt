Europe was still divided by the Iron Curtain and Jimmy Carter was in the White House. In the last 3 decades much has changed for Europe and its parliament. We spoke to a few veterans of the 1979 intake about how the institution has changed.
The first election took place in 9 countries with just 410 MEPs. That figure now stands at 785 from 27 countries. In 2009, 736 MEPs will be elected.
From opinions to policies
German Christian Democrat Ingo Friedrich stresses the great importance of the Parliament's role in 2009: "Back in 1979 it was about enlisting people in the Member States to the idea of a common Europe. Today we decide on a broad range of issues, about the tiniest detail of a directive to the great lines of European policies in the concert of world powers."
Bill Newton Dunn, a UK member of the Liberal ALDE group, also underlined the distinct power shift towards the Parliament over the past 30 years: "We are elected and we have the right to say 'yay or nay'. We've seen how a parliament can start with few powers and turn into an institution that is very powerful."
For German Christian Democrat Elmar Brok of the centre right EPP-ED group, "the EP is dealing with concrete issues as for example are climate change and social policy" as opposed to its original role of opinion giver.
Technology a driving force in politics
The changes in technology have also shaped and changed the way the European Parliament conducts it day to day business and elections. In 1979 Sony had just launched the portable cassette player for around â‚¬150 and as Mr Newton Dunn recalls, the typewriter was the number one office tool: "In 1979 we had no assistants, no typewriters, no offices, nothing. Four MEPs to share one typewriter and we'd fight and book it out. There was no technology and no mobiles."
Technology is a driving force behind many things and the 2009 EP elections will be no exception. MEPs are already canvassing voters through e-mail campaigns with the letter and stamp approach seemingly obsolete.
Mr Newton Dunn said, "If you look at how Obama conducted his campaign with e-mails and TV, the next EU election will be more centred on E-technology to reach the electorate."
Two way discourse essential
New technology has also enabled MEPs to become much more media savvy and in regular contact with citizens. "We also have become much more relevant for the media which requires us to be more professional. Today more citizens turn to us MEPs with their problems because our greater influence gives us more opportunities to help them" said Mr Friedrich.
