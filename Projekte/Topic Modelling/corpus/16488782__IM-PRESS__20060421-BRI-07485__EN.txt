MEPs mark the twentieth anniversary of Chernobyl
2006-05-03 - 11:31
Twenty years to the day after the nuclear explosion in Chernobyl, Energy Commissioner Andris PIEBALGS opened the debate by paying tribute to the people who lost their lives and to the communities hurt by the accident. Having been in Ukraine at the time, he felt a close personal contact with the issue.
The Commissioner stressed the substantial EU assistance provided to countries of the former Soviet Union since 1991 for nuclear safety improvements - more than half a billion euros had gone to Ukraine alone. " Chernobyl was a turning point in raising awareness in the international community of the need for the application of rules and common standards in the nuclear industry, and for immediate reaction in the case of emergencies ," he said. He set out a series of international conventions under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency to which the Euratom Community and all the Member States were signatories. He also reminded MEPs of the range of EU legislation aimed at ensuring nuclear safety and a swift reaction to any radiological accidents.
Commissioner Piebalgs also noted that nuclear power stations within the EU were being brought up to standard or would be closed, with EU assistance for the countries affected. Looking to the future, he said there were a number of legislative initiatives on the table. The EU would also be funding more research into how to deal with radioactive waste.
The leader of the EPP-ED group, Hans Gert POETTERING (DE) took the floor to express sympathy with those affected by what he called the " first European environmental tragedy of continental dimensions ." " It is our resp onsibility," he said, " to make sure it remains the only one. " Noting that the accident took place during a military experiment at the plant, he said there was a warning here of the risks of nuclear energy in the hands of dictatorships. He said major improvements in nuclear safety had taken place since the fall of the iron curtain. " We must ," he concluded, " strive for safe nuclear power for safe energy for Europe ."
Martin SCHULZ (DE), leader of the Socialist group, also called on MEPs to remember the victims. He recalled being mayor of a German town at the time, and taking in children who had lost their families in the disaster. He agreed it was significant that the accident took place in a dictatorship: " Facts were swept under the carpet, time went by which could have reduced loss of life. Those in charge at the time have a high degree of historical responsibility. " While acknowledging that his group, like others, was not united on the question, he gave his view of the wider question of nuclear energy: although the risk of an accident was low, the damage it would cause meant that it was a risk not worth taking. The issue of military use of civil nuclear facilities and what, he said, was the US's inconsistent approach to Iraq and North Korea also persuaded him to oppose nuclear power.
Graham WATSON (UK) for the Liberals, describing Chernobyl as the "world's worst ever civil nuclear accident" called for an expression of solidarity with the victims of the accident. He said that we should understand the Chernobyl disaster as indicative of the need to develop renewable fuel. " The EU has to radically re-examine its patterns of energy consumption" if we want to avoid dependency on Russian oil. Mr. Watson asserted the need for "greater autonomy ", saying that " money invested in clean, green technology is not money wasted ". He, therefore, applauded the Union's plans to double the use of biomass, predicting benefits for jobs and industry. He said that it is time " to make a genuine commitment - to invest in technology for the future ".
On behalf of the Greens/EFA. Claude TURMES (LU) declared it a " day of remembrance…to remember the thousands who have died and will die ". He mentioned three political lessons to be learned from the Chernobyl disaster: a need for dignity - " the victims deserve dignity " and recognition; " a need for transparency on the consequences of the accident"; and "a need for absolute transparency on the plans of the nuclear industry ". Mr. Turmes asked whether we want to risk creating more nuclear plants " in a world where accidents of nuclear chains cannot be excluded…in a world with Al Qaeda". He closed by warning that "societies can only survive if they learn the lessons of history ".
Jonas SJÖSTEDT (GUE/NGL, SE) noted that twenty years on and we can still see the sickness and handicaps of the people who suffered at Chernobyl. Consequently, he called for the decommissioning of old reactors " at all costs ". Mr. Sjostedt spoke against a dependency on oil for our energy supply, instead recommending that "we need sustainable energy sources that mean we can reduce our dependence on nuclear energy".
Georgios KARATZAFERIS (IND/DEM, EL) said that " today we are commemorating a tragic accident…and we don't know how many victims to commemorate ". He spoke of the "lingering effects of radiation" that " will continue to be present in hundreds of years' time ". He also expressed great anxiety of the Bulgarian reactor being built, noting its proximity to Greece and Italy. He declared that " we are duty bound to debate and condemn nuclear power…we should call for the decommissioning of nuclear power plants…we have to be courageous as representatives of democracy ".
Brian CROWLEY (UEN, IE) spoke of " the horrors which still befall the people of Chernobyl, Belarus, Kazakhstan and other parts of Europe " whilst remembering those who gave their lives for others. In speaking against the use of nuclear power, Mr. Crowley made an analogy: " atomic weapons are to an army what an elephant is to a mouse ", likewise believing it impossible for mankind to control nuclear power. He commended the work of many voluntary groups who have been raising money for the victims of Chernobyl. He closed by saying that it is " our responsibility to not let it happen again ".
Jana BOBOŠÍKOVÁ (NI, CZ) believed that Chernobyl still raises fears and concerns but that we " must admit that the EU cannot live without nuclear energy ". She called for Europe to "be realistic…Europeans won't switch to biomass or wind energy…but they would like to live, consume, produce". She advised that the EU cannot compete with the Asian and American economies -who are dependent on nuclear energy - " with a windmill ".

Transport
"Intelligent cars" that call Emergency services could save lives from 2009
2006-05-03 - 11:31
Parliament adopted the report by Gary TITLEY (PES, UK), by a large majority, on the introduction of the eCall system. Most speakers in the debate warmly welcomed the introduction by 2009 of an eCall system installed in vehicles which would use satellite technology to alert the nearest emergency services to the exact location of a vehicle in the event of an accident and which could save up to 2,500 lives a year.
eCall would bring about a reduction of up to 15% in the gravity of injuries. MEPs, however, voiced concern on the unwillingness of some Member States to implement the eCall system as soon as possible. So far, a majority of Member States have been slow in the adoption and promotion of 112 as an emergency number. MEPs, as well as Commissioner Viviane REDING, called on these Member States to speed up the introduction of eCall. Mrs Reding said that infringement procedures will not be excluded.
The agonising wait for emergency services after a road accident could be cut by up to 50% while European road deaths could fall by 5-10% under road safety proposals set to be endorsed by Parliament. A new "eCall" system installed in vehicles will use satellite technology to alert the nearest emergency services to the exact location of a vehicle in the event of an accident. The system would work anywhere in the EU benefiting the 100 million people who travel abroad by car each year.
MEPs on the Committee on Transport and Tourism recommend that Parliament "supports and encourages" the European eCall initiative that "could save up to 2,500 lives a year and bring about a reduction of up to 15% in the gravity of injuries". This view comes in a non-binding own initiative report tabled by Gary TITLEY (PES, UK) on road safety and the introduction of the eCall system.
The report recommends that all European authorities include eCall information within their public road safety campaigns, and that "the large-scale-roll-out of eCall by 2009 is a priority of the eSafety initiative".
What is eCall?
Welcomed as "the first building block of intelligent car initiative", eCall promises to accelerate road-accident response time, reduce the severity of road accidents and therefore contribute "to the objective of reducing road deaths in the EU". As part of the eSafety initiative, the eCall scheme consists of a harmonisation of in-vehicle emergency call, Europe-wide. The initiative involves an eCall device fitted in road vehicles which is activated in the case of an accident, transmitting "an emergency call with data that goes directly to the nearest emergency call centre" thereby providing information on the location of the accident. In so doing, "the nearest emergency centre (the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)) is notified immediately, and knows exactly where to go", resulting in "a drastic reduction in the rescue time".
Currently, some privately developed systems of emergency call exist; however, their penetration of the trans-national market has been very limited. By contrast, "eCall aims to be introduced in all vehicles in Europe, for all trades and types, and to work anywhere the vehicle will be in Europe, thus giving service to more than 100 million persons that can travel abroad annually each year".
The likely benefits
The introduction of a European-wide eCall service "could save up to 2,500 lives a year and bring about a reduction of up to 15% in the gravity of injuries". Moreover, through its introduction, the report suggests that the annual external costs of road traffic could be reduced by up to €26 billion and the response time: "by approximately 40% in urban areas and approximately 50% in rural areas". The faster arrival of rescue teams enables a more efficient clearing of the accident therefore improving congestion levels. The report points out that even when "taking into account the necessary annual investments on the in-vehicle systems, to upgrade the PSAPs and to train the emergency services staff" a substantial cost-benefit savings should still accrue from the initiative.
The costs of the initiative
Nevertheless, the committee also points out the disparity which exists between the costs estimated by the Commission and those estimated by the industry. It therefore invites them "to pursue a deeper cost-efficiency analysis for every action to be undertaken to implement eCall". Whilst encouraging a "gradual introduction and large-scale roll-out of eCall", the committee is also aware that new technologies may prove costly and that consumers may be unwilling to pay for these, it thus "calls on all stakeholders to work together to define incentives to speed up the introduction of the eCall incentive". The report notes the fact that the costs involved may be particularly prohibitive in areas where the service is needed most - in rural or isolated areas.
What needs to be done?
The eCall system is based on the use of 112 (as an emergency number) and E112 (location information requirements in public wireless networks for emergency calls), therefore the committee calls on Member States to complete their implementation as soon as possible. Correspondingly, the committee regrets that Member States have been slow in the adoption and promotion of 112 as an emergency number. Furthermore, the report "stresses the importance of all member states signing the Memorandum of Understanding" - a memorandum produced by the eCall Driving Group ("a group established to produce a framework architecture and a business model for eCall") which aims to ensure the functioning of eCall in any EU State. It considers that, for any proper improvement to be realised, this memorandum should be "converted into a letter of intent, signed by all stake holders, as soon as possible".

Budgetary control
2004 budget discharge: MEPs delay Parliament's discharge - Strasbourg rent cause for concern
2006-05-03 - 11:31
MEPs voted to postpone discharge for the European Parliament's budget in 2004. The House wants further information into alleged irregularities concerning the cost of renting two of its buildings in Strasbourg. The decision to grant discharge to the European Parliament was rejected by the House by 591 votes to 3 in favour with 13 abstentions. MEPs must now draft a new report and have a further six months to decide on its 2004 discharge.
Rapporteur on the European Parliament discharge, Markus FERBER (EPP-ED, DE) said in the debate: "We have to find out if the city of Strasbourg receives a sum of money from Parliament that differs from the sum it passes on to the pension fund. I would like to point out the following: We are not discussing the principal question of the Parliament's seat in Strasbourg, which is clearly laid down in the Treaties."
MEPs signed off the Commission's 2004 budget but they still want to keep up the pressure on EU governments. Parliament insists on better management of Community funds where these are jointly managed by the Commission and the Member States but is nevertheless recommending that the Commission be granted the 2004 budget discharge.
Rapporteur Jan MULDER (ALDE, NL) has constantly stressed the principle of accountability. "It is not enough to say an action has been carried out; it must be shown how it has been implemented and who is accountable for this implementation", he says. For this purpose the House is suggesting the introduction of "national management declarations", to be signed by the relevant bodies of the Member States. The latter are responsible for joint management of the Community budget with the Commission and would, therefore, have to take their share of responsibility if errors occur.
Parliament welcomes the initiatives taken by the Council to reinforce the responsibility of the Member States for improving the control of actions under shared management, with the aim of achieving a positive statement of assurance, and especially the commitment by the Council to producing an annual summary at the appropriate national level of the available audits and declarations.
MEPs note with satisfaction that the Council and the Commission agree on the importance of strengthening internal control (...) in order to get to a positive statement of assurance by the Court of Auditors. (...). The House also notes that as part of their enhanced responsibilities for structural funds and in accordance with national constitutional requirements, the relevant audit authorities in the Member States will produce an assessment concerning the compliance of management and control systems with the regulations of the Community. MEPs welcome the fact that Member States have therefore undertaken to produce an annual summary at the appropriate national level of the available audits and declarations.
Parliament expects that the results of the review on unknown bank accounts related to Commission activities launched by the Commission in October 2005 will be made known completely to Parliament and be followed-up. MEPs also expect that the accounts thereby established will be audited and the funds credited to the accounts will be entered into the general budget.
The Council did not take up the central proposal of the 2003 discharge, i.e. a similar national declaration but at a higher level: MEPs wanted finance ministers to sign these declarations and thereby become accountable in cases where the EU budget is jointly managed. This idea got a cool reception from the Council in November 2005, with Member States claiming that existing control systems were adequate. In the 2004 discharge, MEPs are now proposing a slightly modified approach: a series of sectoral declarations signed by bodies selected by the Member States themselves.
It should be pointed out that the Court of Auditors, for the eleventh consecutive year, has been unable to establish that "underlying transactions" (all the operations underlying the implementation of the Community budget) are free of irregularities. Under the EU Treaty, the Commission and the Member States are required to ensure "sound financial management" (Article 274), something which cannot be verified completely with the existing control systems.
Mr Mulder believes the Commission should not have to pick up the tab for a problem which originates primarily in the Member States. He stressed "I think the Council must be more responsible and more transparent. Refusing the discharge to the Commission is a nuclear weapon and would mean that the Commission would have to resign. It would not be fair to make the current Commission accountable for the policies of its predecessor. This Commission is cooperating well with the European Parliament to improve the EU's financial management, whereas the Council is resisting".
Review of Commission's internal control systems needed
The other main plank of the 2004 discharge relates to the accountability of the Commission under the same Article 274, which requires it to manage the Community budget properly. The current system, which is the fruit of the administrative reforms carried out by former Commissioner Neil Kinnock, requires the directors-general to report on their activities, by department and for the whole of the Commission. MEPs believe this system has shortcomings, as the quality of information contained in the reports is not checked and no one is accountable for it.
MEPs therefore urge other senior officials to accept accountability, namely the secretary-general of the Commission, the director-general for the budget and the internal auditor.
Discharge for the other institutions and the EU agencies
Turning to the other EU institutions, MEPs granted discharge by a large majority for the Committee of the Regions.
As to the EU agencies, apart from the "explicit" reservations expressed by the Court of Auditors regarding the European Reconstruction Agency for 2004, MEPs note that, following enlargement of the EU in 2004, the structures and operating methods of this agency have been affected. They want the Commission to analyse the actual or presumed problems and to propose adjustments to the rules.
In addition to calling on the agencies to make good and proper use of the resources available to them, MEPs urge them to avoid duplication as far as possible and to detail measures for improving the application of the transparency principle in communication with the public and in recruitment.

Asset management refinements needed to EU rules
2006-05-03 - 11:31
Parliament is calling for clarification and consolidation of the EU’s legislative framework for the asset management industry. This comes in an own-initiative report drawn up by Wolf KLINZ (ALDE, DE) and adopted by a large majority.
The report says the interaction between the UCITS (undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities) directive, the MiFID (markets in financial instruments directive) and its level 2 measures and the E-commerce directive leaves undesirable scope for interpretation. It calls on the Commission and the other EU bodies involved (CESR and CEIOPS) to ensure a high level of transparency and management of conflicts of interests, notification requirements and thus equal treatment between UCITS and competing products.
The report makes recommendations on a range of issues: investor information and protection, risk management, European passports, management company and depository passports, fund processing standardisation, cross-border consolidation, distribution structures, investment policy, non-UCITS investments, supervision issues and the Lamfalussy process.

State aid for innovation should be an exception, but has its place
2006-05-03 - 11:31
The use of state aid to promote innovation should remain the exception rather than the rule according to MEPs, who adopted an own-initiative report on the subject. It says state aid should be an instrument to correct imbalances that cannot be addressed by regular policy instruments, highlighting some areas where this might be the case.
Drawn up by Sophia In’t Veld (ALDE, NL), the report was adopted by a clear majority. MEPs, who are responding to a specific Commission consultation paper following on from the reform proposals for the whole range of state aid policy, say state aid for innovation should be complementary to the relevant EU policies and should have a clear measurable added value for the immediate beneficiaries as well as a secondary impact on the broader local, regional and national economy. Lessons need to be learned from past failures and successes in using aid to foster innovation. The new EU framework should avoid very restrictive definitions and arrangements, while providing for an interim review once the system is up and running.
The report welcomes the idea of transparent, non-discriminatory, practicable ex ante rules which would provide for legal certainty. It says subsidies should be conditional on the characteristics of the economic sector, the market structure and the market power of the company concerned, among other factors.
Parliament also insists that state aid for innovation should be temporary, granted according to rational criteria, proportionate, strictly and effectively controlled and subject to periodic impact assessments. It notes that innovative processes as such do not merit state aid, which should only be granted for innovations which cannot be financed by normal commercial means.
MEPs also stress that SMEs should be allocated a larger share of the aid available. They call for financial support to be given by means of risk capital for seed and start-up phases, and for such support also to be available in the post-seed phase, though this is not an optimal option and should be for the short term only.
Parliament says regional aid and state aid for innovation are complementary and should focus on less-developed regions in order to promote economic and social cohesion.
Calling for greater clarity on how state aid rules apply to universities and research establishments engaged in economic activities, Parliament also calls for them to take part in regional public-private partnerships as ‘innovation intermediaries.’ Rapporteur Sophia IN 'T VELD ALDE NL Text adopted

Better language competence would increase mobility in the EU
2006-05-03 - 11:31
Proficiency in at least two foreign languages should be a basic skill for every European citizen studying and working in the EU stresses the European Parliament in a report by Manolis MAVROMMATIS (EPP-ED, GR) approved by Parliament. MEPs strongly support the introduction of a common European indicator of language competence, which would enable comparisons between linguistic proficiency and Member State policies in this area.
To encourage mobility in the enlarged EU, it is important for European citizens to possess knowledge of several languages. In March 2002, the Barcelona European Council called for the introduction of a linguistic proficiency indicator to bridge the current information gap regarding the actual language and communication skills of European Union citizens. While MEPs consider that the EU Action Plan 'Promoting Language Learning and Linguistic Diversity 2004-2006' constitutes a positive step towards the achievement of the Barcelona objective (mother tongue + two languages), there is a clear need to step up EU efforts in this area. Consequently, they welcome the creation of an European Indicator of Language Competence proposed by the Commission in a communication from last year which is to measure overall foreign language competencies in four areas: reading, comprehension, speaking and writing in each Member State. The Indicator should record the proficiency of the sample at each of the six levels on the scales of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages of the Council of Europe and this in at least two languages other than the mother tongue. This reference framework has gained wide acceptance and is already used in many Member States.
During an initial phase, linguistic proficiency will be tested in the five most widely taught languages in the European Union (English, French, German, Spanish and Italian), but the Parliament wants to make sure further languages would be added at a subsequent stage. According to a recent Eurobarometer survey "Europeans and their languages", published on February 2006, 38% of Europeans speak English as a foreign language, while the rates for the other four languages are 14% for German, 14% for French, 6% for Spanish and 3% for Italian.
The Indicator will offer a valuable technical instrument that will help the European Commission obtain reliable information concerning the linguistic proficiency of European citizens, in particular young people. It will also enable comparisons to be made between Member State policies in this area, and will facilitate consultation regarding best practice, thereby giving fresh impetus to language teaching.
In the context of the European Year of Workers' Mobility, rapporteur Mr MAVROMMATIS said: "Learning two languages in addition to the mother tongue will give motivation and an opportunity to young people to exercise their right to free movement within EU. They will have opportunities to study and work in the EU25. That is one more reason why we should have a common language test that will indicate the true skills of the Europeans."
MEPs believe that Member States should be fully involved in development and implementation of the Indicator. Member States are invited to participate actively in the implementation and development of the Indicator and give fresh impetus to language teaching, including through successful language immersion programmes.
Parliament calls on the Commission to actively encourage information concerning the advantages of language learning from an early age, and considers that initiatives to inform the public of the advantages of foreign language proficiency, such as European Day of Languages (26 September), a Council of Europe initiative, and the European Language Label, an EU initiative, should contribute more substantially to increasing multilingualism.
Finally, MEPs call on the Council to concur with the timescale adopted by the Commission regarding the establishment and implementation of the European Indicator of Language Competence so as to organise a first pilot exercise to test the proposed testing instruments in 2007.
