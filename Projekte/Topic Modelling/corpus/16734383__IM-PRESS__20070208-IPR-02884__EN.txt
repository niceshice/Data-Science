Highlights of the Strasbourg week 12-15 February 2007
The February plenary session will see Parliament's President Hans-Gert Poettering make his inaugural address setting out his priorities for the next two and a half years until the European elections in June 2009. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Commission President José Manuel Barroso will respond. Parliament will also turn its attention (with a debate and vote) to the final report from the Temporary Committee investigating the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners. The House will also debate and vote on a resolution on the forthcoming European Council on the Lisbon strategy to be held in Brussels on 8 and 9 March. On Wednesday at midday, the Italian President Giorgio Napolitano will address the House in a formal sitting. Among the legislative highlights is Caroline Jackson's (EPP-ED, UK) report on the revision of the framework directive on waste. Monday 12 February Monday starts off with a debate on a conciliation agreement on spatial information . Europe needs better map-based information to support its policies, especially on the environment. A new database designed to achieve this - known as INSPIRE - could be in place by early 2009. Parliament and the Council have struck a deal which will enable data to be shared across the EU, without undermining high quality services in the Member States. The House will then focus on tabling two reports on waste from the Environment Committee. The first, authored by Caroline Jackson (EPP-ED, UK) on a draft directive from the European Commission, puts forward binding targets for reducing waste by 2010 and rejects Commission proposals to modify the existing five-stage "waste hierarchy"; the second looks at the Commission's proposed long-term strategy for preventing and recycling waste. Also on Monday, MEPs will be asking the questions to the Commission on EU restrictions on liquids that passengers can carry on aircraft. Questions include whether the Commission carried out an evaluation of information and evidence presented by the United Kingdom's secret services upon requesting these restrictions. Tuesday 13 February At 10am on Tuesday, EP President Hans-Gert Poettering will make his inaugural speech on the priorities of his two and a half year mandate. German Chancellor and Council President-in-office Angela Merkel and Commission President José Manuel Barroso will participate in the debate which follows . All former Presidents of the Parliament have been invited to attend. A highlight of this week's session will be the Tuesday afternoon debate with the Council Presidency and Commission President José Manuel Barroso on the - chiefly economic - issues to be discussed at the European Council meeting of 8-9 March in Brussels . On Tuesday evening, the House debates the reform of the wine sector with the Agriculture committee recommending retaining distillation measures for now, empowering Member States to restrict grubbing-up of vines, and liberalising planting rights only gradually. It also advocates strict labelling rules and maintaining current regulations on acceptable winemaking practices. MEPs will also be asked to reject, for a second time, a European Commission proposal that would have allowed Member States to divert some Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) direct farm payments to rural development spending . Fiona Hall (ALDE, UK) will table a non-binding report on a European policy on radio spectrum . The Industry Committee is calling for a "sustainable" approach to the use of radio spectrum in Europe so as to promote competition and innovative technologies, inhibit the hoarding of frequency rights and the power of monopolies and benefit consumers. MEPs say this approach should take account of technological change as well as the needs of market players and the public. Wednesday 14 February From 9am on Wednesday, the European Parliament will debate (vote also on Wednesday) the final report from the Temporary Committee investigating the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners . The committee deplores the passivity of some Member States in the face of illegal CIA operations as well as a lack of co-operation from the EU Council of Ministers. In fact, MEPs in the committee want the Council to launch a formal inquiry under EU Treaty Article 7 on breaches of fundamental rights. The votes are due to start at 11.30am on Wednesday. During the votes, the House will vote on a resolution on climate change which underlines that the transport sector has the largest increase in energy consumption with road transport contributing to roughly 25% of the Community CO2 emission and the resolution therefore calls for a boost in public transport. At midday on Wednesday, President Giorgio Napolitano of Italy will address the House in a formal sitting . On Wednesday afternoon, there will be a joint debate on employment and the economy . Europe should take advantage of the present improvement in economic growth to make the changes and investment needed to enhance its potential growth rates for the longer term, so as to be able to generate more employment. This is the key message of a report from the Economics Committee on the EU’s Broad Economic Policy Guidelines. Wednesday evening sees MEPs debating a report from the Fisheries Committee report on the implementation of the EU action plan against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing . The report points out that the Green Paper on a new maritime policy could serve as a framework for cooperation on the basis of which the fight against illegal fishing might be more effective. The committee also asks the Commission to publish blacklists of fishing vessels and to consider the idea of establishing an EU coastguard. The last point on Wednesday evening is a question to the Commission on the free-circulation of Roma people within EU borders. Thursday 15 February On Thursday, the House will debate two reports from the Economics Committee. The first is on the 2005 annual report of the European Investment Bank with its President, Philippe Maystadt . The second is on the macro-economic impact of the increase in the price of energy. Europe should act now to prevent increasing energy prices damaging Europe’s economy. The Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee says that if no action is taken, Europe’s dependency on energy imports will rise from 50 per cent today to 71 per cent in 2030. The committee is calling for a massive investment in energy infrastructure and supply and new measures to improve energy-efficiency. As is usual, the plenary session ends with three debates and votes on resolutions relating to human rights in the world. On this occasion, the topics are: Dialogue between the Chinese government and envoys of the Dalai Lama Humanitarian situation of refugees from Iraq The situation in Guinea
