An estimated 375 million Europeans are entitled to vote Europe goes to the polls in 10 days when people have the chance to elect a new set of Members for the European Parliament. Ahead of the ballot - in which an estimated 375 million people are entitled to vote, we look at some of the questions we have been getting about the practicalities of the election and how it will work exactly. Here is a sample of what we have been asked.
How can I vote in the European elections?
In most countries you can vote at the age of 18 although in Austria it's 16. As long as you are registered and on the electoral roll you can vote. Some countries have specific rules - you can see the electoral law of your own country via the first link below.
What about living abroad?
You are entitled to vote either back in your home country or in the country you live in now provide you are registered.
Why should I vote?
In the last few years the European Parliament has passed legislation forcing mobile phone operators to lower their prices. It has also passed rules that will reduce CO2 emissions by 20% within just over a decade. Added to this have been a series of European wide directives on how to manage immigration and a blue card scheme for skilled migrants.
All these decisions affect everyone in Europe one way or another. If you want your voice to be heard then voting for the candidate or group that represents your views is one way of doing that.
People often complain that the EU and "Brussels" is remote. Now is your chance to make a difference and elect people who will represent you there and shape the kind of European Union you want to see.
How many rounds of voting are there?
There is only one round of voting even if the exact date of the elections (4-7 June) varies from country to country.
Is it possible to vote by post?
Voting by post is usually possible although not in all countries. See your national electoral laws via the first link below for more information.
