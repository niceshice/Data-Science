MEPs are worried about the increase in alcohol consumption among minors
The European Parliament adopted an own initiative report on the European Union strategy to support Member States in reducing alcohol-related harm. The report raises several issues including: labelling and warnings, binge-drinking, "alcopops" and reducing accidents caused by drinking and driving. The report was adopted by a large majority in a show of hands.
MEPs are worried about the increase in alcohol consumption among minors and young people and note a worrying trend on their part to start drinking at an ever-earlier age and, given their greater willingness to take risks, to engage in dangerous forms of behaviour such as binge drinking, other forms of hazardous alcohol consumption which aim at drunkenness, mixed consumption of alcohol and drugs, and driving whilst under the influence of alcohol and drugs.
The report calls on the Member States to pay particular attention to vulnerable social groups, such as children, young people and pregnant women, and to address the problems of hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption by young people, workers and drivers by means of information and awareness-raising campaigns and, where appropriate, a review of compliance with existing national laws.
EP calls for a comparative study on labelling and advertising
The report points out that Member States are currently able to introduce obligatory health warnings for alcoholic beverages. The House recalls that front of pack labels may include the warnings that alcohol can cause serious health and mental health problems, that alcohol is addictive and that alcohol consumption during pregnancy may be harmful to the foetus.
MEPs note that the existence of different national labelling requirements has clear implications for the EU internal market and therefore urge the Commission to initiate a comparative study on impact and effectiveness of various information and communication means, including labelling and advertising, applied in Member States with a view to reducing hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption, and to publish the results before 31 December 2009.
The report calls on the Commission and Member States, with the involvement of relevant non-governmental organisations and economic associations in the context of the Health and Alcohol Forum proposed by the Commission, to encourage the exchange of proven practices, in particular with a view to preventing hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption among children and young people, and to adopt the following measures:
(i) to launch education campaigns to be conducted by Member States and interest groups on the risks of hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption, especially through school-based educational programmes directed towards children and adolescents, in particular by encouraging them to engage in regular sports activities, but also towards parents in order to prepare them to speak about alcohol-related problems within a family setting, and towards teachers; the idea of responsible and moderate consumption by adults should also be put across at an early stage,
(ii) to limit the access to and availability of alcoholic drinks for young people, for instance by strictly implementing the existing legislation which prohibits selling alcohol to young people, by intensifying controls on sellers and distributors, such as restaurants and bars, supermarkets and retailers,
(iii) to involve retailers and the catering industry in identifying and implementing concrete measures to prevent the selling and serving of alcohol and alcohol pops to minors,
(iv) to particularly focus on such beverages as "alcopops", which are specifically targeted at young people, in order to ensure that their alcoholic nature can be clearly identified by consumers through measures such as stricter labelling requirements for such drinks, and requirements for clearer separation of alcopops from soft drinks in shops, and the selling to minors prohibited; also to promote higher taxes on such beverages,
(v) to draw up guidelines, to be implemented at national level, setting an age limit for purchasing, selling and serving alcoholic drinks,
(vi) to promote at European level blood alcohol content (BAC) limits as close as is workable to 0.00 % for new drivers, as already proposed by Parliament in its resolution of 18 January 2007 on the European Road Safety Action Programme - mid-term review, bearing in mind that some prepared foods may contain traces of alcohol,
(vii) to provide more possibilities to know and verify the blood alcohol content also through the use of auto-calculation on the Internet and the widespread availability of breathanalysers, especially in discos, pubs and stadiums, and on motorways and roads in general, in particular during night hours, and to ensure that the message conveyed to the consumer is that drinking and driving are not compatible,
(viii) to take any necessary measures to increase controls on drink-driving to the maximum,
(ix) to strengthen the sanctions for drink-driving imposed by Member States, such as prolonged withdrawal of the driving licence,
(x) to encourage Member States to ensure the availability of alternative public means of transportation for drivers who have consumed alcohol,
(xi) to encourage the extension of "designated-driver programmes" ("who drives doesn't drink") through educational means in view of their beneficial impact on road safety, while reminding passengers of the effects of hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption,
(xii) to set up a European prize for the best campaign against hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption directed at schools and young people,
(xiii) to intensify the exchange of best practice between Member States on how to work against hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption, and between national police forces on controls on drink-driving by young people,
(xiv) to promote initiatives designed to guarantee psychological follow-up for individuals taken to hospital with acute alcohol intoxication.
