This Easter is particularly poignant as Catholic, Protestant and Orthodox Easters fall at the same time. As well as the religious aspects of Easter and the secular one of giving Easter eggs there are some slightly unusual celebrations in some EU countries. We spoke to some MEPs about what happens where they are.
On the Greek Island of Corfu pottery is broken on Easter Saturday in a tradition said to be of either Venetian or of pagan origin. According to Sylvana Rapti, a Greek MEP who hails from Corfu, at "11 am on the Saturday the bells toll to announce Jesus' first Resurrection" to mark "the moment when mourning for Jesus' suffering gives way to joy and the noise of breaking pottery!"
"People throw pottery jars full of water or wine off their balconies - because they are even noisier when they are full," she said. According to the tradition the breaking of pottery is supposed to bring good luck.
Water fights in Slovakia and Hungary
In Slovakia and Hungary the traditions are somewhat more unusual with the girls in the family being sprinkled with water by men on Easter Monday. Slovak MEP Miroslav Mikolášik explained: "The boys in this way want to transfer the vital physical and mental power of water to a beloved person, namely a girl."
He added, "this tradition has its roots in our ancestors - old Slavs who used the symbolism and magic power of water."
Eggs in Riga
In Latvia fighting with eggs is considered the norm over Easter. As Latvian MEP Roberts Zīle explained, "nowadays it is an Easter tradition to colour eggs with materials from nature such as onion skins, rye shoots and birch leaves. We then have egg fights where they are smashed together. The one, whose egg shell is the strongest, is said to live the longest."
Going on a swing is another tradition according to archaic beliefs. Swinging is connected with fertility, and it must be done, so the livestock will do well, Mr Zīle said.
