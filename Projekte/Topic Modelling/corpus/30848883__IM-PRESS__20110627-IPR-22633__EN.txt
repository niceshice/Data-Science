"The news of the end of the detention of Hu Jia is uplifting," said Jerzy Buzek, President of the European Parliament. "Whilst rejoicing for Hu Jia and his family, we should not forget about the many political activists and human rights defenders who are unjustly jailed in China."
Commenting on the end of the detention of political activist and 2008 Sakharov Prize winner Hu Jia, Mr Buzek said:
"The news of the end of the detention of Hu Jia is uplifting. His work and that of his wife Zeng Jinyan in favour of democracy, the environment and their fight against HIV/AIDS are praiseworthy - they should be supported, not jailed or harassed for their activism. They should now be able to carry on with their everyday life without further hindrance.
The European Parliament feels particularly strongly about Hu Jia. Not only because he won the Sakharov Prize in December 2008, but also because his imprisonment in December 2007 can partly be seen as the direct consequence of his participation - through a video conference - in a hearing of the European Parliament in November 2007 on human rights in China. Hopefully, we will be able to welcome Hu Jia in person to the European Parliament, where he could come to collect his Sakharov Prize award.
I also hope that the newly acquired freedom will allow him to take care of his health problems.
Whilst rejoicing for Hu Jia and his family, we should not forget about the many political activists and human rights defenders who are unjustly jailed in China - Liu Xiaobo to start with."
