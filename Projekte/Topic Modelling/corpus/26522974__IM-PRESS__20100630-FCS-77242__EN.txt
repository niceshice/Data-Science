Space Station Astronaut Frank De Winne on Europe, earth and...cycling
European Space Agency-European Amateur Radio Benefitting Society event at the European Parliament, Brussels 20 April. Frank De Winne is seen on the top left. Amateur radio highlighted De Winne calls for more support for space research International Space Station veterans Russia's Roman Romanenko, Canada's Robert Thirsk and Belgium's Frank De Winne were in Parliament Monday to open an exhibition about amateur radio. When in orbit they regularly spoke to school children via radio and during last June's European election Frank De Winne urged people to use their vote (unsurprisingly he voted by proxy!). We asked him about his experiences.
You encouraged people to vote in the European elections last June. What was your motivation to get the political message across?
I think that we need to support democracy and we can do it only when we vote for our representatives. I'm a strong believer that politicians, our representatives, really try to do their best for the society, try to improve society, try to improve things for European citizens. But it's only possible when we participate ourselves as well.
We don't have so many chances to participate in the decision-making process. Our opportunity comes through voting, and I think we should do it. I think it's really important that European citizens feel connected to Europe and participate in European decision making.
Back on earth, what are the questions you most like to answer?
For me personally - and it's really something that I'm engaged in and that I want to work in - it's the question: "why should Europe be involved in space exploration".
We need to bring our European values to space exploration. Americans, Chinese, and Russians are going to continue space exploration. If we want to make sure that our European values are represented in space exploration, we should be present and we should be present at a high level so that we are heard.
I don't know what we are going to do (going to the Moon, Mars, asteroids), but we should be there. There should be Europeans on board and I think that we should have European technology that goes to Mars. We should have European scientists, engineers, control centres working in exploration.
A more personal question: Do people dream differently in space?
I rarely remember my dreams, but it's like my fellow astronaut Canadian Bob Thirsk says, sometimes you wake up down on earth and you realise that you dreamt about doing something in space, while when you are up there you dream about things that you would be doing down on earth with your kids and your family. I think it's just because you miss those things.
Would you like to go into space again?
Oh yes. If I had the opportunity I would for sure like to do it.
On the space station you rode a bike to keep fit. Do you still enjoy cycling now you're back home?
Absolutely! I mostly enjoy watching it. On the space station you can't watch it live. There are only a couple of things I don't want to miss in my life: watching the Tour of Flanders (he is from the region) and the Paris-Roubaix bikes races. It's just part of my culture. It's very good that people have their roots. Whatever they do, wherever they are in the world they should maintain their roots and stay connected to them.

Memorial human rights activist Lidia Yusupova on the "virus" of fear
Lidia Yusupova: "You should not allow fear to approach you, it paralyses you". Critical of Russian peoples silence over terror in Caucasus Collects testimonies from victims Lidia Yusupova is a human rights lawyer who worked for Russia's Memorial organisation. As someone who worked in Grozny in Chechnya she was in Parliament on 14 April to present a documentary on the life of murdered Russian journalist Anna Politovskaya. MEPs awarded Memorial the Parliament's Sakharov prize for human rights in 2009. Ms Yusupova is a staunch critic of the Russian state-sponsored brutality towards the people of the Caucasus and believes silence is helping it.
The presentation of "Anna, Seven Years on the Frontline" took place in the press room in the parliament' press room which is named after Anna Politovskaya. It was organised by the Chair of the Human Rights Committee and Finnish MEP Heidi Hautala and the Czech NGO "People in Need". It formed part of the "One World" human rights festival held under the Patronage of former Czech President Vaclav Havel and Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek.
As part of her previous work as a lawyer offering practical help to victims of abuse Lidia Yusupova collected testimonies from victims of human rights abuses, killings and "disappearances". She also provided legal assistance in claims against the Russian Army and Security Services. Lately she is working as a journalist.
Speaking to us she said that "the Chechen syndrome" has spread throughout the Caucasus and that state sponsored terror produces inevitable counter-reaction. She told us that it's not yet too late for the EU to demand the Russian government to solve the problem.
Recent explosions in Moscow and the fears created by them are symptoms of what disease?
These explosions are just a continuation of life we saw 5-7 years ago - it’s only a new branch. The situation is only seemingly under control. The actions of the regime in Caucasus give birth to the cycles of counter-reaction.
Memorial exists because it feels that Russia finds it difficult to come to terms with its past, from Stalin's repressions to the Chechen wars. Why is this?
There's a genetic disease, a virus. Since the times of Lenin, Stalin and the Bolsheviks the nation has a herd mentality - to be a part of the mass, not to have your own opinion, not to be yourself. Only a few people in Russia can afford to be themselves. Most people live in the way that is convenient to them. They will be told black is white, they will repeat it. Of course, not everyone is like that.
The current climate of fear is not really about Caucasian people. It’s the fear of politicians to lose power and the fear in which the entire Russian population lives. This fear is a virus, artificially spread by the regime because the lowest instincts of people surface the fastest. You can have psychological control over the masses by triggering fear.
Will the recent Moscow bombing change Russia's attitude towards its own history?
No, no. You know what I would have done on the day of the terrorist attack if I were the Russian nation? I would have announced civil disobedience. If you say you knew the terrorist acts would be conducted, why haven’t you protected us? If you didn't, why are you creating this precedent and why are we being blown up? I was astonished to hear an interview of a young girl: "Why are you blowing us up? Don’t kill us...we are not the ones to blame if you were harmed". That's how people think.
Nobody has to be harmed, exterminated and killed. I wanted to say to this girl – I am sorry for those who lost their lives and their relatives, but I am also sorry for those who are daily kidnapped, killed and bombed, day-in, day-out. The commanders doing this are paid with your tax money.
Then why this narrow mindedness: "we have done nothing wrong to you"? The problem is precisely that you are doing nothing. You should have demanded your government stop the war you don’t need. These people don’t even understand that Caucasus conflict is provoking counter-reaction and they become victims of this policy.
Human rights organisations have called you one of the bravest women in Europe for your courageous work in Chechnya. What seems most terrifying/frightening and desperate in your work and what gives the biggest hope?
I didn’t know (laughs). I'll start with hope. Apart from all the faith (in God, in destiny and so forth) you have to believe in yourself and your strength. I am doing it for myself, because I don’t want to put up with the things surrounding me, the way I and others are treated. I think you have to consider yourself a human being and make others reckon with you as a human.
There are no hopeless or desperate situations. You have to go and fight and not back down. You should not allow fear to approach you, it paralyses you. You must have faith in what you are doing. Of course, we are all human, there are such seconds and minutes, but I try to push it aside.

World Anti-doping Agency's David Howman on fight against sports' cheats
David Howman: "If you use doping you deprive the cleaner athlete of an opportunity to be successful". MEPs debate scientific developments and genetic doping Dopers bring shame on "themselves, their family and their country" The "shame" that athletes "bring on themselves, their family and their country" by using illegal drugs is something athletes don't consider according to David Howman, Director General of the World Anti-doping Agency. He met with MEPs on the Culture Committee Monday (26 January) to discuss doping in sport. Prior to speaking to us he briefed MEPs on some of the problems the Agency faces, notably keeping track of scientific developments, genetic doping and the different sanctions countries impose.
(Europarl): What are the main consequences of doping in sport?
DH: There are two main consequences. One is that any person who dopes brings great shame on bring on themselves, their family and their country. It's a personal wrong - something I think people don't often think about. The second is that you cheat other athletes. You deprive the cleaner athlete of an opportunity to be successful and that’s wrong. Just like it's wrong if you, as a journalist, plagiarise somebody else's work and pretend that it's your own. Then we could add the fact that when you dope, you can damage your health.
(Europarl): What drug control mechanisms does the World Anti-doping Agency use?
DH: We don't have any ourselves. The control that we have is preparing the prohibited list. We do this with the help of experts every year, so the number of doping substances is reviewed annually. For control, say in trafficking or distribution, we rely on governments and on their having proper laws in place so that trafficking doesn't occur. We are not policeman. We must rely on countries to have policeman who do that job.
(Europarl): The new list includes new trends, so you watch for new drugs and keep it up to date?
DH: Our experts must think as if they were experts advising cheats. It is a horrible thing to say but that is the only way you can look at what is really going on. We’ll have a meeting with our experts next week. They work all year long. They look at research, trends and information from athletes who have cheated and told us what went on. They look at what we know from doctors who have been caught and have explained what they did to athletes. We also have information from the pharmaceutical industry.
(Europarl): How important is it to involve sportsmen, clubs, civil society, trainers in the fight against doping?
DH: Everyone around the athlete needs to be involved in understanding what doping is about, so that they stop the athlete from succumbing to the temptation. We have education packages for coaches and other people who are there for the athlete, even doctors. This helps them understand about doping and the rules. If they break the rules, if they encourage the athletes to break the rules then we think they should be punished too.

EU watchdog Nikiforos Diamandouros interviewed
European Ombudsman Nikiforos Diamandouros People confused over national & European Ombudsman EU Ombudsman role expanding due to treaty changes How does it feel to be the man responsible for ensuring that the Institutions of the European Union are open and transparent? As he prepares to present his annual report to MEPs we caught up with European Ombudsman Nikiforos Diamandouros and asked him about some of the complaints that his office in Strasbourg in France received. You can watch his present his annual findings live to the Petitions Committee on 4 May.
In 2008, 75% of complaints lodged with you were found to be inadmissible. Is there a lot of confusion as to what the Ombudsman actually does?
The figure has come down a bit. But it still is about 70%. It is very difficult even for very sophisticated people to understand that when there is a violation of EU law, if it's on state level, they can't come to me. They should go to their national Ombudsman.
This accounts for almost 80% of the inadmissible complaints.
For this very reason we have set up the European Network of Ombudsmen to transfer all the complaints to the right institution without the citizen or complainant having to run around to find out which institution is the right one. In other words, we do that job for them.
So, prima facie, you are right: there is confusion. But it is the kind of confusion that is easily addressable.
In your seven years of office, how has the job changed? How, for instance, has the Lisbon Treaty affected your work and the role of the Ombudsman?
The institution has evolved very much in those seven years. The office has more than doubled: from 28 persons in 2003 to 65.
This suggests a trend of strengthening, growing and reaching out. I have every reason to believe that Lisbon will open up further opportunities. The Charter of Fundamental Rights now has equal legal value as the treaties. It is legally binding. And remember that article 41 of the Charter recognises good administration as a fundamental right of every citizen of the Union.
Also, the Treaty has made all the institutions, offices, agencies and bodies subject to my mandate, including the European Council and foreign policy and security now come under my mandate.
It would be reasonable to expect that all this translates into more complaints and more opportunities for the Ombudsman to serve the citizens better.
While the Ombudsman's decisions aren't binding, there is still about 70% compliance. Why do you think that is?
The EU has a very strong tradition of rule of law. It is now trying to enhance its democratic profile. This means that there is a great deal of respect, understanding and compliance with rules and decisions, not just decisions of the courts, but the rules of the game in general.
You are quite right, though: the Ombudsman is a non-judicial means of address. It is an alternative to the courts and I do not have the power to issue binding decisions.
But rather than a weakness, I see that as a challenge! Because I then have to argue so compellingly and so convincingly that it becomes very difficult for the other side not to accept my ruling. This doesn't mean there aren't moments of disagreement, moments of frustration or that they instantly accept it. It may take quite a bit of time. But the end result usually is high compliance. And I think that brings a high degree of satisfaction institutionally for all of us.

The word ombudsman is actually ancient Swedish in origin. The modern use of the term started in 1809, when Sweden got its first Parliamentary Ombudsman. Since, the word has been incorporated into several different languages, including English. The European Ombudsman is appointed by the European Parliament to investigate complaints of maladministration in EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies.
The Ombudsman has no judicial means to compel compliance, but can issue critical remarks, recommendations and special reports. Over the years, the European Ombudsman has worked close to 35.000 cases. Of these, only 16 have resulted in a special report to Parliament.

Environment, extreme poverty causing refugee problems - UN's Guterres
António Guterres is the United Nations High Commissioner for refugees 10 million in refugee camps Hardening of people's attitudes during economic crisis Around the world 10 million people live in refugee camps - more than the population of several small European Union countries combined. António Guterres is the UN's High Commissioner for refugees and heads an organisation looking after displaced and stateless people from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Palestine, DR Congo and Iraq amongst others. We interviewed him just after he spoke to Members of Parliament's Civil Liberties Committee on 28 April.
As well as traditional threats such as war and violence he also warned about the problems caused by environmental degradation and extreme poverty.
Your first 5-year term as High Commissioner is coming to its end. How have refugee trends evolved during your mandate?
At the beginning we witnessed a steady decrease in the number of refugees each year, but in the last two years the resilience of conflict and the return of insecurity to areas where peace had been established is creating a small increase in the number of refugees and internally displaced people.
Unfortunately, last year the number of people that we helped to go back home voluntarily and in safety and dignity dramatically decreased, especially because of the situation in Afghanistan, Southern Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Conflicts and persecution have uprooted 40 million people; over 10 million live in refugee camps, often for years. What are the effects of long term displacement, and is there a "durable" solution to the plight of refugees and the displaced?
There has been a meaningful increase in the number of resettlement opportunities from countries of first asylum to countries in the developed world. A European resettlement programme is being established; we strongly support that. We are witnessing more and more countries that are accepting local integration - Tanzania just granted Tanzanian nationality to another 60 000 Burundians.
Unfortunately the number of people that we were able to help to go home in safety and dignity has decreased. This is making some of the refugee situations more protracted, and creating enormous problems, especially when people live in camps. To live 10, 20 years sometimes with restrictions of movement, with very limited resources, no access to secondary education...generates a level of suffering that should put a lot of pressure on the international community for more solutions.
During times of economic hardship, people's attitudes tend to harden. At the same time conflicts and climate change force more and more people to flee. How do you see this equation for refugee protection?
I believe there is a trend; attitudes on migration in general become more negative during periods of economic crisis. There are usually two scapegoats, governments and foreigners...This negative attitude also translates itself into shrinking of the asylum space and this is a major concern for us.
At the same time we are witnessing new trends of forced displacement. A refugee is someone who flees a country for a well founded fear of persecution or a conflict. What we are getting more and more is situations where people are forced to flee because of environmental degradation or extreme poverty.
These factors are becoming more and more interlinked and the international community lacks strategy and a set of instruments to give an adequate response to the new trends of forced displacement. But I hope that next year, with the anniversary of the 1951 refugee convention we will be able to act as a catalyst for a meaningful international debate on these new global challenges.
Burden-sharing and solidarity raise heightened debate also among EU Member States. Is Europe pulling its weight in international refugee protection?
Europe is still an important contributor in asylum but unfortunately with the unified European space, we still don't have a functional European asylum system. We are building it, but very slowly. We still have a mosaic of completely different national asylum systems which of course creates an enormous dysfunction.
This is in my opinion negative for the protection of people, and negative for the interest of the European Union. We hope and we are strongly supportive of the five proposals by the European Commission (for example reception conditions, procedures) and we strongly appeal to the members to get together and to understand that a true harmonisation is necessary; burden sharing is of course an important element.

3 questions to Tony Blair on Middle East and Faith Foundation
Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair was in Parliament on Monday 22 March to talk about Palestine UN envoy Blair meets Development and Foreign Affairs MEPs Prospects for peace in region discussed Tony Blair was at the European Parliament Monday to meet MEPs from the Development and Foreign Affairs Committees. On the agenda was Palestine and how to boost the economy and development to improve the plight of the Palestinians. He was joined by senior UN officials and members of the Palestine-Israeli community. At the hearing many MEPs were sceptical about the overall prospects for peace in the region. He answered some questions about his visit to the Parliament.
In terms of the Middle East Peace Process generally, are we entering a new phase and is there any prospect of a breakthrough?
It’s a cliché in the peace process to assert that "we are entering a critical phase". But I think it is crucial in the period ahead to marry together a meaningful, genuine political process with a sustained and vigorous effort to help build the foundations of a Palestinian State.
There is a real opportunity here. It’s clear that President Obama is committed to work with the broader international community and the parties to reach a deal within a reasonable timeframe. President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad have dedicated themselves to building a functioning Palestinian State which can live side by side with Israel, in peace and security. The Government of Israel recognises and subscribes to the "Two State" principle.
But the process is fragile and can be easily reversed. This is why it is crucial that the parties, with the international community’s support, move now from proximity talks to direct negotiations, and then on to a final status deal. Only negotiations between the parties, with supporting change on the ground, can lead to a lasting and just peace.
Regarding the economic sustainability of a future Palestinian State, do you see any hope of a "peace dividend" similar to that which revived Northern Ireland?
Certainly. The Palestinian territory is blessed with natural resources and entrepreneurial, skilled and determined people. Prime Minister Fayyad’s government has set out a case for statehood and is putting into action a plan to make that a reality. As the foundations of the state are built and the weight of the occupation gradually lifted, the prospects for a vibrant Palestinian economy are huge. The Palestinian Authority will host a second Palestine Investment Conference in early June, which will seek to leverage foreign direct investment and give the economy a further boost.
As an example of what can be achieved, one has only to look at the Palestinian high-tech sector, which boasts a workforce of 3,600 engineers, combined with a number of entrepreneurs committed to working alongside the Israeli high-tech sector and on their own account, to produce high-end ICT products for a global market.
Your Faith Foundation stresses the peaceful cooperation and interaction between faiths. Is this principle sometimes difficult to sustain when it is confronted by the deep rooted religious tensions which exist in the Middle East?
The point of the Faith Foundation is at one level very simple. It is that as the world becomes ever more globalised, religion can serve either to emphasise the differences between peoples, or help them come together and understand and accept their shared humanity and spirituality. I have found in my work with the Faith Foundation that people of different faiths are ready and willing to work with one another to solve shared problems, for example to combat malaria, one of the Millennium Development Goals. The Middle East is no exception. It is all too easy to succumb to extremist agendas which emphasise difference and hatred of the other. The truly challenging, but ultimately far more satisfying, calling is to seek out and promote shared values.

"Notre Europe" chair Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa on the euro
Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, chair of "Notre Europe" at the EP on Tuesday 16 March for talks with Foreign Affairs MEPs on their report "Charter for a New Euro-American Partnership" ©BELGA/EPA/M Cavanaugh One of euro founders interviewed In Parliament to discuss transatlantic relations with MEPs One of the men considered to be the founding fathers of the euro currency met MEPs on the Foreign Affairs Committee Tuesday (16 March) to talk about transatlantic relations. Tommaso Padoa Schioppa was formerly on the board of the European Central Bank and now chairs the Paris-based think tank "Notre Europe". As the euro goes though choppy waters we caught up with him to ask a few questions about the common currency.
You are often referred to as one of the "founding fathers of the euro"? Has the European currency fulfilled the expectations you had some 25 years ago?
My expectations on the euro have been met fully, it is an enormous success. It provides a high degree of financial stability and the European Central Bank is capable of managing the euro in times of crisis very effectively.
My expectations have not been met in the construction of other European policies, not sufficient progress has been made. So we are still in a condition where the action of the EU is insufficient. But this does not apply to the euro in any sense.
The euro and the US dollar are competing on world markets to be the leading currency. Who will get the upper hand in the long term?
Well, the outlook of the currency system in the long-term is very uncertain. I think that as the world becomes more global and has a number of very big economic actors it is increasingly difficult for the currency of just one country or one region to be the world currency. This is true for the dollar but it would be even true for the euro.
So what is necessary is to develop a new form of international monetary cooperation which is however entirely to be invented, we are still very far from that.
There are still many sceptical voices saying that the euro will eventually fail. Is this a lack of faith or are there real risks which may endanger the common currency?
I think that nobody really thinks that the euro is in any sense in danger. There are of course, in a very wide debate, always various voices, but I see nobody with authority who predicts anything like that and I do not see any sign of that.
On the contrary I see that precisely in this moment there is a growing awareness of the fact that the euro is a common element of strength to which everybody is committed to.

Hague Prosecutor Brammertz: Balkans "still suffering" from Yugoslav wars
Serge Brammertz, pursuer of Yugoslav war criminals since 1 January 2008. European Parliament 26 January 2010. Ratko Mladić and Goran Hadžić still at large Cooperation with the ICTY is a precondition of progress towards EU membership "I was once beaten up so badly, I spent four days in a coma. I was thrown out onto a heap of corpses, and I was found there by one of my comrades." This is the testimony of just one victim of the Yugoslav wars who testified at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in the Hague. Chief Prosecutor, Belgian Serge Brammertz held talks with MEPs on the Foreign Affairs Committee on 26 January. We spoke to him.
One of the most crucial aspects of the stabilisation of the successor states of Yugoslavia has been the carrot and stick of potential future EU membership. Slovenia has already joined and Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro all want to follow suit.
However, cooperation with the ICTY is a precondition of progress towards EU membership. This is why the European Parliament regularly monitors developments in the region.
One of the key areas of discussion on 26 January was what to do should fugitives like Serb General Ratko Mladić and Serb Goran Hadžić continue to evade the Court.
What are the overall lessons learned from Tribunal's work?
You know, we are not yet at the end of the process, probably it is too early to have a final conclusion. I think it is clear that by having indicted 161 persons the tribune has played a major role in addressing the crimes committed in the region.
Of course the Tribunal in its initial phase had a number of organisational, logistical problems to deal with. But I think at the end of the day if we look at the number of cases prosecuted I think it has been quite successful.
In a broader context, you know that after the Tribunal, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), the Special Court for Sierra Leone and Cambodia we have the International Criminal Court (ICC). I think the experience with the ad hoc tribunals has played a major role in the creation of the ICC as a permanent tribunal.
Suffering cannot be put into numbers, but give us some idea of the scale of the Tribunal's work?
We have millions of pages of documents at the tribunal. We have thousands of victims who have testified during these 16 years. Figures are relative and differ in terms of victims. There are victims who have lost their lives, victims of rape, victims who lost their families.
The entire region is a victim of the crimes committed by a number of individuals and the entire region is still suffering politically.
Given that Ratko Mladić and Goran Hadžić are still at large, when do you think the ICTY will finish its work?
The only good scenario is that the fugitives are arrested during the lifetime of the Tribunal, which means the next two or three years.
In the worst case scenario, the UN Security Council is working on the so-called residual mechanism - a kind of institution to be created after the closure of the Tribunal, which will deal with remaining requests of assistance for witness protection. This mechanism will also have a tribunal component - a kind of a "sleeping tribunal" to be activated if one of the fugitives is arrested at a later stage.
I think the message that the Security Council and the international community really wants to give is that whenever, wherever the fugitives are arrested there will be a judicial mechanism to deal with them.
