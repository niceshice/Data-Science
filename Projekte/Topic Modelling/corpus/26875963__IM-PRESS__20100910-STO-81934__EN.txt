Observation of Nigeria's 2007 Presidential Election Â© European Union, 1995-2010 15 September marks International Democracy Day Political, practical & financial help available to build democracy beyond EU borders Today (Wednesday 15 September) marks the International Day of Democracy and this year the focus is on building links between people and parliaments. To mark the occasion Jerzy Buzek, the President of the European Parliament, said that people should be able to choose their own government: "We are convinced that people around the world want to live in a democratic order and that they are entitled to choose their government."
He evoked his own personal experiences in coming from Poland which was under Soviet sponsored rule for over 40 years: "The history of a once divided continent and the experience of generations of Europeans living under dictatorship and ultimately triumphing over it, underpins our commitment to support peaceful democratic change and also to assist those committed to democracy, human rights and good governance beyond the EU's borders."
Debates & practical help to forge democracy
Speaking of the role the European Union plays now he stressed that "EU democracy support is aimed at democratisation, as well as at sustaining democracy and making it work for the people".
The EU and the Parliament regularly hold debates on the state of human rights and democracy around the world. In addition the Parliament's annual Sakharov Prize for human rights often rewards those protesting against non-democratic governments.
Since 2008 the Parliament's new Office for Promotion of Parliamentary Democracy has been providing technical support to young and emerging democracies by helping to advise their staff and pass on best practices beyond Europe. There is also the European Instrument for Democracy & Human Rights which financially helps NGOs and civil society around the world.
