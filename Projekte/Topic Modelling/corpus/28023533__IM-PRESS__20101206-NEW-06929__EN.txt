One million signatures: enough to request an EU law
2010-12-10 - 10:01
The European Commission will in future have to consider drafting a new EU law if so requested by at least one million EU citizens, once Parliament approves the ground rules for the "citizens' initiative" in Strasbourg next week. The Lisbon Treaty laid down a right for Europe's citizens to ask for new EU legislation if they can muster enough public support.
Under the rules on which MEPs will vote in Strasbourg, a "citizens' committee", consisting of people from at least seven different Member States, will be able to register an initiative on a Commission website. Then, after the Commission has made an initial admissibility check, they can start collecting signatures. The initiative will have 12 months to gather the required million signatures, after which the Commission will decide if a new law can be proposed.
Although the principle of a citizens' initiative was laid down in the Lisbon Treaty, legislation had to be adopted to bring it into force. Parliament, Council and Commission representatives have now thrashed out an agreement on the nuts and bolts of the procedure, with Parliament putting a big effort into making it as user-friendly as possible.
The EP Constitutional Affairs Committee will vote on the agreement on Monday 13 December and the full Parliament on Wednesday 15 December. After formal Council approval, the Member States will have one year to enact the necessary national legislation. People should thus be able to launch citizens' initiatives from the end of 2011.
Procedure: ordinary legislative procedure (1st reading)

Parliament to vote on EU budget for 2011
2010-12-10 - 10:01
The European Parliament is set to vote on the 2011 EU budget at its plenary session in Strasbourg on Wednesday, following a debate the previous day. This was decided by Parliament's Conference of Presidents - the political group leaders and the President of the EP - on Thursday. The 2011 budget, as submitted by the Budgets Committee to the full Parliament, includes more funding for all the priorities set by MEPs, including youth, innovation, the Middle East peace process and Palestine, Lifelong learning, the "People" research programme and the Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme.
Regarding the overall figures, MEPs are expected to embrace the levels proposed in the Commission's draft budget of 26 November: €141.8 billion in commitment appropriations and €126.5 billion in payments. Parliament has always attached more importance to the level of commitments, since they determine future expenditure.
Furthermore, there is an agreement between Council, Parliament and Commission that, should additional funds be necessary to fulfil the EU's legal obligations, there will be amending budgets during 2011, as the EU budget cannot legally have a deficit.
Aside from the 2011 budget, Parliament had a number of political demands relating to the implementation of the budgetary provisions in the Lisbon Treaty. Parliament laid down seven such demands in a budget resolution adopted at the October plenary session in Strasbourg. The main ones concerned the involvement of Parliament in the talks on the next long-term budget and on a new system of own resources. On the own resources, the European Commission will present a formal proposal by the end of June 2011, ensuring that the proposals on this issue are discussed at the same time as the future financial perspective. The involvement of Parliament in these matters is laid down in the Treaty (Art. 312.5, 324 and 311) but needed to be worked out in practice.
After almost two months of negotiations, EP negotiators have achieved an agreement with the Council's Presidency which is backed by the other Member States. It contains a commitment by the next four EU presidencies (the governments of Hungary, Poland, Denmark and Cyprus) on the involvement of the Parliament, which has given sufficient assurances to MEPs.
Parliament also successfully argued for systematic assessments to be made of the European added value of new legislation and its funding; there will be a report on the cost of "non-Europe"; and an evaluation of the benefits of synergies between the EU and national budgets. Parliament wants in this way to ensure that EU taxpayers get the best value for money.
In addition, a compromise was reached on the new priorities stemming from the Lisbon Treaty for which no provision had yet been made in the 2011 budget. The European Commission has undertaken to examine how these new priority areas could be boosted in the budgets for 2012 and 2013.
The Conference of Presidents is pleased that the discussions on all these matters were held at the appropriate level, with the participation of Belgian Prime Minister Leterme, Commission President Barroso and many Heads of State and Government.
The issue of flexibility within the budget - to cater for unforeseen expenditure for emergencies or new EU tasks - and the financing of the ITER nuclear fusion research project will need to be resolved at a later stage since no agreement was reached between Parliament and Council.

Tougher rules to combat human trafficking
2010-12-10 - 10:01
Criminals trafficking in human beings will face tougher penalties, while their victims should get better protection and assistance, under a new EU law that comes before Parliament in Strasbourg. The legislation will cover exploitation in the sex industry, forced labour (for example, in the construction sector, farming and domestic service), begging, the removal of organs, illegal adoption and forced marriages. It takes a broader view of "exploitation" than the EU framework decision of 2002 which it replaces, thus extending protection to more victims.
The legislation as agreed by Parliament and Council negotiators lays down minimum standards for defining criminal offences and penalties for traffickers. It introduces EU-wide rules to step up prevention of these crimes and improve the protection of victims. Member States will have two years to transpose it into their national laws.
The directive will not apply to the UK, although it could opt in later. Ireland has opted in.

EU-wide protection for victims of crime
2010-12-10 - 10:01
Victims of crime who are granted protection by law in one EU Member State may be able to get similar protection if they move to another EU country, under the new European Protection Order on which Parliament votes in Strasbourg next week. All Member States already have measures to protect crime victims but those measures cease to apply if the person goes to another country. The European Protection Order (EPO) will enable individuals who have been given protection in one Member State to request protection in any other Member State to which they move, although it would be up to the latter to decide whether protection was warranted under their own national law.
The EPO rules will apply to a victim or potential victim who needs protection “against a criminal act of another person which may, in any way, endanger his life, physical, psychological and sexual integrity [….] as well as his dignity or personal liberty”. Such acts would include harassment, abductions, stalking and "other forms of indirect coercion".
Protect all victims, not just targets of gender violence, say MEPs
Most measures currently in place in the Member States protect women who are victims of gender violence but MEPs want to spell out more clearly the fact that any victim of a crime at the hands of an identified aggressor is covered too, and that this applies whether the victim is a child or adult and regardless of their gender.
The draft text of the EPO has been agreed by MEPs and representatives of the Belgian Presidency of the Council but still needs to be confirmed by Parliament and a qualified majority of Member States in the Council.

EU residence rights for refugees
2010-12-10 - 10:01
Refugees and other people protected under international law could acquire long-term resident status in Europe under a change to EU legislation that comes before Parliament for a vote on Wednesday. The new rules will not apply to the UK, Ireland and Denmark. Refugees would have the same rights as other non-EU nationals with long-term resident status, including free movement within the EU and, under certain conditions, equal treatment with EU citizens in a wide range of economic and social areas.
This legislation, which amends an EU directive of 2003, will bring "direct benefit to all the beneficiaries of international protection who have been residing legally on the territory of the EU for more than 5 years, but currently have no entitlement to long-term resident status. It will bring an end to their differential treatment vis-à-vis other third country nationals, and will give them greater certainty about their situation in the EU", says Civil Liberties Committee rapporteur Claude Moraes (S&D, UK).
Once the new rules are approved, Member States will have two years to put them into effect.
The UK, Ireland and Denmark are opting out of this directive.

Immigration: a single permit to live and work in the EU
2010-12-10 - 10:01
A draft "single permit" law, making it easier for legal immigrants to the EU to obtain residence and work permits as well as giving them equal rights with nationals on pay, working conditions and social security, will be put to the vote on Tuesday. The directive would enable legal immigrants from non-EU countries to obtain work and residence permits via a single procedure at a "one-stop shop". It would also guarantee them certain core rights and a secure legal status.
Although non-EU workers would be entitled to equal treatment in areas such as pay and working hours, training and social security, EU Member States could restrict these rights in certain circumstances. They could, for example, require proof of a thorough knowledge of the national language in order to allow non-EU workers to follow education or training courses.
The directive will not apply to seasonal workers, posted workers, refugees or the self-employed.
It will not apply to the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark, who have exercised their right to opt out from this legislation.

Guillermo Fariñas: 2010 Sakharov Prize winner
2010-12-10 - 10:01
Cuban political dissident Guillermo Fariñas is the winner of this year's European Parliament Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. The award ceremony is set for Wednesday 15 December at 1pm. Mr Fariñas is currently waiting for an exit permit from the Cuban authorities. "Guillermo Fariñas was ready to sacrifice and risk his own health and life as a means of pressure to achieve change in Cuba. I hope to hand over the award to him in person, here in Strasbourg, in December, which would be a tremendous moment for the European Parliament and for all Cuban prisoners of conscience," said Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek, announcing the winner at the plenary session on 21 October.
Guillermo Fariñas, aged 48, was nominated on behalf of all those who fight in Cuba for freedom and human rights. A doctor of psychology, independent journalist and political dissident, he has conducted 23 hunger strikes over the years "not in his own favour but in order to defend his compatriots" according to José Ignacio Salafranca (EPP, ES).
Mr Fariñas ended his 135-day hunger strike on 8 July 2010 after the Havana government announced the release of 52 political prisoners following mediation by the Catholic Church.
Mr Fariñas is the founder of "Cubanacán Press," an independent press agency that works to raise awareness of the fate of political prisoners in Cuba. His efforts to secure free internet for all earned him a Reporters Without Borders Cyber-Freedom Prize in 2006.
The Sakharov Prize
Human rights, democracy and the rule of law are key priorities for the European Parliament. The Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, awarded since 1988 and named after Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov (1921-1989), is awarded to individuals or organisations who seek to defend these principles.
Parliament awards the prize including €50,000, at a formal sitting in Strasbourg each December.
If Mr Fariñas is in Strasbourg, please contact the following for interview requests:

MEPs to debate Wikileaks with Barroso
2010-12-10 - 10:01
The cables released by Wikileaks and the whole issue of cyber security will be discussed during Question Hour on Tuesday with Commission President Barroso. The revelations on CIA flights and extraordinary renditions contained in the leaked documents are expected to be of particular interest to MEPs. In its 2007 resolution on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners, Parliament instructed the relevant EP committees to monitor developments and determine whether there was a clear risk of a serious breach of the EU's principles and values. MEPs also asked other institutions, governments and organisations to keep Parliament informed of developments.
Cyber security
Raising levels of security in cyber space is one of the strategic objectives of the new Internal Security Strategy presented by the Commission on 22 November this year. The Digital Agenda for Europe published in August also addresses issues relating to cyber security, cybercrime, safer internet and privacy.

Fundamental rights within the EU
2010-12-10 - 10:01
The rights of EU citizens are still abused too frequently, says this year's report on fundamental rights in the European Union. MEPs call for "urgent concrete steps, mid-term strategies and long-term solutions, as well as follow up by EU institutions". The EU must ensure that its human rights policy is consistent inside and outside EU territory, including "zero tolerance" of human rights abuses by Member States, stresses the Civil Liberties Committee in its draft report.
This is the first report on fundamental rights in the EU since the Lisbon Treaty entered into force. The new Treaty transformed fundamental "basic values" into "concrete rights", by making the Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding.

Afghanistan: radical rethink of EU strategy
2010-12-10 - 10:01
The EU's strategy on Afghanistan needs a radical rethink, according to a draft resolution to be debated by Parliament in Strasbourg. Despite nearly a decade of international involvement, security and socio-economic conditions in the country are still deteriorating. An "exit strategy" needs to be shaped in full co-operation with the Afghans and must include the Taliban at the negotiating table, says the resolution.
The new EU strategy should aim to improve international aid co-ordination, fine tune the EU's role and the involvement of Afghan players in the peace process, improve police training and step up efforts to eliminate opium cultivation, adds the resolution, which was drafted for the Foreign Affairs Committee by Pino Arlacchi (ALDE, IT).

2010-12-10 - 10:01
The economic development of the EU's poorer regions depends on an improved cohesion policy, with decentralisation, simpler funding procedures and better monitoring of outcomes by the Commission, says a draft report by the Regional Development Committee that comes up for debate in Strasbourg. This own-initiative report, titled "Achieving real territorial, social and economic cohesion within the EU - a sine qua non for global competitiveness", discusses future guidelines for regional development policy.
EU funding will achieve the greatest impact if local stakeholders are more closely involved in policy making, argues rapporteur Petru Luhan (EPP, RO), who believes a genuine "bottom-up" approach is essential when devising and implementing cohesion policy. Decentralisation is crucial and the Commission must simplify the procedures for using the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund.
The principle of partnership between different levels of power and governance must be strengthened to ensure an integrated approach and better take-up of EU funds, says the report. Future budget funding must be at least equivalent to current levels and GDP must remain the principal criterion for determining the eligibility of regions for cohesion funds.
A policy geared to results
A separate report by Ramona Manescu (ALDE, RO), on good governance in EU regional policy, seeks to improve assistance and control procedures by the Commission. The Commission should provide more support to local authorities to help them improve the standard of projects submitted and supervise the outcomes more closely, on the spot, through impact assessments. The principle of a "bond of trust" should be developed, under which Member States would undertake to make good use of the funds.

Heritage label for sites of European significance
2010-12-10 - 10:01
Monuments and sites of natural, archaeological, urban or cultural value which have played a significant role in European history, culture or integration could be awarded a European Heritage Label, if MEPs vote to approve the plan in Strasbourg. This new scheme, which would be voluntary and would initially involve only EU Member States, replaces an existing European intergovernmental scheme.
Under an amendment by Parliament's Culture Committee, each Member State would pre-select up to two sites every two years, instead of annually as proposed by the Commission. Countries could also nominate sites jointly. One site per country would then be chosen by the Commission, with the help of 13 independent experts nominated by the Parliament, the Council, the Commission and the Committee of the Regions.
The Culture Committee also stresses that "the attribution of the European label shall not entail any obligation of an urban planning, judicial, landscaping, mobility or architectural nature". Nevertheless, Member States would be obliged to monitor labelled sites and ensure access to them for the widest possible public, with special attention for disabled persons. Although the label would normally be awarded permanently, it could under certain circumstances be withdrawn by the Commission or by countries themselves.
Procedure: Ordinary legislative procedure (1st reading) (no agreement)

International divorce? Choose the law to apply
2010-12-10 - 10:01
International couples who are divorcing will be able to choose which EU country's law should govern their divorce, under new legislation that comes before Parliament in Strasbourg. A Franco-German couple living in Belgium could thus decide whether French, German or Belgian law should apply if they decide to divorce. The EU regulation on divorce and legal separation will allow divorcing "international" couples (i.e. couples of different nationalities, couples living apart in different EU countries or living together in a country other than their home country) to choose which country's law applies, so long as it is the law of a country to which they have a close connection (such as habitual residence or nationality). The new rules also clarify which law is to apply should the spouses fail to agree on a choice.
The new rules were backed by EU justice ministers on 3 December, in the first-ever use of the "enhanced cooperation procedure", which enables groups of Member States to agree legislation for themselves, even in the absence of unanimity in the Council. The cross-border divorce proposal has won the backing of 14 Member States so far: Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, Austria, Portugal, Romania and Slovenia. Other EU Member States may join at any time. Parliament has consultation rights on this legislation.

Parliament will vote on Tuesday on applications for aid from the EU Solidarity Fund to repair storm damage in France and Portugal.

A fresh boost for energy efficiency
2010-12-10 - 10:01
With the EU Energy Efficiency Action Plan set to be updated soon, MEPs will vote on a resolution calling for energy efficiency to be given more attention, with increased resources and greater integration into all policy areas. The draft resolution by the Industry, Research and Energy Committee argues for better implementation of existing legislation, the promotion of energy-efficient buildings and a leading role for the public sector in energy efficiency. Binding energy efficiency targets are also mentioned.
The Industry Committee stresses that energy efficiency, a key priority of the European Energy Strategy 2011-2020, is the most cost-effective way to reduce CO2 and other emissions and increase security of supply. Achieving the (non-binding) target of 20% energy savings by 2020 could save the EU some €100 billion.

Côte d'Ivoire: MEPS to discuss post-electoral turmoil
2010-12-10 - 10:01
Parliament will debate the electoral dispute and increasing political tension in Côte d'Ivoire with EU Foreign Policy High Representative Catherine Ashton on Wednesday, before voting on a resolution on Thursday. The result of the 28 November presidential election run-off has left Côte d'Ivoire with two presidents, who have each named separate cabinets. MEPs from the EU-ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly, High Representative Ashton, the UN and many western countries have thrown their support behind Alassane Ouattara, since initial results issued by an independent electoral commission gave him a clear ten-point victory over Laurent Gbagbo. But the results were later overturned by the country's Constitutional Council, which awarded the victory to the incumbent president Gbagbo.

Enforcing the EU ban on battery hens
2010-12-10 - 10:01
As the January 2012 deadline for the ban on battery cages for hens approaches, MEPs are concerned about the risk of unfair competition from Member States that are still not ready to comply with the new rules. The Commission is being asked to report on the progress made so far and to take steps to ensure that eggs produced under the old methods are not placed on the EU market. MEPs will also ask what action the Commission will take against any Member State whose producers fail to comply with the new rules. The House will vote on a resolution on Thursday.

The outcome of the NATO Lisbon summit, including the decisions to build a missile defence system for Europe and to "reset" the Alliance's relations with Russia, will be discussed by MEPs with EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton on Wednesday. NATO leaders meeting in Lisbon from 19 to 20 November agreed to update the Alliance's now 10-year-old strategy (the Strategic Concept) to include new threats such as cyber attacks and ballistic missiles. They decided to build a missile defence shield to cover all NATO member states and also sought to revamp relations with Russia by putting them on a more cooperative footing.

MEPs and Members of the Pan-African Parliament set out their priorities and recommendations for the EU-Africa partnership in their "Tripoli Declaration", addressed to heads of state and government at the third EU-Africa summit in Tripoli (Libya) on 29/30 November 2010.
Procedure: Resolution
Debate: 24 November
Vote: Wednesday 15 December Declaration for the Third Africa-Europe Summit by EP and Pan African Parliament delegations Verbatim of debate in plenary 24.11.2010
