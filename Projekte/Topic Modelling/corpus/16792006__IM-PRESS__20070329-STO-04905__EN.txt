AIDS: 2.8 million dead so far
A Euro barometer report last year revealed deep ignorance among Europeans about how the AIDS virus is spread. Of those asked 45% believed that drinking from the same glass as a sufferer could lead to infection. A parliamentary report likely to be debated in the next plenary advocates an information campaign, measures to promote condoms, drug substitution programmes and supplying sterile syringes to sufferers to fight the disease.
Targeting those who are most at risk
The report - drafted by Latvian Liberal MEP Georgs Andrejevs - identifies those groups who are most "at risk" from AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). This group includes people who inject drugs, sex workers, homosexual men, prisoners and those under 25.
Worldwide, the UN estimates that 40 million people are infected with the HIV (Human immunodeficiency virus). Most of them are in Africa and the virus is cutting a swathing through a generation as poverty, poor access to health facilities and ignorance about how the disease is spread take their toll. To date an estimated 2.8 million people have died due to AIDS - although this is certainly an underestimate.
AIDS - the free movement killer
AIDS cuts down people regardless of nationality, race or religion. However, it does especially prey on the poor and weak - those who have no access to drugs that can stall the onset of the disease. With many poorer people heading to Europe, AIDS is now entering the continent from another source. A study in 2006 revealed that three quarters of heterosexually acquired infections in the EU are among migrants and immigrants. Many of these come from Russia and the Ukraine.
According to a report of "EuroHIV" (European Centre for the Epidemiological Monitoring of AIDS) in 2005, approximately 51 new HIV infections per million inhabitants occurred in EU while 280 cases per million inhabitants occurred in Russia and Ukraine. NGOs estimate the actual number of infected people is three times higher than the officially recorded figures suggest.
AIDS - the truth
AIDS is a collection of symptoms and infections resulting from the specific damage to the immune system caused by HIV. Many years can pass between the infection and the actual outbreak of the disease. It was first diagnosed in the United States in 1981.
The HIV-Virus is acquired by means of body liquids such as blood, sperm and vaginal secretion, as well as mother milk. Ways of infection include unprotected sexual intercourse and collective use of syringes by drug addicts. The virus cannot be transmitted during everyday contact on the workplace, meals, in public swimming pools, saunas and in hospitals and dentists, where disinfection is reliably destroying the virus.
The April Plenary sessions opens on 23 April in Strasbourg.
