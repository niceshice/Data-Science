Alternative dispute resolution must be tried first ©BELGA_HILLCREEK Imagine a European Erin Brockovich - someone to protect the consumer against large companies who misbehave. That might be on the cards with proposals for EU rules on collective redress. But don't expect to get rich. The EU wants to learn lessons from the US and avoid abusive and excessive practices, as well as punitive damages.
A draft report by German Christian Democrat Klaus-Heiner Lehne on the European Commission's exploration into how to deal with mass consumer claims in the EU says victims of unlawful practices should be able to bundle claims, which they would not pursue individually , perhaps because of the cost. But, the EU should not copy the US class action system , which, it says, has proved prone to frivolous litigation and abuse.
To avoid abuses and set basic rules for further negotiations, the report suggests:
collective redress would be possible in cases where the value of individual claims is below €2,000
collective action would be allowed in cross-border cases, where the defendant and victims are domiciled in different member states, and where EU law has been infringed
action can be taken only by a representative body like a consumer organisation or ombudsman on behalf of a clearly identified group. Members of the group must be identified before the claim is brought
compensation would represent the actual damage sustained and there will be no punitive damages
each claimant must provide evidence for his claim
courts where the defendant is domiciled should have jurisdiction
Alternative dispute resolution
However, before going to court the parties should exhaust all alternative dispute resolutions (ADR) as they are a faster and cheaper solution to settling disputes, the report says. It suggests setting up ADR schemes at a European level and wants a legal obligation for the parties involved to seek a collective, consensual resolution before launching court proceedings.
