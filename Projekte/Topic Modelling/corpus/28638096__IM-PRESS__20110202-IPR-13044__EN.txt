At the opening of this week's Brussels plenary session, EP President Jerzy Buzek made statements about the ongoing crises in Tunisia and Egypt, Latvia's Bloody Sunday anniversary, the recent hanging of Sahra Bahrami in Iran, the killing of gay rights activist David Kato in Uganda and the genocide of Roma people during World War II.
"The situation in the Mediterranean is changing as we speak", noted Mr Buzek, adding that Parliament is "happy to see the movement for democratic change initiated by our neighbours" in Tunisia.
In Egypt, by contrast, the situation was different, and "the movement may lose momentum", he continued, stressing that political reform was a prerequisite for economic and social reform and that elections must be held to respond to the desire for democracy. "The EU considers democracy as important as stability" for our Mediterranean neighbours, he added.
Mr Buzek next noted that 20 January was the 20th anniversary of Latvia's "Bloody Sunday", when pro-Soviet troops attacked strategic buildings in the capital of the newly reborn state, killing and injuring many citizens.
He next called on the Iranian authorities to explain the charges against Sahra Bahrami, whom they had hanged on 29 January, for alleged drug-trafficking. Ms Bahrami had been arrested in the wake of the December 2009 Ashura protests.
Mr Buzek also called on the Ugandan authorities to investigate the murder of David Kato in Uganda on 26 January. He deplored the fact that homosexuals are treated as criminals in Uganda.
Lastly, he announced that an extraordinary meeting of the Conference of Presidents, open to all MEPs, would be held on 8 February to debate the outcome of the 4 February European summit. European Council President Hermann von Rompuy would be invited to take part and report on the summit's conclusions, as provided for in the Lisbon Treaty, he added.
Call for EU recognition of Roma genocide in World War II
Prompted by the 66th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp on 27 January, Mr Buzek issued a call for the European Union to give official recognition to the genocide of Roma people perpetrated in World War II by the Nazis and their allies.
"Today we remember our Roma brothers and sisters", said Mr Buzek. "The Roma are the largest ethnic minority in the EU and have also been the most oppressed for the longest time", he pointed out. Only some EU Member States had so far recognised the extermination of the Roma as genocide. "It is time to acknowledge this", urged the EP President, calling for better understanding of their situation and saying we can fight discrimination through education.
Agenda changes
