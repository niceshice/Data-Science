(clockwise from top left) Brandt, Antall, Politkovskaya, Adenauer
Leading post-war Europeans have been honoured by the European Parliament with new buildings due to be named after them. Hungarian post-Soviet PM József Antall, German Chancellors Willy Brandt and Konrad Adenauer and murdered Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya are all honoured. The buildings will house MEPs office space needed after the EU's expansion in 2004 and 2007 as well as a new visitors centre for the public. All figures were judged to have made an impact on Europe's history and values.
József Antall: Hungarian Prime Minister 1990-1993
Located to the right of the former Leopold Station as seen from place du Luxembourg this building will be named after József Antall, who was Hungarian Prime Minister from 1990-93.
Mr Antall, who also died in 1993, played a role in the Hungarian uprising against Soviet rule in 1956 as well as negotiating with Hungary's Communist government in the late 1980's to bring a peaceful transition to democracy. In 1990 he became the first democratically elected Prime Minister to emerge from the rubble of the Soviet empire. He used his mandate to call for the end to the Warsaw pact and tried to orientate Hungary towards the then European Community as well as NATO.
Willy Brandt: West German Chancellor 1969-74 who championed "Ostpolitik"
As West Germany's first Socialist post-war Chancellor Willy Brandt made his name with his "Ostpolitik" peace overtures towards East Germany and the Soviet bloc in the early 1970's. He also memorably knelt before the memorial of the Warsaw uprising of 1944 to seek atonement for Nazi Germany's brutal suppression of the rising. In 1971 he was awarded the Nobel Peace prize - largely for his Ostpolitik policies. Between 1979 and 1983 he was a member of the European Parliament.
Willy Brandt had started his political career as a member of Germany's Socialist SPD in 1930. Four years later he was forced to leave Germany for Scandinavia due to Hitler's suppression of all dissent. Working as a journalist he reported on the Nuremburg war tribunals in 1945 before returning to Germany and becoming a citizen again in 1948. The following year he was elected to the German Bundestag. He died in 1992.
The Parliament's building being named after Willy Brandt is the one to the left of the Leopold station as seen from Place du Luxembourg.
Konrad Adenauer: West German Chancellor 1949-63 who sought reconciliation
Konrad Adenauer was one of the most important figures in post-war German history. As a long standing Chancellor of West Germany he worked to try and rebuild both the reputation and position of Germany in the post Nazi period. He also presided over the post war German "economic miracle".
During his term in office played a key role in supporting the creation of the European Economic Community of initially six nations in 1957. This was in line with his policy of rapprochement with France - something his good relations with France's General De Gaulle helped achieve. Adenauer also believed in close relationship and role in Europe for the United States.
The bridge that connects the Antall and Brandt buildings to Parliament's older buildings will be named after Mr Adenauer. A Parliament building in Luxembourg also currently bears his name.
Anna Politkovskaya: Russian journalist highlighting abuses in Chechnya
In her career as a journalist reporting on the Chechen wars of the 1990's Anna Politkovskaya earned many admirers - and also made many enemies. Her writing - both of books and articles - was recognised by an international audience for its honesty and the courage needed to report in such a war zone. Her work also brought her condemnation from the Russian military and their masters in the Kremlin.
After numerous death threats and one attempt on her life she was shot dead in the lift of her Moscow apartment block on 7 October 2006. Anna Politkovskaya was one of the EP's three finalists for the 2007 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. The Parliament has named a room where press conferences are held in her honour.
