At the opening of today's plenary session in Brussels, Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek made reference to Monday's flood of toxic waste in Hungary, the anniversary of the murder of Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya and the EP's support for abolition of the death penalty.
Mr Buzek first expressed the EP's sympathy to the Hungarian people following Monday's release of toxic waste following a dam burst, which caused four deaths and over 300 injuries. He described it as "one of the worst disasters in the history of their country" and said "the European Parliament offers its full support and solidarity to Hungary in this difficult time."
He then paid tribute to Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was assassinated four years ago tomorrow, as well as to other Russian activists, and urged the Russian authorities to do their best to enforce the rule of law.
Lastly, looking ahead to World Day against the Death Penalty on 10 October, the President reiterated Parliament's call for a moratorium on executions, saying "death can never be regarded as a form of justice". The EP, he said, was glad to see progress in Russia, Burundi and Togo but regretted the situation in Japan and the USA and was particularly concerned at the number of executions in China and Iran.
Agenda changes
A number of changes to the plenary agenda were approved. Today, Wednesday, a debate - with Council and Commission statements - on the social provisions of the Lisbon Treaty was added to the agenda, to be taken after the joint debate on the oral questions on biodiversity. The debate on the oral question on "Containers lost at sea and compensation" was removed from the agenda. On Thursday, the votes will begin at 11.30am instead of 11.00 and the report by Vladimír MAŇKA (S&D, SK) on the draft amending budget no. 2/2010 - part 2 (BUDG) was taken off the agenda.
