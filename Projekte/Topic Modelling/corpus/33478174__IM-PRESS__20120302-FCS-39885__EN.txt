International Women's Day 2012: equal pay for equal work
Institutions
2012-03-16 - 11:16
Poster of the woman day The EP has dedicated this year's International Women's Day to the theme "equal pay for equal work" as women in the EU are still on average paid 17% less then men. Slovakian Christian-Democrat MEP Edit Bauer, author of a report on how to close the gender pay gap, said more needed to be done about this: "Progress is extremely slow".
The report on equal pay said there were many reasons, often complex and related, why women continued to be paid less than men. Experts claim half of the difference is due to direct and indirect discrimination. Other causes cited include women tending to do more part-time work than men and often dominating in lower-paid sectors or industries with fewer opportunities for collective representation and bargaining power. Research also shows a marked difference once women return to the labour market after their first maternity leave.
Programme of events in Brussels
7 March : seminar for journalists and screening of the film "Made in Dagenham" about a strike in favour of equal pay in England in 1968
8 March : interparliamentary meeting. This is an event that brings together European and national MPs from parliamentary committees for equal opportunities to share their experiences and best practices on the effectiveness of current measures to reduce the gender pay gap and elaborate on potential further initiatives to tackle its causes. The meeting is open to the public. During the event three discussion panels are foreseen, focusing on the following topics: segregation of the labour market as a factor of inequality; closing the gender pay gap - experiences and best practices from national parliaments; and how can the EU support member states in tackling the gender pay gap.

Mind the gap: how women have to work until today to earn what men did last year
Infograph on the gender pay gap You can't put a price on equality but you certainly can measure it in weeks: today marks how much longer women have had to work to earn as much as men did in 2011. The second European Equal Pay Day calls attention to the continuing gap between men's and women's salaries by indicating when women achieve pay equality with men in the previous year.
Equality between women and men is one of the core values of the European Union. The principle of equal pay for equal work was enshrined in the Treaty of Rome in 1957, but more than 50 years later men and women are still often paid differently for doing the same work.

Gender pay gap: "It's time to go from legislation to good practice"
Edit Bauer "How is it possible that after having legislation on equal pay for over 50 years it doesn't work and we still have a 16%-17% gender pay gap in the EU?" asks Slovakian Christian Democrat Edit Bauer. Mrs Bauer is the author of a report on equal pay for male and female workers for equal work or work of equal value. In this interview Mrs Bauer speaks about the EU's focus for this year's International Women's Day, to be celebrated on 8 March.
What are the consequences of the pay gap in the short, medium and long term? It's not just that women are at a higher risk of falling into poverty. Statistics show that the gender gap is growing with age. There is also a gap when it comes to pensions and older women have a greater risk of falling into poverty than men do. Long term consequences: in those countries where the gap is the smallest, the birth rate is the highest, so the lack of equality has consequences for the demographic trend. It also affects economic competitiveness. What needs to be changed to overcome this reality? Even in sectors where women employees prevail, men used to have higher salaries. Horizontal and vertical segregations of economic sectors is deeply rooted in the structure of the economy but it has also much to do with culture and with society's approach to motherhood. What is really striking is there are now more women who graduate, and statistics show that women who start their working careers are better paid than young men in the UK. The gap appears for the first time when women return to the labour market after their first maternal leave. I have a feeling that the demographic crisis and its consequences will affect us in the future as much as the economic crisis does now. It's time to change the approach to motherhood and evaluate parenthood in society. What are the concrete proposals of your report and how can the EU help tackling this problem? It is a very complex issue. It is an illusion to expect that any change of legislation will profoundly change the whole situation. It seems to me that everybody should contribute to solving the situation. In the Parliament legislation is the only tool we have and I ask myself the question: how is it possible after having legislation on equal pay for over 50 years it doesn't work and we still have a 16%-17% gender pay gap? It is necessary to take a look at the legislation and check why it is so less effective in comparison with other fields. Our answer is: we should make legislation more effective and impose some sanctions which could be unusual as first steps but necessary, because without any sanctions it will not work. There are some good examples of good practices to block access to privileges coming from public procurement and European funds. Why do we grant free access to those who do not accept and breach the principle of equal pay? Member states have very different situations regarding collective bargaining and the position of trade unions for example. We need to empower those who apply for a job so that they are able to get some information about the salaries situation. The wage system should be more transparent. There is a proposal to publish the structure of salaries once a year, on equal pay day for example. There are also good examples of this in the EU. There are very few discrimination cases taken to court, so it is also necessary to think about how to help those who are suffering from wage discrimination to take their cases to court or empower equality bodies so that they are able to impose sanctions. If you had to tweet a message on the 2012 International Women's Day what would it be? Its time to go from legislation to good practice and its time to close the gender pay gap.

Interparliamentary meeting: how to tackle the gender pay gap
The European Parliament highlighted the theme of "equal pay for equal work" as part of its celebrations for International Women's day 2012 on March 8. For the last special event MEPs discussed with citizens and their counterparts from the national parliaments how to best tackle the continuing gender pay gap as women in the EU are still paid on average 17% less than men.
Martin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, opened the debate. He called the question of pay equality "one of the central challenges we are facing today". He said that although female students represent almost 60% of all university graduates, women are still underrepresented in company board rooms.
Also attending the conference were: Viviane Reding, European Commission vice-president responsible for justice, fundamental rights and citizenship; Edit Bauer, member of the EP's women's rights committee; and Egemen Bagis, the Turkish minister for EU Affairs and chief negotiator.
We asked eight women who attended the conference: "What can the EP do to eliminate the gender pay gap?" Click on the slideshow to see what they said. Video EuroparlTV video Flickr
