Future distribution of EP seats among EU Member States

2007-10-16 - 09:44
On 12 October, the European Parliament adopted a report proposing a new allocation of seats between Member States after the next elections in 2009. It is now for the Member States to decide whether to accept Parliament's proposal alongside the Reform Treaty. MEPs are also calling for a revision of the proposed distribution of seats in time for the 2014-2019 parliamentary term.
At their June 2007 summit, EU heads of state and government asked the European Parliament to table a proposal by October this year for the redistribution of its seats. This redistribution is needed because the summit decided to raise the number of seats, as laid down in the amended Nice Treaty, from 736 to 750.
The following allocation of seats in the European Parliament for the 2009-2014 parliamentary term, as proposed by the two co-rapporteurs, Alain Lamassoure (EPP-ED, FR) and Adrian Severin (PES, RO), was approved with 378 votes in favour, 154 against and 109 abstentions:

(1) Population figures as officially established on 7 November 2006 by the Commission in Doc. 15124/06 on the basis of Eurostat figures.
(2) "Nice": Distribution of Seats according to Art. 189 TEC as modified by Art. 9 of the BG/RO - Act of Accession.
(3) "New": New Proposal on the basis of Art. 9A TEU new (I-20).
(4) The new figures concerning Germany and Malta derive automatically from the draft reform treaty provisions.
According to the draft reform treaty, Parliament's new composition will be decided by the European Council acting by unanimity, on the basis of Parliament's proposal and after obtaining its consent.

The debate in Parliament
During the debates in committee and in plenary ahead of the vote, some MEPs wanted to examine the possibility of replacing the number of residents as the basis for calculating the allocation of seats among Member States with the number of European citizens. The two co-rapporteurs based their proposal on the Eurostat figures for the number of residents in each Member State, having concluded that there were too many differences in the concept of citizenship between the Member States for this to be a viable option, at least for the time being.
The current proposal does not permanently resolve the issue. Parliament asked, in adopting the report, for the proposed distribution to be revised again, well in advance of the 2014-2019 legislative term, setting up an objective and fair system for allocating the seats in the Parliament, in order take account of demographic changes and "avoid the traditional political horse-trading between Member States".
Finally, Parliament decided not to consider future Member States, such as Croatia, when allocating seats, so as to avoid pre-judging future enlargements. It also proposed that future accessions could be accompanied by a temporary increase over the 750-seat ceiling, as was done for Bulgaria and Romania.
Legal background and the IGC mandate
Under current rules (the Treaty of Nice as amended by the accession treaties with Bulgaria and Romania), the number of MEPs for the next legislature, 2009-2014, would be 736. However, the June 2007 European Council decided to raise the number from 736 to 750.
The mandate which the government leaders drew up at the June summit for the intergovernmental conference (IGC), which is to finalise the Reform Treaty, maintains the procedure and the principles of Parliament's composition formulated in the draft constitutional treaty. The June 2007 European Council conclusions called on Parliament to "pave the way for settling the issue of the future composition of the European Parliament in good time before the 2009 elections". This decision, said the EU leaders, should respect the following principles:
the maximum number of MEPS would be 750,
the maximum number of seats attributed to a Member State is to be lowered from 99 to 96 (at present, only Germany has the maximum of 99 seats),
the minimum number of seats allocated to any Member State is to be raised from 5 to 6 (at present, only Malta has five seats), and
seats are to be allocated according to a “degressive proportionality” principle.
The "degressive proportionality" principle
Although, in practice, seats have always been allocated in accordance with a degressive proportionality principle, this is the first time this principle has been clearly established in a treaty. The European Council mandate did not include a definition of this principle. The Parliament affirmed that the principle of degressive proportionality means that the ratio between the population and the number of seats of each Member State must vary in relation to their respective populations, in such a way that each Member from a more populous Member State represents more citizens than each Member from a less populous Member State.
Moreover, MEPs agreed that an allocation of the seats that follows the "degressive proportionality" method allowed the combination of:
the principle of efficiency, by imposing a ceiling on the number of Members at a level which is still compatible with the role of a legislative assembly,
the principle of plurality, by allowing the main constituents of the spectrum of political opinion in each Member State – particularly the majority and the opposition – to be represented, and
the principle of solidarity, whereby the more populous States agree to be under-represented in order to allow the less populous States to be better represented.
Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania 2005 - numerical implications
At the start of the present legislature, the number of seats was 732, allocated according to the Act of accession of 2003 which governed the enlargement of the Union to 25 Member States.
With the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, in mid-legislature, the number was temporarily increased to 785, to include MEPs from these two countries (18 for Bulgaria and 35 for Romania), without obliging any MEPs to give up their seats in mid-term.
The same Act of Accession, which amended the Nice Treaty's provisions, set the post-2009 size of the Parliament at 736 members.
Since the reform mandate brings the number of seats up to 750, there are 14 seats to be allocated. To this figure, two seats should be added, since Germany would automatically lose 3 seats due to the 96 cap and Malta would gain one due to the new minimum. Therefore, the final figure of additional seats to be distributed, as compared to the current rules, is 16.
