Hospital disinfectants that might have been taken off the market in 2010 will be reprieved until 2014, to allow more time for their ingredients to be properly tested for safety. This is the result of an agreement between MEPs and the Council of Ministers which the full Parliament endorsed in Strasbourg with 652 votes in favour, 5 against and 17 abstentions.
The first-reading agreement on the directive on biocidal products was negotiated by MEPs led by rapporteur Daciana Octavia SÃ‚RBU (PES, RO).
Under a directive adopted in 1998 on the placing of biocidal products on the market (Directive 98/8/EC), a ten-year transition period was laid down, running until 14 May 2010, to allow "active substances" used in biocides such as disinfectants to be assessed and, if safe, placed on a centralised European Community positive list of approved substances.
It now appears that ten years will not be enough, with the danger that the transition period during which the biocides market continues to be regulated by national rules will expire before the Community positive list is in place. This means that important products such as hospital disinfectants would have to be removed from the market as of 15 May 2010 unless steps are taken to allow national rules to continue to apply for the time being.
The Commission suggested prolonging the transition period by a further three years (to 2013) but Parliament's proposal for an extra year was accepted by Council so the deadline will now be 14 May 2014. The transition period could be extended again through comitology but only for a further two years.
