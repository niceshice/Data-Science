a, b, Conciliation
Codecision is the most important law-making procedure at European level: it is based on the principle of equality of the European Parliament and Council of Ministers as co-legislators. Codecision applies to areas such as transport policy, the environment and consumer protection. Two thirds of European laws are adopted jointly by the European Parliament and the Council.
Conciliation is a special third-reading stage of the Codecision procedure. It takes place if Parliament and Council have not been able to reach agreement on a draft law at first or second reading. The two co-legislators hold direct negotiations: up against tight deadlines, they must reach agreement if the act concerned is to become law.
Conciliation procedures are almost always successful: agreement is reached by the specially-convened Conciliation Committee, and Parliament (in third reading, in plenary) and Council then ratify this. Occasionally, however, conciliation fails: either it proves impossible to find agreement, or one of the two sides subsequently fails to approve the agreement reached in the Conciliation Committee. Then, the act does not become law and the Commission can only restart the legislative process by presenting a new draft law.
Two recent laws which were finalised through conciliation are the Directive on the Quality of Bathing Waters and the Directive on Batteries and Accumulators.
