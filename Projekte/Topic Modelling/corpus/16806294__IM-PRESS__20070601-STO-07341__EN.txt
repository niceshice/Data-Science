learning never stops - rapporteur Mantovani
You study hard and get qualifications that you are proud of. But what if they are not accepted by other countries in Europe? This could adversely affect the possibilities for qualified people to work and live across the continent. Parliament's Employment Committee will vote Thursday on the European Qualifications Framework (EQF), which aims to allow qualifications to "travel" more easily. In an exclusive interview we asked the rapporteur Mario Mantovani (EPP-ED) about the proposals.
Why is it important to have common European framework for qualifications and diplomas?
Well, it is part of the Lisbon strategy, which means the creation of more jobs and making the European economy the most competitive in the world. That's why we have to focus on learning not just in school but during the entire lifetime, and this needs constant and continuous updating, considering the speed of world evolution. We always need to be ready, so that we can give the best of ourselves, using our life experience.
The EU and European Parliament have been working to achieve free movement of people in the EU. Don't you think there is a contradiction in continuing to have different values for diplomas in Europe?
On the contrary, but I think that the European framework on lifelong learning will improve mobility within the EU. I think of researchers, young students, volunteers and in general all who need to move within Europe....you recall the story of the Polish plumber who frightened France, probably one of the reasons the French voted against the constitution. Well, I am convinced that thanks to this European framework on qualifications we can overcome these difficulties. The Polish plumber's diploma and qualifications will be recognised, as will those of Italian, French, German or Romanian plumbers. A more organic framework makes people feel equal everywhere in Europe.
The debate is focusing on a voluntary framework for diplomas and qualifications. What is the advantage?
This is a recommendation - so it is a bit less political and much more technical. If every qualification required in school or somewhere else was obligatory, it would pose problems for Member states which move at different speeds. The fact that the framework on lifelong learning is not binding allows countries to use it and to adapt their national diplomas. This gradual approach won't pose a problem for EU countries, which a directive might.
What stage have you reached in your personal life- long learning?
If I have to fix a level - in line with the qualification framework structure based on 8 levels of knowledge, ability and skills - I would like to belong to the last level, even if it does not reflect my personal history. What is important is our enthusiasm and the move towards improvements in our working environment and our life.
The report will go to the entire Parliament in September.
