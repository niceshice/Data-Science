Debate with PM Gordon Brown on the preparations of the G20 Summit - London 2 April
At 3pm (Strasbourg time) on Tuesday 24 March, Gordon Brown will deliver a speech to the European Parliament on the preparation of the G20 Summit on 2 April. Political group leaders will participate in the debate with Prime Minister Brown responding at the end. The UK currently holds the rotating presidency of the G20. On 2 April 2009, world leaders from the G20 countries – representing 85% of the world’s output – will meet in London. They will meet against the backdrop of the worst international banking crisis in generations.
London April G20 Summit - MEPs to quiz Council and Commission
The November 2008 Washington Summit led to an action plan for dealing with the financial and economic crisis. Meanwhile, financial markets and financial institutions remain severely perturbed and under distress. The economic situation worldwide is deteriorating further as the malaise spreads to other countries. Pervenche BERÈS (PES, FR), on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will be asking the Council and Commission questions on forthcoming summit.
Czech PM on the conclusions of the European Council
Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek will present the conclusions of the European Council of 19 and 20 March to MEPs in Strasbourg at 9am on Wednesday. The European Council is focussing on the economic and financial situation, energy and climate change, external relations and the European Council will receive an update from the Taoiseach on the Lisbon Treaty.
European conscience and heroes of the fight against totalitarianism
Hanna FOLTYN-KUBICKA (UEN, PL), on behalf of the UEN Group, will be asking the Council and Commission questions on the European conscience and heroes of the fight against totalitarianism. MEPs will vote on a resolution on 2 April.
Safer cosmetics
Parliament will be asked to approve an update of EU legislation on cosmetics when it votes on a first-reading agreement thrashed out between EP and Council representatives. The basic aim of the new regulation is to remove legal uncertainties and inconsistencies, while increasing the safety of cosmetics. Parliament's amendments add further improvements, especially regarding the claims companies make for their products and the safety of nanomaterials used in cosmetics.
Avoiding potential risks of electromagnetic fields
Antennas, mobile phone masts and other electromagnetic emitting devices should be set within a specific distance from schools and health institutions, according to a report to be voted on next week by the European Parliament. The Commission should make more reliable information available about the effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields to citizens who feel that they are not well informed. The report acknowledges the wide use of wireless technologies and other electromagnetic emitting technologies and their benefits to society, but also raises concerns over their "continuing uncertainties about possible health risks."
Fresh impetus for Single European Sky
A safer and more efficient European air traffic control system is the main goal of two regulations revising the Single European Sky legislation that should be approved by Parliament following a first reading agreement reached on 17 March between MEPs and EU transport ministers. The first regulation in the second Single European Sky package (SES II) is designed to improve the performance and sustainability of the European aviation system, the second to improve the safety of aerodromes, air traffic management and air navigation services.
Novel foods - MEPs to set out new rules
The European Parliament will debate and vote next week in Strasbourg on a proposal to update the EU regulation on novel foods. The report by the Environment Committee calls on the Commission to ban the placing on the market of food derived from cloned animals and their descendants. MEPs also want food being produced by nanotechnology processes to undergo a specific risk assessment before being approved for use.
Stop female genital mutilation
A clear strategy for banning female genital mutilation on EU territory and the need to acknowledge the problem in EU immigration law and cooperation agreements are among the key points of a report proposed by the EP Women's Rights Committee, aimed at stamping out this practice. Since FGM is a violation of rights, it can constitute a legitimate reason for applying for refugee status, says the report. This point was not supported unanimously by the committee and some MEPs voted against the report because of it and may therefore be subject to an alternative resolution.
Best practices in regional policy
Regional development projects need simpler procedures and a clearer division of powers and responsibilities among the EU, Member States and regional and local authorities. The own-initiative report adopted by the Regional Development Committee on 11 February proposes possible common criteria for defining best practices, with a view to overcoming obstacles to use of the structural funds. It also suggests instruments to make these practices more accessible and visible to potential stakeholders.
Getting the best out of urban development spending
Cities, which are home to 80% of the EU's 492 million people, need fully integrated urban development plans to tackle their economic, social and environmental problems, says this report, which urges EU Member States to delegate the management of EU money for urban sustainability projects to cities, and calls for more flexibility to combine funding from different sources.
Urban development should be a strategic priority
The report regrets that Member States are not obliged to promote urban development as a strategic priority. It urges them, the European Commission, and regional and local authorities to evaluate impact of mainstreaming the URBAN initiative (stakeholder partnerships, integrated approach and "bottom-up" input to planning) and to monitor the impact of EU funds in urban areas.
Getting the best out of rural development spending
Rural per capita income and access to goods and services are best improved by supporting non-agricultural activities in rural areas, without depleting farmers' incomes, says this report, which calls for figures on the take-up of rural development funding under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), and advocates closer co-ordination of rural and regional development measures, so as to enhance their combined impact.
Territorial cohesion and future cohesion policy
Pointers to a reformed EU regional development policy, built around the concepts of (economic) concentration, connection and co-operation, are set out in this report, which responds to the Commission's Fifth progress report on economic and social cohesion and Green Paper on territorial cohesion. Parliament's report calls inter alia for a more comprehensive system of "transitional" assistance to regions about to rise above the full structural funding eligibility threshold (75% of EU average GDP) and a formal multi-level system of governance, to involve all stakeholders in regional policy design and implementation.
Implementation of Structural Funds Regulations 2007-2013
This report responds to a Commission Communication on regional policy programmes for 2007-2013, which, with investments of €347 billion, make up the second-largest item in EU budget. 81.5% of investment funds go to "convergence" (i.e. fully eligible - under 75% of EU average GDP) regions, which are home to 35% of the EU population.
A closer and deeper strategic partnership with the USA
A new transatlantic partnership is needed to strengthen ties between the EU and America now that Barack Obama has taken office, says the EP Foreign Affairs Committee. MEPs are calling for a new institutional architecture including a political council and a joint parliamentary committee.
Better coordination between the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
Increasingly, the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development are financing operations in the same geographical areas, including Eastern Europe, the Southern Caucasus, Russia, the Western Balkans, and soon, Turkey. In light of this, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is calling for increased cooperation between the two institutions.
EU - Belarus relations
MEPs will debate EU-Belarus relations after hearing statements from Council and Commission. Parliament will vote on a resolution during the plenary session in Brussels on 2 April.
Cigarette tax at least €1.50 per pack from 2014
A gradual increase in minimum tax rates on cigarettes, to at least €1.50 per pack by 2014, and other tobacco products, is backed by the Economic Affairs Committee, but it advocates smaller increases than those proposed by the Commission. The aim of the proposed legislation is to avoid distorting the single market and to foster tax convergence (tobacco tax rates currently differ from Member State to Member State).
Multilingualism: an asset for Europe
EU citizens must be helped and encouraged to learn languages other than their own if they are to derive full economic, social and cultural benefit from freedom of movement, says a report tabled by the Culture Committee. The committee's own-initiative report, which is a response to a Commission Communication on multilingualism, was drafted by Vasco Graça Moura (EPP-ED, PT). It stresses the need to promote more and better language teaching, as a knowledge of languages is an asset - and increasingly a necessity - in many walks of life.
Unity and diversity through art
In an increasingly heterogeneous and multicultural world, artistic studies can be used to preserve our identities and to encourage inter-cultural understanding, according to a report by the Committee on Culture and Education. In order for this to happen, the European Union needs to address "significant disparities between the existing artistic education models in the various Member States."
Food aid programme for Europe's poorest people set to expand
The EU food distribution programme for the most deprived people in Europe must continue within the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), be fully funded by the EU and consist purely of food products of Community origin, says the Agriculture Committee. Since the programme came into being in 1987, millions of needy Europeans have received food from intervention stocks of the CAP, distributed via charities and social services. In the mid-1990s, the rules were changed to allow food to be bought on the open market to supplement this source, in certain circumstances.
EU must guarantee reasonable food prices for consumers and profits for farmers
Correcting the market inequalities, and improving direct relations between consumers and producers, in order to guarantee reasonable prices for the former and profits for the latter, are the principle objectives of a report proposed by the Agriculture Committee on the difference in price between production and consumption in the food chain.
Partnership agreements with the Caribbean and Côte d'Ivoire
The EP International Trade Committee will ask Parliament to give its formal assent to allow two Economic Partnership Agreements to go ahead, one with the Caribbean countries grouped in Cariforum, the other with the West African state of Côte d'Ivoire.
Cautious welcome for EU partnership accord with the Caribbean
EU - India Free Trade Agreement
For the last two decades, India has been emerging as a "major innovator, developer, as well as producer and exporter" of goods and services. Due to its geographical size, population and economic growth, it is becoming an influential player in global affairs. The EU is the world s biggest economic bloc, and India is the world's second most populous nation. The EU is India's largest source of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), investing EUR 10 900 million in 2007, whilst India's FDI to the EU has increased from EUR 500 million in 200 to EUR 9 500 million in 2007. The report recognises that "forging an economic alliance is therefore vital to both."
One year after Lisbon: the Africa-EU partnership at work
The Development Committee will submit to the House an own-initiative report drafted in response to the Commission Communication "One year after Lisbon: The Africa-EU partnership at work".
EU must improve its commitment to the Millennium Development Goals
Development and cooperation In the year 2000, the international community, including the European Union, made commitments to halve extreme poverty worldwide by 2015. Currently, most developing countries do not have the resources to meet the eight Millennium Development Goals, so the Committee on Development is calling on the Commission and Member States to increase and standardise their financial contributions.
Future of the car industry
MEPs will debate future of the car industry after hearing statements from the Commission. Ministers have expressed deep concern about the serious situation that the sector is facing at present, putting at risk a very significant number of jobs. In 2008 there were about 8% fewer cars sold in the EU than in 2007. The automotive sector with its 12 million jobs depending on this strategic industry has been hit particularly hard by the current economic crisis with new registrations down by 20% and gloomy expectations for 2009.
EP reviews 2007 - 2013 Financial Framework
The EP is set to vote on a report by the Budget Committee on the mid-term review of the 2007-2013 financial framework. In the current context of economic crisis and forthcoming elections in the EP, the report recommends a realistic rather than ambitious review. It also states that "the general magnitude of EU resources must not be affected" by the global economic problems.
Non-interoperability of mobile phone chargers - MEPs quiz Commission
With reference to the non-interoperability of mobile phone chargers, the Commission will be questioned on what progress has been made towards harmonisation and, in particular, whether it has already taken measures to tackle this problem, which directly affects European consumers (who are obliged to replace chargers which still work) and the environment (because of the enormous quantity of waste thus generated).
Substances that deplete the ozone layer
A compromise has been reached between representatives of the EP and Council on a regulation updating the EU law on substances depleting the ozone layer. The new law brings EU legislation in line with developments of the Montreal protocol aiming at protecting the ozone layer, but goes beyond it, so that the EU will continue to lead by example. The deal does not only cover the marketing ban of certain substances but also substances contained in refrigerators and insulation material in buildings.
A first reading compromise has been achieved
Criticism of "extensive urbanisation" practices in Spain
Extensive urbanisation" practices in Spain are criticised in a report proposed by the Petitions Committee, which suggests interrupting EU aid for the country until the problem is solved. The report deals with problems associated with "extensive urbanisation" in Spain and suggests interrupting the provision of EU aid to the country until these are solved. It says Spain should "suspend and review" all the new urbanisation plans which do not respect the right to legitimate ownership "suspend and review". The report also calls for "adequate compensation" for those affected. Two alternative resolutions will be put to the vote also.
Biometric visas: children under twelve exempted from giving fingerprints
Biometric visas, like biometric passports, should improve security provided the fingerprints they include are reliable. Children under twelve will be exempted from the requirement to provide fingerprints, as MEPs wished, following an agreement with the Council proposed by the EP Civil Liberties Committee.
Working conditions: companies must be liable for subcontractors
Companies must be responsible for the conditions of workers employed by their subcontractors and an EU legal instrument is needed to make sure this is the case say Members of the EP Employment and Social Affairs Committee, referring to the concept of "joint and several liability". There is a possibility that an alternative resolution will be put forward.
Security and fundamental freedoms on the internet
Increasingly, companies, governments, police and even criminals are seeking the greatest possible access to our private data. The internet provides a previously unimaginable level of access to information about our private lives, which unfortunately, can be abused by companies, intelligence services or even identity thieves. A report by the Committee on Civil Liberties Committee proposes action against cybercriminals whilst also guaranteeing fundamental rights to privacy for internet users.
Follow-up to the Declaration of the Sports Ministers of the European Union at their meeting in Biarritz in November 2008
Katerina Batzeli and Doris Pack, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education will be asking questions to the Commission on the follow-up to the Declaration of the Sports Ministers of the European Union at their meeting in Biarritz in November 2008.

Debate with PM Gordon Brown on the preparations of the G20 Summit - London 2 April
2009-03-20 - 09:31
At 3pm (Strasbourg time) on Tuesday 24 March, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown will deliver a speech to the European Parliament on the preparation of the G20 Summit on 2 April. Political group leaders will participate in the debate with Prime Minister Brown responding at the end. The UK currently holds the rotating presidency of the G20. The London G20 Summit
On 2 April 2009, world leaders from the G20 countries – representing 85% of the world’s output – will meet in London. They will meet against the backdrop of the worst international banking crisis in generations.
Confidence in the international banking system has fallen. Major institutions have failed. Countries around the world have entered recession, with falling trade and rising unemployment.
At the Summit, countries need to come together to enhance global coordination in order to help restore global economic growth. World leaders must make three commitments:
First, to take whatever action is necessary to stabilise financial markets and enable families and businesses to get through the recession.
Second, to reform and strengthen the global financial and economic system to restore confidence and trust.
Third, to put the global economy on track for sustainable growth.
The London Summit will take place against the backdrop of exceptionally challenging economic circumstances. But, just as after the Second World War, visionary leaders laid the groundwork for 30 years of prosperity and growth built on international economic cooperation, this crisis is also an opportunity.
The world’s leading economies can come together and lay the foundations not just for a sustainable economic recovery, but also for a genuinely new era of international economic partnership – a global deal, in which all countries have a part to play and all will see the benefits.
What is the G20?
The Group of Twenty (G-20) Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors was established in 1999 to bring together systemically important industrialized and developing economies to discuss key issues in the global economy. The inaugural meeting of the G20 took place in Berlin, on 15-16 December 1999, hosted by German and Canadian finance ministers.
Mandate
The G20 is an informal forum that promotes open and constructive discussion between industrial and emerging-market countries on key issues related to global economic stability. By contributing to the strengthening of the international financial architecture and providing opportunities for dialogue on national policies, international co-operation, and international financial institutions, the G20 helps to support growth and development across the globe.
Origins
The G20 was created as a response both to the financial crises of the late 1990s and to a growing recognition that key emerging-market countries were not adequately represented at the core of global economic discussion and governance. Prior to the G-20 creation, similar groupings to promote dialogue and analysis had been established at the initiative of the G-7. The G-22 met at Washington D.C. in April and October 1998. Its aim was to involve non-G-7 countries in the resolution of global aspects of the financial crisis then affecting emerging-market countries. Two subsequent meetings comprising a larger group of participants (G-33) held in March and April 1999 discussed reforms of the global economy and the international financial system. The proposals made by the G-22 and the G-33 to reduce the world economy's susceptibility to crises showed the potential benefits of a regular international consultative forum embracing the emerging-market countries. Such a regular dialogue with a constant set of partners was institutionalized by the creation of the G20 in 1999.
Membership
The G20 is made up of the finance ministers and central bank governors of 19 countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. The European Union who is represented by the rotating Council presidency and the European Central Bank. To ensure global economic fora and institutions work together, the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the President of the World Bank, plus the chairs of the International Monetary and Financial Committee and Development Committee of the IMF and World Bank, also participate in G20 meetings on an ex-officio basis.
The G-20 thus brings together important industrial and emerging-market countries from all regions of the world. Together, member countries represent around 90 per cent of global gross national product, 80 per cent of world trade (including EU intra-trade) as well as two-thirds of the world's population. The G20's economic weight and broad membership gives it a high degree of legitimacy and influence over the management of the global economy and financial system.

European conscience and heroes of the fight against totalitarianism
2009-03-20 - 09:31
Hanna FOLTYN-KUBICKA (UEN, PL) will be asking the Council and Commission questions on the European conscience and heroes of the fight against totalitarianism. MEPs will vote on a resolution on 2 April. What action does the Council propose to take in response to Written Declaration 0044/2008 - P6_TA(2008)0439 adopted by the Parliament on 9 September 2008, which proclaims 23 August as the European Day of Remembrance for the victims of Stalinism and Nazism? What response does the Council have to the Prague Declaration, adopted at the Prague Conference, ‘European Conscience and Communism’, on 3 June 2008?
Does the Council support the Prague Declaration's proposal that an Institute of European Memory and Conscience be established, as a European research institute for the studies of totalitarianism and as a pan-European museum/memorial for all the victims of totalitarian regimes, demonstrating the comparison of crimes committed against humanity by totalitarian Communist and Nazi regimes?
In addition, does the Council support the initiative taken by the UEN group to proclaim 25 May as the International Day of the Heroes of the Fight Against Totalitarianism?
25 May is the anniversary of the execution of Rotamaster Witold Pilecki, the only person who voluntarily went to a concentration camp during World War II in order to organise the resistance movement there and collect information about mass murders, and who after his escape from Auschwitz fought first the Nazi, and then the Communist regimes.
Establishing the International Day of the Heroes of the Fight Against Totalitarianism would be a great way of keeping a living memory of the past and the people like Czech Karel Stransky or German Otto Küsel and many others who, similarly to Witold Pilecki, should be written into the awareness of Europeans as the heroes of the totalitarian age, because of their dedication, faithfulness to ideals, humanism, honour and courage.
President Vaclav Klaus of the Czech Republic, the country holding the Presidency of the EU, has already voiced his support for this initiative.
What is the Council’s position towards the group’s proposal? Would the Council agree to support proclaiming 25 May as the International Day of the Heroes of the Fight Against Totalitarianism? Hanna FOLTYN-KUBICKA UEN PL Council & Commission statements

London April G20 Summit - MEPs to quiz Council and Commission
2009-03-20 - 09:31
The November 2008 Washington Summit led to an action plan for dealing with the financial and economic crisis. Meanwhile, financial markets and financial institutions remain severely perturbed and under distress. The economic situation worldwide is deteriorating further as the malaise spreads to other countries. Pervenche BERÈS (PES, FR), on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will be asking the Council and Commission questions on the London April G20 Summit.
Delivering on the Washington action plan is crucial. The April G20 Summit should therefore aim not only to deliver on short-term measures under the action plan, as expected, but must also steer towards an international agreement on the actions to be undertaken in the mid- to longer term, with a detailed timetable for decision and implementation.
It must deliver, in particular, on the following issues:
– short- and long-term steps towards the reduction of global imbalances,
– revision of IMF and World Bank governance,
– improving the role of the IMF in ensuring multilateral surveillance and enhanced resources for the IMF,
– review of the scope of financial regulation worldwide, with special emphasis on institutions, instruments and markets that are currently unregulated, so as to ensure that all systemically important institutions are appropriately regulated,
– revision of governance of the IASB and accounting standards,
– remuneration and incentive models,
– the fight against rising protectionist tendencies.
These and other issues need to be addressed in order to restore the situation in the financial markets and to avoid further negative spillover and damage to the fragile economic situation.
Does the Council share these views? What is the message that the EU will deliver at the G20 Summit in April, in particular on the abovementioned issues? What will the EU’s contribution to the Summit agenda be? How will the Council ensure that the G20 deals successfully with the challenges outlined above? How will the EU organise its representation and participation in these debates and ensure that the European Parliament’s views are taken on board?

Better coordination between the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
2009-03-20 - 09:31
Increasingly, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)are financing operations in the same geographical areas, including Eastern Europe, the Southern Caucasus, Russia, the Western Balkans, and soon, Turkey. In light of this, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is calling for increased cooperation between the two institutions. As a consequence of their increasingly similar areas of operation, the European Parliament has, for the first time issued a joint report on the activities of the EIB and the EBRD. The report welcomes their efforts towards combating the financial crisis, and calls for the two institutions to work together more efficiently in areas of common interest.
Cooperation between the EIB and the EBRD
Currently, there are three different types of cooperation between the two banks in their various areas of common operation. In Eastern Europe, there is a Memorandum of Understanding, where the EBRD takes the lead, and provides for joint investment, whilst in the Western Balkans there has been a move away from competition to cooperation through pooling of funds. More recently, in Turkey the banks have reached an agreement based on the definition of "specific and common areas of competence, with the leading bank to be determined on a case-by-case basis."
Clearly, as the objectives, modes of operating and the expertise of the two banks are very different, there cannot simply be an arbitrary division between lending operations in the public and private sectors. Therefore, the report takes the view that in countries of common operation, their actions should be complementary, depending on the comparative advantage of each bank.
In order to achieve more effective cooperation, the report makes a number of suggestions to improve collaboration at all levels of both organisations. Committee MEPs recommend that there should be an improved functional division of labour, which will allow each organisation to "focus on their respective skills and strengths." The report also suggests that EIB specialises in the financing of larger scale projects, whilst the EBRD focuses on smaller-scale investments, but at the same time that a definition of types of projects and sectors which are of interest to both banks should be constructed so they are able to pool their knowledge and resources.
International financial institutions
In order to make a real impact on regions further away from the European Union's sphere of influence, the committee recommends that the EIB and EBRD work together with other international and regional financial organisations. A closer working relationship will help to ensure that overlaps and duplications in funding do not occur.
The activities of other multinational development banks and institutions clearly have a positive impact on the developing world, the report calls on the Commission to analyse in detail their full impact, in relation to the objectives and operations of the European Development Fund.
Global economic crisis
Under current conditions of economic crisis, and increased difficulties in accessing credit, the operations of the two banks are even more important, in relation to their provision of credit to the public and private sectors. In light of the European Economic Recovery Plan, the EIB has decided to "increase [its] lending volume by 30% in 2009 and 2010"; a move which is welcomed by the committee. The report calls on the EIB and EBRD to ensure that even in times of financial strain, that they are active in promoting projects which support renewable energy sources and combat climate change.

European Council
Czech PM on the conclusions of the European Council
2009-03-20 - 09:31
Mirek Topolanek the Czech Prime Minister will present the conclusions of the European Council of 19 and 20 March to MEPs in Strasbourg at 9am on Wednesday. The European Council is focussing on the economic and financial situation, energy and climate change, external relations and the European Council will receive an update from the Taoiseach on the Lisbon Treaty. The UK government believes that s hort-term actions in response to the economic crisis should be consistent with the medium to long term Lisbon strategy. This provides a vital framework for driving economic reform within the EU , and for long term sustainable, low carbon recovery and growth.
The European Parliament has rightly spoken out against protectionism and thus has played a significant role in influencing the EU’s response to the current downturn.
The conclusions of the European Council will be available via the link hereunder. Results of the European Council (19.20 March)

Safer cosmetics
2009-03-20 - 09:31
Parliament will be asked to approve an update of EU legislation on cosmetics when it votes on a first-reading agreement thrashed out between EP and Council representatives. The basic aim of the new regulation is to remove legal uncertainties and inconsistencies, while increasing the safety of cosmetics. Parliament's amendments add further improvements, especially regarding the claims companies make for their products and the safety of nanomaterials used in cosmetics. This legislation has been guided through Parliament by MEP Dagmar Roth-Behrendt (PES, DE), the rapporteur for the Environment and Public Health Committee. Many of Parliament's wishes have been taken on board in the final text of the regulation
Broad backing for Commission proposal
MEPs agreed from the outset with the Commission's approach of simplifying EU law on cosmetics by replacing the 27 sets of national legislation that enacted the old cosmetics directive with a single regulation - a standard legal text directly applicable in all Member States. They also supported the essential aims of the new proposal: ensuring a high level of safety of cosmetic products in future by strengthening manufacturer responsibility and in-market control aspects while cutting red tape. The existing provisions banning animal testing for finished cosmetic products as of 2004, with a phasing-out period for animal tests on cosmetic ingredients by 2009/2013, are unaffected by the new regulation.
Nanomaterials: labelling, definition and safety assessment needed
If cosmetics ingredients include nanomaterials, as happens increasingly, safety concerns must be paramount, says the compromise between EP and Council.
The Commission estimated in 2006 that about 5% of cosmetic products contained nanoparticles. As requested by the Environment Committee, the new regulation introduces a safety assessment procedure for all products containing nanomaterials, which could lead to a ban on a substance if there is a risk to human health. MEPs also pushed successfully for any nanomaterials present in cosmetics to be mentioned in the list of ingredients on the packaging.
Thanks to Parliament, a definition of nanomaterials is also introduced in the regulation and this must be adapted by the Commission in line with scientific and technological advances. The definition introduced by MEPs is as follows: "'nanomaterial' means an insoluble or bioresistant and intentionally manufactured material with one or more external dimensions, or an internal structure, on the scale from 1 to 100 nm".
Product claims: common criteria for use needed
On the use of product claims for cosmetics (such as claims about their effectiveness) the regulation seeks to ensure that only the real effects of a product can be mentioned in advertising and labelling. The Commission is asked to draw up an action plan on such claims and to adopt a list of common criteria for their use.
Substances classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction
As proposed by the Commission and supported by MEPs, the regulation provides for strict rules for the use of substances in cosmetics which are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction (CMR). The use of those substances is basically forbidden and they can only be used in exceptional cases under strict conditions, which have been tightened up by the compromise.
Date of entry into force
The regulation - which is directly applicable in all Member States - will enter into force 20 days after publication in the EU Official Journal. It will apply 42 month later - except for certain parts on CMR substances and nanomaterials, which will apply from an earlier stage.
Background: the 2003 cosmetics directive
The last time this topic came before Parliament, MEPs fought hard and successfully for a ban on sales of any animal-tested cosmetic products and ingredients, including those from outside the EU (see link below). Animal testing of finished cosmetic products was outlawed from 2004. In addition, bans were to be phased in for animal testing of cosmetics ingredients and also - to make sure that imports are covered - on any sales in the EU of animal-tested products and ingredients.
The deal will allow the continued use of ethanol in cosmetics, which is widely used and is the base of most perfumes. There are also provisions which will reduce the regulatory burden on industry, without lowering safety, which sit alongside a requirement to notify nanomaterials and to mark them on the ingredient list.

Avoiding potential risks of electromagnetic fields
2009-03-20 - 09:31
Antennas, mobile phone masts and other electromagnetic emitting devices should be set within a specific distance from schools and health institutions, according to a report to be voted on next week by the European Parliament. The Commission should make more reliable information available about the effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields to citizens who feel that they are not well informed. The report acknowledges the wide use of wireless technologies and other electromagnetic emitting technologies and their benefits to society, but also raises concerns over their "continuing uncertainties about possible health risks." In particular, there are concerns about the exposure of children and young people to electromagnetic fields. Therefore, MEPs of the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee are calling for stricter regulation and protection for residents and consumers.
Better protection for EU citizens through "optimal placement of devices"
The report, drafted by Frédérique RIES (ALDE, BE), notes that industry stakeholders can already influence a number of safety factors, including the direction of the transmitting antenna in relation to living spaces, and the distance between the site and the transmitter. Industry actors are being encouraged to use this power to give better protection to people living nearby, and to prevent a "proliferation of poorly positioned masts and transmitters."
The placement of antennas, mobile phone masts and high-voltage power lines should be negotiated between industry actors, public authorities and residents' associations in order to minimise health risks and legal action cases. This will also ensure that EMF-transmitting devices are kept clear of schools, crèches, retirement homes and health care institutions. In addition to this, the committee recommends that mobile telephone operators should negotiate to share infrastructure in order to reduce "the exposure of the public to EMFs."
Increased access to reliable information
A recently published Eurobarometer study suggests that "the majority of citizens do not feel that the public authorities inform them adequately on measures to protect them from EMFs." In light of this, the report makes a number of suggestions to improve EU citizen's access to reliable information. These suggestions include making maps available on the internet, which show areas of exposure to EMF transmitting devices. In conjunction with this, the Commission should produce a yearly report on the "level of electromagnetic radiation in the EU" and its sources.
Committee MEPs also call for an improvement to consumer information, by amending the technical standards of the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation to impose labelling requirements, which would show the transmitting power of every wireless-operated device.
Review of EMF limits and Interphone findings
The Commission is urged to review "the scientific basis and adequacy of the EMF limits as laid down in Recommendation 1999/519/EC" and to then report back to Parliament. This is in light of the fact that many member states have voluntarily introduced much stricter regulations than are required by the EU.
The report also refers to the Interphone study, which began in 2000, and which is a wide ranging scientific project to look into the links between mobile phones and certain types of cancer, including brain, auditory and parotid gland tumours. The results have been expected since 2006, but have been repeatedly postponed. The Committee is particularly concerned by the "appeal for caution" from Elisabeth Cardis, the coordinator of the Interphone study, that "as far as children are concerned, mobile phones should not be used beyond reasonable limits."
The report therefore calls on the Commission, who has made significant financial contributions towards this study, to ask those who are in charge of the project "why no definitive findings have been published." Parliament and Member States should be informed without delay if a response is given.
Children and young people
Children and young people aged 10 to 20 are amongst the highest users of mobile phones, which is of concern to the Committee as there are uncertainties remaining about the possible health risks, "particularly to young people whose brains are still developing." The report suggests that in order to raise awareness of the dangers of mobile phones, and to encourage good mobile phone techniques, such as using hands-free kits, keeping calls short and switching off phones, that "the Community funding earmarked for studies on EMFs be partly switched to finance" an awareness raising campaign.
Aggressive marketing campaigns by telephone operators, including "the sale of mobile phones designed solely for children or free call time packages aimed at teenagers" are also condemned by the committee.

Reprieve for hospital disinfectants to allow more time for testing
2009-03-20 - 09:31
Hospital disinfectants that might have been taken off the market in 2010 will be reprieved until 2014, to allow more time for their ingredients to be properly tested for safety. This is the result of an agreement between MEPs and the Council of Ministers which the full Parliament will be asked to endorse in Strasbourg. The first-reading agreement on the directive on biocidal products was negotiated by MEPs led by rapporteur Daciana Octavia Sârbu (PES, RO).
Under a directive adopted in 1998 on the placing of biocidal products on the market (Directive 98/8/EC), a ten-year transition period was laid down, running until 14 May 2010, to allow "active substances" used in biocides such as disinfectants to be assessed and, if safe, placed on a centralised European Community positive list of approved substances.
It now appears that ten years will not be enough, with the danger that the transition period during which the biocides market continues to be regulated by national rules will expire before the Community positive list is in place. This means that important products such as hospital disinfectants would have to be removed from the market as of 15 May 2010 unless steps are taken to allow national rules to continue to apply for the time being.
The Commission suggested prolonging the transition period by a further three years (to 2013) but Parliament's proposal for an extra year was accepted by Council so the deadline will now be 14 May 2014. The transition period could be extended again through comitology but only for a further two years.

Transport
Fresh impetus for Single European Sky
2009-03-20 - 09:31
A safer and more efficient European air traffic control system is the main goal of two regulations revising the Single European Sky legislation that should be approved by Parliament following a first reading agreement reached on 17 March between MEPs and EU transport ministers. The first regulation in the second Single European Sky package (SES II) is designed to improve the performance and sustainability of the European aviation system, the second to improve the safety of aerodromes, air traffic management and air navigation services.
Binding targets for performance and sustainability of Europe's aviation system
The regulation to improve the performance and sustainability of the European aviation system provides for the following measures.
Performance schemes for air navigation services , shall be designed and implemented based on criteria in line with the International Civil Aviation Organization policies. The schemes shall provide for national or regional plans, subject to consultation with social partners: air navigation service providers, airspace users' representatives, airport operators and airport coordinators. Performance targets will be set in conjunction with the Commission. Member States will ensure appropriate incentives and sanctions are applied to encourage air navigation service providers to comply with the rules and achieve the targets. Eurocontrol, the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation , will act as the performance review body.
Functional Airspace Blocks (FABs) are a key development. International flights currently have to pass through national air traffic control zones or "blocks", being handed over from one national authority to another. This system leads to bottlenecks and delays, forcing aircraft to consume more fuel and jeopardising safety.
An important feature of the first Single Sky package was supposed to be the introduction of FABs, cutting across national frontiers to enable air traffic controllers to manage flights in a more rational way. Around nine European FABs have so far been designed - including a single UK-Ireland zone - but it is felt that insufficient progress has been made.
The new regulation will give a fresh impetus to this project by stipulating that FABs must be established no later than three years after entry into force of the regulation. A senior political figure will be appointed as FAB coordinator to facilitate mergers between blocks. Funding will be made available from the Trans-European Network programme and the European Investment Bank and from the inclusion of aviation in the Emissions Trading Scheme.
Safety of aerodromes, air traffic management and air navigation services
The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which was set up by a 2002 regulation, was originally limited to ensuring the airworthiness and environmental compatibility of aircraft but its mandate was progressively extended to cover all other fields of aviation safety. It is now the key player of the EU's aviation safety strategy, responsible for preparing regulation in the sector and ensuring its implementation by Member States.
Under the new regulation on aviation safety, EASA's powers will be extended to ensure precise, uniform and binding rules for airport safety, air traffic management and air navigation services. EASA will establish harmonised rules on Air Traffic Management (ATM) systems and Air Navigation Services (ANS), to improve aviation safety in a context of sharply rising traffic and increasing numbers of air routes.
The regulation states that all "aerodromes" (a term which covers all airports, airfields etc.) that are open to the public and serve commercial flights are subject to Community law. It lays down rules on infrastructure, equipment, management and aerodrome surroundings. Aerodrome operators will have to meet these requirements to receive certification by the national aviation authorities. EASA will define the detailed requirements for certification and carry out audits and inspections.
Existing airport permits will not be affected. Military aerodromes and very small airports - with runways that are shorter than 800 metres - will be excluded. Member States may also choose to exclude airports that carry fewer than 10,000 passengers per year.
Background
The first SES legislation was adopted in 2000. Nine years later, the EU has 27 Member States and the European aviation market has extended to 37 countries. Increasing amounts of traffic are giving rise to safety, environmental, and organisational challenges. Aviation traffic in Europe is expected to double by 2020.
Further action at Community level is therefore needed to ensure a harmonised system where efficiency is maximised, reducing delays and congestion, thereby leading to lower fuel consumption and overall flight costs.
The measures provided for in SES II are targeted to help the industry meet these challenges. The benefits for the aviation industry are estimated at 2 to 3 billion euros over the next 10 years. Sixteen million tonnes of CO2 emissions should be cut as a result of reduced flight times.
EU transport ministers are expected to approve the legislation at the end of March . The regulations will enter into force 20 days after their publication in the Official Journal, i.e. before the summer. Rapporteur Marian-Jean MARINESCU EPP-ED RO Procedure (x2) : Codecision (1st reading)

Food safety
Novel foods - MEPs to set out new rules
2009-03-20 - 09:31
The European Parliament will debate and vote next week in Strasbourg on a proposal to update the EU regulation on novel foods. The report by the Environment Committee calls on the Commission to ban the placing on the market of food derived from cloned animals and their descendants. MEPs also want food being produced by nanotechnology processes to undergo a specific risk assessment before being approved for use. Seven to ten applications for novel foods are submitted each year. Since 1 December 1997, there have been almost 100 applications.
So far, more than 20 novel foods have been authorised for use in the EU, such as "noni juice" (made from a Tahitian plant) and products derived from new production processes such as "salatrim" (a reduced-energy fat) and DHA-rich oil (a high-pressure fruit juice)
Novel foods are defined as those which have not been consumed to any significant degree in the EU before May 1997, when the first legislation on novel foods was established. These can be newly developed products, such as foods produced by new production processes like nanotechnology, but also food that has been consumed traditionally in third countries, outside the EU.
The committee supports the use of non-animal tests and intelligent testing strategies when assessing the safety of a novel food.
Negotiations with the Council presidency to find a first reading agreement have started, but it is not expected that an agreement will be reached before the plenary vote.
The Commission's proposal to update the regulation on novel foods aims at simplifying and centralising the procedure of authorisation of these products, ensuring food safety and human health. Food safety shall be assessed by the European Food Safety Authority, taking into account ethical factors.
MEPs in general support the proposal but have proposed amendments, concerning food derived from cloned animals and produced with the aid of nanotechnology, aiming to achieve, not only a high level of food safety, but also consumer, environmental and animal health protection, based on the precautionary principle.
The list of novel foods: food derived from cloned animals excluded; new Commission proposal demanded
The Environment Committee wants to exclude food derived from cloned animals from the scope of this Regulation, pointing out that a legislative proposal shall be presented by the Commission to interdict the placing on the market of food derived from cloned animals and their descendants.
Food produced with nanotechnology processes must be safe and labelled
MEPs suggest that foods which have been produced by nanotechnology processes, and foods which will need specific risk assessment methods, should be included in the Community list until those methods have been approved for use. “The methods currently available are not adequate for assessing the risks associated with nanomaterials" says the text.
The risk assessment methods must not imply the use of vertebrate animals, underline the MEPs, who also support the use of non-animal tests and the intelligent testing strategies.
Furthermore, the food containing nanomaterials should be labelled as “produced with the aid of nanotechnology”, say MEPs in the committee. The Council considers however that the safety evaluation shall guarantee that these products are equally safe as their conventional counterparts, rejecting the need of specific labelling.
A definition of nanomaterials shall be included in the regulation: "nanomaterial means an intentionally manufactured material with one or more external dimensions or an internal structure, of order of 100 nm or less" says the text.
Ethical demands
In order to enter a food on the Community list of the novel foods accepted in the EU, the Committee considers that the opinion of the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies shall be sought when necessary, regarding ethical and environment aspects.
Data protection
The Committee backs the Commission on the protection of data provided in support of an application for inclusion of a novel food in the Commission list, during a limited period of time, in order to stimulate research and development. Nevertheless, amendments have been tabled regarding the permission to access the studies on vertebrates and other studies that may prevent animal testing and whether the prior and the subsequent applicants have agreed to share data.
In addition, the committee wants data to be used by other applicants when the research projects are partly or completely paid by the Commission or by a public institution.
Background
Novel foods are subjected to the general labelling requirements (Directive 2000/13/EC), but they may require specific additional information.
The European Food Safety Authority's (EFSA) scientific opinion on nanotechnology published in 2009 concluded that currently there are data limitations and a lack of validated test methodologies for risk assessments.
Among other recommendations, the EFSA urges additional research on nano materials' interaction in food and feed, in the gastro-intestinal tract and in biological tissues.
The European Group on Ethics in Science and the New Technologies and the Scientific Committee of the EFSA published their opinions in 2008 regarding the production of food from clones and their offspring, their health and welfare, showing some concerns about the issue.
Currently no products derived from cloned animals are sold either in European or in international markets. Rapporteur Kartika Tamara LIOTARD GUE/NGL NL A6-0512/2009 Novel foods (repeal. Regulation (EC) No 258/97) Procedure : Codecision (1st reading)

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Stop female genital mutilation
2009-03-20 - 09:31
A clear strategy for banning female genital mutilation on EU territory and the need to acknowledge the problem in EU immigration law and cooperation agreements are among the key points of a report proposed by the EP Women's Rights Committee, aimed at stamping out this practice. Since FGM is a violation of rights, it can constitute a legitimate reason for applying for refugee status, says the report. This point was not supported unanimously by the committee and some MEPs voted against the report because of it and may therefore be subject to an alternative resolution.
Around 500,000 women in Europe are the victims of genital mutilation and the practice is particularly widespread in immigrant and refugee families, says the own-initiative report drafted by Cristiana Muscardini (UEN, IT).
Committee members want the Commission and Member States to draw up a clear strategy and action plans with the aim of banishing female genital mutilation from the EU.
Although female genital mutilation (FGM) is a violation of women's rights under various international conventions and is prohibited under the criminal law of the Member States, it is difficult to monitor on EU territory as it is carried out clandestinely.
MEPs also call for EU directives on immigration to treat the act of committing genital mutilation as an offence and lay down appropriate penalties for those guilty of it. The report urges the Commission to include a clause aimed at eliminating female genital mutilation in cooperation negotiations and agreements with the countries concerned.
Sounding the alarm
It should be compulsory for general practitioners, doctors and health clinic teams to report female genital mutilation to the health authorities or the police, say MEPs. Anyone who performs such operations should be prosecuted. Rapporteur Cristiana MUSCARDINI UEN IT A6-0054/2009 Combating female genital mutilation in the EU Procedure : own-initiative

Regional policy
Best practices in regional policy
2009-03-20 - 09:31
Regional development projects need simpler procedures and a clearer division of powers and responsibilities among the EU, Member States and regional and local authorities. The own-initiative report adopted by the Regional Development Committee on 11 February proposes possible common criteria for defining best practices, with a view to overcoming obstacles to use of the structural funds. It also suggests instruments to make these practices more accessible and visible to potential stakeholders. Removing obstacles
The report calls on Commission to gear evaluation criteria for projects co-financed by EU structural funds to the long term; develop specific evaluation criteria for innovative projects, so as to allow a higher failure rate; cut the period for which project documents must be stored from ten years to three, seek to introduce a single control system, and encourage Member States to set up a system of co-operation and responsibility-sharing between national, regional and local levels.
Best practices
It also calls on the Commission to draw up a set of criteria tailored specifically to cohesion policy, to enable "best practices" to be distinguished from those applying to other projects and lists points for the Commission to take into account in identifying best practices, starting with project quality, the partnership principle (i.e. involving all stakeholders) and sustainability of the measure concerned.
R&D/innovation
Funding for R&D/innovation projects should take account of qualitatively significant investment in science and research, links between industry and academia, links between science and research institutes, and development or innovation in respect of forward-looking technologies, says the report.
Environment, climate and sustainable energy policy
Funding for environment, climate and sustainable energy projects should take account of protective measures for high risk areas, conservation of scarce resources, significant increases in energy efficiency, and measures to reduce C02 emissions, says the report.
Creating high-quality jobs
For job-creating projects, the report recommends taking account of improvements in working conditions, forward-looking job creation, increased productivity, improved competitiveness, creation of jobs not tied to a particular location, and use of modern information and communication media.
Lifelong learning
For lifelong learning projects, the report recommends taking account of qualitative improvement/opportunities for the disadvantaged, close link between education and training, projects tailored to quality and quantity requirements, measures to stimulate willingness to undertake training, and lifelong language training.
Integrated urban development
Here the report recommends taking account of long-run integrated policy for local public transport, pedestrians and car use; efficient traffic management; increase in entrepreneurial investment, measures to stimulate and secure employment and to improve social life; redevelopment of derelict land in urban areas, and redeveloping waste land to avoid urban sprawl.
Demographic change
Here the report recommends taking account of universal access to services, enhanced measures to attract skilled workers, and measures to facilitate reconciliation between family and working life.
Cross-border co-operation
For projects involving cross-border co-operation, the report suggests taking account of increase in cross-border contacts, creation of permanent networks or long-term co-operation schemes, harmonisation of different systems and procedures, involvement of new partners, and infrastructure connections between partner regions.
Public-private partnerships
For projects implemented by public-private partnerships, the report recommends taking account of improvements in effectiveness and profitability, faster project implementation, and increased participation of local and regional authorities and players.
Exchange of best practices
The report calls on the Commission to organise and co-ordinate the exchange of best practices through a network of regions, and to create a public web site containing key information about the projects in all Community languages for this purpose, and recommends that the Commission set up a specific office in the Directorate-General for Regional Policy to organise, in co-operation with the network of the regions, the evaluation, collection and exchange of best practices.
The Report on best practices in the field of regional policy and obstacles to the use of the structural funds, drafted by Constanze Angela Krehl (PES, DE) was approved in committee on 12 February with 49 votes in favour, none against and 3 abstentions. It is scheduled for a plenary vote on 24 March.

Getting the best out of urban development spending
2009-03-20 - 09:31
Cities, which are home to 80% of the EU's 492 million people, need fully integrated urban development plans to tackle their economic, social and environmental problems, says this report, which urges EU Member States to delegate the management of EU money for urban sustainability projects to cities, and calls for more flexibility to combine funding from different sources. Challenges
Urban development challenges include economic restructuring, labour market fluctuations, inaccessible and congested public transport, limited useable territory, an exodus from rural areas and small towns to large urban centres, social exclusion, high and rising crime rates, "ghettoisation" of some city districts, low-income housing, worsening quality of life in deprived areas, insufficient parks and recreation areas, pollution, water, waste and residue management control and the need for secure energy supplies and efficient energy use. Cities account for over 75% of world energy consumption and produce 80% of greenhouse gases, as a result of energy production, traffic, industry and heating.
Urban development should be a strategic priority
The report regrets that Member States are not obliged to promote urban development as a strategic priority. It urges them, the European Commission, and regional and local authorities to evaluate impact of mainstreaming the URBAN initiative (stakeholder partnerships, integrated approach and "bottom-up" input to planning) and to monitor the impact of EU funds in urban areas.
Delegating the management of structural funds
The report points out that Member States may delegate to cities the management of EU structural funding for sustainable urban development measures. Enabling cities to take responsibility, from planning to implementation, would be "more efficient for regional and European growth" and could also improve the administrative capacity of local management, it says, adding that such delegation should become mandatory in the next programming period (from 2013).
Integrated approach to urban planning
Any public urban development support should be based on integrated urban development plans - in the next programming period, this should become one of the most important conditions for granting structural funds and receiving European Investment Bank loans, says the report. It also notes that integrated development plans will work only if sufficient resources are available, and proposes determining "a minimum level" of structural fund spending in urban areas, per person and per programming period.
Combined funding?
The report says that the "one programme, one fund" principle (e.g. European Social Fund for economic and social development and European Regional Development Fund for physical infrastructure investment) should be reviewed, to enable local and regional authorities to make better use of synergies between them. In the long run, it adds, the Commission could study the possibility of merging the two funds, if this would simplify procedures.
Financial engineering
The report says that in the next programming period, regional policy needs to make more use of financial engineering, such as JESSICA-style revolving funds, which offer credit on favourable terms, rather than relying solely on grants, as at present. It also recommends the use of public/private partnerships, e.g. for infrastructure and housing projects. However, it nonetheless stipulates that PPPs need to be governed by a clear code of conduct, particularly for public authorities.
Measuring urban development contribution to regional development
The report calls on the Commission regularly to evaluate, measure, benchmark and discuss the impact of EU policies on the economic and social situation, particularly issues relating to education and culture, and the health, transport, environmental and security situation in urban areas.
No common definition of "urban areas"
However, the report feels that given the EU's diversity, it would be inappropriate to adopt a common definition of "urban areas", or even "urban". Instead, it says, the definition and designation of these areas should be left to Member States, in line with the subsidiarity principle, based on common European indicators.
The Report on the urban dimension of cohesion policy in the new programming period, drafted by Oldřich Vlasák, (EPP-ED, CZ) was approved in committee on 20 January with 46 votes in favour and one against. It is currently scheduled for a plenary vote on 24 March.

Regional policy
Getting the best out of rural development spending
2009-03-20 - 09:31
Rural per capita income and access to goods and services are best improved by supporting non-agricultural activities in rural areas, without depleting farmers' incomes, says this report, which calls for figures on the take-up of rural development funding under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), and advocates closer co-ordination of rural and regional development measures, so as to enhance their combined impact. Under the EU's 2007-2013 financial framework, rural development funding comes from the European Agricultural Fund for Regional Development (EAFRD), a CAP heading, rather than from the regional funds, as in 2000-2006. In practice, this separates non-agricultural rural funding from regional policy, creating a risk that some aims (e.g. environmental protection and education) may either be duplicated or omitted in both areas. So it is important to ensure that activities co-funded by the EAFRD complement those co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund, the Cohesion Fund and the European Social Fund, says the report.
The report observes that the approach of separating rural development from cohesion policy with the creation of the EAFRD "needs to be monitored very closely in order to evaluate its true impact on rural areas".
Challenges
Sustainable development, per capita income levels, access to public goods and services and rural depopulation - some of the biggest challenges for cohesion policy - can be most effectively improved through, among other measures, support for economic activities in rural communities, says the report. It therefore calls on the European Commission and EU Member States to support projects that develop human capital, in particular by providing training opportunities for agricultural and non-agricultural entrepreneurs in rural areas, with the aim of promoting employment and job creation.
Development in rural areas requires greater attention and support for the preservation of the natural and farmed landscape, ecotourism, the production and use of renewable energy and local initiatives such as local food-quality procurement schemes and local farmers' markets, it adds.
Figures needed
The report calls on the Commission to supply detailed figures and forecasts for the take-up of EARFD and structural funding in rural areas and to look into "the synergies that can be created by the EAFRD and the structural funds in terms of the funding available in rural areas". Prior to rural funding reform, the Commission should make a detailed assessment of all sectoral policies having an impact on rural areas, and notably the CAP and regional policy, and a set of best practices should be drawn up for rural development policy as a whole, it adds.
Co-ordination, funding and EU value-added
Rural development policy can work efficiently only if EARDF and regional development measures are "co-ordinated and mutually complementary, so as to avoid double financing and gaps", says the report, which calls on the Commission to propose reforms to improve co-ordination of measures co-funded under the cohesion policy and CAP.
Co-ordinating structural policy and rural development measures would also allow projects with greater European added value to be undertaken, providing opportunities to enhance rural areas through infrastructure or environment protection measures, says the report.
The report nonetheless observes that rural development policy can achieve its aims only if it is adequately funded and used in line with priorities set out for rural areas. Funds raised through modulation should always be distributed back to active farming communities, it says.
A reliable income for farmers
The report also calls on the Commission to assess whether regional policy programmes can help to offer farmers a reliable income, e.g. by carrying out environmental protection, nature conservation and landscape management activities. It stresses the importance of support to keep young farmers on their land, by providing them with incentives for development and other activities such as rural tourism.
Let's discuss how
The report calls on the Council to convene a joint, informal meeting of agriculture and regional policy ministers to discuss how best to co-ordinate regional policy and rural development measures, inviting the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee, as EU consultative bodies, and also representatives of regional and local authorities.
It also asks the Commission to create a high-level working group by 2011, as part of the CAP "health check", to put forward proposals to secure the future of the rural economy and all who live in rural areas after 2013.
The Report on complementarities and co-ordination of cohesion policy with rural development measures, drafted by Wojciech Roszkowski (UEN, PL) was approved in committee on 20 January with 47 votes in favour and two abstentions. It is currently scheduled for a plenary vote on 24 March.

Regional policy
Territorial cohesion and future cohesion policy
2009-03-20 - 09:31
Pointers to a reformed EU regional development policy, built around the concepts of (economic) concentration, connection and co-operation, are set out in this report, which responds to the Commission's Fifth progress report on economic and social cohesion and Green Paper on territorial cohesion. Parliament's report calls inter alia for a more comprehensive system of "transitional" assistance to regions about to rise above the full structural funding eligibility threshold (75% of EU average GDP) and a formal multi-level system of governance, to involve all stakeholders in regional policy design and implementation.
A single Community policy is needed to address challenges such as globalisation, climate and demographic change, migration and energy efficiency. This policy should cover all EU regions, add value for everyone, and be capable of adapting to the most appropriate scale of intervention, says the report.
Territorial cohesion: key concepts
"Territorial cohesion", which has yet to be officially defined but incorporates the concepts of concentration, connection and co-operation, is central to strengthening economic and social cohesion, and to closing development gaps within and between EU Member States and regions, says the report, which criticizes the Commission's failure to define territorial cohesion clearly or say how it will be integrated into existing cohesion policy and applied from 2013.
The concentration, connection and co-operation concepts can help to overcome obstacles to harmonious development, such as negative effects of economic concentration in regional capitals, unequal access to markets and services, and divisions imposed by boundaries between Member States but also regions. These concepts need to be developed into concrete policy options and the Commission is urged to explain how they will be integrated into the post-2013 legislative framework
Economic, social and territorial cohesion should be complementary and mutually reinforcing - there should be no hierarchy or trade-off between these objectives. Progress and growth in any given territory should provide benefits for the whole region and across the EU, says the report, which proposes that priority should go to policies that promote "polycentric" development, so as to lessen negative concentration effects on regional capitals (e.g. congestion, pollution, social exclusion and poverty). The report also stresses the importance of socially and regionally equitable access to public services such as health and education to sustainable economic and social development, whilst acknowledging that responsibility for these services should rest with national, regional and local authorities.
Co-ordinating sector-specific policies
Co-ordinating all sector-specific Community policies that have a "strong territorial impact" is central to developing territorial cohesion and strengthening economic and social cohesion, says the report, which regrets that the Green Paper merely lists these policies, without suggesting ways to improve synergies between them.
Recommendations
Definition - the report expects a clear and flexible definition of "territorial cohesion" to emerge from the public consultation on the Green Paper (a public consultation on which closed at the end of February). It stresses that any future definition should provide for good governance and partnership between public, private and civil society players.
White Paper - the Commission should publish a White Paper clearly defining and consolidating the notion of territorial cohesion and its added value for cohesion policy and proposing action to solve the growing problems facing EU regions, says the report.
"Transition regions" - the Commission is called upon to establish a more comprehensive system of gradual transitional assistance to regions that will soon be above the 75% of EU average GDP threshold, so as to provide them with a clearer status and more security in their development.
Cross-border co-operation should be stepped up, not least because it directly involves local and regional authorities in planning and implementing programmes.
New model governance - given that EU cohesion policy has transformed governance from an often centralised system into an increasingly integrated, multi-level one, stakeholders, public authorities and citizens should establish a formal system of territorial governance, based on a "multi-sectoral, territorial and bottom-up integrated approach", to respond to a single need of citizens or users - Community initiatives such as Urban I and Urban II for urban areas and Leader in rural ones offer a model.
Council meetings - the informal structures that have long governed territorial cohesion and spatial planning in the Council should be replaced by formal ministerial meetings of regional policy ministers, to improve information flows and accelerate the development of territorial cohesion policy.
The Report on the Green Paper on Territorial Cohesion and the state of debate on future reform of cohesion policy, drafted by Lambert van Nistelrooij (EPP-ED, NL) was approved in committee on 12 February with 50 votes in favour, one against and no abstentions. It is currently scheduled for a plenary vote on 24 March.

Implementation of Structural Funds Regulations 2007-2013
2009-03-20 - 09:31
This report responds to a Commission Communication on regional policy programmes for 2007-2013, which, with investments of €347 billion, make up the second-largest item in EU budget. 81.5% of investment funds go to "convergence" (i.e. fully eligible - under 75% of EU average GDP) regions, which are home to 35% of the EU population. MEPs note that the Member States' "Lisbon" (growth and jobs) allocations account for 65% of funds available in the convergence regions and 82% in the regional competitiveness and employment ones (i.e. all the rest). Although these shares are bigger than initially requested (60% and 75% respectively), still more needs to be spent on Lisbon aims, e.g. at least 5% of structural funding should be spent on improving the energy efficiency of existing homes, says the report.
Lisbon incorporated
The report acknowledges efforts by all Member States to incorporate the three Lisbon aims - making Europe and its regions more attractive places in which to invest and work, improving knowledge and innovation for growth and creating more and better jobs - in their national programmes. It also underlines the potential of renewable energies to create jobs and foster sustainable local development.
Mitigating regional disparities
It nonetheless reiterates that economically and environmentally sound development, and reducing regional disparities, remain the principal goals of EU regional policy, and takes note of Member State measures to meet the development challenges of regions with specific geographical features, such as mountains, islands, outermost regions, remote border towns, regions suffering from depopulation and border regions.
The report also notes that convergence among countries can mask widening disparities within and between regions, in areas such as employment, productivity, income, education levels and innovation capacity.
Globalisation and structural change
MEPs appreciate that all Member States have allocated substantial shares of investment to R&D and innovation, developing a knowledge-based service economy, promoting entrepreneurship and business support services, as well as helping firms and workers adapt to new conditions, but note that most convergence regions still lack transport infrastructure.
Sustainable development, climate change and energy
Environment protection, climate change and energy efficiency measures should be built into all programmes (they get about one-third of the cohesion policy budget), says the report, adding that climate change and energy efficiency investment allocations so far are insufficient to meet real needs. It also notes that new Member States need to devote significantly more resources to achieving EU environmental, climate and biodiversity aims as laid down in the Community acquis.
Multi-level governance and partnership
Involving all stakeholders in planning and implementing investments is vital to the legitimacy and effectiveness of investment programmes, says the report, which also calls for a clear division of competences between the EU, Member States and regional and local authorities and stresses the need to promote public/private partnerships to boost the impact of investment in key projects.
Sound financial management
The report encourages Commission efforts to ensure that Member States operate efficient control systems to ensure that EU funds are well spent. It also welcomes Commission proposals to amend structural fund rules to meet EU needs in exceptional circumstances (e.g. faster, more flexible funding, structural funding for energy-efficiency investments in housing).
The Report on the implementation of the structural funds regulation 2007-2013: results of negotiations on national cohesion strategies and national programmes, drafted by Miroslav Mikolášik (EPP-ED, SK), was approved in committee on 11 February with 48 votes in favour, two against and three abstentions.

External relations
A closer and deeper strategic partnership with the USA
2009-03-20 - 09:31
A new transatlantic partnership is needed to strengthen ties between the EU and America now that Barack Obama has taken office, says the EP Foreign Affairs Committee. MEPs are calling for a new institutional architecture including a political council and a joint parliamentary committee. The "new transatlantic agenda" dating from 1995 should be replaced by a new transatlantic partnership agreement based on a new institutional architecture, argues the report by Francisco José Millán Mon (EPP-ED, ES) proposed by the committee. The EU-US relationship is described in the report as "the most important strategic partnership" for the EU.
MEPs in the committee propose the creation of a Transatlantic Political Council as "a body for systematic high-level consultation and coordination in respect of foreign and security policy". It would be chaired by the High Representative/Vice-President of the Commission on the EU side and by the Secretary of State on the US side, and would meet at least every three months.
A unified transatlantic market: meet the target date of 2015
The full potential of the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) should be used to overcome the existing obstacles to economic integration and to achieve a unified transatlantic market by 2015. MEPs ask the European Commission, on the basis of the study authorised and financed by the European Parliament in its 2007 Budget, to draw up a detailed road map of existing obstacles which need to be removed with the aim of achieving that target date.
They highlight the role to be played by the TEC in transatlantic macro-economic cooperation and they call for closer coordination between European and American monetary institutions.
An EP-US Congress parliamentary committee
A joint parliamentary committee should replace the current Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue, says the report. It should be compromised of Members of the European Parliament and the US Congress, and should meet twice yearly.
The joint parliamentary committee should be able to make proposals to the Economic and Political Councils and to the EU-US summits. Both its co-chairs should be invited to participate in the opening session of meetings of both Councils. The committee should also have the right to conduct hearings with representatives of those Councils.
The report also recommends that EU-US summits take place twice a year "to provide the partnership with strategic direction and impetus".
CIA secret prisons, global issues
The U.S. administration is urged to close down any detention centres outside the United States, to put an end to the policy of extraordinary renditions and to ratify and accede to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.
MEPs in the committee believe the new partnership should also enable the two sides to address, with Russia, the various challenges, threats and opportunities of mutual concern, such as disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation,
Lastly, it should permit better coordination of responses on other matters of joint interest such as promoting sustainable peace in the Middle East through the Quartet, the fight against terrorism and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, notably in Africa.

EU - Belarus relations
2009-03-20 - 09:31
MEPs will debate EU-Belarus relations after hearing statements from Council and Commission. Parliament will vote on a resolution during the plenary session in Brussels on 2 April. On 16 March, the Council said:
"1. The Council welcomes that certain positive steps have been taken by Belarus following the Council's decision on the temporary suspension of the travel restrictions imposed on certain officials of Belarus in October 2008. The Council also welcomes the increased high-level EU-Belarus dialogue, including bilateral contacts, and the intensified technical cooperation initiated by the Commission, as a way of building mutual understanding and providing an opportunity to address the parties' concerns and issues of common interest. The Council also welcomes and further encourages the continuation of Belarus' cooperation with OSCE/ODIHR on electoral legislation.
2. Nevertheless, the Council continues to be concerned about the human rights situation in Belarus and the recent cases of violation in this area. The Council stresses the importance for Belarus to address the concerns raised in this regard and to continue moving forward, through progressive substantial steps, in the areas identified in the Council Conclusions of 13 October 2008. In this context, the Council looks forward to the launching of a Human Rights Dialogue with Belarus in the near future.

Turkmenistan: MEPs concerned about democracy and human rights
2009-03-20 - 09:31
Before giving their final verdict on a trade agreement between the European Community and Turkmenistan, MEPs will wish to hear the response of Council and Commission to their concerns about democracy and human rights and democracy in that country. The EP International Trade Committee adopted a report by Daniel Caspary (EPP-ED, DE) approving unamended - under the consultation procedure - the proposed decision on the conclusion of an interim agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the EC and Turkmenistan.
However, a debate will take place before the full Parliament decides whether to endorse the committee report. The debate is based on oral questions tabled by the EPP-ED, PES, ALDE and UEN groups which ask the Council and Commission to explain why they wish to proceed with the ITA now, given the general situation in Turkmenistan, especially in the fields of human rights, democracy and freedom of religion. MEPs also want to know the position of the other two EU institutions on reports by NGOs and others in Turkmenistan concerning the general situation in the country.

Taxation
Cigarette tax at least €1.50 per pack from 2014
2009-03-20 - 09:31
A gradual increase in minimum tax rates on cigarettes, to at least €1.50 per pack by 2014, and other tobacco products, is backed by the Economic Affairs Committee, but it advocates smaller increases than those proposed by the Commission. The aim of the proposed legislation is to avoid distorting the single market and to foster tax convergence (tobacco tax rates currently differ from Member State to Member State). This should also help to protect health, if used in combination with a ban on tobacco advertising and with education campaigns, said the committee, in a report drafted by Zsolt Laszlo Becsey (EPP-ED, HU).
Convergence would be fostered by applying the same minimum requirement to cigarettes and other tobacco merchandise. The increases, if approved by the Council, would be introduced gradually, ending on January 2014.
At least €1.50 per pack of cigarettes from 2014
The minimum tax on cigarettes should be €64 per 1,000 cigarettes from January 2012 onwards, agreed the committee. But from January 2014, the minimum tax should be €75 per 1,000 cigarettes, less than the €90 proposed by the Commission, it added.
This would make the minimum tax €1.50 per pack of 20 cigarettes from 2014.
New minimum rates for cigars, cigarillos and rolling tobacco
The proposal also aims to bring minimum tax rates for fine-cut rolling tobacco into line with the rate for cigarettes. For this tobacco, the committee proposes minimum tax rates of €43 per kilogramme from 2012 and €50/kg from 2014 (for the latter step, the Commission had proposed €60/kg).
For cigars and cigarillos, the Economic Affairs Committee advocates minimum rates of €12/kg from 2012 and €22/kg from 2014.
More time for Member States
Whereas the Commission proposed increasing the minimum rates in two steps, one from 2010 and the other from 2014, the committee agreed on 2012 and 2014.
As is usual with taxation issues, Parliament's views are advisory rather than binding and the final decision is for the Council, acting unanimously. Rapporteur Zsolt László BECSEY EPP-ED HU A6-0121/2009 Structure and rates of excise duty applied on manufactured tobacco Procedure : Consultation

Culture
Multilingualism: an asset for Europe
2009-03-20 - 09:31
EU citizens must be helped and encouraged to learn languages other than their own if they are to derive full economic, social and cultural benefit from freedom of movement, says a report tabled by the Culture Committee. An alternative resolution will be put forward. The committee's own-initiative report, which is a response to a Commission Communication on multilingualism, was drafted by Vasco GRAÇA MOURA (EPP-ED, PT). It stresses the need to promote more and better language teaching, as a knowledge of languages is an asset - and increasingly a necessity - in many walks of life.
Broad policy aims
The "political priority", says the report, should be the acquisition of language skills through the learning of other EU languages, one of which should be the language of a neighbouring country and another an international "lingua franca". However, it also says support should be provided for learning third country languages, including within the EU, and would like classical Greek and Latin to be included too.
The committee highlights possible dangers in the communication gap between individuals with different cultural backgrounds and the social divide between multilingual and monolingual people, and draws attention to the fact that the lack of language skills continues to be a serious obstacle to the social and labour market integration of non-national workers in many Member States.
In addition, the EU could reap the potential dividends offered by European languages in its external relations, says the report, which calls for further development of this asset in cultural, economic and social dialogue with the rest of the world.
Practical measures
The report welcomes the Commission proposal to promote ‘mother tongue plus two’ in education and calls for more prominence to be given to European Day of Languages, a Council of Europe initiative held annually on 26 September to celebrate language and cultural diversity.
MEPs stress the importance of a full knowledge of the host state’s official languages for the full integration of immigrants and their families and say national governments should promote language courses for all categories of the population.
Good teacher training is needed to ensure quality and Member States are urged to examine the possibility of exchanges of teaching staff at different educational levels, partly with the aim of teaching different school subjects in different languages.
Among other practical measures, the committee recommends to the Member States that TV programmes and particularly children’s TV programmes, should be subtitled, rather than dubbed, believing this would facilitate the learning and practice of EU languages and improve understanding of the cultural background to audiovisual productions.
It also stresses the importance of creating programmes to support translation and of setting up multilingual terminology database networks.
The report ties in with the report by Hannu TAKKULA (ALDE, FI) on "Educating the children of migrants" which says migrant children should learn all of their host-country's official languages.

Culture
Unity and diversity through art
2009-03-20 - 09:31
In an increasingly heterogeneous and multicultural world, artistic studies can be used to preserve our identities and to encourage inter-cultural understanding, according to a report by the Committee on Culture and Education. In order for this to happen, the European Union needs to address "significant disparities between the existing artistic education models in the various Member States." Artistic studies, and especially the history of art, are an ideal way to develop an understanding of common European history according to the rapporteur, Maria BADIA i CUTCHET (PSE, ES). The study of art can also promote a better understanding between different cultures, which is especially important in relation to the diversity and enlargement of the EU. At the same time, art can be a means of "safeguarding…traditional cultural values in different regions."
Education, links with ICT
The report notes that artistic and cultural education are both essential to the "education of children and young people, since [they] contribute to the development of free will, sensitivity, and openness to others." Art education can also lead to increased mobility, and consequently links between cultures, as many "students of arts subjects are interested in pursuing their studies in a Member State other than their own." The report therefore warns that economic hardship should not lead to a reduction on the importance of the arts in the overall education policy.

Agriculture
Food aid programme for Europe's poorest people set to expand
2009-03-20 - 09:31
The EU food distribution programme for the most deprived people in Europe must continue within the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), be fully funded by the EU and consist purely of food products of Community origin, says the Agriculture Committee. Two alternative resolutions will be put forward. Since the programme came into being in 1987, millions of needy Europeans have received food from intervention stocks of the CAP, distributed via charities and social services. In the mid-1990s, the rules were changed to allow food to be bought on the open market to supplement this source, in certain circumstances.
Keep the programme within the CAP
The consultation report drafted by Czesław Adam Siekierski (EPP-ED, PL) proposed by the Agriculture Committee approves the European Commission's proposal to allow more buying of food on the market for this purpose, given the declining food stocks following successive reforms of the CAP and the increased need for food aid in the wake of successive EU enlargements and the economic crisis.
The committee rejects by a comfortable majority a number of amendments seeking a change in the legal basis of the proposal. German Social Democrat Heinz Kindermann had argued that the programme had lost its "agricultural dimension" because of the increase in buying on the market, and that it should henceforth be part of social policy.
Full Community funding
MEPs also propose an expansion in the range of products to be made available, to promote a more balanced diet, as well as longer-term distribution plans from 2010 so that the funding can be used more efficiently.
However, because of the economic difficulties faced by many Member States, MEPs oppose the idea that national governments should help pay for the scheme, calling instead for full Community funding to be preserved. The Commission had proposed that the Community budget should contribute 75% for 2010/2012 (85% in Member States that receive Cohesion Fund money) and that these rates be subsequently reduced to 50% and 75% respectively from 2013/2015.
Only European products to be used
Among other amendments proposed, the committee wants the programme to distribute only products of Community origin, preferably fresh and local ones.
Background
In the 27-member EU, 80 million people (16% of the population) live below the poverty threshold, according to Eurostat, a figure expected to rise considerably because of the economic crisis.
In April 2006 the European Parliament asked the Commission and the Member States to continue this programme, which it said had become vital for millions of Europeans. And in May 2008, in a resolution on food price rises, MEPs described the right to food as a basic right.
At an initial round table meeting with Council of Agriculture Ministers in November 2008, seven Member States forming a blocking minority (Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Latvia, Netherlands, Sweden and UK ) opposed the Commission proposal, arguing that the distribution of food should be funded via national social programmes rather than the CAP budget (and therefore calling for a change in the legal basis).
According to the Commission, over 13 million people benefit from the programme, whose budget has been raised from slightly under €100 million in 1987 to €305 million in 2008 and €500 million in 2009. Participation in the programme is voluntary (in 2008, 19 Member States took part, the non-participants being Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Slovakia, Sweden and UK).

Agriculture
EU must guarantee reasonable food prices for consumers and profits for farmers
2009-03-20 - 09:31
Correcting the market inequalities, and improving direct relations between consumers and producers, in order to guarantee reasonable prices for the former and profits for the latter, are the principle objectives of a report proposed by the Agriculture Committee on the difference in price between production and consumption in the food chain. Europe and the rest of the world have recently experienced high food price volatility, which has caused "significant prices rises"; to the extent that in Europe, consumer prices are now on average up to five times more than the farm gate price. Committee MEPs are calling on the Commission to launch a report, "as soon as possible" to investigate the "margin share in the production and distribution chains."
For the rapporteur, Katerina Batzeli (PES, EL) "this price gap is a major problem which is causing concern for the two extremities of the food chain. Produces and consumers are suffering from the effects of the drive for profits, which is at the origin of the failing food market. It is time to put in place a long-term plan and to adopt interventions at a European level so as to face the financial crisis, which is weighing heavily on households and farmers."
Market dominance and anti-competitive practices
According to committee MEPs, the price transmission mechanism and the gap between consumer and producer prices increase in concentration across the food supply chain. They are particularly concerned by the increase in market share of a number of processors and manufacturers, who are abusing their dominant position to force down "prices paid to suppliers to unsustainable levels."
The report notes that a survey by the Commission on Food Prices in Europe "fails to include the abuse of the dominant position observed at the retail stage", and MEPs are particularly concerned by anti-competitive practices which include the selling of goods below cost. In the long-run, pricing below cost benefits neither the consumers nor the food market as a whole, and consequently, committee MEPs are calling for European-level action to be taken.
European monitoring
The report endorses the Commission's proposal to establish an "efficient European market monitoring system", which will allow price trends and input costs to be monitored across the whole food supply chain. This should allow a more transparent system and will allow for a cross-border comparison system on similar products.
MEPs believe that this measure should be supported by an investigation and evaluation by competition authorities at national and European level to "ensure that competition rules are respected", and that decreases in price should be passed on to consumers. Similarly, they are calling for any price increases to be passed on to producers much more quickly than is happening at present.
European database and international observation, coordination at national level
Committee MEPs are also calling on the Commission to establish a Europe-wide database, easily accessible to European citizens, which will give greater transparency regarding the cost structure of product prices. This should be carried out in cooperation with the Food and Agriculture Organisation, who can in turn, monitor this data at an international level.
As retail trade is primarily influenced by national, legal, economic and political considerations, it would be useful to "conduct a greater exchange of information" and possibly to investigate any anti-competitive policies utilised by companies who work at European level.
Enforcing the power of producer organisations and the idea of local produce
The report believes that in order to shift the balance of power within the food chain, producers' organisations should be encouraged, as this would help to increase farmers' negotiating powers. In turn, this would help to shorten the marketing channels to consumers and would give "greater added value to their products."
In addition, the concept of local foods has been emphasised. Local retailed shops help to "bridge the gap between producers and consumers" and can improve the quality of life in local areas, as they provide jobs and important social links. Local foods are also beneficial to consumers as they can be informed about the health benefits of certain foods, whilst also building links with local producers.

Partnership agreements with the Caribbean and Côte d'Ivoire
2009-03-20 - 09:31
The EP International Trade Committee will ask Parliament to give its formal assent to allow two Economic Partnership Agreements to go ahead, one with the Caribbean countries grouped in Cariforum, the other with the West African state of Côte d'Ivoire. Cautious welcome for EU partnership accord with the Caribbean
Regarding the first Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), with the Cariforum states, the Trade Committee recommends that Parliament approve the EPA provided that undertakings are given by the Commission and Council for a review clause and that extra aid for trade is included.
The draft resolution by David MARTIN (PES, UK) states that the EPA can only be described as "satisfactory" if it offers the Cariforum countries support for their economic development, promotes their participation in world trade and strengthens the regionalisation process.
Of the six groups of ACP countries taking part in such negotiations with the EU, the Caribbean region was the only one to sign, in December 2007, a full EPA covering areas such as investment, competition policy, public procurement, current account balances, the environment, social issues, cultural cooperation and greater protection for intellectual property. Thirteen Cariforum member states signed the agreement on 15 October 2008 and Guyana signed up on 20 October. Haiti has until 2010 to sign.
Aid for trade
Regarding measures to accompany the EPA, which will include compensation for the net loss in customs revenue, MEPs ask the Commission to clarify the distribution of funds in the region within the "aid for trade" budget. They also call on EU Member States to outline additional funding beyond 2008-2013 budget commitments.
The ACP states are asked to describe what additional EPA-related funds are needed, particularly with regard to regulatory frameworks, safeguard measures, trade facilitation and support in meeting international sanitary and phytosanitary and intellectual property standards. The EU is committed to increasing its trade-related assistance to €2 billion annually by 2010 (€1 billion from the Community, €1 billion from the Member States).
MEPs support the agreed tariff line exclusions focused on agricultural goods and some processed agricultural goods, given that they are based chiefly on the need to protect infant industries or sensitive products in these countries. The committee also points out that the duty-free, quota-free market access agreed between the parties will produce a significant increase in trade and is supported by more flexible and improved rules of origin, as well as a comprehensive review clause.
Review clause and regional integration
Welcoming the provision for a review of the EPA no later than five years after the date of signature (and at subsequent five-yearly intervals), the committee requests that the EP and the Cariforum parliaments be involved in any revision of the agreement.
To stimulate intra-regional trade, MEPs call for the selective application of most-favoured nation treatment to the European Union by Cariforum and other sub-regional groups. They also call for further lowering of tariffs between developing countries and regional groups, which today account for 15 to 25 percent of the trade value.
Lastly, implementation of the EPAs should be scrutinised by the EP International Trade Committee, working together with representatives from the ACP states to ensure overall consistency in trade and development policies, says the draft resolution.
Background
In 2000 the ACP and EU agreed to conclude new trading arrangements compatible with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules to replace the unilateral regime of trade preferences granted by the EU to imports from the ACP that prevailed at the time.
Since EPAs aim at building on and strengthening the regional integration processes in the ACP, negotiations have been conducted at the regional level with six self-declared EPA regional groups: SADC (Southern Africa), ESA (East Africa), ECOWAS (West Africa), CEMAC (Central Africa), CARIFORUM/CARICOM (Caribbean) and the Pacific Forum (Pacific countries).
"Stepping stone" agreement with Côte d'Ivoire
The Trade Committee will also ask the House to approve a draft recommendation on the interim (or "stepping stone") Economic Partnership Agreement between from Côte d'Ivoire and the EU. The draft recommendation was approved in committee with 12 votes for, 4 against and 1 abstention.
In a short statement at the time of the committee vote, rapporteur Erika MANN (PES, DE) asked Council and Parliament to make a sensible decision when it comes to the EPA and Ivory Coast. "We should bear in mind the concerns of the country," she said.
The stepping-stone EPA is a temporary solution while negotiations for a final EPA covering the entire West African region continue. The final EPA will entirely replace these interim accords. Negotiations are underway for a final EPA covering the West African region ECOWAS (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Côte d'Ivoire, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Togo). The objective of the EU and West Africa in the negotiations is to conclude an agreement at regional level which supports development and fosters regional integration.
All imports from Côte d'Ivoire have entered the EU duty and quota free since 1 January 2008 (other than transition periods until 2010 for rice and 2015 for sugar).
In return, over the next 15 years, Côte d'Ivoire will liberalise 81% of imports from the EU (representing 89% of tariff lines) in areas such as industrial machines (pumps, generators, turbines, etc), certain vehicles (boats, aircrafts, cars), and certain chemicals. These are all inputs used by Ivorians which are not produced locally.
Côte d'Ivoire excluded a number of agricultural goods and non-agricultural processed goods from liberalisation, mainly to ensure protection of certain sensitive agricultural markets and industries but also to maintain fiscal revenues. The products concerned are: chicken and other meats, tomatoes, onions, sugar, tobacco, beer, worn clothes, cement, malt, gasoline and cars.
Oral Questions
MEPs have also tabled a number of Oral Questions to elicit further information from the Council and Commission on the various EPA negotiations (see link below). Oral questions - EC-Cariforum States Partnership Agreement

EU - India Free Trade Agreement
2009-03-20 - 09:31
For the last two decades, India has been emerging as a "major innovator, developer, as well as producer and exporter" of goods and services. Due to its geographical size, population and economic growth, it is becoming an influential player in global affairs. The report, drafted by Sajjad KARIM (EPP-ED), calls for closer links between the EU and India in the areas of trade, investment and services. Two alternative resolutions will be put forward. The EU is the world s biggest economic bloc, and India is the world's second most populous nation. The EU is India's largest source of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), investing EUR 10 900 million in 2007, whilst India's FDI to the EU has increased from EUR 500 million in 200 to EUR 9 500 million in 2007. The report recognises that "forging an economic alliance is therefore vital to both."
Trade, services and investment
The report believes that an EU-India free trade agreement would be a "win-win scenario" for both sides, as it would increase trade and investments dramatically. Several free trade simulations have shown that the free trade agreement would "increase overall exports and imports for both the EU and India", to the extent that by 2015, bilateral trade is expected to exceed EUR 160 600 million. Both India and the EU will reaffirm their commitment "to tariff reductions, further liberalisation of establishment and trade in services."
The report recognises that services are the fastest growing sector of the Indian economy, and that India exports 9,2% of its services to the EU, whilst the EU exports only 1,5% of its services. However, the committee also states that this sector is not entirely open to foreign competition, and that the EU should call for a completion of "liberalisation in market access and national treatment in GATS Mode 3 in most services."
Currently, there is no chapter in the FTA on investment. The committee is calling for the Commission to include one, as this would provide "a single point of information for investors."
Development, poverty, human rights, and the environment
India faces significant problems with human development and poverty, with 80% of the Indian population living on less than $2 per day. There are also "significant economic imbalances between India's States." Therefore, the committee recognises that a substantial development chapter is essential and calls for the inclusion of "binding and enforceable commitments on social and environmental standards and sustainable development." Committee MEPs welcome the progress already made by India in the areas of public spending on health, and child labour laws.

One year after Lisbon: the Africa-EU partnership at work
2009-03-20 - 09:31
The Development Committee will submit to the House an own-initiative report drafted in response to the Commission Communication "One year after Lisbon: The Africa-EU partnership at work". The committee's report, drafted by Maria MARTENS (EPP-ED, NL), welcomes the fact that, one year after the adoption of the Joint Africa-EU Strategy, the main components of the institutional architecture for its implementation are finally in place. It calls for the completion of this institutional architecture by developing the parliamentary, civil society and local authority components that would give it transparency, ownership and democratic legitimacy.
Role of parliaments and non-state actors
MEPs reiterate their request to the Commissions of the EU and the African Union to involve the European and Pan-African Parliaments in the Joint Strategy. Whilst welcoming the €55 million support programme in the 9th European Development Fund for strengthening the capacity of AU institutions, the committee insists that part of this budget must be made available for strengthening the capacity of the Pan-African Parliament.
The Action Plan indicates that each of the Africa-EU Partnerships is open for a wide range of actions but MEPs regret that overwhelming emphasis is placed on state actions and are concerned at the low level of involvement of African civil society.
Other partnerships
The Joint Strategy should also address issues which, while formally belonging to a different institutional architecture, have a profound influence on the future of Africa, such as the economic partnership agreements (EPAs), the second revision of the Cotonou Agreement, the Euro-Mediterranean Strategy and Africa’s relationship with new global players such as China and Brazil.
Peace and security, aid for trade
The committee calls for due priority to be assigned to implementing the African peace and security architecture, stressing that the EDF is not an adequate financing source for future replenishment of the African Peace Facility and calling for a definitive solution for African Peace Facility financing.
Members insist that the final EPAs signed with African states must be primarily tools for development which respect the various beneficiaries' different capacities and levels of development. They also insist that the Commission and Member States honour their commitment to provide by 2010 at least EUR 2 billion a year in genuine 'aid for trade', the largest share of which must be for Africa.
Climate change, brain drain, affordable medicines
The committee insists that fresh funds are needed if African states are not to pay a disproportionate price for adapting to climate change. It notes the need for a fair solution to the 'brain drain', and calls for help for African countries to apply the flexibilities provided for in the Doha Declaration on TRIPS, to facilitate access to affordable key medicines in Africa.
Special funding for the Joint Strategy
Lastly, the committee calls on the EU institutions to create a specific financial instrument for implementing the Joint Strategy, centralising all existing sources of funding. It questions to what extent the Joint Strategy will be able to achieve its lofty ambitions or offer genuine added value without any new funding.

Development and cooperation
EU must improve its commitment to the Millennium Development Goals
2009-03-20 - 09:31
In the year 2000, the international community, including the European Union, made commitments to halve extreme poverty worldwide by 2015. Currently, most developing countries do not have the resources to meet the eight Millennium Development Goals, so the Committee on Development is calling on the Commission and Member States to increase and standardise their financial contributions. Current estimates suggest that 1.4 billion people are now living below the poverty line, of $1.25 per day, which is "equivalent to over one fourth of the developing world population." Despite the good intentions of the MDGs, there is still a significant lack of access to basic health care and primary education, which "causes the death of millions of people and perpetuates the cycle of poverty." Many developing countries do not have the necessary resources to meet the challenges they face, and therefore some form of external aid is essential.
Unpredictable aid streams, health and education
The situation cannot be improved without some level of predictability in the levels of aid available. Currently, some recipients are forced to spend aid support "before it has actually been provided and without being certain that it will ever be provided." Despite promises made, many Member States are still not giving all the aid which they have pledged to give. The committee therefore calls on the Commission and EU Member States to improve the quantity and quality of the aid they offer.
Access to health care and basic education are fundamental human rights, which many developing countries have made progress towards, but simply lack the funds to reach their aims. The report therefore reiterates Parliament's earlier calls to ensure that at least 20% of the Community's financial support is invested in basic health and education programmes. Currently, less than 7% of the Community's development budget is given to these sectors.
MDG Contracts
The rapporteur, Alain Hutchinson (PES, BE), supports the Commission's proposal to apply the concept of contracts "based on tangible results in terms of attaining MDGs." The use of contracts implies a firmer financial commitment which would allow greater predictability from the donor country, in return for more sustainable results from the recipient country. The Commission intends these contracts to be launched at the beginning of the tenth EDF, and intends to use them to commit funds for a six-year period. Whilst the committee welcomes this proposal, they are calling for some changes, as currently they suffer "from a serious lack of transparency and of ownership by the poor countries."
Providing the contracts are precisely defined, they will be able to present an excellent opportunity to improve the effectiveness of European aid and cooperation with developing countries.

Industry
Future of the car industry
2009-03-20 - 09:31
On Tuesday evening, MEPs will debate future of the car industry after hearing statements from the Commission. Ministers have expressed deep concern about the serious situation that the sector is facing at present, putting at risk a very significant number of jobs. In 2008 there were about 8% fewer cars sold in the EU than in 2007. The automotive sector with its 12 million jobs depending on this strategic industry has been hit particularly hard by the current economic crisis with new registrations down by 20% and gloomy expectations for 2009.
The worsening trend over the last months suggests that things will get worse in 2009 with another 10%-20% fall in sales. The projected figures for heavy-duty vehicles are even worse with industry projecting decreases of about 30%. The whole automotive value chain is already affected by the crisis and the impact is likely to be particularly painful for automotive suppliers, especially smaller suppliers.
The automotive industry is a key industry in the European economy characterised by having few vehicle manufacturing firms and a substantial number of independent suppliers to which about 2/3 of the production is outsourced. The output includes cars, light trucks and vans, buses and coaches, medium and heavy trucks, motorcycles and agricultural and forestry tractors.
The automotive industry has for a long time seen mergers and acquisitions. Currently the main EU car industry is composed of DaimlerChrysler, Volkswagen (VW), BMW, Ford Europe, General Motors (GM) Europe, Renault, PSA (Peugeot-Citroën), Fiat and Porsche. In addition there are a number of small manufacturers. Some Japanese manufacturers also have significant production facilities in the EU.
The EU truck industry buses and coaches sector has seen a similar consolidation. Europe now sees Volvo, Scania, Iveco, DaimlerChrysler, MAN and Daf.
Due to its close links to other sectors and the wide spread of supply industry and vehicle trade, the negative economic effects reaches out to millions of employees in all Member States. In its communication, the European Commission defends a proactive stance to support industry in their efforts to withstand the crisis, soften negative effects and ensure long-term competitiveness. Building on the European Economic Recovery Plan of 2008, it sets various measures to improve access to credit, to clarify the rules for granting state aid in the particular circumstances, to boost the demand for new vehicles through coordinated national action, to minimise social costs and retain the skilled workforce and to defend fair competition in open markets. The Commission suggests a new partnership with industry, trade unions and Member States in the context of the CARS 21 process to accompany the common crisis response.
Primary responsibility for dealing with the crisis lies with industry. However, the European Economic Recovery Plan of November 2008, has set out key elements of the public support relevant for the automotive sector. In order to ensure transparency and a rapid adoption of national schemes the Commission has organised the exchange of best practises and proposed common principles on which car scrapping schemes should be based.
Much of this public support should be covered by horizontal policy instruments applicable to industry as a whole and should be met through a combination of European and Member State level action. The EIB is expected to approve €3.8 billion worth of automotive sector projects in March while additional projects in the pipeline add up to a total of € 6.8 billion. It should be noted that the financial branches of car makers may also qualify for aid under the schemes adopted by the Commission for the banking sector.

Budget
EP reviews 2007 - 2013 Financial Framework
2009-03-20 - 09:31
The EP is set to vote on a report by the Budget Committee on the mid-term review of the 2007-2013 financial framework. In the current context of economic crisis and forthcoming elections in the EP, the report recommends a realistic rather than ambitious review. It also states that "the general magnitude of EU resources must not be affected" by the global economic problems. Given the current context of economic crisis, upcoming European Parliament elections, the setting up of a new Commission and a "number of uncertainties linked to the ratification process of the Treaty of Lisbon", the rapporteur, Reimer BÖGE (PPE-DE, DE) acknowledges that an ambitious and detailed review of spending priorities is not realistic. However, he stresses that a more ambitious review should be a high priority for the new Parliament and Commission.
Three-step process
The report recommends that a realistic mid-term review should be developed in three steps. Firstly, the review must resolve "deficits and leftovers in the context of the annual budgetary procedures, if possible through more flexibility, and, if necessary, using part of the margin left below the own resources ceiling." The report notes that headings 1a (Competitiveness for growth and employment), 3 (Freedom, security and justice and Citizenship) and 4 (The EU as a global partner) are already underfinanced under the current MFF, and that the Union still needs the means to fulfil its other political ambitions in the areas of energy security, and climate change.
The second stage the committee proposes is a "possible adjustment and prolongation of the current MFF until 2015/16" which would allow a smooth transition of the MFF and would enable each Parliament and Commission political responsibility for each MFF. This would mean that some current programmes could be prolonged to allow a phasing of mandates of the Parliament and Commission.
The final recommendation of the report is that the preparation of the next MFF should begin in 2016/17. This preparation would occur under the parliament elected in 2014.
Flexibility and sound financial management
Committee MEPs believe that the MFF "should have a greater degree of flexibility" in order to be able to face current challenges in food, energy, and financial sectors. Not only will increased flexibility help to face unexpected challenges, it is also seen as an "absolute necessity" to facilitate the decision-making process within the Union.
Finally, the report stresses that sound financial management enabled through the Member States and the Commission "matching political priorities and financial needs" should be a high priority for the coming years. They suggest that this should be achieved by identifying positive and negative priorities rather than through self-imposed ceilings.

Non-interoperability of mobile phone chargers - MEPs quiz Commission
2009-03-20 - 09:31
Marco CAPPATO (ALDE, IT) will be asking the Commission questions on the non-interoperability of mobile phone chargers. With reference to Written Question E-5767/08 on the non-interoperability of mobile phone chargers, would the Commission state what progress has been made towards harmonisation and, in particular, whether it has already taken measures to tackle this problem, which directly affects European consumers (who are obliged to replace chargers which still work) and the environment (because of the enormous quantity of waste thus generated)?
Has the Commission already held discussions with the manufacturers with a view to enabling any consumer to use any mobile phone charger, which is increasingly necessary? If so, what was the outcome of the discussions?
Does the Commission think that specific legislation will be required to achieve this purpose?
Does the Commission envisage extending any such measures to other types of electronic equipment? Oral question to Commission

Environment
Substances that deplete the ozone layer
2009-03-20 - 09:31
A compromise has been reached between representatives of the EP and Council on a regulation updating the EU law on substances depleting the ozone layer. The new law brings EU legislation in line with developments of the Montreal protocol aiming at protecting the ozone layer, but goes beyond it, so that the EU will continue to lead by example. The deal does not only cover the marketing ban of certain substances but also substances contained in refrigerators and insulation material in buildings. A first reading compromise has been achieved
The Montreal Protocol, set in 1987, obliged the signatory countries to phase out ozone-depleting substances according to a set timetable.
The revision of the regulation, the EU's main instrument for implementing the Montreal Protocol, aims at simplifying the current legislation. Despite the good results achieved in recent years in the recovery of the ozone layer continued vigilance is required, also taking into account the impact of climate change since most of the substances have high global warming potential and are contributory factor towards increasing the temperature of the planet. Many ozone depleting substances (ODS) are greenhouse gases.
The agreement reached between representatives of Parliament and Council strengthens the Commissions proposal and ensures that the EU can go beyond the Montreal protocol and lead by example.
The compromise achieved will not only help against the destructive effects of UV radiation, but also against climate change.
The revised regulation (the achieved compromise) will clarify some of its provisions, such as those on exemptions and derogations to the use of ozone-depleting substances, and the conditions under which they can be imported and exported. It aligns the EU law with latest international agreements, but goes in some parts beyond it.
Already under the existing EU legislation the production and placing on the market of the most damaging ozone-depleting substances is banned, while the EU is going further than the Montreal protocol by banning or setting limits on certain uses of these substances. Exceptions exist for the use of several ODS, which will be further limited according to the achieved compromise.
Deadlines for the phasing out of hydro chlorofluorocarbons
The phasing out of the production of hydro chlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) will be brought forward for 5 years and shall be achieved by the end of 2019. MEPs achieved that the production of HCFC’s has to be further decreased during the period 2017-2019: it should fall to 7% in relation to 1997 levels.
Deadline for phasing our Methyl bromide
Further environmental and health benefits will be gained through a reduction and the ultimately phase out by 18 March 2010 of the use of methyl bromide (used as a pesticide), which until then can be used only for preventing the introduction and spread of pests through international trade (quarantine and pre-shipment applications)
Substances contained in refrigerators and buildings
Although most of the harmful substances are no longer produced and used in new equipment, thousands of tonnes are contained in existing refrigeration equipments and insulation material in buildings.
The compromise therefore lists responsibilities for undertakings to prevent the substances from being released into the atmosphere to prevent further damage to the ozone layer. It also tightens up the provisions on recovery and destruction of these substances
Furthermore, the Commission shall make available at the latest by the 1st of January 2010 a list of products and equipment which might contain or rely on controlled substances in order to reduce them and ultimately to phase them out.
Background
The ozone layer is a layer of gas in the upper atmosphere which shields life on earth from harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun.
In the 1970s scientists discovered that some chemicals could deplete the ozone layer and in the 1980s the so-called ozone hole was discovered above the Antarctic.
Increased UV radiation can damage ecosystems and have an adverse impact on human health, leading to skin cancer and cataract problems.
The EU regulation on the ozone layer is the European main instrument for the implementation of the provisions of the Montreal Protocol. It bans the production and placing on the market of the most damaging ozone-depleting substances and sets limits on certain uses of these substances.
191 countries have signed the Montreal Protocol.
The ozone layer is expected to recover to pre-1980 levels by 2050-2075. Rapporteur Johannes BLOKLAND IND/DEM NL A6-0045/2009 Environment: substances depleting the ozone layer (repeal. Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000). Recast Procedure : Codecision (1st reading)

Petitions
Petitions Committee criticises "extensive urbanisation" practices in Spain
2009-03-20 - 09:31
"Extensive urbanisation" practices in Spain are criticised in a report proposed by the Petitions Committee, which suggests interrupting EU aid for the country until the problem is solved. The report goes before the full Parliament at the end of March on Thursday for a vote. There is no debate scheduled on the report. Two alternative resolutions will be put to the vote also. The Petitions Committee's report, drawn up by Margrete AUKEN (Greens/EFA, DK) and adopted by 24 votes in favour to 11 against with one abstention, deals with problems associated with "extensive urbanisation" in Spain and suggests interrupting the provision of EU aid to the country until these are solved. It says Spain should "suspend and review" all the new urbanisation plans which do not respect the right to legitimate ownership "suspend and review". The report also calls for "adequate compensation" for those affected.
Interrupt structural funding?
The report notes that the Commission is empowered to interrupt the payment of structural funds, to suspend such funding to a Member State or region, and to establish corrections in relation to projects in receipt of funding. It also asserts that Parliament, as the budgetary authority, may decide to place funding set aside for cohesion policies in the reserve if it considers this necessary to persuade a Member State to end serious breaches of the rules and principles which accompany the funds.
Suspend and review plans
The Petitions committee considers that the relevant Spanish regional authorities "should suspend and review all new urbanisation plans which do not take into consideration the criteria of environmental sustainability and social responsibility and which do not guarantee the respect for the rightful ownership of legitimately acquired property in compliance with the Spanish Constitution".
"Excessive powers"
MEPs in the Petitions Committee reiterate the conclusions of its previous resolutions by calling into question the methods by which urbanisation agents are selected and the "frequently excessive powers often given to town planners and property developers by certain local authorities" at the expense of communities and the citizens who have their homes in the area.
The text also affirms that estate agents in Member States, such as the UK , and other providers of services related to the real estate market in Spain continue to market property in new urbanisations even when they are necessarily aware that there is a clear possibility that the project in question will not be completed nor built.
According to the report, one of the main causes of this problem is the absence of supra-municipal planning or regional planning guidelines placing limits on urban growth and development.
Recourse "outrageously slow" - compensation for victims
The committee says that procedures remain "outrageously slow" and that the sentences handed down in many cases are not enforced in a way which provides any satisfaction to the victims of such abuse.
MEPs in the committee take the view that persons who "in good faith" have bought property in Spain which has been declared illegal should have the right to appropriate compensation through the Spanish courts. Nevertheless, "developers that have entered into contracts, the unlawfulness of which they should have been aware of, ought not be entitled to compensation".
In addition, the text recalls that EU directive on unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices obliges Member States to provide "appropriate means for legal redress and remedies for consumers who have been victims of such practices" and to ensure "adequate sanctions".
Water resources
The Commission, at the request of the Committee on Petitions, has launched an investigation into more than 250 urbanisation projects which have received a negative opinion from the relevant water authorities. The report maintains that these urbanisations without water resources contravene the Water Framework Directive.

Visa policy
Biometric visas: children under twelve exempted from giving fingerprints
2009-03-20 - 09:31
Biometric visas, like biometric passports, should improve security provided the fingerprints they include are reliable. Children under twelve will be exempted from the requirement to provide fingerprints, as MEPs wished, following an agreement with the Council proposed by the EP Civil Liberties Committee. The European Visa Information System (VIS) is intended to facilitate the procedure for issuing visas while preventing "visa shopping", that is simultaneous applications for visas in more than one EU country. For the system to work well, common consular instructions are needed to ensure that all Member States issue visas on the same basis and that the visas contain the same features.
The Civil Liberties Committee recommends approving a second-reading agreement negotiated between the rapporteur and the Council of Ministers on the inclusion of biometric data in the VIS in a report by Sarah LUDFORD (ALDE, UK).
The purpose of biometric features - a photograph and ten fingerprints, as recommended by the International Civil Aviation Organization - is to enable the identity of visa applicants to be verified and to establish a reliable link between visa holders and their passports so as to prevent the use of false identities.
Exemption for children under twelve
During negotiations with the Council, MEPs successfully argued for children under twelve to be exempted from the requirement to give their fingerprints. Studies on the reliability of fingerprints suggest that they can undergo change before that age and might therefore no longer match those on the visa. On 14 January this year, the European Parliament voted for a similar exemption for biometric passports.
Sharing of equipment for collecting biometric data
MEPs would like to see new methods of organisation to ease the registration of visa applicants and reduce costs to Member States. A special type of representation, purely to receive applications and collect biometric data, would be set up alongside diplomatic and consular representations. In this way Member States would not need to equip every one of their consulates with biometric collection equipment. These joint centres would also help strengthen consular co-operation locally. However, Member States would remain free to provide their diplomatic and consular offices with such equipment if they wished.
Subcontracting only as a last resort
In exceptional circumstances, Member State may co-operate with an external service provider if, because of a very high number of visa applications, it is impossible to organise the collection of biometric identifiers in appropriate conditions or to ensure sufficient geographical cover in the country concerned in another way.
The UK government welcomes the use of biometric fingerprints by the Schengen states. They increase the security of the EU external border, just as taking fingerprints from minors has enabled the UK to detect cases of child trafficking. The UK has been taking fingerprints for visas from the age of five on a mandatory basis since January 2008 and has rolled out over a hundred visa application centres world-wide.

Social policy
Working conditions: companies must be liable for subcontractors
2009-03-20 - 09:31
Companies must be responsible for the conditions of workers employed by their subcontractors and an EU legal instrument is needed to make sure this is the case say Members of the EP Employment and Social Affairs Committee, referring to the concept of "joint and several liability". Two alternative resolutions will be put forward. The rise of subcontracting has had far-reaching consequences for labour relations and sometimes this makes it difficult clearly to determine the branch of law applicable to the relationships between the various elements of a production chain, according to the committee's own-initiative report, drafted by Lasse LEHTINEN (PES, FI).
The committee welcomes the fact that eight Member States (Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain) have already responded in their national law to problems connected with the duties of subcontractors as employers. It urges other Member States to consider similar schemes. However, implementing the rules in cross-border subcontracting processes is especially difficult when Member States have different systems in place.
A legal instrument at European level
In the draft directive providing for sanctions against employers of illegal immigrants, currently before Parliament for a first reading, the European Commission introduced into Community legislation the idea of "joint and several liability". This is a "suitable instrument" to ensure that companies are responsible for the practices of their subcontractors, says the report.
MEPs in the committee call on the Commission to establish a clear-cut Community legal instrument introducing joint and several liability at European level, while respecting the different legal systems in place in the Member States. They also want the Commission to launch an impact assessment on the added value and feasibility of a Community instrument on chain liability as a way of increasing transparency in subcontracting processes. Lastly, they believe that the scope of liability in such an instrument should cover at least wages, social security contributions, taxes and damages in relation to work-related accidents.

Fundamental rights
Security and fundamental freedoms on the internet
2009-03-20 - 09:31
Increasingly, companies, governments, police and even criminals are seeking the greatest possible access to our private data. The internet provides a previously unimaginable level of access to information about our private lives, which unfortunately, can be abused by companies, intelligence services or even identity thieves. A report by the Committee on Civil Liberties Committee proposes action against cybercriminals whilst also guaranteeing fundamental rights to privacy for internet users. The report, by Stavros LAMBRINIDIS (PES, EL) is the first recommendation from MEPs concerning the fight against cybercrime and preserving the rights of internet users. Clearly the internet can be used as an excellent tool for accessing information and allowing connections between individuals and communities all over the world. However, it also has its dangers as it can expose users to surveillance, or even serve as a tool for criminals or terrorists. The main advantage and disadvantage of the internet is that it transcends almost all borders.
Committee MEPs are also concerned with the idea that "e-illiteracy will be the new illiteracy of the 21st Century." The report argues that in this age, having access to the internet is "equivalent to ensuring that all citizens have access to schooling", and that this access should not be denied by governments or private companies.
Fundamental freedoms of internet users
There are a number of fundamental rights which are affected by the internet, including "respect for private life…data protection…freedom of speech and association, freedom of press, political expression and participation, non-discrimination and education." The report calls on Member States to protect these rights by making use of existing national, regional, and international law, and to exchange best practices amongst themselves.
The report recognises that given "the global and open nature of the Internet", international standards for data protection, security and freedom of speech are required. Committee MEPs call on Member States and the Commission to draw up a series of regulations to protect the privacy of internet users.
Crime, identity theft and terrorism
The nature of the internet also means that it is open to abuse. It has "been used as a platform for violent messages…as well as for websites which can specifically incite hate-based criminal acts." Cybercrime, in general has also increased, and internet users are at risk of identity theft, if they transmit their personal details across the internet without a minimum level of protection. Therefore, the committee calls on the Council and Commission to develop a "comprehensive strategy to combat cybercrime…identity theft and fraud."
Finally, the report raises the question of consent of internet users, when giving personal information to governments or private companies, and the imbalance of negotiating power between users and institutions. In relation to this, committee MEPs stress the importance of internet users being able to retain the right to permanently delete any of their personal details saved on "internet websites or on any third party data storage medium."

Follow-up to the Declaration of the Sports Ministers of the European Union at their meeting in Biarritz in November 2008
2009-03-20 - 09:31
Katerina BATZELI (PES, EL) and Doris PACK (EPP-ED, DE) on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education will be asking questions to the Commission on the follow-up to the Declaration of the Sports Ministers of the European Union at their meeting in Biarritz in November 2008 The Declaration of the Sports Ministers of the European Union at their meeting in Biarritz in November 2008 set two key tasks for European institutions:
(a) ‘the ministers ask the relevant European institutions to strengthen current dialogue mechanisms by setting up a consultative framework as of 2009 associating notably the International Olympic Committee and representatives of the sports movement’;
(b) ‘European ministers call on the Commission to provide clearer legal guidelines on the application of EU law to sport organisations’.
Could the Commission answer the following questions?
1. What steps has the Commission taken so far, and what steps does the Commission intend to take, during the remainder of its mandate, to complete these tasks?
2. Does the Commission believe the ‘consultative framework’ should be formal or informal, and which sports representatives does the Commission intend to invite? Oral question to the Commission
