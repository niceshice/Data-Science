The European Parliament in a resolution adopted by MEPs welcomed the Bali roadmap's 2009 deadline for the conclusion of an international agreement on climate change. The House underlined the need for industrialised countries to cut emissions by at least 30% by 2020 and 60-80% by 2050 compared to 1990.
Though satisfied that the Bali Action Plan contains "a clear timetable" for reaching agreement, MEPs regretted "that it was not possible to make unambiguous references to science in relation to the necessary greenhouse gas reductions." They welcomed, however, the Kyoto Protocol parties' recognition of the need for industrialised countries to cut emissions by 25-40% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2020. The EP also called for the WTO to consider "temporary measures that favour the manufacture and export of climate-friendly products and innovative technology".
Greening of EU development policy
MEPs also lay emphasis on technology transfer, welcoming the pledge to up investment in "development, transfer and deployment of both mitigation and adaptation technologies to developing countries."
"A greening of the EU development policy and aid is necessary and urgent", members also underline, criticizing "very slow progress in this area".
EU biofuels policy: urgent review is necessary
The EP, aware of the biofuels targets included in the newly proposed "climate change package", calls "for an urgent review of EU biofuels policy, with particular emphasis on the lifecycle sustainability of each biofuel in terms of greenhouse gas reductions". The House also underlines that developing and implementing biofuel strategies "should fully account for and safeguard against any associated negative environmental, social and economic impact".
Major emitters' meetings: EU presence conditional on US emission reductions
Noting the initiative taken by the US administration to convene a series of meetings of the world's major emitters, MEPs called for the Commission and the Member States concerned "to make their participation conditional on concrete proposals from the hosts for short-term emissions reduction targets which are consistent with the aims and objectives of the UNFCCC".
The resolution, drafted by rapporteur Guido Sacconi (PES, IT), will was approved by a majority of 605 votes to 45 with 19 abstentions.
