European Police College: no budget discharge, funding for 2011 partly frozen
Budgetary control
Plenary sittings
2010-10-14 - 14:29
MEPs on Thursday refused to sign off the budget of the European Police College (CEPOL) for the financial year 2008. Parliament has so far granted budget discharges to all other EU agencies but finds it unacceptable that the Police College, established as an agency in 2006, has yet to meet good standards of administration.
MEPs stress that repeated audits have highlighted shortcomings in the College's observance of the Financial and Staff Regulations, its accounting system, its management of budgets and staff, its procurement procedures and its rules governing expenditure on courses.
During its vote on Tuesday this week on next year's EU budget, Parliament's Budget Committee decided to freeze a sum of â‚¬425,000 for the Police College until it receives satisfactory information on the follow-up to be given to the negative discharge decision.
Today's vote follows Parliament's decision in May 2010 to postpone the CEPOL discharge because of structural internal management deficiencies. At that time Parliament requested an action plan and a list of specific remedial measures with an implementation timetable.
The action plan was approved by the governing board within the deadline requested in Parliament's resolution of 5 May. However, the implementation report (with specific measures and the timetable for implementing them in line with the action plan) was not adopted by the board, and has not yet undergone a "professional assessment", even though this was required by Parliament.
Following today's decision to refuse the discharge, a formal proposal to close the accounts for the year 2008 will be submitted to a vote at the October II session.
The decision was approved by an overwhelming majority (618 in favour, none against, 7 abstentions).
