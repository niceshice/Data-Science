A stand with various energy options available such as sun, wind, nuclear. Energy policy and climate change have raced up the political agenda in the last few years. The UN's climate change panel has alerted us all to the dangers of inaction. Over the last few years MEPs have supported cuts in the EU's CO2 emissions and steps to set up a low carbon market to increase efficiency and to use more energy efficient things around our houses. But is it enough? The June election gives people their chance to give a verdict and also give a new "climate" mandate to incoming MEPs.
"20/20/20 by 2020"
In December last year MEPs voted by a substantial majority to make the EU the only place in the world with far-reaching and legally binding limits on CO2 emissions and climate change goals by 2020.
The plan sets targets for a 20% cut in greenhouse gas emissions, a 20% improvement in energy efficiency and a 20% share for renewables in the EU's energy mix.
This package of measures - only agreed after intense discussion with EU energy ministers - also includes a previously agreed tool, the EU's Emission Trading System, which will run from 2013 to 2020 and aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 21% from 2005 levels. The ETS works as a cap and trade scheme whereby emission are limited but within those limits participants may buy and sell allowances to meet their needs.
The ETS covers over 10,000 energy and industrial installations which account for half of the EU's total C02 emissions. The fast growing emissions from aircraft will be cover by the ETS from 2012 following agreement between MEPs and ministers in July 2008.
Reaching a post-Kyoto deal on climate change by the end of year deadline will be a key challenge facing incoming MEPs after the European elections, with the present Members already signalling their support for such a deal.
Car emissions reduced and capped
A new regulation setting emission performance standards for new passenger cars registered in the EU backs an average emission target of 120g of CO2/km for the whole car industry by 2012, down from 160g/km today. This will come through things like better tyres and tighter standards for air conditioning systems.
Our homes are another area where we can make savings. Just a few weeks ago Parliament backed the ban on old fashioned light bulbs, which often produce more heat than light. New energy efficient light bulbs can be as much as 75% more efficient.
MEPs have also backed greater use of energy labelling for things like fridges and washing machines. The A-E scale shows the buyer how energy efficient a product is.
Diversifying sources of energy
In terms of energy and international relations, MEPs have also been active. Following the gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine which disrupted gas supplies to many EU countries and left people shivering in homes, homes and schools in places like Bulgaria and Slovakia, MEPs have increasingly pushed for the Union to work towards diversifying energy supplies.
