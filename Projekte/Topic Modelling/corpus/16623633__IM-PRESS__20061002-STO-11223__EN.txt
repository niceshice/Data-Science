India, a young and optimistic nation
Josep Borrell, President of the European Parliament, travels to India this week to meet senior government ministers and business leaders. Some of the issues to be discussed include trade links, energy supply, protection of the environment and terrorism - which were in a resolution passed by MEPs last week. It explored the EU's current and possible future relations with India and sets out Parliament's position ahead of the EU-India summit on 13 October.
President Borrell finds himself in a country of 1.1 billion people - the second most populous on the planet and the world's largest democracy. India is also a country of great cultural diversity - the constitution recognises 23 languages - more than in all 25 EU countries combined.
India: "crossroads between...Far East and energy-rich Middle Eastâ€¦"
The resolution was based on a recent report by British Liberal Democrat Sajjad Karim. In his report it said that "India is an emerging leader at the geopolitical centre of gravity: the crossroads between the booming Far East and energy-rich Middle East and Central Asia".
India has an economy that is growing at an average of 6% a year with the EU being India's biggest trading partner and the largest source of India's foreign direct investment. Although relations are good there are some tensions over high import tariffs on some European goods and India would like to see a reduction in "non-tariff barriers" - like trade defence actions and restrictions on the movement of people.
India is particularly strong in the IT sector, with a 44% share of globally traded IT services and "outsourcing". In this sector wages are $8,000 compared with $70,000 for an equivalent job in Germany, for example. IT outsourcing could be on the agenda when President Borrell meets members of the "European Business Group" on 6 October.
People power
There are strong cultural links between India and the EU. Some 3 million Indians - or people of Indian descent - live in the EU while 30,000 European expatriates live there. India's strength could well be her people. In 2020 in the EU the average age will be 45, in India it will be 29. She will have a large pool of young and well-qualified people. The Erasmus scholarship scheme and the Jean Monnet Chair in European Studies at the University of Delhi are helping to build academic ties.
Parliament is strongly committed to good relations with India - it has a delegation of MEPs for South Asia who maintain strong links with the Indian Parliament. The delegation is headed by Neena Gill, a British MEP of Indian origin. The Parliament resolution also restated the EP's call for an annual parliamentary summit either before or alongside the annual EU-Indian summit.
