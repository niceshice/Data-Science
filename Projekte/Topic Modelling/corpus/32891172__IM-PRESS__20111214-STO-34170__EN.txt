The European Parliament has always attracted prominent visitors and 2011 was no exception. A succession of well-known international figures visited, some to attend official meetings in the Parliament, others to participate in special events and some to be honoured.
Enjoy our selection of photographs of a few of Parliament's many eminent guests over the last year. Some came to Brussels and some to Strasbourg, from former US President Jimmy Carter to Microsoft's Bill Gates, former EP President Simone Veil and Italian actor and film director Roberto Benigni.
