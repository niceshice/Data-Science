Ageing and shrinking Europe - what's the answer?

old and young hand in hand
It's an old adage that "none of us are getting any younger". However, in the coming decades this is an issue the EU will have to face. The current average age in Europe is 39, current trends could push this to 49 by 2050. This means more pensioners and less people of working age. MEPs have already given serious consideration to this issue and the Employment Committee is currently working on a report on demography in response to proposals from the Commission.
At the start of the 19th century Europe accounted for 15% of the global population. By 2050 it will be just 5%. This is due not only to rising populations in other parts of the world, but also to the fact that Europe has a declining population.
Bye, bye baby boom!
Across the EU women have an average of 1.52 children. This is below the 2.1 child threshold needed to replace the population. As the post-war baby boomers reach retirement age and life expectancy increases, the number of people in employment and paying tax (to support to the pension and healthcare system) will be comparatively smaller.
As European Commissioner for Employment Affairs Vladimir Å pidla explained in October last year when he launched Commission proposals: "today, there are four people of working age for every person over 65, by 2050, this ratio will have dropped to two workers paying for one pensioner." It is in response to the Commission Communication "The demographic future of Europe" that Parliament's Employment and Social Affairs Committee is drafting a report.
Earlier this week MEPs on Parliament's Industry Committee discussed a draft report on "Enhancing the quality of life of older people through the use of new Information and Communication Technologies". This is due to be voted on in the full Committee on 19 December.
In addition to concerns over pensions, an ageing population will place growing pressure on Europe's healthcare systems. As health costs increase extra money will have to be found. Just as a strong economy will be needed to cope with the extra strain staring it is envisaged that the EU's GDP could fall by up to 1.2% between 2031 and 2050 as the population ages.
What can be done?
There have been a number of suggestions as to what could be done to alleviate the situation, including:
Immigration: to the South and East of Europe lie counties considerably poorer with young and growing populations. However, immigration is a growing issue in its own right. Also the immigrants themselves will eventually age.
Work longer and start receiving your pension later - but are Europeans willing to vote for governments that suggest this?
New birth policies - encourage people to have more children using the tax system perhaps?
In September a Report by Parliament's Civil Liberties Committee - "Policy Plan on Legal Migration" was adopted. This envisages a scheme whereby skilled immigrants are allowed to work and live in the EU. The European Commission has already raised the possibility of a US style "Blue Card" to offer future skilled workers.
Living longer is a sign of a healthy and successful society, but when this is coupled with a low birth rate it raises issues that need to be considered now. Over the next few weeks we will be considering the issues raised by demographic changes in a series of articles.
