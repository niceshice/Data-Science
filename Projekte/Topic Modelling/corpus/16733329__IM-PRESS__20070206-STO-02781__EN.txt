Obesity: 300,000-400,000 new cases a year
A staggering 27% of men and 38% of women in the European Union are classified as obese. This figure does not include the 5 million children who suffer the same condition. Healthy diets and regular exercise is the way to beat it. However, as a recent resolution passed by MEPs shows - these practices must start early in life to have any effect. With half of all mortality in the EU related to cardiovascular ailments - and one third of all these being related to poor diet - the time to act is now.
Educate children early
In 2000 a report for the World Health Organisation identified obesity as the developed world's greatest health problem. As well as heart disease obesity can lead to strokes, diabetes and arthritis.
Parliament's rapporteur on the issue - Frédérique Ries of the Liberal ALDE group has called for a several-fold approach to the problem. Her report stresses the important of education, nutrition and exercise from an early age. If young children become more aware of what are "healthy" and unhealthy" foods from an early age Mrs Ries thinks it will form lifelong eating habits. This report was later put to a resolution passed by MEPs.
As well as this approach, the report stresses that the EU must coordinate its agriculture, research and investment policies to promote healthy diet and exercise. Its main recommendations are:
Schools: educate children from an early age on the benefits of a healthy diet. Ensure that schools have enough funds to provide healthy food (burger and chips are usually cheaper than fresh fruit and vegetables).
End the stigma: obese people often suffer from low self esteem and conscious and unconscious discrimination. MEPs want obesity classified as a "chronic disease" to tackle this.
Health services: the report calls for lifelong monitoring of people who may suffer from obesity. It goes on to say that health services and industry must work in partnership to tackle the problem. This is pressing as obesity related treatment takes up on average 6% of national health care costs.
Education / information: education on nutrition is vital to combating obesity. TV campaigns directed at children for food products such as crisps and sweets should be more closely managed. This could come through a revision of the EU wide "TV without frontiers" directive.
Signposts: food "signposting" on the nutritional value of food could be a way forward. In the UK the idea of food "traffic lights" has been raised by food campaigners. For example: Red for unhealthy, Amber - for medium risk and Green for healthy
Do you read the label?
"Yes of course!" - But do you read the label on the front or the back? Manufacturers put their healthy claims on the front - while the nutritional information is on the back in a table. This information can be confusing, for example is it clear the difference between salt and sodium?
Research has shown that people are influenced by nutritional and health claims on products. An EU-wide regulation entered into force in January that aims to tighten up this whole area. In particular it will prevent firms from making healthy claims for their products if they are high in sugar, salt or fat.
This whole area is up for review this year. In April the European Commission will release a consultative white paper on nutrition and physical activity. One aspect it is likely to consider is the "signposting" of foods.
It is a sad fact that obesity can be socially selective. Cheap processed food like burgers, chips and frozen pizzas are often much cheaper than fresh fruit and vegetables. Also poorer members of society may not have access to proper educational or health care facilities - thus making their condition worse.
Am I overweight / obese?
People are classified as obese if they have a body mass index over 30. This means if you overweight by 30 percent of the ideal body weight. "Overweight" is defined as a body mass index of 25-30.
