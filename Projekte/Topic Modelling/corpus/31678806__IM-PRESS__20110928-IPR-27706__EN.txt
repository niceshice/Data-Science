In a resolution adopted by an overwhelming majority (442 votes to 104, with 40 abstentions) MEPs demand that the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people be upheld fully within the EU and defended systematically in its external relations.
They call for gender identity disorders to be removed from the World Health Organisation's classification of mental and behavioural disorders. They roundly condemn the fact that homosexuality, bisexuality and trans-sexuality are still regarded as mental illnesses, requiring psychiatric treatment, in some countries, including some EU Member States, and they call for this to stop.
Parliament points to the obligation of EU Member States to grant asylum to people from non-EU countries who are fleeing persecution based on their sexual orientation. They also call on Member States to ensure freedom of movement for same-sex couples and their families in the EU as well as access to preventive health-care and medical treatment for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.
The House supports the efforts of foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton and of EU Member States to promote the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people at the UN and welcomes the ground-breaking UN Human Rights Council Resolution passed in June this year. It backs plans to continue discussions at the next session of the UN Human Rights Council, taking the view that a "respectful and open dialogue" amongst all regions of the world is indispensable.
