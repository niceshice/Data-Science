the tops of multicoloured umbrellas ©BELGA_PHOTOPQR_LE TELEGRAMME_FRANCOIS DESTOC Generally clear skies with a few cold winds and the occasional squall is the political weather forecast for the19-22 October European Parliament session. Around €1.5 billion in energy investment and a €300 million dairy fund could be approved by MEPs when they vote on the EU budget for next year. Also this week is the first "Question Time" with European Commission head José Manuel Barroso and a resolution on freedom of information in Italy and other countries.
Monday: Clear skies with sunny periods expected in Strasbourg as President Jerzy Buzek opens the October session at 1700 CET. This will give way to possible claps of thunder during the one minute speeches by MEPs. Expect humid and tropical conditions as the House considers short-stay visa waivers for several Caribbean countries.
Tuesday: The morning starts mild then gets warmer, dry and arid as Members debate climate change ahead of December's Copenhagen climate summit.
There is the chance of occasional squalls in the afternoon as MEPs hold the first ever Q&A session with Commission President Barroso . Chilly periods, frost and warm fronts are expected depending on whether his admirers or critics are asking the questions.
Temperatures could soar late afternoon as the 2010 EU budget , which could see a new €300 million dairy fund set up, comes up for debate.
Wednesday: A bracing breeze blows in from Scandinavia as Sweden's EU Minister Cecilia Malmström briefs MEPs on preparations for the next EU summit at the end of the month, with the tough question of who will get the EU top jobs expected to dominate. Localised frosty conditions and occasional strong gusts of wind towards Prague (the Czech Republic is the only EU country that still has to ratify the Lisbon Treaty) could be followed by a thaw during the ensuing debate.
Midday could see unpredictable weather, with abrupt rises in temperature possible as a resolution on media freedom in Italy and other EU states is put to the vote.
Thursday: Expect sunny skies as the winner of the Parliament's 2009 human rights Sakharov prize is named.
A depression could settle in around the Chamber Thursday afternoon as the human rights records of Guinea, Iran and Sri Lanka come under scrutiny in a debate closing the session, though forecasters hope for a wind of change to clear it rapidly afterwards.
If you are in the Strasbourg area this week then the real weather forecast is sunny for Monday, with temperatures dipping on Tuesday and turning cloudy on Wednesday and Thursday.
