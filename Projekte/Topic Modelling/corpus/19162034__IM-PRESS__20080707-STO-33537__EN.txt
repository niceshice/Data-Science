Tuesday sees MEPs debate whether to include aircraft emissions in the ETS Plans to include CO2 from aircraft in Europe's Emissions Trading Scheme are expected to be backed by MEPs Tuesday when they debate the issue. Members are likely to endorse a deal that has already been agreed by transport ministers across the Union. It will mean that all planes landing or taking off in the EU will be in the ETS by 2012. It should add up to €9 to an average flight by 2020. Airlines can sell CO2 allowances if they reduce emissions and buy them if their emission output goes up.
Over 85% of emissions certificates will be allocated for free, whilst 15% will be auctioned. MEPs are supportive of plans to use the money from the auctioning of emissions for research into cleaner aircraft, anti-deforestation measures in the developing world and cleaner transport.
Emissions from flights up 87% since 1990
The wider aim is to reduce the emissions that planes produce. Although planes contribute just 5% of all greenhouse gases their output has risen 87% since 1990. Fumes released high in the air are harmful to the atmosphere as the thinness of air makes dispersal difficult.
Humanitarian flights and emergency medical services are just two of the areas that will be excluded along with police and military flights. Journeys taken by plane by European Government Ministers, Prime Ministers and Presidents will be included.
Tuesday morning sees MEPs debate the issues involved at this, the 2nd reading of the proposed legislation - which aims to amend an earlier directive. They will also vote on a relevant report by German centre-right MEP Peter Liese (EPP-ED). You can watch the debate from Strasbourg live online here on the parliament's website on Tuesday.
