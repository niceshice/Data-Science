Members of the public taking part in citizens' forum in Norwich
A grey November Saturday in East Anglia saw some 130 young people - mainly first-time voters in 2009 - gather in EPIC, the East of England Production Innovation Centre, the former Anglia TV studios in Norwich.
The third Citizens' Forum in the UK and the first in England was about to get under way. After a welcome, an inspiring rap and keynote speech (all by young people), the participants took part in an electronic quiz which explored their knowledge of the EU, their attitudes to EU policies and investigated possible contradictions in their attitudes. This led to animated discussion in the whole group.
After a quick sandwich lunch, four working groups looked in more depth at policy issues such as the challenge of dealing with migrant workers, and environmental sustainability in Europe, each working group assisted by facilitators.
The young people then took part in a cross-party panel discussion with MEPs from the region, Chris Beazley (Conservative), Andrew Duff (Liberal Democrat) and Richard Howitt (Labour) (Jeffrey Titford of UKIP unfortunately being obliged to cancel at the last minute).
A further electronic voting session took place to explore if exposure to the day had led participants' attitudes to change (they tended to be reinforced). And the event ended with a prize for the best suggestion for the future of Europe, won by Charlotte Pridham from John Leggott College in Scunthorpe with the idea that each MEP should employ a young person as researcher and adviser on young people's issues.
The BBC TV "Politics Show" was present throughout the day and broadcast a programme on the event the following day, which can be seen at the link below.
