More information needed on avian flu
As bird flu moves closer to the EU, with confirmed cases in Romania, Ukraine, Croatia and Turkey, people are getting worried and looking to the EU institutions for answers and information, Environment Committee Chairman Karl-Heinz Florenz said Monday, but the situation remains unclear.
Introducing Health and Consumer Protection Commissioner Markos Kyprianou, who came to discuss avian flu with the Committee, Mr Florenz said he hoped the Commissioner was well, given his recent visits to China and Turkey, where there have been human deaths from avian influenza. He said that the public lacks clear information about how they can actually catch the disease and what safeguards are in place to protect the EU.
MEPs were very keen to hear what measures are being taken at national level to contain any outbreak of the virus and to perform real-time analysis. The Commissioner said "the EU is still the best prepared region in the world but there is still a lot to do, we can't allow complacency." He urged Member States to improve information exchange and keep alert.
He agreed with committee members that research is very important, which is why of the 100 million euros the European Commission is pledging to support the fight against avian influenza outside the EU, 20 million is committed to research projects.
To those MEPs who asked exactly how the disease could be contracted and in what danger EU citizens stand, Mr Kyprianou said that well-cooked meat doesn't contain the disease and in any case, in the EU, sick birds don't get onto the market so "the combination of the two makes it safe."
He said that many of the problems had arisen from the handling of raw meat, blood and sick animals. Noting that in one Turkish case, someone preparing the meal got sick but the people eating it didn't fall ill, "If people are educated to follow personal hygiene rules...to wash their hands" risks would be reduced.
