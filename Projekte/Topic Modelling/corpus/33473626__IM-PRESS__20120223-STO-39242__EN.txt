Infograph on the gender pay gap You can't put a price on equality but you certainly can measure it in weeks: today marks how much longer women have had to work to earn as much as men did in 2011. The second European Equal Pay Day calls attention to the continuing gap between men's and women's salaries by indicating when women achieve pay equality with men in the previous year.
Equality between women and men is one of the core values of the European Union. The principle of equal pay for equal work was enshrined in the Treaty of Rome in 1957, but more than 50 years later men and women are still often paid differently for doing the same work.
