17th country to join euro 1.3 million people represented by 6 MEPs The Baltic State of Estonia became the 17th country to join the euro currency on 1 January. Its 1.3 million people will now join an estimated 330 million people across Europe in having the single currency. It will also become the first former Soviet Republic to adopt the euro. Estonia's particular coins will have a picture of Estonia on one side with the name of the country - "Eesti" - on them. The other side will be the same as all other euro coins.
Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek welcomed the change saying that "this is a result of the strong commitment of Estonia to comply with all the necessary standards and to pave the way to a prosperous future of its citizens". In the European Parliament itself the country is represented by 6 Members who were last elected in June 2009.
Despite the turbulence the single currency has experienced over the last year the government in Tallinn has made the decision to embrace the euro as a way of securing economic stability. The national currency - the Kroon - will still be legal tender for most of January.
Launched as a currency in 1999 and in circulation since 2002 the euro is now used by Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain. All of the other countries in the European Union bar the UK and Denmark (who both have permanent opt-outs on joining the single currency) are obliged to join the euro under the terms of their Accession Treaties to the EU once certain economic conditions are met and when they make the political decision to do so.
