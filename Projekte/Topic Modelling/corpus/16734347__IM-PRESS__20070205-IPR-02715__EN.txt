The UK recycles little compared to other European countries
The Environment Committee is tabling a report to the House aimed at tackling Europe's growing mountain of waste. The report is on a draft directive from the European Commission, which puts forward binding targets for reducing waste and rejects Commission proposals to modify the existing five-stage "waste hierarchy". Parliament's rapporteur from the UK, set out her position on 8 February.
Speaking at a media briefing in London ahead of the vote on the new EU Waste Directive, European Parliament rapporteur Caroline Jackson MEP (Cons, SW) said: 'If I have one message for UK local authorities, it is this: If you are planning a new incinerator as part of your Waste Management Plan, you will need to understand the new energy efficiency criteria laid down in this new directive. Some authorities may have to redesign their proposed incineration plants if they wish these to be redefined as 'waste recovery' facilities."
According to the UK Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, in England and Wales alone the combination of industry, commerce and household waste amounts to over 100 million tonnes annually and is growing at around 3% each year. Provisional figures show that in 2004/05 English households recycled more than a fifth of their waste (approaching 23%) - but this is one of the lowest rates in Europe. The target is to increase this to 25% by 2005/06 and to reduce the amount of biodegradable municipal waste landfilled, in accordance with European Directives. The UK is still a long way behind many of its European neighbours, who recycle well over half their municipal waste. There is a huge discrepancy in local authority performance, with the worst still only recycling in single percentage figures.
Mrs Jackson told journalists in London that the new directive would lay down three markers in EU law:-
- setting out a hierarchy of waste, which could be referred to in planning decisions. The hierarchy would have 5 levels: prevention and reduction of waste; re-use of waste; recycling; recovery; safe and environmentally sound disposal. By tightening up the definitions in the directive, the European Parliament would help to avoid expensive cases being taken to the European Court of Justice for interpretation in future. Other amendments tabled seek to define when waste ceases to be considered as waste, given that under current rules second-hand clothing can be classified as waste and cannot therefore always be exported to developing countries;
- in response to public demand, the European Parliament would be looking to set targets for the prevention of waste for the first time;
- the directive would specify when waste can be defined as 'recovery' rather than 'disposal' by the use of energy efficiency criteria - hence the need for local authorities to keep an eye on this directive as it passes through the EU legislative process.
If the Council and Parliament can reach agreement on the final text before the end of 2007, the provisions of the directive would come into effect late in 2009, just ahead of the new landfill targets set down in the EU Landfill Directive.
Caroline Jackson MEP was also European Parliament rapporteur in 1999 for the Landfill Directive.
