Police cooperation is just one aspect foreseen under the Stockholm programme for 2010-2014 Â©European Community The initial scope of an ambitious programme of police, customs, asylum and visa cooperation between the EU's 27 countries was laid out in the Parliament's Civil Liberties Committee Wednesday. This "Stockholm programme" is the initiative of the Swedish presidency as current legal and political agreements in this field are drawing to a close.
The aim is to put citizens at the heart of the project with special emphasis being placed on rights, security and solidarity between countries.
As well as covering ways in which police forces from different countries can work together to tackle crime, the Stockholm programme will also look at Europe's asylum policy. In what could be one of the most contentious issues the programme aims to build consensus on a common approach among the 27 EU members on how to deal with migration and migrants when they arrive.
Negotiations are at an early stage and several of Parliament's committees will be involved in the drafting of a parliamentary resolution on the programme, which is expected to be debated by all MEPs in November.
Meetings will be held with national MPs on 16 November. EU leaders will consider a proposal at a summit in December.

The first Justice and Home Affairs work programme was in 1999, followed by the Hague programme in 2004
Co-operation on visas, migration and asylum more forward, but differences in national systems and a lack of mutual trust hamper progress
