Natalia DASILVA BXL (+32) 2 28 44301 STR (+33) 3 881 73661 PORT (+32) 498 98 39 85 EMAIL peti-press@europarl.europa.eu EU Member States need to pass from words to action to tackle discrimination against Roma people. Ensuring that Roma children go to ordinary schools (not special ones as happens in some EU countries), involving regional and local authorities in integration efforts, and ensuring Roma citizens' freedom of movement should be priorities in all national strategies to integrate Europe's largest ethnic minority, said MEPs in a debate on Wednesday.
