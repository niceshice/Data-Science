At the opening of this week's plenary session in Strasbourg, Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek welcomed the release from house arrest of Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, and voiced support for the 25 November UN International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women.
Aung San Suu Kyi had been one of the first winners of Parliament's Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought, but had been prevented from attending the award ceremony 20 years before, in 1990, noted Mr Buzek, adding that that he had invited her to attend a forthcoming session of the European Parliament.
The President also voiced support for the 25 November UN International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, stressing that women everywhere suffer violence, rape and humiliation, and adding that female genital mutilation is still inflicted on 8,000 girls every day. He reiterated that Parliament had for many years advocated action to prevent such abuses, and urged MEPs to wear rose petals to show their support for it.
