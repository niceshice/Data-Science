Monday 16 June 2008
The session starts on Monday at 5pm with a debate on the revision of the framework directive on waste . The EU will have new waste legislation which includes targets for re-use and recycling of waste to be attained by 2020 if a compromise between Council and Parliament is adopted in plenary. An informal compromise, proposed by rapporteur Caroline Jackson (EPP-ED, Conservative, South West, UK) has been achieved on the waste framework directive between representatives of Parliament and Council in view to a second reading agreement.
Parliament then turns its attention to environmental quality standards in the field of water policy . 33 pollutants - mainly pesticides and heavy metals - likely to be found in rivers, lakes and coastal waters - will be subject to environmental quality standards. Member States will have to "make progress towards compliance" of these standards by 2018, according to a second-reading agreement with Council. The proposed directive on water quality is the final piece of legislation needed to support the Water Framework Directive.
The House will mark 40 years of the customs union which was established on 1 July 1968. The customs union was one of the EU’s earliest milestones. It abolished customs duties at internal borders and put in place a uniform system for taxing imports. Internal border controls subsequently disappeared. Customs officers are now found only at the EU’s external borders. The House will also vote on a resolution on this topic .
Parliament then turns its attention to a report on 2010, the European Year for combating poverty and social exclusion . Persistent poverty is "a worrying phenomenon" in Europe which must be tackled more effectively, says the Employment Committee in its report backing plans to designate 2010 as the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. 78 million EU citizens live at risk of poverty, 19 million of them are children, recalls the Employment Committee.
On the sidelines of the plenary, two hearings take place . Vice-President and Commissioner Jacques Barrot from 5.30pm to 8pm in front of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs. A delegation from the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality will also participate in room LOW N1.4.
Second, the hearing of Commissioner-designate Antonio Tajani takes place from 8.15pm to 11.15pm before the Committee on Transport and Tourism. A delegation from the Committee on Budgets will also participate also in room LOW N1.4.
After the hearings, the relevant parliamentary committees will communicate their assessment to the President of the European Parliament, and to the chairman of the Conference of Committee Chairmen, in the form of an evaluation letter with a view to the final vote in plenary. A vote on both will take place on Wednesday 18 June at midday by the whole European Parliament.
Tuesday 17 June 2008
Tuesday morning is dedicated to the "return directive" or the first-reading of the directive establishing common standards and procedures for the return of third-country nationals residing illegally . This draft legislation lays down a maximum period of custody and a ban on re-entry into the EU by deportees, while seeking to safeguard the basic rights of the individuals concerned. Parliament has been working on the directive on an equal footing with the Council under the co-decision procedure. The UK is not affected by the directive because it has not opted into this area of Community law. The directive will, however, apply to Ireland.
Later on Tuesday morning, MEPs will debate whether to approve Slovakia's bid to adopt the euro on 1 January 2009 . The Economics Committee has already given its backing, but stressed that Slovakia should make further efforts to keep its rate of inflation down and continue structural reforms to its economy.
Tuesday afternoon starts with a joint debate on the energy market with particular focus on the electricity market . The Industry committee backs rapporteur Eluned MORGAN 's (PES, Wales, Labour UK) preference for full ownership unbundling, which is also the European Commission's preferred option. This would involve forbidding companies or countries from simultaneously exercising control over electricity generation or supply and "directly or indirectly exercising control over a transmission system operator" and vice versa.
Giles CHICHESTER (EPP-ED, UK) for the Industry Committee is insisting that the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators - proposed as part of the energy package - should have regulatory powers, contrary to the Commission's original plan. In the vote on three related first-reading reports, overwhelming majorities on the committee backs a strong decision-making role for the Agency.
Wednesday 18 June 2008
The key debate of the week is on the preparation of the Brussels European Council to be held on 19 and 20 June . The meeting of the European Council will be preceded by an statement by Hans-Gert Pöttering, President of the European Parliament, followed by an exchange of views. The main topics to be debated by heads of State and government are regrouped under: the Lisbon Treaty, freedom security and justice, policy implications of high food prices, economic social and environmental issues, Western Balkans and external relations.
MEPs will debate measures to take in the short-and medium to combat rising oil prices after hearing statements from the Council and Commission. Oil prices have risen over to $130 a barrel. Fuel protests triggered by rising oil prices have spread to more countries across Europe, with thousands of fishermen on strike. Marine fuel prices have gone beyond €0.7/l in most European harbours, an increase of around 240% since 2004.
At 11.30am, the House will vote on a report on the statute of the European Ombudsman . Proposed changes in the rules governing the European Ombudsman's access to information held by EU bodies and evidence given to him by EU civil servants, are set out in a report, proposed by the Constitutional Affairs Committee, on the Ombudsman's Statute. The key aim of these changes is to boost citizens' confidence in the Ombudsman's work. The vote will take place in the presence of the Council and the debate took place on 21 April.
At midday, t he United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, Asma Jilani Jahangir , will address a formal sitting of the House as part of the EP's programme of events for European Year of Intercultural Dialogue 2008.
MEPs will debate preparations of the EU/Russia summit after hearing statements from the Commission and the Council. The EU-Russia summit will be held in Khanty-Mansiysk Siberia on 26-27 June, when new president Dmitry Medvedev, will represent Russia for the first time. The House will also vote on a resolution on this topic.
MEPs then debate Sovereign Wealth Funds , government-owned investment vehicles that invest surplus state funds, which are growing rapidly; so also are the political controversy and the potential risks they give rise to, according to a question to the Council and the Commission from the Economics Committee.
Parliament also tackles the crisis in the fisheries sector caused by rising fuel oil prices . Philippe MORILLON (ALDE, FR), on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries will be asking the Commission questions on the crisis in the fisheries sector caused by rising fuel oil prices. The price of petroleum has quadrupled since 2004, and fuel prices have soared during May this year, triggering a serious crisis in the fishing industry, all branches of which are affected. The House will also vote on a resolution on this topic.
Late on Wednesday evening, Liam Aylward (UEN, IE) will present his report on the future of the sheep/lamb and goat sector in Europe . MEPs will debate proposals by the Agriculture Committee for urgent EU action to support sheep and goat farming, including producer income support and marketing measures. In addition, the Commission's plans for compulsory electronic tagging of every animal should be rethought, says the report.
Thursday 19 June 2008
Parliament debates the First Intelligent Car report . Intelligent car technologies need to be cheaper and be better publicised to increase their use, says an own initiative report. If fully deployed with the necessary infrastructure, Intelligent Vehicle Systems could save thousands of lives and alleviate congestion, environmental and health problems.
As usual the session end with three debates and votes on human rights around the world, on this occasion the topics are: Burma: ongoing detention of political prisoners, Somalia: civilian murders - an everyday occurrence and I ran : execution of minors.

European Council
Preparation of the European Council - 19-20 June
2008-06-12 - 09:50
The key debate in Strasbourg plenary is on the preparations of the Brussels European Council scheduled for 19-20 June 2008. The meeting of the European Council will be preceded by a statement by Hans-Gert Pöttering, President of the European Parliament, followed by an exchange of views. The Slovenian Presidency intends to focus the agenda of the European Council on the following items:
I . LISBON TREATY
The European Council will take stock of the state of ratification of the Lisbon Treaty. The Presidency will report on the progress of the preparatory work conducted in line with the European Council conclusions of December 2007 to ensure the full functioning of the Treaty as soon as it enters into force, subject to ratification by all Member States. The European Council is expected to note the progress achieved and to invite the incoming Presidency to complete the work by the end of the year.
II. FREEDOM, SECURITY AND JUSTICE
The European Council will take stock of progress achieved on certain key dossiers in the field of freedom, security and justice and give the necessary impetus to allow their timely adoption.
III. POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF HIGH FOOD PRICES
The European Council will assess developments as regards rising food prices and discuss policy implications for the European Union across the board, including possible consequences for development policy, trade policy, the common agricultural policy and energy/climate change.
IV. ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
In the light of progress achieved since its Spring meeting, the European Council may address a very limited number of key dossiers related to the Lisbon Strategy.
V. WESTERN BALKANS
The European Council will take stock of the implementation of the Thessaloniki Agenda. It is expected to reconfirm the European Perspective of the Western Balkans as well as to address a number of dossiers and initiatives aimed at supporting the political and economic development in the countries of the Western Balkans based on the recent Commission's Communication.
VI. EXTERNAL RELATIONS
The European Council will take stock of progress regarding the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals and look at possible means of accelerating efforts, as agreed last December. Further to the declaration it adopted last March, the European Council will revert to "Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean" with a view to the summit which will be held on 13 July 2008. The European Council will also address the enhancement of the eastern dimension of the European Neighbourhood Policy. The European Council may address other external action issues, in the light of international developments. Council and Commission statements - Preparation of the European Council (19/20 June 2008)

Separate electricity generation from transmission, says Industry Committee
2008-06-12 - 09:50
A European Commission plan for "ownership unbundling", i.e. separating electricity firms' generation assets from their transmission ones, was backed by the Industry committee. To ensure full separation, MEPs in the Committee also reject two alternative plans: one for an "independent system operator" to run unbundled transmission activities, and the other allowing firms to retain supply and transmission assets while ensuring "an effective separation of interests". The committee backs rapporteur Eluned MORGAN 's (PES, Wales, Labour UK) preference for full ownership unbundling, which is also the European Commission's preferred option. This would involve forbidding companies or countries from simultaneously exercising control over electricity generation or supply and "directly or indirectly exercising control over a transmission system operator" and vice versa.
No ISO
The committee rejects the European Commission's alternative proposal that firms could hand over control of their transmission assets (and over investment and commercial decisions) to an "Independent System Operator" (ISO). The rapporteur argued that this would entail "bureaucracy and costly regulatory control".
No third way
The committee also rejected, by 22 votes in favour to 26 against with three abstentions, a “third option” plan, backed by eight Member States including France and Germany, which supporters said would enable countries "to further liberalise their markets without having to resort to ownership unbundling". This would allow Member States to choose between ownership unbundling, ISOs and "legal unbundling" (whereby a vertically integrated company could retain its network assets but ensure "an effective separation of interests" through rules on assets, equipment, staff, identity and compliance control).
Members also back a Commission proposal to prevent control of transmission systems or transmission system operators "by a person or persons from third countries".
Consumer protection
MEPs also added some consumer protection measures to the proposal. Customers should have:
the right to withdraw from contracts with their electricity providers without charge,
the right to compensation if service quality levels are not met (as with, for example, inaccurate and delayed billing),
access to information on their rights through bills and electricity company web sites,
access to information on procedures to be followed in the event of disputes,
the right to change suppliers within two weeks,
the right to be informed, at least quarterly, of actual electricity consumption and costs,
access to smart meters within 10 years of the directive's entry into force,
the right to have their electricity provided by a supplier regardless of the Member State in which the supplier is registered,
access to information on the environmental impact (CO2 emissions and radioactive waste) resulting from the electricity produced by the supplier, and
the right to protection against market abuse: to that end, national authorities must be able to impose "price caps in uncompetitive markets for a defined and limited period".
The committee also seeks to specifically protect vulnerable energy consumers. EU countries, it said, should take "appropriate measures [...] to ensure that the number of people in energy poverty" (i.e. those unable to afford heating the home to an acceptable standard, as defined by the WHO) "decreases in real terms."
MEPs in the committee also urge Member States to cut the cost of energy to low-income households and inserted an amendment mandating national authorities "to introduce pricing formulas which increase for greater levels of consumption", so as to reward efficient consumption.
Another amendment says that if and when electricity companies pass the costs of free-of-charge Emission Trading Scheme certificates to customers, "Member States may demand reimbursement from these companies through additional taxation".
Energy efficiency and climate change
Given the inextricable link between energy consumption and climate change, members also authorized national authorities to require system operators "to give priority to generating installations using renewable energy sources or waste or producing combined heat and power", except when the safety and reliability of the grid is compromised. Member States "may require that a minimum of 2% of all electricity revenues from domestic consumers is spent to fund energy efficiency".
Regional integration
National authorities should work together to integrate their national markets "at least at one or more regional levels" as "a first and intermediate step towards a fully liberalised common European market", said the committee, which also called for a concerted effort to integrate the EU's "electricity islands."
Key issues for the UK and Ireland
Until recently, the UK was largely self-reliant on energy, producing significant quantities of oil, gas and coal. The gradual depletion of oil and gas reserves and a decrease in domestic coal production has led to a growing dependence on imports. In the electricity sector, gas has replaced coal as the principal fuel. Since 2005, rapidly increasing energy prices, growing concerns on security of supply and awareness of climate change have raised the profile of energy in the UK. The Government has come out strongly in favour of new nuclear build, while some regions are putting particular focus on renewable energies (particularly wind and tidal).
The rapidly increasing consumption of energy in Ireland, combined with the decreasing domestic production, has resulted in a significant increase in energy imports in recent years. Ireland exhibits a significant dependence on oil (nearly 60% of primary energy supply). The UK is the major source of oil and natural gas for Ireland. Gas has become the most important fuel for electricity generation in Ireland, gradually replacing coal and oil. Significant amount of wind power capacity has been installed recently. However, CO2 emissions per capita are still above the EU-27 average, while energy intensity remains at low levels. The high dependence on oil and difficulties in meeting Kyoto emission reduction targets are important energy issues.

Stronger powers for the EU Energy Agency
2008-06-12 - 09:50
Giles CHICHESTER (EPP-ED, UK) for the Industry Committee is insisting that the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators - proposed as part of the energy package - should have regulatory powers, contrary to the Commission's original plan. In the vote on three related first-reading reports, overwhelming majorities on the committee backs a strong decision-making role for the Agency. The Commission, in its original proposals, proposed creating two bodies to bring together the various entities running power distribution networks: the European Network of Transmission System Operators for electricity (ENTSOE) and gas (ENTSOG), endowing each with the power to adopt network codes on:
security rules, including interoperability rules and procedures for emergency situations;
grid connection and access rules;
cross-border capacity allocation and congestion management rules;
network-related transparency rules;
energy efficiency rules;
a 10-year investment plan;
an annual work programme;
research plans.
The Agency would only have played an advisory role to these two bodies. The Committee, however, turned this situation around. There was wide agreement among the political groups that it ought to be the ENTSOs who, on the basis of Agency guidelines, propose the rules, plans and codes cited above, and the Agency which adopts them. Moreover, MEPs decided, the Agency should monitor the ENTSOs' implementation of the network codes. It should also have a considerable say in defining "issues of prime importance" for the development of the internal market in electricity and gas.
With new competences come new responsibilities. The Agency, MEPs decided, should therefore be made more accountable: its director should be subject to a vote of approval by the European Parliament and should regularly report back to the EP on the performance of his or her duties.
The seat of the Agency, according to the committee, should be in Brussels. Rapporteur Giles CHICHESTER EPP-ED UK A6-0226/2008 Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators Procedure : Codecision (1st reading)

Towards a European Charter on the Rights of Energy Consumers
2008-06-12 - 09:50
Mia DE VITS (PES, BE) for the Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee will be putting forward an own-initiative report on "Towards a European Charter on the Rights of Energy Consumers" which underlines the potential added value of the Charter as an information tool collecting, clarifying and consolidating the energy rights of consumers as already adopted in the existing EU legislation. The report stresses that European electricity and gas consumers have the right to be connected to the networks and to be supplied with electricity and gas, at reasonable, transparent, non- discriminatory and clearly comparable tariffs and prices, including adjusted prices and tariffs resulting from their respective indexation mechanisms; non-discrimination should include a prohibition on discriminatory charges on certain methods of payment, in particular for those, often vulnerable, consumers charged by means of a prepayment meter.
Single entry point
The committee calls on Member States to put in place a physical single entry point for any consumer information request, for example through national energy regulators, thus facilitating consumer access to information and at the same time ensuring that information is available as close to consumers as possible in terms of place, time, tools and thoroughness.
Renewable energy
The report considers that priority should be given to renewable energy sources, combined heat and power and other embedded generation, and that the right of consumers to make an informed choice in favour of renewable energies should be recognised in the Charter. The committee considers therefore that all consumers should be informed in an objective, transparent and non-discriminatory way about the sources of energy available to them.
Finally, the report asks the Commission to carry out an in-depth study on the current use of smart meters in private households and, if necessary to carefully examine the possibility of developing and, after consulting Parliament, financing with a view to promoting best practices. The report underlines the importance of promoting and supporting industry in its efforts in this regard.

New waste targets to be attained by 2020 as deal set to be approved
2008-06-12 - 09:50
The EU will have new waste legislation which includes targets for re-use and recycling of waste to be attained by 2020 if a compromise between Council and Parliament is adopted in plenary. An informal compromise, proposed by rapporteur Caroline Jackson (EPP-ED, UK) has been achieved on the waste framework directive between representatives of Parliament and Council in view to a second reading agreement. It consists of 39 new amendments which will be tabled in the plenary by the rapporteur. Over 1.8 billion tonnes of waste are generated each year in Europe. This amount is growing faster than GDP and less than a third of it is recycled. Some Member States landfill 90% of their municipal waste, others only 10%. In September 2005, the European Commission proposed an overhaul of the 1975 directive, largely to lay down rules on recycling and to require Member States to draw up binding national programmes for cutting waste production within five years after the entry into force of the directive.
The new directive also simplifies the existing legal framework. It integrates the Directive on the disposal of waste oils and the Directive on hazardous waste into the Waste Framework Directive. It sets the definitions and ground rules for all the other pieces of EU legislation relative to waste - it therefore has a direct or indirect impact on them all.
Parliament's rapporteur Caroline JACKSON (EPP-ED, UK) commented on the compromise: "The adoption of this directive is an important moment for the European Parliament because we have transformed it. The original Commission proposal addressed highly technical points. MEPs have now added recycling targets and put a new emphasis on waste prevention. We have thus given real meaning to the Commission's desire to create a recycling society."
"Anyone who still criticises the package we have agreed has to realise that the alternative may not be a better package, but no package at all - a return to the 1975 directive with no targets and with none of the new definitions and clarities which the draft directive will introduce. This is as good as we are going to get - and it's very good."
Inclusion of targets for re-use and recycling
MEPs managed in including in the directive a new article on re-use and recycling targets, which was foreseen neither by the original Commissions' proposal nor by the Council Common Position. The compromise states that Member states "shall take the necessary measures designed to achieve the following targets":
- by 2020 for re-use and recycling of waste materials such as paper, metal glass from households and similar waste streams: 50 %
- by 2020 for non hazardous construction and demolition waste: 70 %
A special target for manufacturing and industrial waste, as demanded by MEPs is not included in the compromise but the Commission has to examine the targets by 2020 and eventually reinforce them or consider setting targets for other waste streams.
Waste prevention is reinforced - targets to be considered in the future
The new directive will oblige Member States to establish waste management plans and waste prevention programmes with waste prevention objectives 5 years after entry into force of the directive. Further to this duty the compromise includes a new article on waste prevention. The Commission shall propose - if appropriate - by end 2014 the setting of waste prevention and decoupling objectives for 2020.
Incineration
For MEPs, a crucial aim is to reduce the amount of landfill and incineration, both of which cause pollution. Members were divided over whether incineration of municipal solid waste should be regarded as a "disposal" or a "recovery" operation, the latter one being a better option regarding the waste hierarchy. The compromise amendments back the Commission and Council position that it should be categorised as recovery, provided it meets a certain energy efficiency standard (energy efficiency formula in annex II to the directive). According to the Commission this has the effect that only the most energy efficient existing municipal solid waste incinerators will be classified as recovery installations; this will be a strong incentive for increasing the energy efficiency of future incinerators.
MEPs nevertheless managed to include a revision after 6 years of the energy efficiency provisions into the compromise.
Member States to stick to binding five-stage hierarchy
The compromise makes the application of the five-stage waste hierarchy, which is designed to prevent and reduce waste production, more certain and comprehensive. The hierarchy also lays down an order of preference for waste operations: prevention, re-use, recycling, other recovery operations and, as a last resort, safe and environmentally sound disposal. As demanded by the Environment Committee, the article on the waste hierarchy is moved to a more prominent place in the directive. Member States shall treat it "as a priority order", in waste prevention and management legislation rather than as a "guiding principle" as proposed by Council. Departing from the hierarchy may be possible where it is justified by "life cycle" thinking on the overall impacts of the generation and management of such waste.
Some figures
The 1.8 billion tonnes of waste generated each year in Europe works out at 3.5 tonnes per person. This consists mainly of waste from households, commercial activities (e.g., shops, restaurants, hospitals etc.), industry (e.g. pharmaceutical companies, clothes manufacturers etc.), agriculture (e.g. slurry), construction and demolition projects, mining and quarrying activities and from energy generation.
Municipal waste generation averages 530kg per person per year, an average that masks significant differences among Member States. For example, per capita waste generation is 300 to 350 kg per annum in the EU-10 Member States, but around 570 kg in the EU-15.
In 2005, 49% of EU municipal waste was disposed of through landfill, 18% was incinerated and 27% recycled or composted. Rapporteur Caroline JACKSON EPP-ED UK A6-0162/2008 Revision of the framework directive on waste Procedure : Codecision (2nd reading)

Tougher EU-wide water quality standards
2008-06-12 - 09:50
33 pollutants - mainly pesticides and heavy metals - likely to be found in rivers, lakes and coastal waters - will be subject to environmental quality standards (EQS). Member States will have to "make progress towards compliance" of these standards by 2018, according to a second-reading agreement with Council. The proposed directive on water quality is the final piece of legislation needed to support the Water Framework Directive. The objective of the directive is to achieve good surface water chemical status. Environmental quality standards (EQS) for 33 pollutants like pesticides, heavy metals and others are proposed. These substances may endanger the survival of ecosystems, and via the food chain, human health.
Main points of the agreement with Council:
More substances to be controlled by 2018
Member States will have to "make progress towards compliance" of water quality standards, which take the form of maximum allowable concentrations and annual average values, by 2018.Thirteen of the 33 pollutants covered by the directive are already identified as "priority hazardous substances". Heavy metals like cadmium and mercury are among these substances.
MEPs call on the Commission, in addition to classifying 13 of the 33 substances as hazardous, to make a proposal as to whether 13 extra of these substances (including, dioxins, PCBs and Bisphenol) shall be considered for "possible identification as priority substances or priority hazardous substances".
In order to classify these 13 new substances as "priority" or "hazardous" ones, the Commission may decide so two years after the entry into force of the text (2011). The Commission will propose EQS for the new priority substances in 2013. Adoption of these EQS is scheduled in 2015 matching the deadline of the second river basin management plans Member States will have to submit.
This contrasts with the stance taken by the Council and the Commission, which sought to limit checks to surface waters, except for three substances that are more hazardous than others when they accumulate in the food chain: mercury, hexachlorobenzene, and hexachlorobutadien. Fish, molluscs or crustaceans will serve as indicators.
Reducing the extent of mixing zones in the future
Close to pollution sources, it will not be possible to comply quickly with environmental quality standards. In these 'mixing zones', pollutant concentrations may exceed the limits, provided that they do not prevent the rest of the body of surface water from meeting the standards.
MEPs want to guarantee that Member States ensure the best available water treatment techniques when they establish "mixing zones". A description of measures taken to reduce the extent of the mixing zones in the future should be included in river basin management plans.
Inventory of discharges, maps if available
Member States will have to establish in 2009 an inventory, including maps, if available, of emissions, discharges and losses of all priority substances and pollutants for each river basin district or part of a river basin district lying within their territory including their concentrations in sediment and biota.
Member States sharing bodies of surface water should coordinate their monitoring activities and the compilation of inventories.
Entry into force
The directive will be adopted in 2008 and will enter into in 2010 at the earliest (18 months of transposition). Rapporteur Anne LAPERROUZE ALDE FR A6-0192/2008 Water policy: establishment of environmental quality standards (amend. Dir. 2000/30/EC) Procedure : Codecision (2nd reading)

Better protection for pedestrians and cyclists to be introduced more quickly
2008-06-12 - 09:50
Plans to reduce the number of pedestrians and cyclists injured on Europe's roads by introducing tougher standards on the safety of motor vehicles will come before the House for a first-reading vote. MEPs are expected to endorse a compromise already reached between Parliament and Council negotiators. Each year 8,000 pedestrians and cyclists are killed and 300,000 injured across the EU. A new EU regulation seeks to reduce these figures by laying down stricter safety requirements to be observed by manufacturers of cars, SUVs and light goods vehicles. The regulation replaces the Directive 2005/66/EC and the Directive 2003/102/EC, some of whose requirements have now been deemed by an independent study not to be feasible.
The new standards relate essentially to a number of performance tests that vehicles and frontal protection systems are required to pass, and the compulsory introduction of brake assistance systems. Differentiated timetables for the introduction of these standards will apply to "new vehicles" (new cars made under an existing design) and "new vehicle types" (cars made under new, not yet existent, designs).
Under the agreement struck with the Council, most of the amendments to the Commission text proposed by the EP Transport Committee (rapporteur: Francesco Ferrari, ALDE, IT) have been accepted. In particular, MEPs have successfully pushed for the new requirements to be introduced more quickly than the Commission had proposed.
The main points covered by the agreement are as follows:
- The compulsory introduction of brake-assist systems (BAS) and the performance tests that cars have to pass in order to increase pedestrian protection (passive safety measures) will be introduced between 9 and 15 months earlier than the Commission is proposing. In addition, thanks to MEPs, no time distinction is to be allowed between lighter and heavier cars as far as the introduction of BAS is concerned. Under the Commission's proposal, manufacturers of certain types of SUV would have had more time to comply.
- Frontal protection systems (FPS), better known as bull bars, will have to pass the same performance tests as the vehicles on which they are intended to be installed.
- With regard to collision avoidance systems (for example, future technology such as infra-red systems that can identify pedestrians and other obstacles and avoid collisions with them more reliably than the car driver), it was agreed that once any such a system is developed, the EU co-legislators (EP and Council) will have the right to assess the effective potential of this active safety measure, and that there will be no automatic trade-off between passive safety requirements and anti-collision systems.

The First Intelligent Car report
2008-06-12 - 09:50
Intelligent car technologies need to be cheaper and be better publicised to increase their use, says an own initiative report by Zita GURMAI (PES, HU) on behalf of the Transport Committee. If fully deployed with the necessary infrastructure, Intelligent Vehicle Systems could save thousands of lives and alleviate congestion, environmental and health problems. The Intelligent Car Initiative is a flagship project within the European Commission's strategic policy framework for information society and the media, and in 2006 the Commission said it will launch a major intelligent road transport systems programme in 2008.
This report by rapporteur Zita Gurmai welcomes this project and notes that Intelligent Vehicle Systems could substantially reduce the annual death toll on EU roads - currently in the region of 41,600 as well as helping to reduce congestion, alleviate and even remedy environmental and public health problems, if the penetration rates for the systems are increased.
Cheaper systems and more information needed
However, the report states that at the moment many consumers cannot afford the new systems, so they need be cheaper as soon as possible. MEPs in the transport committee are also calling for better public information about intelligent cars and say car dealers as well as the media should play a key role in informing customers.
Towards a pan-European emergency call system
The report welcomes the negotiations on the inclusion of eCall, a pan-European in-vehicle emergency call system, in all new cars from 2010 onwards. In the event of an accident the eCall system will automatically call the emergency services and provide them with the exact location of the vehicle. It has been estimated that if fully deployed across the EU, this system could save up to 2,500 lives a year.
Electronic Stability Control technology
Electronic Stability Control (ESC) is a computerised safety technology that can avoid car crashes by reducing the danger of skidding and is estimated to save 4 000 lives per year if all cars were equipped with the technology. The rapporteur fully supports the Commission's goal of achieving 100% availability of ESC for the model year 2012.
Towards cleaner vehicles
Noting that information and communication technology (ITC) based systems can contribute to reducing fuel consumption and emissions and that car usage represents 12% of all EU emissions, the report invites the Commission to develop methodology for measuring the exact impact of ICTs on CO2 emissions so that reliable data is available for the car industry and consumers.
The use of portable or nomadic devices
MEPs in the committee also note that the use and availability of portable or nomadic devices had increased and called on stakeholders to work on ways to ensure that such devices neither distract the driver nor prove dangerous in an accident.

Inland transport of dangerous goods
2008-06-12 - 09:50
Bogusław LIBERADZKI (PES, PL) for the Transport Committee will be recommending that Parliament approves the common position on inland transport of dangerous goods. The proposed Directive aims to simplify and update the existing dangerous goods rules and at the same time extend the scope of the current rules by including inland waterways. The proposed Directive aims to provide a user-friendly single set of rules for the inland transport of dangerous goods in the European Union. The proposed Directive will make an important contribution to ensuring the safety and security of the transport of dangerous goods in the European Union.
In its common position, the Council introduced several modifications, which are summarised as follows:
those Member States which have no railway systems will be exempted from transposing and implementing the proposed Directive, insofar as rail is concerned;
all Member States, which have no inland waterways or whose inland waterways are not linked to those of other Member States, will be given the possibility of not applying the Directive, insofar as inland waterway transport of dangerous goods is concerned;
a transitional period of up to two years for the application of inland waterways;
provisions provided for to allow sufficient time for the adoption of national provisions, the establishment of legal frameworks and the training of personnel.
The transposition date is set for 30 June 2009 and Member States may maintain national restrictions on the transport of substances containing dioxins and furans for certain periods of time.

Higher safety standards for road infrastructure
2008-06-12 - 09:50
Parliament will vote at first reading on a draft directive to upgrade road safety management standards. The aim is to establish EU-wide standards on road infrastructure management, notably for Trans-European Networks. Safety standards for roads, in particular in road design and road maintenance, differ greatly between the EU Member States. To raise standards, the draft directive provides for impact assessments of the effect of road building on safety, safety audits and inspections, and improved safety in the existing road network. This would include the identification of high-risk road sections as well as the use of intelligent road signs and intelligent transport systems and telematics services for emergency and signage purposes.
The EP Transport Committee initially rejected the draft directive outright, on the grounds that it risked creating too much red tape and that this area was best dealt with at national level. EP negotiators have now reached an agreement reached with the Council, which the House can be expected to endorse in Strasbourg. The EP rapporteur is Helmuth Markov (GUE/NGL, DE).
The substance of the legislation is contained in the annexes to the directive but, under the compromise, these will be non-binding on Member States. Thus, the directive will in effect not lay down any major substantive requirements but rather serve as a set of guidelines for Member States on how to manage road infrastructure safety.

Immigration
Parliament to vote on deportation of illegal immigrants
2008-06-12 - 09:50
Parliament will vote at first reading on a draft directive establishing common EU rules on the deportation of illegal immigrants. This draft legislation (known as the "return" directive) lays down a maximum period of custody and a ban on re-entry into the EU by deportees, while seeking to safeguard the basic rights of the individuals concerned. Parliament has been working on the directive on an equal footing with the Council under the co-decision procedure. The UK is not affected by the directive because it has not opted into this area of Community law. The directive will, however, apply to Ireland.
EU immigration package
The European Union could soon have a common immigration policy covering the following areas: the fight against illegal immigration (the "return" directive); measures to promote legal immigration by skilled workers (the Blue Card directive); and a third directive, currently being examined by MEPs, that would punish employers of illegal immigrants and thus discourage clandestine working. MEPs have meanwhile visited several detention centres for illegal immigrants around Europe to compare practices in different countries.
Encouraging immigrants to return voluntarily
The "return" directive, laying down rules on the deportation of illegal immigrants, is the first of the three directives to reach the plenary stage at Parliament.
The Commission's original text seeks to combat illegal immigration through a two-step approach: a decision to expel an immigrant will be immediately followed by a voluntary departure period ; if the deportee does not leave a removal order will then be issued. If the removal order is issued by a judicial authority, which believes the individual in question might abscond, that person can be placed in detention. The draft directive lays down a maximum custody period : at present detainees can be held indefinitely in some Member States, including the UK (Ireland has a maximum of 8 weeks). It also requires guaranteed basic living conditions, including the right to health care and to education for children.
In addition, the Commission text limits the use of coercive measures and provides for a number of legal guarantees and appeals for deportees, to prevent arbitrary or mass expulsions.
A re-entry ban may be imposed on a deportee and that person may not re-enter EU territory again during the period of the ban.
Compromise in Council – but MEPs must still approve it
At the European Parliament, the Civil Liberties Committee decided its position in September 2007 when it adopted a report drafted by Manfred WEBER (EPP-ED, DE). In this draft report, MEPs reduced the maximum period of custody before deportation to three months (as against six in the Commission proposal) but they also decided it could be extended to 18 months if the individual concerned did not cooperate or was convicted by the courts.
At the Council, the Coreper delegations have also been examining the Commission’s text with a view to seeking agreement with Parliament. Regular “trialogues” between the Council presidency, the Commission and the EP rapporteur brought the different sides closer together, resulting in a compromise in early June.
Key points of the compromise
These talks resulted in a compromise text that was approved by the national delegations at Coreper on Wednesday 4 June and has been backed within Parliament by the EPP-ED, ALDE and UEN groups. It will be put to the vote in plenary on 18 June in the form of fresh amendments to the Weber report.
Under this compromise, the “voluntary return” period would be limited to between seven and thirty days. The period of custody would be six months maximum but could be extended to 18 in the cases described above and if the administration of the third country concerned was excessively slow. The re-entry ban would apply for five years, or longer if the individual represents a serious threat to public safety. Lastly, the text takes account of MEPs’ demands regarding children and families : they must not be subject to coercive measures and alternatives to custody must be proposed for them. Unaccompanied minors may only be deported if they can be returned to their family or to "adequate reception facilities" in their state of return.
Member States must also take account of the situation of the individual’s country of origin, under the principle of non-refoulement (which states that no state may send a refugee to a country where his/her life or liberty may be endangered). Following a recent ruling by the Court of Justice, the European Parliament will in future decide jointly with the Council (under co-decision) which countries are deemed “safe”.
Legal aid: Parliament’s red line
The main stumbling block between Parliament and Council is the granting of legal aid to illegal immigrants who have no resources. Under the original proposal this was to be mandatory but the Council wanted to make it optional given the financial burden it would impose on the Member States. The compromise with MEPs makes it mandatory to provide such aid, albeit “in accordance with relevant national legislation or rules regarding legal aid" and with the “procedure directive” of 2005 on aid to asylum seekers.
The Community return fund, set up for the period 2008-13 with funding of €676 million, could also be used to finance legal assistance.
A policy in the pipeline for several years
The idea of a common European policy on immigration was raised for the first time at the Seville European Council in 2002. The Amsterdam Treaty, in force since 1999, already provided the legal basis for a common policy. At Seville the EU heads of state or government recognised that immigration and asylum questions could not be solved purely at national level.
Once the directive is adopted, Member States will have 24 months to bring it into effect, except for the clause on legal aid, for which the period will be 36 months.
Visits by MEPs to detentions centres
In parallel to their legislative work, members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Internal Affairs (LIBE) have visited several detention centres to see the conditions in which illegal immigrants live. Delegations of MEPs have visited Italy, Spain, France, Malta, Greece, Belgium, the UK, Poland, Denmark and lastly Cyprus in late May. The aim was check whether existing Community law is being observed in the Member States. A report will be presented in the autumn by Martine Roure (PES, FR).

Year of Intercultural Dialogue - Asma Jahangir
2008-06-12 - 09:50
The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, Asma Jilani Jahangir, will address a formal sitting of the House as part of the EP's programme of events for European Year of Intercultural Dialogue 2008. A Pakistani lawyer and human rights activist, Mrs Jahangir is the chair of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan and was detained by the Musharraf government when a state of emergency was declared in late 2007.
She has been the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief since 2004. The mandate of the special rapporteur, who is an independent expert appointed by the UN Human Rights Council, is to identify obstacles to the enjoyment of freedom of religion or belief and to make recommendations on ways to overcome these obstacles.
Among topics Mrs Jahangir has examined are the display of religious symbols, the right to hold atheistic or non-theistic beliefs, the question of conversion and the freedom of religion or belief of detainees, refugees and asylum-seekers.
The UN first appointed a "Special Rapporteur on Religious Intolerance” in 1986. The title was altered in 2000 to “Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief”.
The Grand Mufti of Syria, Ahmad Bader Hassoun, has already addressed MEPs as part of the EP's programme for the Year of Intercultural Dialogue and the Dalai Lama is expected later in the year. Formal sitting - 2008, European Year of Intercultural Dialogue

Sheep and goat farming: a valuable sector in need of a helping hand
2008-06-12 - 09:50
MEPs will debate and vote on proposals by the Agriculture Committee for urgent EU action to support sheep and goat farming, including producer income support and marketing measures. In addition, the Commission's plans for compulsory electronic tagging of every animal should be rethought, says the committee. The sheep and goat sectors in Europe are at a critical stage, argues rapporteur Liam AYLWARD (UEN, IE) in his own-initiative report. Swift measures need to be taken by the EU to preserve sheep and goat farming on an economically sustainable basis.
The structural decline in the production of sheep and goats has significantly accelerated since the 2003 CAP reform. Of the total EU-27 sheep flock, 83 % is concentrated in six countries: Spain, the UK, Italy, Greece, Romania and France. However, sheep farming is also important for Portugal, the Netherlands and Ireland. The sheep flock dropped by 18% in the EU-15 between 1990 and 2006. Almost all countries were affected, except Spain. The UK flock in particular suffered from the foot-and-mouth crisis in 2001. In France numbers fell by 30%.
The Agriculture Committee's draft report proposes a range of measures to help the sector. These include:
- new financial support to halt the decline in production, including a per capita sheep premium and special payments for traditional mountain breeds;
- greater flexibility in the introduction of the new EU electronic sheep tagging system (which is costly for producers): each Member State would decided whether to use such a system;
- a labelling system for sheepmeat products, with an EU logo to allow consumers to distinguish between EU and non-EU products;
- measures to promote consumption of lamb and goat, especially among young people;
- research into the supply chain and claims that supermarkets abuse their power to influence prices;
- research into better veterinary products to combat diseases such as blue tongue;
- a task force to oversee reform of the sector.

MEPs will debate preparations of the EU/Russia summit after hearing statements from the Commission and the Council. The EU-Russia summit will be held in Khanty-Mansiysk Siberia on June 26-27, when new president Dmitry Medvedev, will represent Russia for the first time. The House will also vote on a resolution on this topic. The Slovenian EU presidency has announced that the last obstacle has been removed to opening EU-Russia negotiations on a new "Partnership and Cooperation" pact. Lithuania lifted its veto on the EU-Russia talks after having secured that the EU negotiating mandate - outlining what the European Commission's manoeuvring space will be during the talks with Moscow - will reflect Vilnius' worries in the field of energy, judicial cooperation and frozen conflicts in Georgia and Moldova.

40 years of the Customs Union - 1 July 2008
2008-06-12 - 09:50
The Parliament will debate "40 years of the Customs Union 1 July 1968" following a statement from the European Commission. The customs union was one of the EU’s earliest milestones. It abolished customs duties at internal borders and put in place a uniform system for taxing imports. Internal border controls subsequently disappeared. Customs officers are now found only at the EU’s external borders. The House will also vote on a resolution on this topic. The EU Customs Union means:
No customs duties at internal borders between the EU Member States;
Common customs duties on imports from outside the EU;
Common rules of origin for products from outside the EU.
A common definition of customs value
Agreement on these four principles between the six founder Member States (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) led to completion of the Customs Union on 1 July 1968, one and a half years earlier than planned in the 1957 Treaty of Rome.
After 1 July 1968 drafting of the Community customs legislation was pushed forward to make sure that wherever goods are imported into the EU, the same rules are applied. A legal framework was established covering such important points as:
Ensuring that the common tariff is applied in the same way all along the EU’s external borders;
Introducing a common approach on warehousing procedures;
Facilitating movements of goods in “customs transit”;
Replacing the wide variety of customs documents with a single administrative document.
All the rules on the above-mentioned points were finally brought together in a single piece of legislation, the Community Customs Code, which was adopted in 1992. Commission statements - 1 July 2008, 40 years of Customs Union

What can be done to combat rising oil prices?
2008-06-12 - 09:50
MEPs will debate measures to take in the short-and medium to combat rising oil prices after hearing statements from the Council and Commission. Oil prices have risen over to $130 a barrel. Fuel protests triggered by rising oil prices have spread to more countries across Europe, with thousands of fishermen on strike. Marine fuel prices have gone beyond 0.7€/l in most European harbours, an increase of around 240% since 2004. On 12June, the European Commission the College of Commissioners analysed both structural and cyclical factors and proposes a co-ordinated policy response, including immediate, medium and long-term policy options. Based on Commission proposals made over the last two years, these include stepping up the drive for energy efficiency in business and private households, a commitment to make proposals on the transparency of commercial oil stocks by the end of the year and support for the organisation of a global fuel summit between main producing and consuming countries to discuss a wide range of issues related to the balanced functioning of oil markets. The Commission agreed that Member States take short term initiatives to support the most deprived sectors of the population. These measures should fit into a co-ordinated strategy and should avoid distorting effects on the internal market or on fiscal and monetary policy.
At the latest ECOFIN Council meeting on 3 June, ministers were of opinion that the future will also bring higher oil prices, so they concluded that solutions must be sought for the adaptation of the European economy. In this context, they confirmed the 'Manchester agreement' of 2005, under which the Ministers of Finance undertook to efficiently coordinate responses to rising oil prices and to avoid introducing fiscal or other measures of a distorting nature liable to prevent the necessary adaptation of economic operators. They decided that any measures aimed at relieving the effects of the increased oil prices in respect of the poorest population segments must be short-term and targeted.
The ministers agreed to continue to carefully monitor the development of food and oil prices; furthermore, these two topics will be on the agenda of the European Council meeting on 19 and 20 June. Council and Commission statements - short and medium term measures against rising oil prices
Debate : 18.06.2008 Fisheries: Commission issues statement on the emergency in the sector - 29 May 2008 Ministers of Finance discuss high food and oil prices Commission calls for swift adoption of energy and climate policies as best coordinated response to rising oil prices

Fisheries
MEPs to quiz Commission on the crisis in the fisheries sector caused by rising fuel oil prices
2008-06-12 - 09:50
Philippe MORILLON (ALDE, FR), on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries will be asking the Commission questions on the crisis in the fisheries sector caused by rising fuel oil prices. The price of petroleum has quadrupled since 2004, and fuel prices have soared during May this year, triggering a serious crisis in the fishing industry, all branches of which are affected. Faced with this situation, many fishermen and fishing businesses have no choice but to cease their activities, with very serious economic and social implications for the Union.
Many maritime workers find themselves in a desperate situation, which calls for urgent measures and effective arrangements to be adopted in response to the emergency.
Last week French fisheries were paralysed, with vessels confined to port. The fishermen called on the authorities to take steps to deal with this serious state of affairs. The situation of conflict and cessation of activities is now spreading to other parts of the European Union.
Given that current arrangements, particularly those for ‘de minimis’ aid, are proving completely inadequate as a means of safeguarding the Community fishing industry, measures must be taken in the immediate, medium and long terms to support this sector of vital importance to the European Union.
In the light of this situation, the Committee on Fisheries would like to put the following oral question to the Commission:
What emergency measures and arrangements, and what long-term measures, does the Commission envisage adopting to help the fisheries industry contend with constantly rising fuel oil prices? Debate: 18.6.2008

Justice and home affairs
Keeping tabs on criminals throughout Europe
2008-06-12 - 09:50
Parliament will debate and vote under the consultation procedure on a proposed EU-wide scheme for Member States to exchange data from their criminal records. This will enable the courts to know about any previous convictions a defendant may have in another Member State as well as making it easier for employers to vet candidates for jobs in sensitive areas such as work with children. Under the new legislation (a Council framework decision), if an individual from one Member State is convicted in another state, the latter will have to forward certain data from that person's criminal record to the state of his/her nationality. Member States will be required to hold complete criminal records on their nationals, listing all convictions imposed by other Member States.
Each Member State will have to designate an authority to store data from the criminal records of its own nationals and the data must be updated systematically so it can be consulted by any judicial authority of the Union that makes a request.
Beefing up the Council's text
The draft report on which the House will vote was drawn up for the Civil Liberties Committee by Agustín DÍAZ DE MERA GARCÍA CONSUEGRA (EPP-ED, ES) and was adopted by an overwhelming majority under the consultation procedure.
One practical aim of the new legislation is to prevent paedophiles convicted in one Member State from taking a job looking after children in another state. In the run-up to the committee vote, the EP rapporteur mentioned several times the case of serial killer Michel Fourniret, who was able to work as a supervisor in a Belgian school while he was banned from doing the same in France after being convicted there.
MEPs want to improve the legislation by making the exchanged data easier to read, for example by including a special section on convictions for sex crimes. They also want national authorities to be required to give information on disqualifications arising from a criminal conviction (in the draft text this is optional).
MEPs concerned about data protection
However, the committee also wants to see tighter rules on the way the information can be used. It calls for better data protection by banning the processing of certain information (on racial and ethnic origin, political opinions, sexual orientation or health), except where a court mandate is issued.
European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS)
Lastly, the draft framework decision envisages the creation of a computerised system of data exchange on criminal convictions using a standard format (known as ECRIS). This would allow data to be swapped on the person as well as the form, content and facts of the conviction, using a standard, computerised format that would allow for automated translation. A separate draft decision setting up ECRIS has just been unveiled by the Commission (see link hereunder).

Food safety
Residue limits for foodstuffs of animal origin to be established
2008-06-12 - 09:50
The European Parliament will debate and vote on a first reading report by Avril Doyle (EPP-ED, IR) on a proposal to change current legislation on the presence of pharmacological active substances in foodstuffs of animal origin. The target of the legislation is to continue to reduce the amount of drug residue that consumers are exposed to. At the same time, the current, difficult to understand, legislation is to be clarified. Members of the Environment committee propose several amendments. Veterinary medicinal products used for the therapeutic treatment and the welfare of animals, which are destined for human consumption, may give rise to residues of such products in food-producing animals. In order to ensure public health and consumer safety, a risk assessment of the safety limit of residues of all pharmacologically active substances contained in veterinary products has to be carried out. Existing Council Regulations lay down that maximum residue limits (MRLs) be established for all such active substances, where appropriate.
The Commission's proposal seeks to resolve the difficulties encountered in the application of this existing legislation. It draws up and simplifies the time frames for how long veterinary products are assessed to remain in the animals they are fed to, as well as the maximum residue levels (MRL) that apply both to substances intentionally fed to animals as well as to those resulting from environmental contamination. This is seen as necessary for the health of both humans and of animals raised for food.
Risk assessment to be based on need to use medicine, combined effects assessment and effect on vulnerable people
The committee says that when assessing the risks of pharmacological substances it should be considered misuse to pre-emptively use veterinary medicine if the diseases could be avoided by improving conditions for animals in a proportionate and reasonable way. In the risk assessment specific attention should be given to combined effects of different substances and to their effects on vulnerable people, and also the direct toxicity should be assessed, not only medicinal or microbiological effects. A specific clause for the use of horse meat for food, which is overlooked in earlier legislation, was added, allowing the use of horse meat as long as a 6 month period has passed since non-injected medication.
Import to be banned if food contains medicines forbidden in EU
Further, the Committee agrees that food imports should be banned if they contain traces of pharmacological substances that are forbidden in the EU. MEPs in the committee also agree that Member States, the Commission or third parties should only be allowed to request maximum residue limits for products that are not at the moment cleared for use on animals under certain conditions. Such cases include when the substances already are being used on animals legally in third countries, as well as in the case of minor uses where no specific medicines exist yet.
Quick-track procedure for emergencies
However, in emergency cases where human and animal health and welfare is endangered, provisional maximum residue limits (for maximum 5 years) and quick processes should be allowed. However, food containing substances for which no maximum residue limit has been set, or if those limits are exceeded, are not allowed to be sold. Rapporteur Avril DOYLE EPP-ED IE A6-0190/2008 Veterinary medicinal products: procedures for the establishment of residue limits of pharmacologically active substances in foodstuffs of animal origin (repeal.

Poultry carcasses -MEPs to vote on a resolution
2008-06-12 - 09:50
The House will debate and vote on a resolution on the issue of poultry carcasses. At the end of May the Commission, after having examined the conditions under which poultry meat treated with antimicrobial substances could be marketed in the EU, decided today to submit to the Standing Committee on Food Chain and Animal Health (SCoFCAH) a proposal that sets strict conditions on the basis of which four antimicrobial substances could be used for in the decontamination process of poultry carcasses. These substances will have to be used separately and not in combination and they would have to be used to treat whole poultry carcasses and not parts of carcasses or poultry cuts.
Poultry treated with chlorinated water
MEPs in the Environment Committee raised strong concerns about moves within the European Commission to lift the EU-import ban on poultry treated with chlorinated water. This ban, in place since 1997, has effectively stopped all imports of United States poultry meat which is generally treated by this process. MEPs speaking in the committee said the chlorination of chicken intended for human consumption is not acceptable for the EU.

Forest fires in Southern Europe
2008-06-12 - 09:50
The House will debate forest fires in Southern Europe, reinforcing the European Union's response. On 7 September 2007, the House adopted a resolution on forest fires (see below) which urges the Commission to create a programme for the exchange of experience of the implementation of new technologies for controlling and following up the risks and effects of forest fires and to prepare a European approval procedure for the qualifications of technical personnel, to improve their training. The Community Civil Protection Mechanism
The Community Mechanism is intended to improve cooperation on civil protection assistance operations. It coordinates assistance, provides prompt support and assists any country inside or outside the European Union that needs help. The main objective is to provide the best possible response and preparedness when a major emergency occurs. These activities are coordinated by the Commission through its Monitoring and Information Centre (MIC), located in DG Environment's Civil Protection Unit.
Thirty states participate in the Community Mechanism, and the resulting pool of resources can be made available to disaster-stricken countries all over the world.
Since the Mechanism became operational in 2002, it has been activated for a number of disasters around the world. These have included the 2004 tsunami in South East Asia, the 2005 forest fires in Portugal, flooding in Bulgaria and Romania, Hurricane Katrina in the US, the earthquake in Pakistan in 2005 and the Lebanon crisis in 2006. In 2007 the Mechanism was activated for floods in Bolivia, as well as for forest fires in Italy, Greece, Cyprus, Albania and the former Republic of Macedonia. More recently the Mechanism was activated for oil spills in Ukraine and South Korea, an earthquake in Kyrgyzstan and floods in Bolivia and Ecuador.

2010 European year for combating poverty and social exclusion
2008-06-12 - 09:50
Persistent poverty is "a worrying phenomenon" in Europe which must be tackled more effectively, says the Employment Committee in its report backing plans to designate 2010 as the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. 78 million EU citizens live at risk of poverty, 19 million of them are children, recalls the Employment Committee. The 2010 European Year will coincide with the conclusion of the EU's ten year strategy for growth and jobs. The actions undertaken during this European Year will reaffirm the initial political commitment of the EU at the start of the Lisbon strategy, in 2000, to making “a decisive impact on the eradication of poverty” by 2010. The European Year also launches a process that had been announced in the Social Agenda 2005-2010.
"Wealth inequalities and severe poverty are matters of growing concern across the Union", stresses the co-decision report drafted by Marie PANAYOTOPOULOS-CASSIOTOU (EPP-ED, GR). 78 million EU citizens live at risk of poverty, 19 million of them are children, recalls the Employment Committee. In amending the priorities for the European Year, MEPs in the committee want initiatives to focus on fighting child poverty and the intergenerational transmission of poverty. Special attention should also be paid to large families, single parents, families caring for a dependent person, and children in institutions.
Support less-favoured regions
MEPs in the committee equally say that more support is needed for less-favoured regions, for areas with permanent structural disadvantages, for extremely remote regions, for island Member States and for areas that have been affected by recent deindustrialisation or industrial conversion.
Budget: Highest amount ever granted to a European Year
The EU will provide €17 million for actions and initiatives in the course of the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion - the highest amount ever granted to a European Year. Activities to be organised include meetings and events, information, promotional and educational campaigns at European and national level as well as surveys and studies.
The events should be planned together with people experiencing poverty, says the amended text, in order to develop social empowerment measures and to address policy gaps. MEPs in the committee also call for a study to focus on attacks on fundamental rights that are the result of serious poverty.
Use synergies with UN International Day for the Eradication of Poverty
The European Year should make use of the synergies arising from the activities organised for the UN International Day for the Eradication of Poverty on 17 October, say MEPs.
The committee considers it important to promote and support more voluntary activities.
Situation in the UK and Ireland
According to the UK Department for Work and Pensions, in 2006-2007 there were 13.2 million people living in poverty in the UK after housing costs. The number of children living in poverty rose from the previous year by 100,000 to 3.9 million and the number of pensioners living in poverty rose by 300,000 to a total of 2.5 million (before housing costs). The number of working-age adults living in poverty in 2006-2007 was 7.3 million.
Poverty levels in Ireland are still among the highest in the EU despite having the second highest GDP. In 2006, 6.9% of the population was estimated to be living in constant poverty with 20.2% of children and 13.6 % of pensioners being at risk of poverty. 1

Euro
Parliament set to back Slovakia’s euro area membership
2008-06-12 - 09:50
MEPs will debate and vote on whether to approve Slovakia's bid to adopt the euro on 1 January 2009. The Economics Committee has already given its backing, but stressed that Slovakia should make further efforts to keep its rate of inflation down and continue structural reforms to its economy. The committee's report, drawn up by David CASA (EPP-ED, MT), agrees with the Commission that Slovakia has met the criteria to join the euro.
Ongoing efforts urged on inflation and structural reform
MEPs in the committee note that the European Central Bank has identified risks concerning the sustainability of the low inflation rate achieved by Slovakia, and urges further fiscal consolidation, with a balanced budget in the medium-term, and for the social partners to keep wage growth in line with productivity growth in order to maintain a low inflation environment. They also call for the structural reforms to the labour, services and product markets to continue and say the government of Slovakia should ensure competition, notably in sensitive sectors such as energy.
Informing the public
The report also calls for a public information campaign to explain the benefits of the single currency ahead of the conversion, and for the necessary steps to be taken to minimise price increases during the changeover period. An observatory should be set up to monitor the prices of a selection of basic goods so as to fight false perceptions about price increases.
Next steps
The European Council is expected to take a political decision on Slovakia's euro membership at its 19-20 June summit, with the formal legislation being put to the vote at the following meeting of EU finance ministers. Parliament's role in decisions on euro area enlargement is consultative.

Economic and monetary affairs
The EU answer to the challenge of sovereign wealth funds
2008-06-12 - 09:50
Sovereign Wealth Funds, government-owned investment vehicles that invest surplus state funds, are growing rapidly; so also are the political controversy and the potential risks they give rise to, according to a question to the Council and the Commission from the Economics Committee. MEPs will hear the Commission’s and Council Presidency’s responses to the following question, tabled on behalf of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee by its Chair, Pervenche Berès (PES,FR), before voting on a resolution on the issue:
“The sub-prime crisis and its consequences had the unexpected effect of shedding light on sovereign wealth funds (SWFs). It created new opportunities for SWFs, some of which have come to rescue some major banks.
An EU response needed?
At the European level, do you think that the various current national initiatives create a need for EU coordination, which could bring together regulation elaborated by Member States in order to safeguard a true level playing field, while ensuring a potential for effective and timely answers, should sensitive sectors be affected? In that regard is the Commission (and does the Council think the Commission should be) conducting a review to check Member States' initiatives and their compliance with EU law? Would it be appropriate to evaluate objectively the range of tools we have at our disposal (i.e. transparency requirements, voting rights of SWFs, golden shares, shareholders' rights) and to have an EU approach to sensitive sectors that would overcome national borders? What do you think of a registration system for these funds?
Policy options for dealing with Sovereign Wealth Funds
To what extent do you consider Article 58 of the EC Treaty, which provides for restrictions on capital and payment movements on grounds of public policy/public order, to be in need of clarification in order to guarantee full compatibility with EU interests and perfect functioning of the internal market?
At the global level, what do you think the EU should do? Should it be leading the way for a global approach to SWFs, promoting best practices and finally tackling the reciprocity of market openness?
What do you think of defining and promoting a strong EU position ex ante, especially in global negotiations?
What do you think about running a fundamental reflection on the functioning of global markets and then making proposals to the appropriate international fora?
Do you think that action is needed regarding the oil monarchies, which are worsening the euro-dollar exchange rate disequilibrium, as oil is sold in dollars which are reinvested via SWFs in euro assets?”
The question to the Council, meanwhile reads:
At the European level, do you think that the various current national initiatives create a need for EU coordination, which could bring together regulation elaborated by Member States in order to safeguard a true level playing field, while ensuring a potential for effective and timely answers, should sensitive sectors be affected?

Development and cooperation
Fish and timber in West Africa need more sustainable EU policies
2008-06-12 - 09:50
Fish and timber are natural resources often not managed in a sustainable way in West Africa due to inadequate EU policies, says a report by the Development Committee. The own initiative report by Frithjof SCHMIDT (Greens/EFA, DE) is part of a periodic review of EU policies. The report draws on the role of the EP Committee on Development to assess how EU policies affect development in a new power granted by the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) that entered into in force December 2006. The periodic review of EU policies is called "policy coherence for development (PCD)" and forms part of the 2005 European consensus on development.
Preventing timber sales from destructive and illegal sources
Concerning timber policies, the report calls on the Commission to propose comprehensive legislation preventing timber from illegal and destructive sources being placed on the market and is concerned that cheap imports of illegal timber destabilises internal markets and reduces the tax revenues of producer countries.
MEPs in the committee are concerned about the negative effects of deforestation on climate change and indigenous communities and therefore call on the Commission to "respond favourably to requests to finance sustainable forest management initiatives" and for Member States and the Commission to "speed up the adoption of a green public procurement policy".
More sustainable fishing activities needed
The report calls on the EU to make fishing activities in West Africa more sustainable and considers that the EU's fisheries policy must be in accordance with the Food and Agricultural Organization's (FAO) Code of Conduct.
MEPs in the committee call on the Commission and West African Governments to curb illegal fishing and control fish stocks, and also note that when the EU reduces its activities in West African waters, their place may be taken by fleets from countries with less respect for the principles of sustainability.
Local impact of EU policies
The report stresses the importance of policy coherence as one of the EU's contributions to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and the impact of EU fisheries and timber policy on local sustainable development.
As more than 80% of the fish and timber exported by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) goes to the EU, the report states that "the EU can play a significant role for the region's further development in these areas".
In its policy assessment, the report included Member States of ECOWAS (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Côte d'Ivoire, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo), Mauritania and Cameroon.

Regional policy
EP to call for integrated town and country planning to help vulnerable communities and groups
2008-06-12 - 09:50
To help vulnerable communities and groups segregated in the EU's least-developed areas, EU Member States should draw up integrated territorial development strategies that harness local potential everywhere, say MEPs in a report. EU statistics may miss these groups, because the aggregate data used to compare whole regions sometimes hide huge wealth differences within them, notes the report, which suggests that more statistical indicators are needed to give policymakers a full picture. The EU's least-favoured micro-regions, urban and rural, are grappling with problems such as a lack of infrastructure, low levels of education, insufficient administrative capacity, high unemployment, deteriorating housing conditions, difficulty in accessing services of general interest, a lack of technological development, and large segregated minorities and vulnerable groups, notes the report by Gábor HARANGOZÓ (PSE, HU)
These problems are often aggravated, in town and country, by an exodus of job-seekers from the countryside to the towns, driven by the concentration of economic growth in urban centres.
Territorial development strategies to revitalise least-developed areas
The report calls on the Commission and Member States to allocate resources between cities, isolated territories and rural areas in a way that matches their needs and to establish tailor-made, long-term programmes for specific vulnerable communities and groups.
To revitalise least-developed areas, EU Member States should draw up "holistic territorial development strategies" encompassing all policy areas. Regional and local authorities, economic and social partners, and NGOs should all be involved in planning and implementing these strategies, says the report .
They should seek, for example, to develop infrastructure, foster development opportunities that draw on local potential; maintain services of general interest through enhanced local administrative capacity and public sector decentralisation, offer training and job opportunities, improve housing and living conditions and attract investors, says the report.
To help create jobs in the country, the report also advocates improving facilities for vocational training in rural areas to support business development in areas such as processing and marketing farm produce, tourism and services.
It notes that industrial units in rural areas are among the first victims of restructuring and relocation, which in turn reduces the range of jobs that small farmers can take to supplement their farming income , and also says that the Common Agricultural Policy needs to be revised to make it fairer to family farmers .
New indicators?
The EU's standard statistical unit for measuring regional entities (NUTS 2) is useful for comparing the social and economic factors at work in different EU Member States' regions, but, by aggregating data, it can hide the (sometimes bigger) differences within each region.
The report therefore calls on the Commission and Member States to produce comparable micro-regional statistical data, with special regard to social indicators such as the UN Human Development Index.
It also asks the Commission to assess carefully whether new development indicators (in addition to per capita GDP), such as social indicators, should also be used to identify the most vulnerable communities and groups and their locations, indicate disparities within and between regions, evaluate implementation and policy efficiency and provide guidance for development planning.
The Commission is also urged to examine whether the NUTS 4 (e.g. local authority) level would be "appropriate for pursuing a differentiated policy to achieve the objective of territorial cohesion".
Need to define "territorial cohesion"
The report stresses that the territorial concentration of vulnerable communities and groups, and social exclusion in the least-developed regions, is a growing challenge to cohesion in the EU and says that the territorial dimension of social exclusion should be dealt with in the context of territorial cohesion policy.
It asks the Commission to present, in the context of the forthcoming Green Paper on Territorial Cohesion, an objective for and a clear definition of territorial cohesion, the criteria determining it, its instruments and the means available for achieving territorial targets.
Build synergies to add value
The report urges the Commission and Member States to make more use of synergies and complementarities of financial instruments such as the European Regional Development Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Social Fund, the Community action programme on public health and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, so as to increase their added value.

Regional policy
Suspending duties on Canary Islands' fish imports
2008-06-12 - 09:50
A proposal to suspend Common Customs Tariff duties from 2007 to 2013 on the Canary Islands' imports of certain fisheries products solely for domestic consumption is proposed by the Regional Development Committee. This measure alleviates the high cost of imports due to the islands' remoteness
from sources of supply (in line with EU Treaty Article 299 on specific measures for outermost regions).
The proposed Council regulation is needed to fill a legal gap. Previous duty suspensions quotas for these products, in place since 1991, expired on 31 December 2006, since when import guarantee deposits lodged with the Spanish authorities have been accumulating.
These payments need to be settled as soon as possible. The regulation will apply only to products that are unloaded from ship or aircraft before the customs declaration for release is submitted to the authorities in the Canary Islands.
The proposal includes review and sunset clauses, and the Commission may suspend the
regulation if it has reason to believe that the provisions are being abused. The estimated cost in Common Customs Tariff revenue forgone is €7.9 mio per year. Rapporteur Gerardo GALEOTE EPP-ED ES Debate: 19.6.2008

Ombudsman
Clearer rules on European Ombudsman's access to information
2008-06-12 - 09:50
Proposed changes in the rules governing the European Ombudsman's access to information held by EU bodies and evidence given to him by EU civil servants, are set out in a report, proposed by the Constitutional Affairs Committee, on the Ombudsman's Statute. The key aim of these changes is to boost citizens' confidence in the Ombudsman's work. The vote will take place in the presence of the Council and the debate took place on 21 April. Changes in the Ombudsman's Statute were requested by the Ombudsman himself, Mr Diamandouros, in a letter sent to EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering in July 2006.
Clearer rules on access to confidential documents
Committee members propose an amendment to a provision that obliges all EU institutions and bodies to provide the Ombudsman with the information he requests. This amendment deletes the current caveat that information may be refused on grounds of secrecy, which Members felt that citizens could interpret as restricting the Ombudsman's right to acquire information.
The new text spells out the rules on the handling of classified information obtained by the Ombudsman and his staff in the course of their inquiries. The report says that they would be required not to divulge any sensitive information or any document falling under the scope of the Community legislation regarding the protection of personal data.
Officials bound to testify
Committee members also agreed to change the rule on the testimony of EU officials. The approved text deletes a requirement that Community civil servants must testify "in accordance with the instructions from their administrations". Again, the committee felt that this wording might mislead citizens into thinking that officials are not always required to tell the truth.
The report setting out amendments to the statute of the European Ombudsman and his staff is drafted by Anneli JÄÄTTEENMÄKI (ALDE, FI)
After the plenary vote in Parliament, the agreement of the Council is also needed for the changes to enter into force. Rapporteur Anneli JÄÄTTEENMÄKI ALDE FI A6-/2008 Statute of the European Ombudsman Procedure : own-initiative
