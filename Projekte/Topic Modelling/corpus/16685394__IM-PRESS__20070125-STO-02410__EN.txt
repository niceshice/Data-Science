Lifelong education and training is a key priority for the Agencies
Health and safety at work, training and improving working conditions were just some of the subjects up for discussion this week when MEPs met the directors of four EU Agencies. They were in front of Parliament's Employment and Social Affairs Committee to set out their plans for 2007. The overall aim of their approach is to improve the employment conditions of millions of workers across the EU.
Training - but what kind?
Muriel Dunbar of the European Training Foundation told MEPs that people's skills do not often match the needs of the labour market. For example Europe has many University Graduates with excellent academic skills while the job market is short of specialised workers.
She also told the Committee that an ageing population and rising retirement age would demand new approached to lifelong learning.
In her presentation Mrs Dunbar highlighted concerns over the acquisition of skills by migrants and the level of social exclusion that a skill shortage can create.
Being safe at work
Health and Safety at work is the most important aspect of any job. The European Agency responsible for this field has set out a series of priorities for the year ahead. They include focusing on work related stress, accidents, absenteeism and migrant workers. The Agency will also have a campaign this year on musculoskeletal disorders.
Globalisation, migration under spotlight
With 2007 being the European Year of Equal Opportunities, Jorma Karppinen of the EU's Foundation for Living and Working conditions explained this would guide their work for the year.
In particular the effects of globalisation, the issue of migration and innovation in the workplace would be their focus. They would also conduct research on the effects of undeclared work - the so called "black" or "grey" economy.
Vocational Training
Aviana Bulgarelli of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training said her aim in 2007 was to "strengthen European cooperation" in the field. In particular by providing expert support for policy makers and reporting on developments in vocational training. She also pledged to ensure that new and possible future EU members are aware of best practice in the area.
