Preparation of the European Council 15-16 October
MEPs will debate preparations for the forthcoming European Council on 15 and 16 October. The meeting will be preceded by a statement by Hans-Gert Pöttering , President of the European Parliament, followed by an exchange of views.
Use by the European Parliament of the symbols of the European Union
The European Union flag, anthem and motto are to be formally recognised in a report put forward to the plenary. A proposal to amend Parliament's Rules of Procedure so as to formalise its use of these symbols is being put forward by the Constitutional Affairs Committee.
Enforcement of the ECJ Judgment on the 'Turco' case
Marco CAPPATO (ALDE, IT) and Michael CASHMAN (PSE, UK), on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Anneli JÄÄTTEENMÄKI (ALDE, FI) and Costas BOTOPOULOS (PES, EL), on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, will be asking the Council and Commission questions on the enforcement of the ECJ Judgment on the 'Turco' Case (transparency in the legislative preparatory works/documents)
Together for health: A strategic approach for the EU 2008-2013
Alojz PETERLE (EPP-ED, SI) will be putting forward a non-binding report entitled Together for health: A strategic approach for the EU 2008-2013, which says that disease prevention efforts and vaccination campaigns, where effective products exist, should be stepped up significantly. The report stresses the importance of carrying out well-organised, comprehensive and effective screening programmes to facilitate the early detection and immediate treatment of disease, thereby reducing the associated mortality and morbidity.
MEPs advocate a holistic approach to eradicating poverty
A holistic approach to eradicating poverty, which seeks to ensure adequate incomes, quality jobs and better access to social services and services of general interest, is advocated by the Employment and Social Affairs Committee in an own-initiative report by Gabriele ZIMMER (GUE/NGL, DE) on promoting social inclusion and combating poverty, including child poverty, in the EU. Eight per cent of EU workers are at risk of poverty. The report stresses that, although having a job is the best defence against poverty, it is not always a guarantee.
Implementation of social legislation relating to road transport
Alejandro CERCAS (PES, ES) will be tabling an own-initiative report for the Employment and Social Affairs Committee on the implementation of social legislation relating to road transport. MEPs express concern at the shortcomings and delays in the transposition and implementation of social legislation relating to road transport in some Member States. Self-employed drivers should also be included in the scope of the directive, say MEPs.
Water scarcity and droughts in the EU
Richard SEEBER (EPP-ED, AT) will be putting forward an own-initiative report on water scarcity and droughts in the European Union. The Environment Committee urges the Commission and Member States to acknowledge that deforestation and unrestrained urban development are contributing to growing water scarcity. The committee calls on the Member States and the authorities concerned to pay heed to water-related considerations in their land-use planning.
Financial market supervision: call for wide-ranging reform
MEPs will debate and vote on a formal call on the Commission to come up with legislation to improve the supervisory architecture for financial services in Europe, based on a report from the Economic and Monetary Committee. The report, drawn up by Ieke van den BURG (PES, NL) and Daniel DÄIANU (ALDE, RO), is a comprehensive overview of areas that need attention in the light of the current crisis and after seven years of operation of the current “Lamfalussy system” It includes recommendations on the structure for the “Level 3” Committees of national financial regulators (CESR for securities, CEIOPS for pensions and insurance, and CEBS for banking) and on the mechanisms for managing systemic risk.
Accounting standards: proposals for improved governance structure
Following a debate in September plenary, MEPs will vote on a resolution on the future of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Parliament adopted a report calling for changes in the governance structure of the IASB in April and since then its oversight body, the International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation, has issued a consultation document with proposed changes.
Situation in Belarus after parliamentary elections
MEPs will debate and vote on a resolution on the situation in Belarus following statements from the Commission and the Council.
Suspension of the WTO Doha Round
Following Commissioner Peter MANDELSON's (Commissioner for Trade) return to the UK government, MEPs will debate the suspension of the WTO Doha round. MEPs debate a Commission statement on the current deadlock in the Round launched Doha in 2001. Trade ministers from 35 WTO members met in Geneva last July for intensive negotiations but failed to reach a deal on a special safeguard mechanism for developing country farmers and on NAMA (non-agricultural market access), two key areas in the Doha Round.
Partnership and Cooperation Agreement - EC-Ukraine
The Committee on International Trade is proposing a report drafted by Zbigniew ZALESKI (EPP-ED, PL) approving the conclusion of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Community and Ukraine in relation to preservation of commitments on trade in services contained in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.
Arctic governance in a global world
Diana WALLIS (UK), Bilyana Ilieva RAEVA ( BG) and Johannes LEBECH (DK), on behalf of the ALDE Group, will be asking the Commission questions on Arctic governance in a global world.
Combating undeclared work
An own-initiative report on a European Commission proposal to step up efforts to combat undeclared work is being proposed by the EP Employment and Social Affairs Committee. Undeclared work, which in some Member States accounts of 20% of GDP, is a worrying feature of Europe's labour markets, say MEPs. Undeclared work risks undermining the European social model and distorting competition on the single market. It also leads to social dumping, notes the report by Pier Antonio PANZERI (PES, IT). Furthermore, immigrants, particularly illegal ones, are more exposed to the risks of undeclared work. 20080925BRI38127 Final draft agenda - 8-9 October 2008 Live broadcasts from plenary European Parliament's web TV channel

2008-10-06 - 13:51
MEPs will debate preparations for the forthcoming European Council on 15 and 16 October. The meeting will be preceded by a statement by Hans-Gert Pöttering, President of the European Parliament, followed by an exchange of views. President Sakozy has written to his fellow Heads of State and government saying the financial crisis calls for unity and a willingness to cooperate with regard to action. The agenda is as follows:
I. Lisbon Treaty
Further to the conclusions of its meeting in June 2008, the European Council will consider the way forward with regard to the Lisbon Treaty.

The European Council will be asked to adopt the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum, the content of which the JHA Council will be asked to approve at its meeting on 25 September 2008.
III. Economic, financial, environmental and energy issues
The European Council should devote part of its discussions to economic, financial, environmental and energy issues. Under this heading it will probably tackle the following subjects:
– the present economic situation
– current discussions on improving financial stability in the European Union
– responses to the volatility of the prices of foodstuffs and energy
– measures to combat climate change and improve the Union's energy security.
IV. Follow-up to the extraordinary meeting of the European Council on 1 September 2008
The European Council could provide a follow-up as necessary to its extraordinary meeting on 1 September 2008 on the crisis in Georgia and relations with Russia, in particular in respect of the implementation of the agreement of 8 September 2008, the role to be played by the Union politically and on the ground, the action undertaken in support of Georgia and relations between the European Union and Russia, especially with a view to the summit on 14 November 2008.
For the record: Reflection Group
The European Council could determine the composition of the Group and decide on the launch of its discussions. Council and Commission statements - Preparation of the European Council (15-16 October 2008)

Financial market supervision: call for wide-ranging reform
2008-10-06 - 13:51
MEPs will debate and vote on a formal call on the Commission to come up with legislation to improve the supervisory architecture for financial services in Europe, based on a report from the Economic and Monetary Committee. The report, drawn up by Ieke van den Burg (PES, NL) and Daniel Dăianu (ALDE, RO), is a comprehensive overview of areas that need attention in the light of the current crisis and after seven years of operation of the current “Lamfalussy system” It includes recommendations on the structure for the “Level 3” Committees of national financial regulators (CESR for securities, CEIOPS for pensions and insurance, and CEBS for banking) and on the mechanisms for managing systemic risk.
Solid legal basis for supervision
MEPs in the committee argue that voluntary arrangements are insufficient to streamline the fragmented structure of European supervisors that need to guarantee the stability of the financial markets and protect the real economy against excessive risks. The Level 3 committees need a legal status commensurate with their duties, and national supervisors should have a commitment to executing the decisions of the committees written into their mandates.
MEPs in the committee encourage the Level 3 Committees to work towards better cross-sector and cross-border integration and coordination.
The committee says that colleges of supervisors dealing with cross-border institutions should become mandatory with a fairly fixed division of competences and a system of qualified majority voting between the supervisors which enables them to make decisions.
Role of the ECSB and international representation
Micro- and macro-prudential and market supervisors should combine their knowledge of developments in the market. The European System of Central Banks would get a central position to coordinate and to take leadership if necessary.
The division of information and tasks should also be streamlined to improve the voice of the European Union at international level, says the report. The EU should have a clear voice in the G8 and the Financial Stability Forum.
Transparency: securitisation, complex financial products and rating agencies
The report calls for measures to make the securitisation process (the selling on as investment products of loans by those who originate them) more transparent and for credit rating agencies to use appropriate terminology making clear the difference between complex financial products. It says companies should not be able artificially to keep debt vehicles off their balance sheets.
Originators of securitised products should be required to assess and monitor risk and ensure debt-backed securities are transparent enough for investors to be able to understand the risks they are taking on.
More transparency is also required when it comes to the over-the-counter markets, where clearing houses should be encouraged.
MEPs in the committee want to see lessons learned from the oversight of auditors to be applied to credit rating agencies, notably when it comes to conflicts of interest.
Remuneration disclosed and assessed for risk
Financial institutions should disclose their remuneration policy, notably including the packages offered to directors – and market supervisors should assess whether the remuneration policy encourages extreme risk taking when they examine a company’s risk management.
Procedural information
The report was drawn up under Rule 39 of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, whereby the EP can use its right formally to request that the Commission draw up legislation on a particular subject (Article 192 of the Treaty). To be adopted by the plenary, an absolute majority of MEPs must support the measure (i.e. at least 393 votes in favour).

Accounting standards: proposals for improved governance structure
2008-10-06 - 13:51
Following a debate at the previous session, MEPs vote on a resolution on the future of the International Accounting Standards Board. Parliament adopted a report calling for changes in the governance structure of the IASB in April and since then its oversight body, the International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation, has issued a consultation document with proposed changes. These proposals, and more recent ideas from the European Commission, were discussed during the September II session – with a number of MEPs in the debate criticising the Commission for its approach.
MEPs will now put to the vote a proposal for a resolution on the issue, based on a draft which the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee will be developing earlier in the week.

Use by the European Parliament of the symbols of the European Union
2008-10-06 - 13:51
The European Union flag, anthem and motto are to be formally recognised in a report put forward to the plenary. A proposal to amend Parliament's Rules of Procedure so as to formalise its use of these symbols is being put forward by the Constitutional Affairs Committee. The flag, a circle of twelve golden stars on a blue background, will be displayed in all EP meeting rooms and at EP official events, says the report, drafted by Carlos CARNERO GONZÁLEZ (PES, ES) and approved in committee with 20 votes in favour and four against.
The anthem, based on the "Ode to Joy" from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, is to be performed at the opening ceremony following each European election and at formal sittings.
The motto, "United in diversity", will be reproduced on all Parliament's official documents.
Finally, the celebration of Europe Day on 9 May is also to be formally recognised in Parliament's Rules of Procedure.
Any amendment to the Rules of Procedure must be approved by an absolute majority of MEPs (i.e. at least 393 votes in favour). Rapporteur Carlos CARNERO GONZÁLEZ PES ES A6-0347/2008 Use by Parliament of the symbols of the Union Procedure : REG

Constitutional affairs
Enforcement of the ECJ Judgment on the 'Turco' case
2008-10-06 - 13:51
Marco CAPPATO (ALDE, IT) and Michael CASHMAN (PSE, UK), on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Anneli JÄÄTTEENMÄKI (ALDE, FI) and Costas BOTOPOULOS (PES, EL), on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs will be asking the Council and Commission the following questions on the enforcement of the ECJ Judgment on the 'Turco' Case (transparency in the legislative preparatory works/documents) By the ECJ landmark judgment of 1 July on the joined cases C-39/05 P and C-52/05 P, the ECJ called on the Council to strengthen ‘the democratic right, of European citizens to scrutinise the information which has formed the basis of a legislative act’ (para. 67) by giving access to documents (such as the Legal Service Opinions) which were until now excluded, with the justification of ‘protecting’ the institution's decision-making process. According to the Court, such a justification (which is more suitable to protect negotiations between diplomats than between legislators) will no longer be invoked to outweigh the ‘overriding’ principle of ensuring democratic control by EU citizens over the EU legislative process.
In the light of the above:
1. How and when will the Council amend its internal rules and update its administrative instructions in the various phases of production, elaboration, diffusion and archiving of documents, in particular in relation to a planned legislative procedure?
2. When will the Council apply strictly Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 1049/01 according to which:
the identity of the national delegation should be known ;
all the preparatory documents should show the legislative procedure reference ;
all the agendas and outcome of proceedings of the Council and preparatory bodies should make clear reference to the background documents and should be registered in good time and published in the Council Register (including ‘room documents’);
How will the General Secretariat of the Council enforce the strict compliance by the Council Secretariat of Regulation (EC) No 1049/01?
3. In an interinstitutional perspective, does the Council agree that this ECJ judgment should also set in a new perspective the interinstitutional cooperation and strategy linked to the ‘better law-making’ objective as launched by the European Council Birmingham Declaration in 1992, which still need to be properly implemented?
4. Moreover, given that the transparency principle is closely interlinked with the principle of good administration as proclaimed by the EP, Council and Commission in Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, does the Council agree that the EU institutions should make clear to citizens in a fair and transparent way even when dealing with non-legislative procedures:
their organizational chart by indicating the remit of their internal units
the internal workflow and indicative deadlines of dossiers falling within their remit
to which services citizens should refer to obtain support, information or administrative redress? Oral questions to Council and Commission

Together for health: A strategic approach for the EU 2008-2013
2008-10-06 - 13:51
Alojz PETERLE (EPP-ED, SI) will be putting forward a non-binding report entitled Together for health: A strategic approach for the EU 2008-2013, which says that disease prevention efforts and vaccination campaigns, where effective products exist, should be stepped up significantly. The committee, therefore, urges the Commission to draw up an ambitious plan for preventive actions for the entire five-year period. The committee agrees that spending on health, particularly on prevention and early diagnosis of diseases, is not only a cost but also an investment that could be evaluated in terms of Healthy Life Years (HLYs) as a Lisbon Structural Indicator.
The report stresses the importance of carrying out well-organised, comprehensive and effective screening programmes to facilitate the early detection and immediate treatment of disease, thereby reducing the associated mortality and morbidity.
Healthy lifestyle
MEPs in the committee stress that the concept of ‘healthy lifestyle’ (i.e. a healthy diet, the absence of drug abuse and sufficient physical activity) needs to be complemented by a psychosocial dimension (i.e. a balanced approach to work and family life). The committee argues that a healthy lifestyle includes good mental and physical health and that these are also important factors in maintaining a competitive economy.
Antibiotics
The committee demands effective measures to combat antibiotic resistance including measures to make antibiotics prescription only, guidelines to decrease the prescription of antibiotics to limit it to cases in which the use of an antibiotic is indeed necessary, efforts to improve marker tests in order to encourage a more cautious use of antibiotics, and, where appropriate, hygiene codes. The report calls for special attention to be paid to the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteria. MEPs in the committee point out that the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) should monitor and evaluate the application of the guidelines and codes.
The report draws the attention of the Commission and Member States to the need to support research and promote the prevention, early diagnosis and suitable treatment of chronic diseases in order to ensure sufferers' welfare and quality of life.
The committee says that antibiotics are becoming increasingly useless as antibiotic resistance rises, whereas resistance levels vary across the EU, resulting from different attitudes to the use and control of antibiotics (3 to 4 times greater consumption of antibiotics in some Member States than in other Member States). The committee point out that antibiotic resistance is a European problem as frequent movements including tourism take place increasing the risk of spreading the resistant bacteria, and inappropriate use of antibiotics should therefore be monitored and prudent use of antibiotics encouraged, whereas the ECDC serves as the appropriate agency to coordinate these activities.

Social policy
MEPs advocate a holistic approach to eradicating poverty
2008-10-06 - 13:51
A holistic approach to eradicating poverty, which seeks to ensure adequate incomes, quality jobs and better access to social services and services of general interest, is advocated by the Employment and Social Affairs Committee in an own initiative report to be presented briefly to the plenary. Eight per cent of EU workers are at risk of poverty. Although having a job is the best defence against poverty, it is not always a guarantee, stresses the own-initiative report by Gabriele ZIMMER (GUE/NGL, DE) on promoting social inclusion and combating poverty, including child poverty, in the EU.
An adequate income
Some of the 27 Member States have a minimum income scheme, but others do not. MEPs encourage Member States to provide for guaranteed minimum income schemes for social inclusion.
Minimum income schemes should be complemented by support measures to facilitate social inclusion e.g. in housing, education, training, and lifelong learning, and income support schemes to help cover the costs to individuals and households, say MEPs.
Member States should also provide targeted additional benefits for disadvantaged groups (people with disabilities or chronic diseases, lone parents or households with many children), to cover extra costs such as those of personal support and the use of medical care.
Child poverty
Children and young people make up almost one-third of the EU population and 19 million children are at risk of poverty.
MEPs in the committee want child poverty reduced by 50% by 2012, and urge Member States to allocate sufficient resources to achieve this goal. They also back an approach based on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
Homelessness
Lastly, MEPs in the committee call on the Council to agree an EU-wide commitment to end street homelessness by 2015. Member States are urged to provide integrated policies to ensure access to quality and affordable housing for all and to devise "winter emergency plans".

Implementation of social legislation relating to road transport
2008-10-06 - 13:51
Alejandro CERCAS (PES, ES) will be tabling an own-initiative report for the Employment and Social Affairs Committee on the implementation of social legislation relating to road transport. MEPs express concern at the shortcomings and delays in the transposition and implementation of social legislation relating to road transport in some Member States. Self-employed drivers should be also included in the scope of the directive, say MEPs. The aim of Directive 2002/15/EC is to establish minimum requirements in relation to the organisation of working time in order to improve the health and safety protection of persons performing road transport activities, to improve road safety and to align conditions of competition.
MEPs in the committee call on the Member States to speed up the process of transposition and to provide for coercive measures in the event of failure.
Self-employed drivers have been excluded from the scope of the directive until at least 23 March 2009. It is important to eliminate disparities between the Member States and to help to ensure fair competition in the road transport sector by including self-employed drivers, say MEPs in the committee.
The committee calls on the Commission to give consideration to the argument of the European Parliament for the full inclusion of self-employed drivers within the scope of the directive after the transitional period, and to give appropriate priority to the social dimension of road safety and the health and safety of drivers and other road users when drawing up its official impact assessment.

Water scarcity and droughts in the EU
2008-10-06 - 13:51
Richard SEEBER (EPP-ED, AT) will be putting forward an own-initiative report on water scarcity and droughts in the European Union. The Environment Committee urges the Commission and Member States to acknowledge that deforestation and unrestrained urban development are contributing to growing water scarcity. The committee calls on the Member States and the authorities concerned to pay heed to water-related considerations in their land-use planning. The committee stresses that any supply of water regardless of the purpose of its consumption must comply with the principle of fair water tarification, thereby encouraging companies especially to use water more efficiently
The report stresses that the cross-regional and trans-border nature of river basins can have a serious cross-border impact on upstream and downstream regions, and that it is thus indispensable for the Member States, as well as regional and local authorities, to cooperate on the issue of water scarcity and drought ensuring sustainable and fair use of water resources. The committee considers that the specificity of the water scarcity and droughts issue requires coordinated action at EU and Member State level as well as at regional and local government level.
The Environment Committee calls on regional and local authorities to take advantage of the great opportunities offered by the Structural Funds and invest in the improvement or renewal of existing infrastructure and technology (in particular in regions where water resources are wasted due to leakages from water pipes) including, notably, clean technologies that facilitate the efficient use of water and can be linked to integrated water resource management (IRM), in particular to address the challenge of water efficiency (in terms of savings and reutilisation) in the industrial and agricultural sectors as well as on the part of domestic consumers.
The report stresses that planning for the European agricultural model should take account of the most frequent and acute environmental hazards as well as water scarcity and drought and that, in that context, an effective crisis management mechanism should constitute a fundamental element of the CAP.
MEPs in the committee take the view that the environmental value of forests and agricultural production must be reassessed in a context of climate change where it is absolutely vital to balance the increase in greenhouse gas emissions with an increase in forest cover, whose contribution as a carbon sink must be taken into account in all policies on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
The committee supports the Commission's commitment to continue to highlight the challenge of water scarcity and drought at international level, in particular through the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Employment policy
Combating undeclared work
2008-10-06 - 13:51
An own-initiative report on a European Commission proposal to step up efforts to combat undeclared work is being proposed by the EP Employment and Social Affairs Committee. Undeclared work, which in some Member States accounts of 20% of GDP, is a worrying feature of Europe's labour markets, say MEPs. Undeclared work risks undermining the European social model and distorting competition on the single market. It also leads to social dumping, notes the report by Pier Antonio PANZERI (PES, IT). Furthermore, immigrants, particularly illegal ones, are more exposed to the risks of undeclared work.
MEPs in the committee ask that Europe's efforts to combat undeclared work be more pro-active and incisive, so as to ensure that the modernisation of labour law in the Union is not confined to the purely theoretical level but is translated into effective, high-quality policies, and to ensure that improved job quality can be achieved in every case in accordance with the 'decent work' objective.
Better European co-ordination
MEPs in the committee call on the Commission to consider establishing a database on the various approaches and methodologies used to measure undeclared work in the Member States so as to promote the sharing of good practice and knowledge transfer in this area.
They also call for the EU to play a greater role in promoting co-operation and co-ordination among labour inspectorates, by strengthening the economic and technological resources of inspection services.
Undeclared work has various definitions in the national legal systems, and a definition common to all Member States would ultimately eliminate statistical uncertainties. The Commission's proposed distinction between legal and illegal activities can be used as a starting point, say MEPs.
Encourage the formal economy
The committee asks Member States to consider improving incentives to declare work and to impose tough sanctions on employers whom, despite benefiting from incentive measures, continue to employ undeclared workers.
MEPs in the committee also call for better enforcement of existing minimum wage legislation in each Member State and urge those Member States that do not currently have a decent minimum wage to consider developing one, in negotiation with the social partners and in accordance with national practices.
Free movement of workers in the EU
Finally, Member States that have applied transitional arrangements to the free movement of workers in the EU are asked to open up their labour markets to workers from all the new Member States, given that restrictions not only run counter to the EU's founding principles, but increase recourse to undeclared work and could create territorial imbalances, stresses the report.

Situation in Belarus after parliamentary elections
2008-10-06 - 13:51
MEPs will debate and vote on a resolution on the situation in Belarus following statements from the Commission and the Council. Jacek PROTASIEWICZ (EPP-ED, PL), Chairman of the Delegation for relations with Belarus on the parliamentary elections in Belarus in Minsk, 29 September 2008 said: "With great disappointment I have to conclude that yesterday's parliamentary elections in Belarus regrettably failed to meet the recognised international standards for democratic elections, which was also initially confirmed by the OSCE observers.
In spite of certain positive developments and several minor improvements from the previous elections, it is deeply regrettable that the Belarusian authorities fell short of their promises and did not ensure a transparent ballot. The fact that the OSCE monitors were prevented from observing the vote count in 35 percent of cases, testifies to fundamental flaws in the conduct of these elections.
Yesterday's vote in Belarus was further compromised by the fact that not a single representative of the democratic opposition was elected to the Belarusian Parliament. This is not a case in any democratic country around the globe.
Moreover, the restrictions imposed by the state authorities on the candidates of the democratic opposition as regards their access to the media, their meetings with the voters and the distribution of their electioneering material, further undermined their chances of being elected and stripped Belarus of a genuine and vibrant political campaign."
On: 30.09.2008, the French Presidency on behalf of the Council said: "The preliminary report by the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) on the conduct of the parliamentary elections in Belarus on Sunday 28 September concludes that these elections fell short of the OSCE’s democratic commitments, in spite of a measure of progress in relation to previous elections.
The Presidency of the Council is concerned by these conclusions and urges the Belarusian authorities to continue their efforts in order to comply with international democratic commitments and in this respect to cooperate fully with the ODIHR.
The Presidency has also noted the positive developments prior to the elections, particularly with regard to the release of the last political prisoners and the invitation to the OSCE to observe the parliamentary elections on 28 September.
It reaffirms the objective pursued by the European Union to reinforce democracy in Belarus." Council and Commission statements - Situation in Belarus

Suspension of the WTO Doha Round
2008-10-06 - 13:51
Following Commissioner Mandelson's (Commissioner for Trade) return to the UK government, MEPs will debate the suspension of the WTO Doha round. MEPs debate a Commission statement on the current deadlock in the Round launched Doha in 2001. Trade ministers from 35 WTO members met in Geneva last July for intensive negotiations but failed to reach a deal on a special safeguard mechanism for developing country farmers and on NAMA (non-agricultural market access), two key areas in the Doha Round. There is no "plan B" following the breakdown of multilateral trade talks in Geneva in July, Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson told a special meeting of the EP International Trade Committee on 16 September 2008. Replying to MEPs' questions, he warned that a failure of the Doha round would have knock-on effects on the multilateral system and on certain international agreements, such as the follow-up to Kyoto.
"The deal outlined in July is still on the table", said the Commissioner, who described the failed talks on a special safeguard mechanism for developing country farmers as a "pre-agreement", adding that "no-one is ready to abandon to these talks", even though issues such as China's special status or cotton are far from settled.
The possibility to resume negotiations has been talked about by senior officials from major WTO members, including the United States, the European Union, Australia, Japan, Brazil, India and China in the last few weeks. Council and Commission statements - Suspension of the WTO Doha Round

Partnership and Cooperation Agreement - EC-Ukraine
2008-10-06 - 13:51
The Committee on International Trade is proposing a report drafted by Zbigniew ZALESKI (EPP-ED, PL) approving the conclusion of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Community and Ukraine in relation to preservation of commitments on trade in services contained in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. The committee notes that the services area is essential for the EU and the Ukrainian economies. Ukraine has no choice but to reform this sector. The short-run transition hardship will result in a modernized, more transparent, open and competitive service market.
Ukraine's capacity to deliver world-class quality services would establish its international reputation and prove the country's ability to rise to the challenge. The European Union must be ready to support Ukraine's efforts both technically and financially but Ukraine must also do its share of domestic reforms and careful opening process.

Regional policy
Arctic governance in a global world
2008-10-06 - 13:51
Diana WALLIS (UK), Bilyana Ilieva RAEVA ( BG) and Johannes LEBECH (DK), on behalf of the ALDE Group will be asking the Commission the following questions on Arctic governance in a global world: It is now over 20 years since Gorbachev's speech in Murmansk when he challenged the Arctic States to form 'a genuine zone of peace and fruitful cooperation' in the far North. Over that period several key and critical issues – pollution, climate change leading to the opening of hitherto closed seaways, resource use, sustainability, security of energy supply, fish stocks – have merged, which have focused attention on the High North. At the end of May 2008 the five countries bordering the Arctic, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia and the USA, adopted a declaration (Ilulissat Declaration) which seeks the application of the international law of the sea to the Arctic but is against the conclusion of a specific legal agreement for the Arctic. This is of significant importance for the international community and all potential Arctic players. It is of particular interest to the EU, which counts three Arctic nations amongst its Member States and an additional two neighbouring states closely related through the EEA, in addition to which economic, environmental and research issues dictate that the EU cannot be indifferent to the Arctic region.
1. In order that the EU should take a more proactive role towards the Arctic region and specifically with regard to the security, economic and environmental dimensions in the High North, could the Commission identify the possible elements of a sustainable and comprehensive EU strategy in order to face these challenges?
2. As the Arctic is currently not yet governed by any multilateral norms and regulations, as it was never expected to become a navigable waterway or an area of commercial exploitation, is the Commission of the opinion that the current governance structures in the High North are sufficient to deal with the nascent and existing issues? With regard to the last International Polar Year in the 1950s which led to the signing of the Antarctic Treaty, is the Commission of the opinion that, e.g., a binding Arctic Charter could be a solution?
3. As the EU has already an interest in the Arctic, through the Arctic Window of the Northern Dimension policy and through the various policy areas, e.g. energy security, climate change, maritime issues or fishing, how is the Commission aiming at improving the coordination of its policies in these areas and when it comes to mapping out a 'real' holistic Arctic or High North policy?
