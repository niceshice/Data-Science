The implementation of Morocco's "advanced status" with the EU, progress on democratisation and regionalisation of the Moroccan state, and the management of migration between the EU and Morocco were the key topics discussed in the debate that followed the official launch of the EU-Morocco Joint Parliamentary Committee on 5 and 6 May 2010.
This new body, whose purpose is to strengthen ties between the European Parliament and its Moroccan counterpart (the Moroccan Chamber of Representatives and Chamber of Councillors), follows the decision of October 2008 to grant Morocco "advanced status", providing the country with a special relationship with the EU.
The decision to establish the JPC, adopted on 21 January 2010 by the Conference of Presidents of the EP's political groups, was welcomed in the joint statement of the EU-Morocco summit held on 7 March 2010 in Granada, Spain.
The EP delegation is chaired by Pier Antonio Panzeri (S&D, IT). The other MEPs on the JPC are Salvatore Iacolino (EPP, IT), Cristian Dan Preda (EPP, RO), Ernst Strasser (EPP, AT), Dominique Vlasto (EPP, FR), Vincent Peillon (S&D, FR), Carmen Romero Lopez (S&D, ES), Robert Rochefort (ALDE, FR), Malika Benarab-Attou (Greens/EFA, FR).
