Androula Vassiliou, new Commissioner for Health approved by MEPs
The House voted in favour of approving the new Cypriot Commissioner Androula Vassiliou for Public Health, Food Safety, Animal Health and Welfare, with 446 votes in favour 7 against and 29 abstentions. A new Commissioner is needed following the resignation of fellow Cypriot Markos Kyprianou, who left to take up the post of foreign minister in the new Cypriot government.
Ms Vassiliou was nominated by the Cypriot government and the Council of the European Union has already given its support to her nomination.
Now appointed, Ms Vassiliou will be in office at least until the appointment of a new Commission after the June 2009 European Parliament elections. The new Commissioner will take part in the debate later on combating cancer in the enlarged European Union.
During an earlier hearing in front of MEPs on 1 April, Ms Vassiliou said: "Health is wealth and I am determined to work hard towards ensuring high standards for our citizens, be they in Romania, Sweden, the UK or Cyprus."
