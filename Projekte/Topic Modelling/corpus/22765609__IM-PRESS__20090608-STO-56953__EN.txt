Facebook and YouTube are just two places online where you can find information about the elections. Almost two million of you came to the Parliament's website over the election period to find out what was going on in the European elections. It reflected the interest in the 7th Europe-wide poll held in 30 years. Here we draw together a few online stats about the different ways people use the internet to follow the poll.
8: different ways to see the election online: YouTube, Flickr, Facebook, MySpace, twitter, EP website, special election website and europarltv.
1,955,627: Visitors to the Parliament's website and special elections site between 1-8 June.
120 million: page requests: the number of "page loads" requested for the special results site.
