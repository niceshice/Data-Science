"Young volunteers stand up!" Guoda Lomanaite, 24 from Lithuania: In the Soviet Union 'volunteering' was usually forced, so had a negative connotation. However, through friends who tried and enjoyed it, I got into it and it turned out to be a very rich experience. Pau Simo Sola, 30, from Spain: It really makes you feel quite good. Surrounded by very nice people, you really feel that the world can be a good place, not like this ugly day here. First time volunteer Virag Gulyas, 26 from Hungary: There are huge differences between Western and the Eastern countries when it comes to volunteering. In the West, people socialise via volunteering, it's not like that in the East yet. ! have worked here for 8 hours and I already see the point of volunteering. Bernardo Gomes, 25 from Portugal: You always gain something, you help someone and you help yourself too. Volunteering enriches my experience, my personal life, my own manner, how we treat each otherâ€¦ Anouk Wahl, 23 from Switzerland: As a volunteer, you are small, but seeing all these volunteers together makes you very aware of the fact that you're part of a diverse world that shares the same values. That is a very gratifying feeling. George Gamkrelidze, 30 from Georgia has been volunteering since he was 17: First I got from it the pleasure of trying different things, now I think more of what kind of benefit does my country get from it. Volunteering is part of a healthy lifestyle! Qian, 23 from China first volunteered during the 2008 Olympic Games: You can always open yourself to something new. That's the philosophy of my NGO in Germany, which connects people from Europe and Asia allowing them to share their different cultures. Nelson Godinho Tiny Santa Rosa, 27 from Portugal has been volunteering since 2003, spreading the message about HIV: We did this first through conversations and later founded a youth magazine that grew into an association and a radio programme. Volunteering is solidarity and, for me, a part of daily life. Aleksandra Jach, 22 from Poland began volunteering this year: If you want to change something that's wrong in society, this is the way to do it. Hard work and good fun. Beauty Orjiakor, 33 from Ireland: One of the reasons I started to volunteer was to give Africa a voice. My message to the world? Volunteering doesn't have to be big; it's in the little things. You just have to go out there and do it because volunteering really does help. They are young, dynamic and eager to help those in need. We are talking about Europe's young volunteers, gathered in front of the European Parliament 7-11 September to share experiences, discuss good practices and convince others to join them. Determined not to let the drizzle damp our curiosity, we talked to some of them.
Around 1,500 young volunteers came to the EP to expound the benefits of volunteering. We asked some of them to describe their most important experience as a volunteer. Click on the photos to see what they think. You will find more photos and interviews on our Flickr page via the link below.
