Streaming photo Citizens concerned about ACTA are this week being offered a front row seat on how the EP will scrutinise this controversial anti-counterfeiting trade agreement. Today the international trade committee, which will be responsible for producing a recommendation to Parliament, will hold its first meeting on ACTA at 1700 CET, while tomorrow its pros and cons will be debated from 1500 CET by academics, civil society bodies and EU officials. Both events will be broadcast live on the website.
ACTA continues to divide opinion. On Tuesday the EP's petitions committee received more than 2.4 million signatures from people considering the agreement a threat to open and free internet. Parliament plays a crucial role as the agreement will not be able to enter into force in the EU unless it approves it and all member states ratify it. As the EP is committed to having an open and free debate, many of the meetings will be streamed live on its website.
