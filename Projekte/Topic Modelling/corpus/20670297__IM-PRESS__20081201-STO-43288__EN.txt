Thursday 4 December The Dalai Lama addresses the Parliament In the concluding half of the Brussels plenary, MEPs gathered to listen to the thoughts of His Holiness the Dalai Lama. Addressing the House as part of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, His Holiness spoke of the plight of Tibet and the need for continued non-violent opposition.
Earlier in the day the Parliament continued its debate of the European climate change and energy package.
Climate Change and Energy Package
MEPs adopted a new sense of urgency over the proposed European climate and energy package, with most members pushing for a deal by mid-December. Initial reports from the Temporary Climate Change Committee have suggested as much as an 80% cut in greenhouse gases by 2050.
Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas echoed these sentiments by saying: "the climate change and energy package is one of the most significant pieces of work the EU has carried out over recent years."
MEPs stress 'date with history'
MEPs shared the belief that change and decisive action were needed. Graham Watson of the Liberal group ALDE was pleased that "we might be days away from a historic agreement." Socialist MEP Martin Schulz speaking for the PES group described climate change as "one of the central challenges of our time", and Joseph Daul of the centre right EPP-ED group stated: "The energy and climate change package is a huge challenge even before the financial crisis but we cannot afford to fail."
While the MEPs voice their support to the climate agreement in Brussels, over 11,000 delegates are gathered in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland for the UN Climate Conference, the outcome of which will be concluded in Copenhagen at the end of the next year.
His Holiness the Dalai Lama
Addressing the House as part of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, the Dalai Lama gave a jovial speech underpinned by moments of heartfelt sobriety.
Speaking of Tibet, His Holiness questioned Chinese leadership claiming his tolerance towards the regime was becoming "thinner and thinner". However he stressed: "My faith in the Chinese people remains unshaken and I want to thank my brave Chinese brothers and sisters for their solidarity."
His Holiness continued: "My maxim has always been to hope for the best and to prepare for the worst. We Tibetans also need to face the reality that our exile may last for a longer time. I would therefore be grateful to the European Union for assistance in our educational and cultural endeavours. I also thank the European Parliament for the consistent display of concern and support for the just and non-violent Tibetan struggle."
