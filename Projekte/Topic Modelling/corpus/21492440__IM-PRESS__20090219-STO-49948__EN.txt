On the top page of the website find out what the EU has done for gender equality over the past 30 years and take part in our debate on whether video games are good or bad.
Mr Pöttering will lead a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly delegation to Egypt, Gaza, Israel and Jordan to assess the situation following the recent fighting. He will also be at the French National Assembly on Friday.
Delegations from parliamentary committees will be in Bulgaria to assess consumer protection, in Poland to look at the use of structural funds and in Georgia to get an on-the-spot view of the EU monitoring mission there.
Among the highlights on the top page of the website this week are a report on the Gaza delegation, an article about how the EP has improved gender equality in the past 30 years, details of a hearing on youth participation in democracy and a debate on the safety of video games.
