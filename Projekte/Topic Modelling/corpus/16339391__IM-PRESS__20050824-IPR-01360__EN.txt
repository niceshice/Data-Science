Simplification of the fruit and vegetable sector

In adopting a non-binding resolution on the reform of the fruit and vegetable sector, Parliament expresses its firm opposition to the Commission’s decision to postpone presentation of a proposal to reform the fruit and vegetable sector.
Parliament considers the postponement of this proposal for one or two years unacceptable and excessive as there is an urgent need to find a solution to the market crises, which cannot be resolved with the available management instruments. Parliament argues that the Commission should not ignore a sector that occupies a very important place (17 %) in the European Union’s final agricultural output and which risks being marginalised in the negotiations on the new financial perspective. MEPs say that new market management mechanisms should be found to deal with the liberalisation of trade during the WTO negotiations.
