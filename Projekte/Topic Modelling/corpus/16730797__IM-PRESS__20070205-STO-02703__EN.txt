The "Estação do Oriente" station in Lisbon
Lisbon: capital of Portugal, UNESCO world heritage site and home to 2.8 million people. The city has also given its name to the EU's decade long strategy to boost economic growth and jobs. The "Lisbon strategy" will be discussed by MEPs and MPs in Parliament over the next two days. In the first of a series of articles we look at European cities that have been associated with EU policies.
Portugal joined the EU in 1986 at the same time as its neighbour Spain. It currently has 24 MEPs in the European Parliament representing 10.6 million people. The country is the westernmost European country and is similar in size to Ireland.
Lisbon strategy aimed at job creation
The ambitious Lisbon strategy launched by EU leaders in March 2000 aims to make Europe "the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010". It focuses on training, better jobs, modernising social protection and promotion social inclusion.
Even the most fervent supporters of the Lisbon strategy had to accept that by 2005 slow economic growth was making the achievement of its goals unlikely. In 2005 the strategy was re-launched focusing more on jobs and growth. One of the most vocal supporters of the policy has been Lisbon-born President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso, who was previously Portugal's Prime Minister.
Lisbon home to EU Agencies
Lisbon is also home to two EU Agencies - the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction and the relatively new European Maritime Safety Agency.
Lisbon is a natural place for the latter as the history of the city has been closely tied to seafaring. In the 15th century sailors such as Vasco da Gama navigated the sea passage to India. By the following century Portuguese sailors had helped put together an Empire that included large parts of Africa and Asia. Worldwide, there are some 200 million Portuguese speakers.
Lisbon is famed for its mild climate and the special light, it is known as the city of seven hills or "cidade das sete colinas" in Portuguese.
