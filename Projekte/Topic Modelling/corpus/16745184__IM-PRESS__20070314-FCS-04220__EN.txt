Monday in Plenary: Terror victims remembered
Candles in Milan in honour of victims of terrorism Teenagers from across Europe joined MEPs yesterday to remember the victims of terrorism with a debate on its causes and ways to prevent it and a minute's silence. Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering called terrorism a "major danger to stability and democracy" and an attack on the values of the EU. Monday also saw debates on a proposal to open the music copyright industry to competition and equality between men and women.
Online music: local, European or global? Music has always had an international appeal although the growth in the online music market has taken this to new extremes. At present those who want to trade music online have to negotiate on a national basis. The European Commission wants to create pan-European licences that would give greater freedom to artists and performers to choose who represents them. However MEPs in the debate voiced concern about the damage this could do to local and national music markets and artists and publishers. They would prefer controlled competition to encourage modernisation. This could also encourage diversity and creativity. The Parliament's rapporteur on the issue, Hungarian Socialist Katalin Levai said in the debate that Parliament "wants to make sure that copyrights and related rights are managed properly to the benefit of all stakeholders". Speakers from all the political groups were critical of the Commission's approach which they felt was an attempt to bypass the legislative procedure. The European Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs, Vladimir Špidla, said that the Commission would take into account the opinions of artists and publishers and keep the Parliament informed Equality between men and women There was also a debate on equality between men and women. The report calls for the European Commission to give stronger practical effect to its Roadmap for Equality between Women and Men (2006-2010). MEPs want the principle of equal pay for equal work to be properly applied, paternity leave encouraged, action taken against violence, better integration of immigrant women and promotion of respect for women's rights in the EU's external relations. The House debated UK Socialist MEP Richard Howitt's own initiative report on Corporate Social Responsibility. MEPs suggest the EU adopt a European standard for product labelling where observance of human rights and fundamental workers' rights are part of the labelling scheme. Minutes silence to honour victims of terrorism The opening of the Plenary session was just one day after the European Day for Victims of Terrorism on March 11 - marking the day in 2004 when 192 people died in train bombings in Madrid. Mr Pöttering said the international community must work together to defeat terrorism and use "all the instruments the rule of law allows... this is why we always remind our American friends that ‘Guantanamo’ is not reconcilable with our European principles of the rule of law". Patricia Cerrada, a student from a school in Madrid, said: "Getting to know other cultures means making the effort to understand them...the best way to fight terrorism in our multicultural society is absolutely to promote communication.....". British student Amir Deng, said, "We have to ask ourselves how far do we address the roots of terrorism and what have we done to them so they feel the need to use violence? We are the potential victims of tomorrow. Creating an intercultural dialogue and promoting education is vital to counteract terrorism." Mr Špidla and the chairmen of Parliament's Civil Liberties Committee Jean-Marie Cavada and the Culture Committee, Nikolaos Sifunakis, took part in the debate.

Tuesday in Plenary: non-proliferation, air safety, veal, online music
MEPs want online copyright rules to protect local and national music Day two of the Strasbourg session saw MEPs debate nuclear non-proliferation, more powers for the European Air Safety Agency and a report on the definition of veal. MEPs also voted to adopt a series of reports on gender equality, online music copyright and corporate social responsibilty. Today sees debates on the forthcoming Berlin Declaration on the state of the European Union and the outcome of last week's European Council.
WMD proliferation "potentially greatest threat to European security" MEPs called on all states whose behaviour violates the non-proliferation regime to cease their activities and comply with the terms of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. (NPT). The Treaty came into force in 1970 and currently has 190 signatories. The first days of May will see an NPT meeting in Vienna and MEPs would like to send a delegation. A resolution to be voted on Wednesday calls on EU members and the Commission to identify how they intend to strengthen the NPT. In 2003 the European Security Strategy identified the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction as a major threat to world peace. Speaking to the house the European Commissioner for External Relations, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, said that "the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and among them nuclear weapons is potentially the greatest threat to European security". She told MEPs that negotiations with Iran over its nuclear programme had reached a "delicate phase". More powers for Europe's aviation safety watchdog MEPs debated increasing the powers of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Formed in 2002, the Agency is currently responsible for certifying the safety of airplanes, motors and propellers. They also ensure that EU states enforce Community standards for aviation safety. The European Commission has proposed extending this to include the licensing of pilots and checking aircraft from third countries. Parliament's rapporteur, Austrian Socialist Jörg Leichtfried, has backed the proposal. "A further extension of the scope of the EASA's competences to areas such as air port security, flight security and Air Traffic Management could be envisaged" he said. Keep veal real, says report The definition of veal may appear fairly straightforward, but apparently not. According to a report by French Socialist Bernadette Bourzai the definition of veal varies considerably across the EU. In particular the age an animal is slaughtered and what it was fed during its lifetime varies from country to country. Ms Bourzai's report is based on proposals from the European Commission (which administers the EU's agriculture policy) to simplify and clarify rules and give precise descriptions to consumers about what they are buying. Online music Parliament adopted a report that calls for local artists to be protected in any European legislation that affects online music. It concerns the cross-border management of copyright for online music. The European Commission had pursued a non-binding recommendation on this issue although Parliament has called for a directive under the codecision legislative procedure to be put in place. In the debate MEPs voiced concern about the damage the original proposal could do to local and national music markets and artists and publishers. They would prefer controlled competition to encourage modernisation. This could also encourage diversity and creativity. The Parliament's rapporteur on the issue, Hungarian Socialist Katalin Levai said Parliament "wants to make sure that copyrights and related rights are managed properly…". Wednesday As well as the debates on the Berlin Declaration and the European Council, job cuts at Airbus and the future of Bosnian-Herzegovina will be debated.

Wednesday in Plenary: MEP reprimanded, Berlin Declaration, Airbus
President Pöttering: “Europe needs a fresh start" Midweek in Plenary saw MEPs debate the outcome of last week's EU summit and the forthcoming "Berlin Declaration" on the future course of the Union. During the day, President Pöttering, delivered a reprimand to Polish MEP Maciej Giertych who had published a pamphlet with the Parliament's logo, which contained anti-Semitic and xenophobic sentiments. The House also debated the future of Europe's aviation industry
Controversial MEP Maciej Giertych reprimanded Chairing the opening of the Wednesday's session, Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering rebuked the Maciej Giertych for the content of his pamphlet "Civilizations at War in Europe". He said that the publication was "a serious breach of fundamental rights and, in particular, the dignity of human beings to which our institution so strongly adheres". Mr Pöttering dissociated the Parliament from the work saying that it had made no financial contribution to its publication. A Berlin Declaration for the future In a few days time EU leaders will agree a Declaration to be signed in Berlin on the EU. Timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome it is likely to reflect on the achievements of the Union and what role it should play in the future. Mr Pöttering will represent the Parliament in the negotiations. He said that Parliament's position would rest on four parts:
Achievements since 1957 - peace, prosperity, spread of democracy.
Transparency and subsidiarity as "cornerstones of the Community method".
Fundamental values of the EU.
Future challenges facing the EU: "energy policy and climate change, European common foreign and security policy, internal security and civil rights, and a socially responsible approach to society entailing strong economic success". The President reiterated the position of the Parliament in support of the Constitutional Treaty and said the Declaration should not just be between governments but must include the Parliament as well. “Europe needs a fresh start. Together we need to muster the courage and the will to meet the challenges of the 21st century" he concluded. EU Summit A mood of optimism tinged by realism coloured the debate into the European Council on 8-9 March, in which EU leaders agreed to cut CO2 emissions 20% by 2020. For the European People's Party Marianne Thyssen counselled caution saying "we cannot rest on our laurels", whilst Martin Schulz of the Socialist group congratulated EU leaders on what they had achieved. However he stressed that "we want to go further". Monica Frassoni for the Greens said that "unilateral reduction will not help us to maintain the level of increase of under 2 degrees Centigrade." Françoise Grossetête of the European People's Party said that "acts must follow words otherwise it would be sheer hypocrisy on the EU's part." Airbus and the aeronautical construction industry Representatives of the Council and the Commission were in Parliament yesterday to talk about the Aeronautical construction industry - although MEPs preferred to bring the subject back to the issue of the Airbus company. Airbus is a joint undertaking by several European countries and has factories and design offices all over the EU. Recently it has had to make many of its employees redundant - prompting a summit between France's President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Angela Merkel over the crisis. Some MEPs criticised bad management with heavy social consequences and called for an alternative to the restructuring programme, possibly with public financial support. Others also called on Airbus to produce quality aircraft rather than deliver promises to different governments around Europe.

Thursday in Plenary: seals, health care, islands, Euromed and human rights
MEPs are calling for a moratorium on seal products The last day in plenary saw MEPs pass a resolution calling for greater legal clarity in cross border health care. Patient mobility and how to manage health insurances schemes across national boundaries are just two aspects MEPs want the Commission to look into. Also on Thursday: a debate on how to help Europe's islands in the face of economic problems and immigration, a debate on banning seal products and a vote on a report on Euromed. Human rights and development issues were also on the agenda.
MEPs call for a moratorium on seal products All the MEPs who took part in the debate on Thursday called for a moratorium on the import, export and sale of all seal products. In the debate, UK Conservative John Bowis told the House that "in 2006, 350 000 seals have been killed and 95% were less than 3 months old.” MEPs reminded that seal hunt is inhuman and cruel, as seals are often skinned alive. Portuguese Socialist Paulo Casaca said, “It is an ethical question: is there any reason to kill so many animals for trivial needs like aesthetics or for fashion?” Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas said the Commission will soon make a legislative proposal on the seal trade after the release of an independent study by the European Food Safety Agency. He urged MEPs to lobby their member states to ban trade of seal products, as it would be then easier for the EC to take action on a European scale. Of all EU countries only Belgium has a total ban on the trade. There are provisional bans in Italy and Luxembourg and some countries like the UK and the Netherlands are considering a ban. Last September Parliament adopted a written declaration calling for the banning of seal products. Resolution on health care across borders Parliament welcomed a consultation initiative by the Commission on a potential European framework facilitating the provision of health care across borders. Such a European framework would:
Make sure that patients know for certain which treatment they can get in another European country and be reimbursed by their national health insurance.
raise standards in health care across the EU by bringing them closer to the best available service
Make access to treatment quicker and less costly. In some EU countries there are long waiting list of treatments such as surgery, while in other countries such treatment may be available more quickly, often cheaper and sometimes of a better quality. In the resolution Parliament states that:
It is “necessary to create a legal framework for cross-border healthcare provision which best guarantees patients' timely access to appropriate and high-quality healthcare, the development of cross-border healthcare provision and the sustainability of healthcare financing.”
Such a framework would be the “best way to enhance the optimal use of healthcare resources and speed up access to treatment”. The European Court of Justice has ruled in the past that patients in principle have the right to get treatment in another EU country and be reimbursed but in practice this often proves to be difficult and in most cases requires prior agreement of the health insurance. Action needed to protect Europe's islands How to harness the economic potential of Europe's islands was the subject of a report backed by MEPs yesterday. According to the report Europe's islands - home to 15 million people - are under threat from poor infrastructure, high fuel costs and illegal migration. As the standard of living is 63% of the EU average MEPs called for state aid to Europe's regions to take into account the specific nature of Islands. Francesco Musotto, the Italian European People's Party MEP who drafted the report told MEPs of the potential energy sources that islands posses. As the search for renewables gathers then the wind, sea and sun that islands have great "potential value" as sources of energy, he told the House. The need to encourage sustainable tourism was also raised. The report also calls for the EU to have its own coastguard to protect islands from the "human tragedy" of migration. Last year thousands of mainly African immigrants landed in the Canary Islands. The year 2010 is going to be the "European Year of Islands". Bosnia-Herzegovina: Reform of Constitution needed A day after the debate MEPs voted to support a report that calls for Constitutional change in Bosnia-Herzegovina that would allow it to become a unified state. It also calls for a return of refugees and for all suspected war criminals to be handed over. Reforms to the education and police system are also vital. It condemns nationalist rhetoric among politicians from all sides. (See separate article) Euromed Kader Arik, the French Socialist rapporteur for EuroMed gave the House a stark summary of progress so far: "one has to admit that the results do not match the heights of the hope given." Launched at a Summit in Barcelona in 1995 the original aim was the make the are a free trade zone of peace, stability and prosperity. The report mentions the problem the regions face: a complex history, last year's war in Lebanon and the lack of progress towards a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East. Overcoming these difficulties requires "strong political willpower and a dose of realism". It also calls for an analysis and review of the 2010 deadline for a free trade and for Parliament to concentrate on social and environmental questions. This weekend Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering will address a Euromed Parliamentary meeting in Tunis. The European Commissioner for Trade, Peter Mandelson stressed the links that bind EU members: "we are interdependent economically, as exports from the EU 27 have grown by 20% and imports by 4%." Interdependent environmentally - water, coast line, pollution of the sea, flows of oil and gas resources that transit, demographically. Other issues MEPs also adopted a comprehensive report by French socialist Pierre Schapira on the “under-estimated and under-exploited” role of local governments for development. They passed resolutions on breaches of human rights in Cambodia, Nigeria and condemned the violent attacks on Galina Kozlova, chief editor of a literary magazine and a representative of the Mari people (in the Russian Federation). The next Plenary will take place 28-29 March in Brussels. Health Care Bosnia-Herzegovina
