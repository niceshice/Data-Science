Proposed EU-wide working times rules were debated Monday "The revision of this directive is worrying millions" according to Spanish Socialist Alejandro Cercas in the debate over the working time directive on Monday in Strasbourg. MEPs were divided on whether opt-outs for the 48 maximum working week should be allowed. They will vote on the issue Wednesday. MEPs also discussed new toy safety rules.
MEPs were split over the merits of protecting workers rights in the face of possible exploitation and allowing sufficiently flexibility for employers and those who wish to work long hours.
Divisions over 48-hour opt-out
Parliament's Employment Committee says the opt-out should end within 3 years. In 1993, the UK won a general opt-out clause allowing it not to apply the maximum 48-hour working week if a worker agrees to work. In other countries the opt-out applies only in some sectors.
Mr Cercas drafted Parliament's report on working time and he wants an end to the opt-out.
During the debate Portuguese Jos√© Albino Silva Peneda for the centre right EPP-ED group asked the key question: "Do we want Europe's workers to work around 8 hours per day including Saturday?"
Another issue was how to account for the time spent on getting to the workplace. Swedish Socialist Jan Andersson said: "It is not time off. We say it is working time, you've left your house and you're going to work."
Some MEPs argued that workers should be free to choose how much they want to work. British Liberal Liz Lynne said: "It is important that workers can earn overtime if they want to. On call time should be classed as working time."
Safer toys, safer kids
Chemicals and heavy metals will be kept out of toys in future. This comes after MEPs and European Ministers agreed new rules for foreign made toys.
In Monday's debate, Belgian Christian Democrat Marianne Thyssen (EPP-ED) explained the need for an update: "What is new is the measure on allergens, there will be a ban on 55 allergenic fragrances and others will only be allowed to use with the proper label."
Export rules for arms
Also on Monday MEPs debated a report on the simplification of trade with defence-related products, new regulation for the approval of cars with high emissions and EU funding for regional and social projects.
