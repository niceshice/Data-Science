Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt
A series of restrictions on goods, from bikes to bread, which prevent trade across the EU will be swept away after MEPs reached agreement Tuesday. The House also debated the EU's Lisbon strategy on jobs and growth and heard a speech from Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt. He called for more cooperation on climate change, immigration and asylum. He also said the Union should not to abandon its enlargement strategy.
Free movement of goods
On Tuesday morning MEPs debated three legislative reports on the marketing of products across Europe. The "goods package" is expected to speed up the free movement of goods within the EU.
Three reports, by German MEP André Brie (GUE/NGL), Danish Socialist Christel Schaldemose and Finnish EPP-ED Member Alexander Stubb were examined, covering various aspects of the marketing of goods, including health and safety, technical and environmental standards and bureaucratic obstacles to trade.
"What I want to say to all small and medium-sized businesses in Europe is that there is no need ever again to fill in a form to apply to enter the market of another country," said Mr Stubb. He told a press conference: "with my report, there should absolutely be no trade barriers, no bureaucracy unless for health and safety purposes".
Swedish PM: "Don't build a wall against Turkey"
After Tuesday's votes the afternoon was devoted to a debate on the future of Europe. The Swedish Prime Minister was the latest European figure to address the House as part of this series. Mr Reinfeldt told the House that he looked forward to the Swedish presidency of the EU (July-December 2009), when he hopes for "very close cooperation between Member States on issues like climate change, energy, immigration, the Balkans, the EU as a global player and a common asylum policy by 2010".
Regarding the possible future enlargement of the EU Mr Reinfeldt said, "without enlargement the EU wouldn't be where it is today…the EU should not build a wall against Turkey or any other European country. We should not be afraid of a strong Europe, but of a weak Europe. We need a strong Europe that defends our values, freedom and democracy".

MEPs debate Lisbon strategy, Europe's economy
MEPs discussed progress with the "Lisbon" jobs and growth strategy with the Council and Commission. The debate also focused on the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines (the EU’s main tool for coordinating economic policy), which are due to be renewed this spring.
Slovenian minister for economic growth Ziga Turk told MEPs, "we need more researchers, to develop more high-tech research, we need to be entrepreneurial".
Speaking for the centre-right ( EPP-ED) group Belgian MEP Marianne Thyssen called for "more investment in R&D and intellectual property rights, better legislation on the internal market and less red tape." She focused on the "need to create jobs rather than relocation."
Speaking for the Socialist group, Luxembourg's Robert Goebbels said tackling "poverty and exclusion are likely to move to centre stage. Many workers have insecure contracts. Problems will become more acute. Texts must reflect the new climate."
Bulgarian Liberal Member Bilyana Raeva said that "knowledge based economy means learning from one another. High social standards and a dynamic economy are not mutually exclusive." She added, "support is needed for a more flexible labour market."
Also on Tuesday
Parliament adopted an own-initiative report on transparency in financial matters. In the evening it debated an EU strategy for Central Asia with Europe's External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner.
A report on the fight against terrorism debated on Monday evening and voted on Tuesday proved controversial. After a number of amendments were voted down, the report was rejected (241 votes in favour 332 against and 87 abstentions). Read our detailed report at the link below.
