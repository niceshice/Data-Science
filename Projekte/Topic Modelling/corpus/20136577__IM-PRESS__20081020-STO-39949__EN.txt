Strasbourg, 20 October: rights of temporary workers were debated Back in Strasbourg Monday, MEPs debated measures to clarify the status and rights of temporary workers in the EU. It covers paid leave and rights for pregnant women. MEPs also discussed steps that will clarify which court has jurisdiction when people of different nationalities divorce.
MEPs back temporary workers
The number of temporary workers is on the increase, but national legislation differs across the EU. The novelty of the directive is that it in principle includes guarantees from "day 1" for temporary workers, covering areas like resting times, paid leave and non-discrimination towards pregnant women.
French Socialist Harlem Désir's report on on proposals to regulate the status and conditions of temporary workers in the EU met with positive reactions across the political spectrum, as well as from Commission and Council.
Mr Desir said, "Adopting this directive without amendments will send a signal that Europe's social heart is still beating...we have to show that Europe cares for employers and workers, reconciling Europe with its citizens." The vote is scheduled for Wednesday.
Foreign divorce made fairer
A report by German Socialist Evelyne Gebhardt concerns Europe-wide guidelines to clarify which country's courts has jurisdiction when couples of different nationalities divorce.
This could help clarify who would get custody of children and property. In Europe there are over 170,000 such divorces a year. However, the call for a comprehensive framework applying to cases of cross-border divorce litigation met with mixed reactions from MEPs, according to political outlook and nationality. There are also divergences between EU governments.
Jacques Barrot, Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security, said before starting a reinforced cooperation, which could "fragment" the EU, it would be best to get as many member states as possible on board.
Making studying abroad easier
A report by French Liberal Marielle de Sarnez seeks more participation and simpler visa procedures for the new Erasmus Mundus programme, which promotes exchanges between students studying for a masters degree inside and outside the EU. "It is a good programme, and considering the difficult times we are going through this is giving a positive image of Europe in the rest of the world," Ms de Sarnez said.
The new Erasmus Mundus Programme has a budget of about €950 million and looks to create joint master's degrees and doctorates, involving universities from at least three European countries; partnerships between European and third country universities, including a scholarship scheme; and to promote European higher education. In the previous programme, 4424 scholarships were granted from 2004-2008 to students from third countries and 323 universities took part, 265 of them in Europe.
