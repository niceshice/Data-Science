EuroparlTV The EU's official motto is "united in diversity", but what exactly does that mean to you? Well now you have the chance to show everyone by taking part in EuroparlTV's video competition in which citizens are invited to create a visual expression of their perception of cultural diversity in Europe. Interested? You have until 31 July to apply.
The EP’s official web television channel is looking for short, creative and entertaining spots presenting the author’s personal vision of diversity within the EU. In one to three minutes you can create your vision using language, music, fashion, folklore or anything else that occurs to you. Participants can submit and upload their videos via the EuroparlTV web page.
The public will get to vote on the list of videos for one month from 15 September via EuroparlTV’s website. The results will be published each day and the three winners announced on 15 October. The winner of the first prize will get a trip for two to three European cities of their choice, the second placed video wins an I-Pad and the person in third place wins a Leica camera.
