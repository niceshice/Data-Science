Mikael Gustafsson Don't miss your chance to quiz the first-ever man to chair the Parliament's women's rights committee. As today is International Women's Day, we asked "full-blooded feminist" Mikael Gustafsson to answer questions from EP fans on our Facebook page .
The chat will take place on the occasion of International Women's Day today from 1500 CET when people will have the opportunity to ask whatever they like for 45 minutes. Over the coming months Mr Gustafsson wants to focus on EU legislation on violence against women and increasing women's economic independence and their influence in politics. He is also working on a report on the role of women in the green economy
