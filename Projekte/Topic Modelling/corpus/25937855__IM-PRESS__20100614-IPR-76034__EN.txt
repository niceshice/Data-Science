Globalisation fund: Parliament backs aid to Ireland and Spain
Budget
Plenary sittings
2010-06-15 - 13:15
Over 2000 former construction workers in Spain and nearly 600 ex-employees of Irish glass company Waterford Crystal and its suppliers will receive a total of €11 million in aid from the EU Globalisation Adjustment Fund to help with training, business start-ups and job guidance under plans agreed by MEPs and the Council of Ministers.
Parliament's reports on the plans were drafted by Barbara Matera (EPP, IT). To release the funds, both Parliament's and the Council of Ministers' approval were necessary. The Council gave its backing to these two cases last week, on Monday 7 June.
Ireland: Waterford Crystal
The Irish application relates to a total of 653 people who lost their jobs at the crystal glass manufacturer Waterford Crystal and three of its suppliers, Thomas Fennell Engineering Ltd, RPS Engineering Services and Abbey Electric in South-East Ireland, between January and May 2009. Of these, 598 will be eligible for help from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF).
The package, approved today by MEPs by 573 votes to 48 with 25 abstentions, will help the 598 most disadvantaged of these dismissed workers by offering them occupational guidance, help for business start-up and various training courses with the relevant allowances and grants. These measures are expected to cost € 3,955,159, of which Ireland has applied for €2,570,853 from the EU fund.
Employees at Waterford Crystal in other EU countries also lost their jobs during the crisis but they will not be covered by the measures since no other Member State has applied for EGF support.
Spain: ceramics industry
Between September 2008 and June 2009, 2425 people lost their jobs at 181 small and medium-sized firms in the ceramics industry in the Spanish region of Valencia. Of these, 1600 will be eligible for help from the EGF. The assistance, approved by the EP today by 575 votes to 51 with 25 abstentions, will include occupational guidance, training, workshops, apprenticeships and advice on setting up a business. The total cost is estimated at €10,151,900 of which EU aid will cover €6,598,735.
Spain: door manufacturers
A total of 585 people lost their jobs at 36 firms producing doors and door-frames in the Spanish region of Castilla-La Mancha between November 2008 and July 2009. Of these, 557 will be eligible for EU funded assistance. The aid, approved by MEPs today by 580 votes to 50 with 24 abstentions, will help cover the costs of intensive job-search assistance, occupational guidance, training, workshops, apprenticeships and business start-up advice. The total cost is expected to be €3 million, of which the EGF will cover €1.95 million.
Mid-term evaluation of the EGF
In addition to the three cases of direct support to unemployed workers, Parliament also approved, by 562 votes to 55 with 40 abstentions, the granting to the Commission of €1.11 million to cover the cost of activities relating to a mid-term evaluation of the EGF, including studies, creation of a knowledge base, meetings between experts and further development of the EGF website.
