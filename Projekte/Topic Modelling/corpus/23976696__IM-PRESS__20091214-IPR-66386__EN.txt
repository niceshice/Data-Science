On Monday, the second week of the Copenhagen Climate Conference, Jo LEINEN, head of the official European Parliament delegation, stressed that the delegation will push for ambitious goals for CO2 reduction by 2020 as well as for sufficient funding for a worldwide climate protection policy after 2013.
"Today sees the start of the final sprint for a worldwide Climate Agreement in Copenhagen", said Jo LEINEN. The European Union has already brought forward concrete figures for CO 2 -reduction and fast-start financial resources. It is now necessary that the world's two biggest greenhouse gas emitters - the USA and China - come out of their cover and propose negotiable offers for an agreement. "The ping-pong-game between the two superpowers has to stop", said LEINEN. Barack Obama has to offer more than a 4% reduction (with 1990 as reference year). China should take Brazil as an example and further limit its greenhouse gas emissions.
The European Parliament delegation will push for ambitious goals for CO 2 -reduction by l 2020 as well as for sufficient f unding for a worldwide climate protection policy after 2013. The European Union should bring a 30/30 offer to the negotiations: 30% less CO 2 and â‚¬ 30 billion in financial help from the EU by 2020 .
