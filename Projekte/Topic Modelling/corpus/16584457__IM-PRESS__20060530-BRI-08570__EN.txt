Future of Europe/European integration
Is Europe still at a crossroads?
2006-06-06 - 14:26
In continuing to contribute to the debate on the future of the EU, MEPs began a series of discussions with Heads of EU governments, the first meeting of which was on 31 May 2006 with Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, who recently laid out his ideas for the future of Europe in a book entitled "The United States of Europe."
Mr VERHOFSTADT argued that there was no choice to be made between widening and deepening the EU: "The Union must continue to grow. This is the only guarantee for lasting peace and stability in Europe... At the same time, the Union must be deepened further, and European integration must continue unabated."
Nor, he said, was there a choice between Europe as a free trade area and Europe as a political entity: "If Europe wants to continue to play a leading economic, political or military role in this new world order, then political union is the only alternative. In short, the question is not whether the Union will evolve into a more federal, political entity, but rather when this will happen, or better yet, whether this will happen in time." He was doubtful about whether this "leap" would happen "in time". The "period of reflection" following the rejections of the constitution in referendums in France and the Netherlands had been a period of "deafening silence," he said.
Meanwhile, "Europe's economic growth is limping along, our political influence in the world is waning and our military strength is below par."
Why had France and the Netherlands voted "no", he asked. It was partly the result of many political leaders having long painted a negative picture of Europe, blaming the EU for all failures and taking credit for successes themselves. But a more decisive reason was Europe's perceived failure to tackle issues of economic reform, unemployment and internal security. "The European Union as it functions today, lacks the necessary power to provide clear and decisive answers... Until Europe embarks on the road towards a real federation where the unanimity rule is scrapped, or at least limited to the strict minimum, it will continue to be powerless to react rapidly and decisively to new challenges."
He said the lack of progress on the Lisbon strategy illustrated the failure of the intergovernmental approach. A "much more compelling, more Community-oriented approach" was needed: "a joint socio-economic policy in which the Union sketches out the main lines of much-needed reforms that will allow us to cope with rising competition in new growth areas, while protecting the social model of which we in Europe are rightly proud." This was not, he said, a matter of unquestioning harmonisation, crudely ignoring the differences in traditions and customs of the Member States. Rather it was a matter of convergence, with maximum and minimum levels of modernisation and social protection.
While this was "highly desirable" for the EU as a whole, it was "vitally important" for the eurozone: "A common currency and a monetary Union are ultimately doomed to disappear if they are not supported by a common approach to social and economic challenges." He called for the euro zone to be bolstered with joint preparations for the spring summit, frequent recommendations from the EU institutions, common macroeconomic starting points for national budgets, convergence criteria on social, fiscal and economic matters, regular meetings of labour, social affairs and science ministers and autonomous representation in international bodies.
On external affairs, he said that only a European defence approach could help the EU move towards a real common foreign policy. The painful experience of European disunity over the Iraq war had shown him that "only when we develop common instruments, such as a European army and European diplomacy, will be forced to show our colours in international crises." This was not a threat to NATO, he said, envisaging the Atlantic alliance becoming a sort of international security network of allies and partners, with a strong autonomous European pillar: "We cannot always ask America to come to our rescue when we are faced with a civil war on our own continent, as was the case in Bosnia and Kosovo."
What then were the institutional options ahead? Mr Verhofstadt rejected the idea of picking and choosing among the Constitution's provisions or of rolling back the EU to a mere free trade area. It was necessary to take the 15 "yes" votes into account as well as the two "no" votes on the Constitution, he said, calling for ratification to continue, which the Member States had in fact agreed in the 30th declaration annexed to the Treaty, which envisaged a debate in the European Council if four-fifths of the EU, twenty countries, had ratified but one or more had been unable to do so. At the same time he said there should be progress within the existing treaties to strengthen socio-economic governance, at least for the eurozone. Such action would be open to all Member States once they adopted the euro, he said.
"I am suggesting we quickly develop a new strategy along two lines. The first involves moving forward with ratification and fully fleshing out and applying declaration 30; the second involves making a new and significant leap forward in European unification, without requiring any amendments to the treaties. This two-track strategy is the only way to benefit from the current period of uncertainty, which would drag on for years, and the only way not to waste time. After all, time is the last thing we can allow ourselves to waste."
Political group leaders
Hans-Gert POETTERING (EPP-ED, DE) said the Treaty of Nice could not be the basis for leading an EU of 500 million people towards a good future. This had been recognised by the EPP congress in 2001, which had called for a new, constitutional treaty. "Perhaps that was too ambitious a term for many people, we need to consider that reasonably," he said. What was now needed was for governments to start presenting Europe to their citizens in a realistic way, covering the good as well as the bad: the enlargement of 2004 and the successful introduction of the euro were two examples of the former.
He spoke of a poll in the Netherlands showing that most people wanted "more Europe" to tackle issues such as internal security, immigration and asylum. To get this, he said, "we need to find a way for the principles of the constitution to become a political and then a legal reality."
He welcomed Mr Verhofstadt's call for ratification of the Treaty to continue and called on Poland to follow the example of Estonia in this regard. He said he had a deep belief in subsidiarity, with the local level doing what it does best, but also the EU dealing with matters for which nation states had grown too small.
Speaking for the Socialist Group, Martin SCHULZ (PES, DE) said Mr Verhofstadt had made a courageous speech, especially in criticising the European Council. The crisis of Europe was a crisis for all the Heads of State or Government, he said, except for Juncker and Verhofstadt: they were the only ones continuing to act as they had promised to do. Mr Schulz supported the idea of continuing the ratification process: "Why should we not reach the figure of 20 out of 25 countries? This was agreed by the Heads of State and Government. We should not give up on the constitution; it is madness to say we should concentrate on other things instead." Why had people voted "no" when they wanted more Europe? The answer, he said, lay in the morose domestic political atmosphere in some countries. He praised Jean-Claude JUNCKER for putting his political future on the line in the referendum in Luxembourg, helping to secure the "yes" vote in that country.
"We have seen leaders with the courage of their convictions to commit military forces despite great opposition. If only they showed the same determination in defending Europe," he said.
For the ALDE group, Graham WATSON (ALDE, UK) called Mr Verhofstadt's speech a tour-de-force. He said there was little evidence of real change in the EU, with 82 per cent of citizens surveyed saying they felt the EU was not communicating well with them. But the same survey showed they trust the EU institutions often more than their own governments. "That is a mandate for the EU to deliver reforms to meet the challenges of energy security, climate change, migration and organised crime." Until Member State governments explained to their people what they do together in Brussels and until the EU has the funding and legal powers to make the difference, the result would be stalemate, based on the unanimity rule, he said.
The ratification of the Constitution in Estonia showed the Treaty was far from dead, he said. "We have the people of Europe behind us as they recognise that population growth, migration, climate change and crime cannot be dealt with on the basis of nation states founded on the 18th century model of tribal power."
Monica FRASSONI (Greens/EFA, IT) thanked the Belgian Prime Minister for his noble effort to shed some light on the crisis of the future of Europe. She agreed with many of his views, for example on the institutions and the Lisbon strategy, but the Greens believe that Europe has to show it works to be loved. Europe cannot be democratic and peaceful if it is supposed to look for guidance to the United States, China or India. Nor can it have a growth that is based on a waste of resources. The Greens say there is a need for a Constitution but not with more markets, more liberalisation and more weapons.
Francis WURTZ (GUE/NGL, FR) did not agree with many of the points raised. He said the main problem is that there is such a large gap between the Europeans and Europe. He stated that the main aim of Europeans is a comparable standard of living. He said that the social and political ideas needed to be changed in order for the European Dream to continue.
Nigel FARAGE (IND/DEM, UK) expressed his disbelief that the Belgian Prime Minster believed he had the right to tell other Heads of State what to do while he does not benefit from an approval rating in his own country. He added that the Prime Minister's speech incorporated the basis of national interest and democracy, by disregarding the failures of the constitution. He concluded, "What part of no don't you get?"
Brian CROWLEY (UEN, IE) believed that some points raised deserved some more analysis. He said that people, his constituents, want more Europe but that there is a limit to what extent Europe should be involved. Red line issues are better dealt with in their own countries. He added that Europe was self-created and is a successful model. Finally he said that the main problem with the constitution is that it is not a constitution, and should therefore not have been called a constitution.
Frank VANHECKE (NA, BE) said that the Belgian Prime Minister was a good illustration of everything that is wrong in Europe. He said that politicians are not willing to listen to their people and that the constitution had not been ratified in Belgium either. He raised the issue of Turkey and said that there is a lack of confidence in Europe as the political leaders are not willing to set frontiers for Europe. He questioned why the citizens will not be allowed a referendum on Turkey joining the European Union?
PM Verhofstadt responds to group leaders
In his response to the group leaders, Mr VERHOFSTADT stated that "Europe must stick to its destiny and follow the course of history. We may feel it is too quick or slow, but history has shown what happens when we are divided, just looking at our own interests: Europe in crisis, with a permanent civil war." He said it was pure selfishness to refuse the Balkans the stability, peace and prosperity the EU enjoyed. The issue of Turkey was just a pretext, he said, to say no to the Balkans as a whole. He insisted that he said consistently the same things in the European Council as in Parliament. The declaration (regarding ratification) should be respected. It was not a matter of ignoring the people of France and the Netherlands, which is why he had proposed a second track towards concrete political matters, above all socio-economic governance, without which monetary union was "absurd" in the long run. "Europe can offer good response to globalisation that is message we haven't got across to our peoples yet."
British and Irish speakers
Andrew DUFF (ALDE, UK) said that the European Council should address the crisis now and not wait until four-fifths of the EU Member States had ratified the Constitution. The next European Council should set the end of 2007 as the date for a new Inter-Governmental Conference whose aim should be to improve the Treaty. Parts 1 and 2 of the Constitution, he said, should be ring-fenced. As for part 3, there should be a strengthening of economic governance, a reform of the European social model, further measures to combat climate change, development of a common energy policy, a threshold set for accession, and finally a revision of the financial system to provide a fairer EU budget.
James ALLISTER (NI, UK) said that Prime Minister Verhofstadt's speech had only served to boost his euro-scepticism. Dropping the title "Constitution", he said, was a stunt. After the "no" votes in France and the Netherlands, the EU had served a "gagging order" on the sceptical countries. "It's easy to win the game if you lock up the opposition". Ever closer union was unachievable.
Timothy KIRKHOPE (EPP-ED, UK) said he could not accept the Prime Minister's generous offer of solidarity on the European Constitution. Europe needs debate. Mr Kirkhope expressed his surprise that the EU Foreign Ministers had not declared the Constitution "dead". "The EU needed to embark on a reforming agenda and put growth and the forefront of its priorities".
Richard CORBETT (PES, UK) said there were two types of pessimism the EU at the moment: First, there was the pessimism of the euro-enthusiasts who feared that the EU was in perpetual crisis and was reduced simply to a free-trade area. Second, there was the fears and pessimism of the anti-Europeans who feared that the EU had become a federal super-state. Neither perception was accurate, he said. The EU had a solid set of achievements with some shortcomings. The Constitution aimed to address these shortcomings and provided some useful but not radical solutions. The right path now was to try to save the Constitution with France on board.
PM Verhofstadt final response to the debate
In his closing remarks a the end of the debate, Mr Verhofstadt noted that the four-fifths criterion which ended up in 'declaration 30' had been envisaged by some as the number of countries needed to proceed without those who had not ratified, but in the end the unanimity rule had prevailed. In fact it was France and the Netherlands which had voted "no". He still wanted to organise a debate on the basis of the four-fifths rule, so ratification should continue. However, this debate could take years - and in the meantime "it would be a serious error not to do something right away... we should go forward with greater socio-economic governance within the eurozone... otherwise years will slip by and we will see public support eroded further."

EP vote should mean more medicine development for children
2006-06-06 - 14:26
After Parliament's vote on 1 June 2006, It will be easier for pharmaceutical firms to develop paediatric medicines aimed at ending the current situation under which most children take small doses of medication developed for adults, which may not correspond to their metabolism and can even be harmful. Drug companies which develop effective and safe tests for paediatric medicine will receive a six-month patent extension. Only those firms meeting strict standards will be allowed to market infant medicine.
"This regulation which is in favour of paediatric medication is a concrete response to various expectations. This text shows how much Europe influences day-to-day life. A single Member State alone does not have the means to promote such a policy in favour of all children", the rapporteur Françoise GROSSETÊTE (EPP-ED, FR).
The law will cover medications currently in development and not yet authorised, authorised medications covered by patents as well as authorised products that are not covered by intellectual property rights. Pharmaceutical firms will have to present a "paediatric investigation plan" (a research and development programme aiming at guaranteeing the necessary data for those who require paediatric treatment). Two obstacles are therefore avoided: the lack of information concerning the dosage - which increases the risk of side-effects and even death - and ineffective treatment due to a reduced dose.
Parliament was keen to enforce the "Paediatric Committee" members' independence, a scientific committee which works at the heart of the European Medicines Agency. Parliament specified that its members should not "have financial or other interests in the pharmaceutical industry which could affect their impartiality, should undertake to act in the public interest and in an independent manner, and should make an annual declaration of their financial interests" and that their opinions will be made public.
Between two and three years after entering into force the "Paediatric Committee" will draw up an inventory of therapeutic benefits in order to determine research priorities.
Where the development of medicines for children could hamper the development of medicines for adults, MEPs in the committee wish to allow "justified derogations" from the requirement, proposed by the Commission, for firms to present the results of paediatric studies at the same time as human pharmaco-kinetic studies in adults.
To avoid being dependent on decisions by national authorities concerning the setting of prices for medicines or their inclusion in national health insurance schemes, products for which paediatric data is supposed to be submitted but which have received marketing authorisation in all Member States will be granted a 6-month extension of the Supplementary Protection Certificate.
Parliament approved a transitional clause which states that, for five years after the regulation enters into force, "the application for an extension of the duration of a certificate already granted shall be lodged not later than six months before the expiry" of a Supplementary Protection Certificate.
A special logo will be affixed on medication boxes which benefit from a paediatric guideline. Based on a recommendation by the "Paediatric Committee" the European Commission has one year to choose a symbol.

Transatlantic Partnership Agreement to strengthen the EU-US relationship
2006-06-06 - 14:26
An own-initiative report by Elmar BROK (EPP-ED, DE), the Chairman of the EP's Foreign Affairs Committee, calls for a Transatlantic Partnership Agreement to strengthen the EU-US relationship. The report passed by a large majority in plenary, and mentions both common threats and challenges, as well as several current irritants to transatlantic relations.
The report calls for close cooperation on the Iran nuclear issue, Kosovo, energy security and the Middle East peace process. The EP urges that "China, Russia and Ukraine be prioritised for actions with respect to EU-US collaboration" and "encourages the partners to engage in further common action regarding obligations deriving from international treaties," such as the International Criminal Court, the Kyoto Protocol, human rights and non-proliferation treaties.
The report also does not shy away from criticisms of US policy. The European Parliament "urges the US to extend the Visa Waiver Program to cover all EU citizens." It also "strongly regrets […] the combination of mistrust due to suspected violation of human rights and international law involved in the so-called extraordinary renditions in Europe" and "reiterates its call for the immediate closure of the Guantánamo detention centre."
On the institutional front, the House proposes the adoption of a Transatlantic Partnership Agreement by 2007, "reiterates the need to strengthen the parliamentary dimension of the Transatlantic Partnership by transforming the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue (TLD) into a transatlantic assembly" and suggests that the EP should establish a permanent post in Washington DC to maintain permanent contact between the two bodies.
Mr Brok's report joins a related one by Erika MANN (PES, DE) from the Committee on International Trade, which calls for a barrier-free transatlantic market to be established by 2015, and the creation of a bilateral trade dispute settlement system.
A barrier-free transatlantic market by 2015
Transatlantic trade and investment ties have never been stronger: with 57% of world GDP between them, the EU and the USA are the engine-room of the world economy. On top of their economic links, they are united by shared values and standards. The EP is calling for a barrier-free transatlantic market by 2015 and regular dialogue between the EP and the US Congress.
Ten years after the signing of the New Transatlantic Agenda (1995), an own-initiative report by Erika MANN (PES, DE) calls for EU-US relations to move in the direction of a new transatlantic partnership. The economic dimension of this partnership would be based on three key pillars: cooperation on regulatory issues, a set of operational cooperation tools (an early warning system, a bilateral mechanism for settling trade disputes and a third-generation agreement on the application of competition law) and sectoral economic cooperation agreements building on the Joint EU-US Work Programme.
The partnership agreement should provide for the removal of non-tariff barriers in key markets by 2015, through gradual regulatory alignment and mutual recognition of rules and standards. For financial services and capital markets, the target date for a barrier-free market would be 2010.
Although WTO disputes concern less than 2% of all trade, the report urges the European Commission to set up a mechanism for settling trade disputes in advance with the aim of exhausting all diplomatic channels before resorting to the WTO dispute settlement body. The early warning system should enable potential trade disputes to be identified at an early stage.
The EP regrets that the US Administration remains so reluctant to enter into any meaningful international partnership on climate change, but notes that it has taken a modest step forward, inasmuch as it is now willing, as agreed at the December 2005 Montreal Conference of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to engage in a thorough forward-looking dialogue; welcomes the fact that an emerging coalition of interests in the US, including Members of Congress from both Houses and both parties, State legislators, local authorities, NGOs and representatives of the business community, is pushing for a more ambitious agenda to tackle greenhouse-gas emissions".
MEPs underlines the need for enhanced EU-US scientific cooperation on biofuels and recommends that the initiative for a joint EU-US biofuels work programme that focuses specifically on second generation bioethanol be implemented as soon as possible"
The European Parliament's role
MEPs want to strengthen the parliamentary dimension of EU-US summits by involving legislators from both sides. For this purpose, they call for "a meeting prior to every summit between the TLD [Transatlantic Legislative Dialogue] and the Senior-Level Group to exchange views on the progress of the Work Programme".

Humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territories and the EU's role
2006-06-06 - 14:26
In adopting a joint resolution on the humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territories and the role of the EU, MEPs express their serious concern over the deterioration of the humanitarian, economic and financial situation in the West Bank and Gaza.
Parliament calls on the Council and Commission to strengthen their initiatives by taking account of the following recommendations:
- to act within the Quartet with the aim of urgently guaranteeing the flow of aid essential to the Palestinians through humanitarian agencies and NGOs and implementing the temporary international mechanism, as proposed by the Quartet, to guarantee direct aid to the Palestinian people, which should be funnelled by the World Bank or other international bodies;
- to invite the governments of the US and the other donor countries to ensure a broad and flexible scope for this mechanism and facilitate it by the direct involvement of the Palestinian Authority's President, and to ensure financial control and accountability of expenditure;
- to develop such a mechanism in order to avoid a major humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territories; calls on all the institutions involved in establishing such a temporary international financial mechanism to be as transparent as possible in order to prevent any fraud or deviation of funds;
- to call on the Israeli government to immediately resume the direct transfer of the withheld Palestinian tax and customs revenues which have been blocked since January 2006; notes that part of these funds have been transferred for payment of electricity supplies, complying with the 1994 Paris Protocol;
- to reinvigorate the institution-building process in Palestine, which has seen an important moment in the recent elections,
- to continue with the EU presence in Rafah and the implementation of the Agreement on Movement and Access,
- to make a comprehensive assessment of the situation, together with the High Representative for the CFSP, so as to guarantee coherence in both aid measures and political and diplomatic initiatives, in order to conduct a dialogue with the Palestinian Authority through its President;
- to ensure that all future assistance will be reviewed in the light of the Palestinian government's respect for these principles;
- to take full advantage of the Action Plan with the Palestinian Authority, within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy; the Commission, for its part, will have to guarantee the full implementation of the EU–Israel Action Plan, as far as Israel's obligations towards the Palestinian Authority are concerned.
MEPs consider that any contact with the newly appointed Palestinian government should aim to achieve the recognition of the final peace agreement, based on a solution involving two viable states and the renunciation of violence by the government itself and the groups supporting it. The House believes the government's clarification regarding denouncing violence and recognition of Israel's right to exist and the Palestinians' international obligations to be crucial for any cooperation of the EU with the Palestinian government.
The House points out that there is no alternative to bilateral negotiations and that unilateral actions could undermine the efforts to reach a lasting and comprehensive settlement.
Parliament reiterates its condemnation of, and calls for an immediate halt to, the continuing extension of settlements, in particular in East Jerusalem, and the building of the wall beyond the 1967 borders, which is contrary to international law and is also an obstacle to the restoration of a climate of dialogue.
Finally, MEPs calls on all parties concerned to fully implement the 'Roadmap for Peace', and calls on the Quartet to encourage negotiations for a fair and lasting solution to the conflict in the Middle East, leading to a firm and final peace agreement as laid out in the "Roadmap for Peace."

European Year of Intercultural Dialogue should focus on religion
2006-06-06 - 14:26
The European Parliament has welcomed the European Commission's proposal that 2008 should be declared "European Year of International Cultural Dialogue". Erna HENNICOT-SCHOEPGES (EPP-ED, L) saw her report adopted by 548 votes in favour, 62 against and 22 abstentions. MEPs had tabled 48 amendments. A small majority of MEPs (299/298/17) is pressing for dialogue between religions to be the main topic of the year's events.
The year should be concluded with an Intercultural Forum in the European Parliament bringing together civil society and political and religious representatives.
MEPs are also keen to bring intercultural dialogue into the mainstream of Community policies. They back the idea of raising the profile of all EU measures related to intercultural dialogue and making them more consistent. The campaign should also highlight the contribution of different cultures to Europe's heritage and lifestyles as well as helping promote intercultural dialogues in schools.
Members also suggested the creation of a prize for intercultural dialogue to reward a youth project in the context of Community programmes such as Socrates, Youth and Culture. Finally, MEPs called for cooperation with the private sector, broadcasters and other media as partners for disseminating information of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, particularly in the context of major sporting events taking place in 2008, namely the European Football Championships and the Beijing Olympic Games, at the same time combating human trafficking and forced prostitution of women during these events.
International dialogue already occupies an important place in many Community policies (e.g. education, youth, anti-racism, asylum policy) as well as in the EU's external relations. Key aims are the promotion of cultural diversity and active citizenship. The Commission's proposal should be seen against this background. Adopted text

Improving EU legislation to prevent sex offences against children
2006-06-06 - 14:26
The European Parliament adopted a report endorsing a proposal to improve existing legislation protecting children from sex offenders in Europe. The aim is to ensure that any court prohibition on working with children, arising from sex offences against minors or from child pornography, will be enforceable not only by the Member State which issues it, but also by any other EU country to which the person concerned moves.
Combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography became a priority for the EU in 2003 when legislation was adopted establishing a minimum common approach to these criminal offences, covering the type of penalty and the prohibitions imposed. One of the provisions was to impose a temporary or permanent ban on child sex offenders taking a job involving supervision of children. As a result of an initiative from Belgium, the Council is now considering an EU decision to ensure that a prohibition on working with children imposed by the national judicial authorities of one Member State will be enforced by any Member State where the individual might reside. This rule should help to avoid cases such as that of a paedophile convicted in France who later committed a similar crime in Belgium.
An important aspect of the new EU law will be to oblige national authorities to include information on penalties for sex offences against children in criminal records which can be consulted by any other Member State on request. In its report, drawn up by Bogusław SONIK (EPP-ED, PL), the House generally supports the proposal, although it recommends amendments to improve the wording and to tighten up some definitions in the legislative text. One of the key changes approved by MEPs would oblige Member States to include also in their criminal records any related prohibition imposed by non-EU countries. Text adopted

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Roma women in the EU
2006-06-06 - 14:26
Roma women are among the most threatened groups and individuals in the European Union (deletion) - and accession and candidate countries, according to the European Parliament. (A) In an own-initiative report adopted today with 412 votes for 48 against and 21 abstentions, MEPs call for measures to combat the extreme levels of multiple discrimination faced by these women on the grounds of both ethnicity and gender.
The report, drafted by Lívia Járóka (EPP-ED, HU), urges EU public authorities to "promptly investigate extreme human rights abuses against Roma women, to swiftly punish perpetrators, and to provide adequate compensation to victims". The Parliament calls on Member States to, to prevent and outlaw coercive sterilisation, and provide redress for such abuse, and to promote family planning, alternative arrangements to early marriages, and sex education. It also calls for proactive measures to eliminate racially segregated maternity wards, to help victims of domestic violence and for particular vigilance regarding the trafficking of Roma women.
A number of other areas of concern are raised in the report. It urges Member States to ensure that all Roma women have access to health care, and not only, as often occurs, in the case of an extreme emergency or childbirth. Surveys show that the life expectancy of Roma women is, in some areas, shorter than that of others. Many Roma girls fail to complete primary education. Lívia Járóka says that since education "is one of the most important tools for escaping poverty, the dual discrimination faced by Roma women in the field of education means that they will have a particularly difficult time escaping poverty". The Parliament calls for measures at national level to ensure that women and girls have access on equal terms to quality education and for plans to end the separate, substandard education of Roma children. A further burning issue, calling for positive measures, is the very high unemployment rates among Roma women - in several places, many times higher than that of the rest of the adult female population. (K) MEPs also urge the Member States to improve Roma housing by recognising in national law a right to adequate housing.
The situation of Roma women in candidate countries should, according to the Parliament, be a key criterion for evaluation states of readiness for accession to the EU. MEPs welcomes the proposal to establish an EU Institute for Gender Equality and urges the institute to focus intensively on the situation of women suffering multiple discrimination including Roma women and encourage the gathering and publication of data set out by sex and ethnicity, on the situation of the Roma people, so progress can be measured.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Women in armed conflicts
2006-06-06 - 14:26
Measures to improve the situation of women in armed conflicts, and recommendations to allow women to take action in peace processes are put forward in an own-initiative report adopted by Parliament on 1 June 2006 315 votes in favour, to 23 against and 67 abstentions.
MEPs highlight the positive role that women play in conflict resolution and post-conflict reconstruction. They also draw attention to the vulnerability and special needs of women and girls in conflict situations and women as perpetrators of violence.
The report, drafted by Véronique DE KEYSER (PES, BE), states that women civilians in times of conflict, like children and old people, are victims of all sorts of ill treatment. In many cases the violence is not only physical and/or sexual abuse but also a violation of their economic, social and cultural rights. Victims of rape and sexual abuses are often stigmatised, rejected and mistreated and sometimes in honour of the community even murdered. MEPs emphasise states responsibility to put an end to impunity and to prosecute those responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes including those relating to sexual violence against women and girls. MEPs call for zero-tolerance of the sexual exploitation of children, girls and women in armed conflicts and refugee camps, and demands severe administrative and criminal penalties for such exploitation. The report also recalls the importance to reproductive health services in conflict situations and refugee camps.
Women should take a more active role in peace-making
Despite all the resolutions, appeals and recommendations adopted and made by various international and European institutions; women are still not fully involved in conflict-prevention and conflict resolution, peace-keeping operations and peace-building, notes the Parliament. Consequently, MEPs do not call for fresh recommendations but the implementation of existing ones, for example UN resolution 1325 of 2000 on Women and peace and security. The Parliament stresses the need to increase the role of women in political decision making in national reconstruction processes, and also their political presence at the negotiating table. The EU is encouraged to support measures to significantly increase the number of women at all levels in all European Security and Defence Policy missions.
The report also takes into account that women are not always peace-makers; they are also some times war-makers. Particularly the problem of female suicide bombers, and stresses that rape used as a weapon of war affects all women, irrespective of ethnic, religious and ideological differences.
Finally, the Parliament supports the due implementation of human rights clauses in agreements with third countries and of the principles of international humanitarian law and related international agreements with specific reference to women's rights and needs. Text adopted

Postponement of vote - Protecting workers against the risk of infection from contaminated needles
2006-06-06 - 14:26
MEPs voted to postpone the vote on the resolution on protecting workers against the risk of infection from contaminated needles to the June plenary session in Strasbourg. Every year around a million workers in Europe, mainly in the medical world, suffer injuries from used surgical needles. The consequences can be serious, including infections from HIV or hepatitis B or C. The EP wants to improve existing EU legislation so as to give workers better protection.
MEPs in the committee believe that many of these "needlestick injuries" which occur in the medical world could be prevented if appropriate measures were made compulsory in medical and veterinary services. In a report by Stephen HUGHES (PES, UK), adopted by a large majority, MEPs in the committee say studies have shown that the use of safer needles together with regular training and organisational measures can help reduce the number of injuries. They add that safer working practices and medical devices designed to prevent accidental needlestick injuries would also produce financial savings. Adopted text

MEPs react on euro zone enlargement
2006-06-06 - 14:26
The European Parliament says accession to the euro zone requires full adherence to the Maastricht criteria on economic convergence. MEPs adopted a report (with major amendments) by 510 votes in favour, to 40 against with 66 abstentions on issues applying to all and any future euro zone enlargements, but which also comments on three particular cases: Slovenia, Lithuania and Estonia.
Drawn up by Werner LANGEN (EPP-ED, DE), the report warns that premature accession to the euro zone might lead to unexpected developments in the economic convergence process. MEPs strongly oppose special provisions concerning the fulfilment of the Maastricht criteria and underline the importance of assessing the long-term stability of the euro zone. Euro enlargement should be used as an opportunity for the enforcement of economic governance within the zone.
In the light of earlier problems, MEPs stress that the judgments on whether a particular country meets the inflation and interest rate criteria should be based on data provided by the European Central Bank and the European Commission. It calls on the Member States to give the Commission the possibility to check the fulfilment of the Maastricht criteria on the basis of definite, current, reliable and high-quality data.
MEPs ask Member States joining the euro to pay particular attention to consumer protection during the changeover phase, with mandatory dual pricing for a sufficiently long period of time and publicity campaigns encouraging citizens to shop around to avoid unjustified price increases.
Parliament welcomes Slovenia as a new member of the euro zone and considers that this enlargement will have a positive effect on the European economy as a whole.
MEPs regret the negative recommendation issued to Lithuania and ask for a clear and comprehensive examination of the basis of the calculation undertaken in order to apply the inflation criteria. They call on the Commission to update its 2006 convergence report on Lithuania and to set up an expert working group in cooperation with the Lithuanian authorities to develop the strategy for fast accession to the euro zone. MEPs ask that the Commission always present its findings to Parliament when it carries out an evaluation of this sort, even if the results are negative.
Parliament encourages Estonia, which failed only the inflation criteria, to continue its efforts to fulfil the criteria for accession and to qualify for euro zone membership soon.
Parliament says that the inflation criterion, which is based on the inflation rates of the three best performing Member States, needs to be clarified, since it was defined before the creation of the euro zone with its single currency and unified monetary policy. The report says it is important to take into account the so-called Balassa-Samuelson effect (the view that fast-growing economies catching up with larger economies will inevitably have higher inflation rates during this transition) when considering the inflation criterion for emerging Member States. MEPs are concerned that two definitions of price stability are being used: the one used by the ECB in its monetary policy and the one used in convergence reports. They say this is misleading and may have negative effects.
Parliament is due to vote on the legislation necessary for Slovenia to adopt the euro from 1 January 2007 during June's plenary session in Strasbourg. Adopted text

Energy
Maximising the potential of energy efficiency
2006-06-06 - 14:26
The European Parliament says energy efficiency is the greatest, fastest and cheapest reaction to energy security worries, rising and volatile energy prices and environmental concerns. MEPs are calling for existing legislation in the field to be implemented and for the Commission to develop new measures in its forthcoming Energy Efficiency Action Plan.
In a report drawn up by Alejo VIDAL-QUADRAS ROCA (EPP-ED, ES), the House highlights research claiming that the EU could save at least 20 per cent of its present energy consumption in a cost-effective manner. To harness this possibility, action is needed at Community, national, regional, local and international levels, by industry and by consumers. MEPs say that energy efficiency should be integrated into EU transport, agricultural and foreign policies. Their proposals include: the creation of an Energy Efficiency Fund to support energy efficiency products; new fiscal measures; the extension of energy efficiency labelling and other consumer information schemes; a European buildings initiative to coordinate upgrading energy standards for new buildings; the encouragement of investment in energy efficiency measures; the replacement of old household appliances. Both Member States and EU institutions should set an example, with energy efficiency measures in the public sector - including a rethink of the multiple locations of Parliament itself.
The report also stresses the many energy efficiency measures already in force, including directives on buildings, combined heat and power, eco-design, emissions trading and on energy end-use efficiency. If this EU-legislation was fully implemented by the Member States, the EU would already be half way to meeting its target of saving 20 per cent of energy-use by 2020. MEPs are therefore calling for the Commission to speed up the infringement procedures for Member States not yet complying.
MEPs say consumers must be clearly and adequately informed and call for an EU-wide information and awareness raising campaign on best practice on energy efficiency. Text adopted

Competitiveness and Innovation Programme: agreement in first reading expected
2006-06-06 - 14:26
Enhancing competitiveness and innovation to increase Europe's productivity, innovation capacity and sustainable growth – that is the main aim of the CIP, a framework programme suggested by the Commission for 2007 to 2013.
Based on an agreement between Parliament's rapporteur Jorgo CHATZIMARKAKIS (ALDE, DE) and the Council, the Industry, Research and Energy Committee adopted a package of 145 compromise agreements which will allow the program to be adopted in first reading and enter into force, as planned, on 1 January 2007.
Following the agreement, the budget for the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework programme (CIP) running from 2007 to 2013 will be €3 196 million. This is a reduction vis-à-vis the Commission's original proposal (€4 212,6 million) but far more than the European Council common position of 16 December 2005 which included a reduction of more than 50 %.
The CIP programme brings together several existing EU programmes and new actions which share the overarching objectives of enhancing competitiveness and innovation. (Measures in the fields of entrepreneurship, SMEs, industrial competitiveness, innovation, information and communication technology (ICT), environmental technologies and intelligent energy. While in current arrangements multiple funding schemes and instruments coexist, the CIP shall simplify the support of an innovative entrepreneurship. It will complement the research-oriented activities promoted by the Community Framework Programme on Research and Technological Development and Demonstration. Its aim is to increase Europe's productivity, innovation capacity and sustainable growth, whilst simultaneously addressing complementary environmental concerns.
Three current programmes will be integrated in the CIP, namely the "Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme" (MAP), the "ICT policy support Programme" and the "Intelligent Energy-Europe Programme". Two more activities complete the CIP: A risk capital instrument to facilitate capital to innovative and high-growth SMEs and a scheme to support cooperation between national and regional programmes for business innovation (BISS).
MEPs underline that particular attention should be paid to the needs of SMEs. To facilitate their participation in the programme, the compromise states that the Commission will publish a user-friendly User Manual establishing a clear, simple and transparent framework of general principles for the participation of beneficiaries in the Framework Programme.
It is important for MEPs that the CIP contributes to closing the gap between research and innovation and promotes all forms of innovation.
The compromise also gives eco-innovation more importance and clarifies certain actions. Also the monitoring and evaluation aspects of implementation of the CIP are improved. Adopted text
