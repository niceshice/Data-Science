At the initiative of the President of the European Parliament, Jerzy Buzek, eight former Presidents of the European Parliament gathered in Strasbourg on the occasion of his inaugural speech. They launched an appeal to Irish voters to go to the polls on 2 October for the Referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.
President Buzek commented: "All of the former Presidents are in agreement the importance of the Lisbon Treaty to equip the European Union to deal with the challenges of the 21st century, including the economic crisis, climate change, immigration and cross-border crime.
The decision on 2 October is for the Irish people to make. Ireland's partners in the EU wish to underline that the decision of the Irish people will have implications for all of us in this great family of nations. We hope there will be a YES because we believe this is in the interest of Ireland and of us all.
The European Parliament is the democratically-elected institution of the EU, there to represent voters' concerns. Along with my predecessors, I strongly support the Lisbon Treaty for the increased democracy it would bring to the EU through giving Parliament a greater say in legislation."
