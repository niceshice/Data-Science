About 80% of the EU budget - for example, the Structural Funds - is managed through "shared management", which means that the spending is delegated to Member States. However, the European Court of Auditors has stated that national authorities in the Member States do not do their part of their job well enough.
The seminar will look at the following questions:
How can financial management in the EU be improved?
What controls can be put in place to make sure Member States are as rigorous in spending EU money as they are in spending national funds?
What are the intentions of Member States in this respect?
