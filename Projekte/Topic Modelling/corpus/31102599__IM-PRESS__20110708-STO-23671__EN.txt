EP President Jerzy Buzek (R) and Irish PM Enda Kenny © European Union 2011 PE-EP/AFP/J.Leguerre "Ireland's success has been an inspiration to the countries which joined the EU in 2004 and 2007," EP President Jerzy Buzek said Tuesday in a speech to the Seanad Éireann, the upper house of the Irish Parliament. "Poland and Ireland share a similar history - of occupation, of immigration, of poverty, of striving for freedom and...of transformation, of economic success and of shared European aspirations."
Mr Buzek said Ireland had used the benefits of EU membership "wisely", making its economy more diverse and open. "New member states, such as Poland, have used your model of development as a blueprint for their policies," he said.
The EU welcomes Ireland's return to economic growth after three years, Mr Buzek told the Irish Senate. "You are well placed to recover, with a business-friendly environment and a skilled workforce."
"If Ireland is to make a full recovery, she needs all the help she can get, and all the instruments at her disposal. So let me make one thing clear, the EU or her institutions are not putting pressure on Ireland to change your corporation tax rate," he added.
Mr Buzek visited Ireland 11-12 July, where he met Irish President Mary McAleese and Taoiseach Enda Kenny, as well as other ministers and members of civil society. Click below for more details and to read the speech in full.
