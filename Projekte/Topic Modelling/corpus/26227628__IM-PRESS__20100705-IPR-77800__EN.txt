Regional and local authorities should be more extensively involved in implementing the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region, and funds for environmental protection and developing infrastructure must be managed more effectively, says a resolution approved by the European Parliament on Tuesday.
The Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region is the first, and so far the only, attempt to create a complex common development strategy for a cross-border "macro-region" with common development goals or problems. Steered by the European Commission, it aims to make better use of Community programmes and national policies.
Its four key aims are protecting the environment, enhancing the regionâ€™s prosperity, increasing its accessibility and attractiveness, and ensuring safety and security.
Member States should use the Structural Funds available for 2007-2013 to promote job creation and economic growth, harnessing the region's special characteristics to add value at regional level, says the resolution, drafted by Wojciech Michal Olejniczak (S&D, PL).
A Baltic Sea Environmental Monitoring Centre should be set up to provide early warning of accidents and serious cross-border pollution, adds the resolution, noting that this is one of the world's most polluted sea areas, suffering from eutrophication, the effects of hazardous substances deposited on the seabed and threats to aquatic biodiversity, including endangered fish populations.
The resolution was approved by a show of hands.
