Europeans ever more worried about money

Personal economic and social concerns are a growing worry for Europeans, says the latest Eurobarometer survey for the 2009 European elections. This survey, done during the financial crisis, also found a clear decline in collective concerns such as terrorism, immigration and climate change. Many more Europeans now know the election dates, although this is not yet reflected in their voting intentions.
The three key priorities, which emerged during the previous, spring 2008 survey (Eurobarometer 69), show big increases: economic growth (51%, +6), unemployment (49%, +2), and inflation and purchasing power (47%, +6). By contrast, collective concerns have fallen considerably: insecurity (33%, -4), the fight against climate change (29%, -4), immigration (29%, -3) and terrorism (28%, -7).
A year ago, only 9% of respondents knew that the European elections would be held in June 2009. Today, 26% do. After the crisis, 44% say they are "interested" in the elections, down from 46% in the previous survey. The number planning to vote is also down slightly.
Another result of the crisis is that the Euro is now seen as the leading component of European identity. Likewise, "a European social welfare system harmonized between the States" is now viewed as the likeliest factor to strengthen the sense of European citizenship.
The results of this second survey confirm that the European Parliament is generally well perceived, as democratic and playing a unifying role. Replies nonetheless show that Europeans are still not clear about Parliament's role and powers.
The Eurobarometer 70 survey was done in October and November 2008.
