Minute of silence for victim of ETA, debate added on Roma in the EU
Parliament held a minute of silence in respect of the ETA assassination of member of the Spanish "Guardia Civil". Juan Manuel Pinuel-Villalon was murdered on Wednesday 14 May in a car bombing at the police barracks of Legutiano (Alava). European Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering said: "The European Parliament condemns this disgraceful act in the most determined terms. I wish to express on behalf of the European Parliament our deep sadness and profound sympathy to their families and friends. I want also to express our solidarity with the Spanish people, their authorities and democratic institutions and to their security forces."
Calendar of part-sessions 2009 - European elections 4-7 June 2009
The European Parliament adopted the calendar of part-sessions for 2009. European elections will take place from 4-7 June 2009. In 2009, eleven part-sessions will take place in Strasbourg and four two-day part-sessions will take place in Brussels. The adopted calendar is available via a link in this publication.
An integrated maritime policy for the EU - 20 May designated European Maritime Day
the first European Maritime Day, the European Parliament adopted an own-initiative report which says that the Action Plan includes too few practical measures and urges the Commission to use the instruments at its disposal under the EU Treaty. MEPs say that climate change challenges are addressed in a non-binding way, and that it should be the task of European Maritime Policy to prepare, in particular, for rising sea levels, with the increased risk of flooding of ports and of coastal regions.
Modern rules for road freight operations and road transport operator licensing
Parliament gave a first-reading to two legislative proposals aimed at modernising the rules on access to the road freight transport market and licensing for road transport operators. The vote on a third report on road passenger transport was postponed. It was notably agreed that restrictions on freight cabotage (delivery operations within a Member State other than that where the haulier is based) will be lifted by 2014.
Current mitigation efforts on climate change “insufficient”, say MEPs in interim report
Pouring cold water on “scientifically unsubstantiated efforts” to discredit studies on the effects and causes of climate change, calling for additional research on the effect of biofuels, and warning that current policies are not enough to stem global warming in the long-term are the key points of the EP interim report on “the scientific facts of climate change”. The report says existing climate change mitigation policies will be insufficient to reduce global GHG emissions over the next decades.
Better social and environmental conditions needed when EU vessels are scrapped on Asia's shores say MEPs
Acting on environmentally damaging practices and on dangerous working conditions under which cargo ships are dismantled, primarily in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, is asked by the House. MEPs also ask the Commission to set up a list to register and monitor 'pre-waste ships', and a list of preferred ship recycling facilities in an own-initiative report drafted by Hans BLOKLAND (IND/DEM, NL).
EU criminal law to protect the environment
Criminal sanctions should be employed to punish all severe offences committed against environment to ensure EU legislation in this field is properly applied. If the directive is approved, illegal conducts seriously damaging environment would be considered as crimes in all Member States. The Parliament has reached a first-reading agreement with the Council on the proposed legislation.
Export-ban of mercury and mercury compounds from the EU by 2011
The export of mercury and mercury compounds from the EU will be prohibited from 15 March 2011, according to a second reading compromise between representatives of the EP and the Council which was confirmed by the European Parliament. Any export from Mercury from the EU, one of the world's biggest mercury exporters, will be prohibited from 15 March 2011 - 3 months earlier than proposed by the Council; the Commission had proposed 1 October 2011.
REACH: MEPs do not oppose chemical substance testing methods
The European Parliament has refrained from opposing the adoption of a draft Commission Regulation on Reach-compliant substance testing methods for chemical substances, since it got assurances from the Commission, that in the future new non-animal test methods will be approved in a quicker and more transparent way. MEPs had threatened to exercise their right to stop the new legislation, if the Commission would not commit itself to change its procedures to encourage non-animal test methods.
EU should take a leading role on access to environmental justice
MEPs urge the EU to take a leading role in the negotiations on the EU strategy for the third Meeting of the Parties to the Aarhus Convention, including the elaboration of a possible wider scope of the Convention to cover sustainable development in all its dimensions. MEPs say that synergies with other multilateral environmental agreements and other relevant international organisations and Conventions (in particular the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety) should be created.
Burma: MEPs condemn slow response from Burmese authorities and ask them to open up to international aid
In adopting a resolution on the tragic situation in Burma, the House condemns the slow response to this grave humanitarian crisis by the Burmese authorities and ask Burma to open cyclone-affected areas to international humanitarian aid operations and to immediately grant visas to aid workers. If the Burmese authorities continue to prevent aid from reaching those in danger, they should be held accountable for crimes against humanity before the ICC, says the resolution.
Learning the lessons of the PEACE programme for Ireland
The experience gained from the PEACE programmes in Ireland, positive results and best practice, what may be improved, challenges still to be faced and lessons to be learned are set out in an own-initiative report by Bairbre DE BRÚN (GUE/NGL, Sinn Fèin, Northern Ireland, UK) adopted by the European Parliament. The report was adopted with 603 votes in favour, 21 against and 12 abstentions.
MEPs call for comprehensive legislation to combat discrimination
The European Parliament adopted a report calling on the Commission to adhere to its commitment to propose a "comprehensive directive" to combat any discrimination in access to goods and services on grounds of sex, race, religion, disability, age or sexual orientation. The own-initiative report by Liz LYNNE (ALDE, West Midlands, UK) was adopted with 362 votes in favour, 262 against and 56 abstentions, also demands effective sanctions and support for victims.
Increasing the number of women scientists - gender parity implies at least 40 % female representation
In adopting a report on the under-representation of women in the world of science, Parliament calls for gender balance on decision-making bodies, mainstreaming of the male-female dimension in research programmes and support for scientific careers for women to increase the number of women scientists in the EU. MEPs criticise the unambitious and insufficient EU target of 25 % and remind the Commission and the Member States that gender parity implies at least 40 % female representation.
Violence against the Roma goes beyond Italy, say MEPs
Recent violence against the Roma in Italy prompted MEPs to put this issue on its agenda for Tuesday (20 May) and debate it with the Commission. MEPs called on Member States to enforce respect for fundamental rights and to facilitate the inclusion of the Roma in society.
EU consumer policy strategy - MEPs call for standard contracts and conditions for contracts
Parliament adopted a report on EU consumer policy strategy (2007-2013) which says that since the greatest obstacles to the development of an internal market in retailing include uncertainties regarding consumer contracts, the report supports the Commission in its efforts to introduce standard contracts and conditions for contracts concluded on-line which would have the same force in all the Member States. The report was adopted with 438 votes in favour, 84 against and 166 abstentions.
Soaring food prices: investment in agriculture needed in developing countries
Priority should be given to investment in agriculture, aquaculture, rural development and agribusinesses in developing countries. Fairer international trade rules and an assessment of the effects of speculation on food prices are also underlined by MEPs in a joint resolution adopted in Strasbourg. On agro-fuels, the Parliament wants production to be linked to strong sustainability criteria and to see second generation bioenergy developed.
Trade in raw materials and commodities- MEPs concerned about supply
In a report adopted by the European Parliament on trade in raw materials, MEPs express their concern that increasing demand for raw materials on world markets and the trend to restrict free access to raw materials in third countries by trade distorting measures may undermine the EU's competitiveness. MEPs would like to see developing countries benefiting from the extraction of natural resources on their territories. China's increasing demand and its role in Africa is once again pointed out.
"Transform priorities and time-lines into reform plans," say MEPs to Turkey
In its latest progress report on Turkey, adopted by a large majority of 467 for, 62 against and 61 abstentions, the European Parliament welcomes recent legislative activities in the country, while insisting that the speed of reforms must pick up. The own-initiative report, drawn up by Ria OOMEN-RUIJTEN (EPP-ED, NL), "welcomes the commitment of Prime Minister Erdogan that 2008 is going to be the year of reforms" and "urges the Turkish government to fulfil its promises" by implementing them.
Chinese earthquake - MEPs express solidarity and welcome rapid response
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the recent earthquake that hit China, killing tens of thousands of people, expressing its "sincere condolences and solidarity to the people of China and to the numerous victims." MEPs welcome the "prompt response to the disaster by the Chinese authorities by means of their emergency operation," and note "with appreciation China's readiness to accept foreign assistance."
European Parliament calls for a political solution in Lebanese crisis
In the aftermath of the recent wave of violent clashes in Beirut, and the recent agreement on power-sharing in Doha, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on Lebanon. The House welcomes the Doha agreement, and calls on all forces in the country to respect the Lebanese army and disarm. The resolution notes that "the security of the country and of all Lebanese people is dependent on the disarmament of all armed groups, especially Hezbollah."
Ensuring pan-European coverage for mobile satellite services
Rules providing for systems providing mobile satellite services - such as broadband internet or mobile TV - to be selected at EU level in the future were backed by the European Parliament. MEPs approved a first-reading compromise by Fiona HALL (ALDE, North East, Liberal Democrat, UK) negotiated with Council beforehand, which aims to improve accessibility, speed, and quality of electronic communications services especially in rural areas.
Promote sustainable industries but avoid unemployment and carbon leakage, say MEPs
The EU's climate change and renewable energy goals should be seen as a chance for EU industries to become world leaders in sustainable technologies, says an own-initiative report on industrial policy proposed adopted by the European Parliament. Yet, a relocation of European industries to countries with less strict environmental policies should be avoided as well, stress MEPs. The report was adopted with 443 votes in favour, 62 against and 21 abstentions.
The European Parliament calls on the US to end discrimination between EU citizens on visas
MEPs call for Member States involved in bilateral talks with the US on visas to respect EU law and for the US to end discrimination among Member States in a resolution adopted today. They also recall that the EU could temporarily restore a visa requirement for US citizens if reciprocity is not reached. Members adopted a resolution by 511 votes in favour, 29 against and 7 abstentions.
Animal health strategy - cloning for economic purposes should be banned say MEPs
MEPs support the objectives of the Commission's Animal Health Strategy for the EU, but call for more ambition and stress that such objectives can only be achieved with a sufficient and clearly defined budget. MEPs strongly support vaccination, which according to them should be recognised as one of the more important methods to prevent diseases. The European Parliament strongly believes that the cloning of animals for economic purposes should be banned.
MEPs adopt written declaration on rheumatic diseases
EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering announced that the written declaration on rheumatic diseases had been adopted. The declaration calls on the Commission and Council to attach more importance to rheumatic diseases in the new Community strategy on health, given their high social and economic costs. More than half of all MEPs (400 out of 785) have now signed the declaration meaning it becomes an official position of the European Parliament.
Parliament calls for a global ban on depleted uranium weapons
In a resolution adopted on depleted uranium (DU) weapons, the House calls for a moratorium on their use, increased pressure for an international treaty to ban them, and more research on these weapons. The resolution "strongly reiterates its call on all EU Member States and NATO countries to impose a moratorium on the use of depleted uranium weapons and to redouble efforts towards a global ban." The resolution was adopted with 491 votes in favour, 18 against and 12 abstentions.
Follow-up to the 2005 Paris Declaration on aid effectiveness
Simplifying aid procedures and phasing out economic policy conditionality are among the demands of the European Parliament in a report on aid effectiveness to developing countries. To be more efficient, aid should also be disbursed according to partners´ own priorities and timetables, says the report adopted with 443 votes in favour, 8 against and 11 abstentions. The report also underlines the necessary fight against corruption.
Human Rights: Sudan, Belarus and Burundi
Parliament adopted three human rights resolutions at the end of its Strasbourg plenary session on Thursday (22 May). In these resolutions, MEPs condemn Sudan for failing to cooperate with the International Criminal Court, call for Belarus to release political prisoners and end intimidation of the opposition, and urge all sides in Burundi to respect the ceasefire agreement. 20080516BRI29011

An integrated maritime policy for the EU - 20 May designated European Maritime Day
2008-05-22 - 17:48
On the first European Maritime Day, the European Parliament adopted an own-initiative report which says that the Action Plan includes too few practical measures and urges the Commission to use the instruments at its disposal under the EU Treaty. MEPs say that climate change challenges are addressed in a non-binding way, and that it should be the task of European Maritime Policy to prepare, in particular, for rising sea levels, with the increased risk of flooding of ports and of coastal regions. The report was adopted with 587 votes in favour, 20 against and 38 abstentions.
20 May - The first European Maritime Day
MEPs backed a proposal to establish an annual Maritime Day. Such an action day should be used to establish the significance of maritime policy outside maritime circles, with the participation of ordinary citizens, schools, universities and non-governmental organisations.
The European Maritime Day highlights the contribution that oceans and seas make to helping Europe meet the challenges of a globalised world. It is an opportunity to celebrate Europe's maritime heritage and maritime identity. It aims to raise awareness of the importance of the maritime industries and sectors in Europe's overall economy, and emphasise the key role of Europe's coastal regions.
The event
On 20 May in Strasbourg, President of the European Parliament Hans-Gert Pöttering, Council President Janez Janša, and Commission President José Manuel Barroso officially launched the first European Maritime Day by signing the Joint Tripartite Declaration establishing a "European Maritime Day".
Reducing emissions
MEPs call for maritime policy to make a substantial contribution to reducing greenhouse emissions, including incorporating shipping in emissions trading and stepping up research efforts with a view to exploiting the seas as a source of renewable energy. They also urge the Commission to be more ambitious in combating sulphur and NOx emissions as well as the emissions from ships.
In this connection, the House reiterates the need for closer cooperation in this field with the IMO (International Maritime Organisation) and, in particular, calls for:
- the introduction of nitrogen oxide emission standards for ships using EU ports;
- the designation of the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea and the North-East Atlantic as Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs);
- the reduction of the maximum permitted sulphur content in marine fuels used in SECAs by passenger vessels from 1,5% to 0,5%;
- the introduction of fiscal measures, such as taxes or charges on sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from ships and the identification of ways of imposing such measures and charges on all ships, regardless of flag, putting into Community ports or sailing within EU waters;
- promotion of the introduction of differentiated harbour and waterway charges to favour ships with low sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions;
- a proposal for an EU directive on the quality of marine fuels.
Glaciers
The melting of glaciers causes not only a rise in sea levels, but also irreparable damage to human, animal and plant life. Therefore, the Commission's initiative to put forward an Arctic Initiative is welcome.
Land-based pollution
Members also point out that land-based pollution of the sea constitutes a significant proportion of overall maritime pollution and that the Commission has yet to get grips with this issue. The Commission should put forward an action plan to reduce such pollution and the Member States should act promptly to transpose the legislation in this field into their national laws. They add that an action plan is also needed to identify and remove old munitions from past wars dumped in the North Sea and the Baltic.
Social and labour protection for seafarers
Seafarers should no longer be excluded from certain areas of European social and labour protection, such as safeguards for employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, rules on collective redundancies and on the posting of workers to provide services. The directives concerned should be revised in close cooperation with the social partners.
Fisheries
The key objective of an EU maritime policy in the field of fisheries should be to promote the modernisation and sustainable development of the industry throughout the EU. Although the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) has been serving well the industry in general, future policy should be developed in such a way to avoid failings in the CFP such as over-centralisation and the failure to take account of the regional diversity of the European waters. MEPs call for mutual recognition by the Member States of intermediate diplomas for the occupation of steersman and mechanic for fishing vessels. MEPs reiterate the need for mechanisms to subsidise or compensate fishermen who are affected by the repercussions of stock recovery plans or measures to protect ecosystems, especially in less favoured regions and communities and the outermost regions.
Protection of fishing and merchant ships by naval vessels
MEPs ask the Commission to set up a Community system for coordination and mutual assistance, that would allow naval vessels flying the flag of a Member State deployed in international waters, to protect fishing and merchant vessels from other Member States, at the earliest possible opportunity.

Modern rules for road freight operations and road transport operator licensing
2008-05-22 - 17:48
Parliament gave a first-reading to two legislative proposals aimed at modernising the rules on access to the road freight transport market and licensing for road transport operators. The vote on a third report on road passenger transport was postponed. It was notably agreed that restrictions on freight cabotage (delivery operations within a Member State other than that where the haulier is based) will be lifted by 2014. Road freight market
Matthieu Grosch (EPP-ED, BE) saw his report adopted with 499 votes in favour, 153 against and 46 abstentions. The key issue was cabotage: when and to what degree may a haulier from one Member State collect and deliver goods within another Member State. Parliament agreed with the Commission that, for the time being, when a haulier takes a delivery to another Member State, he or she may then make three consecutive cabotage operations (i.e. collections and deliveries within that Member State) before returning to their home country within seven days.
Parliament wants, however, to see these restrictions phased out. By 378 votes to 294, it adopted a provision increasing the permitted number of cabotage operations to seven with effect from two years after the entry into force of the legislation, and then abolishing all restrictions on the number and duration of cabotage operations on 1 January 2014.
Member States, should enter in their national register of road transport undertakings all serious infringements to the rules committed by hauliers which have led to the imposition of a sanction. Parliament decided however, that it would be a disproportionate also to include repeated minor infringements in this arrangement
Road passenger transport: vote postponed
Parliament decided to postpone, at request of the PES group, to postpone the vote until June or July on the second report by Matthieu Grosch on the international road passenger transport. Representatives of the industry and trades unions have recently agreed a deal on the key issue of the "12 day rule" for occasional cross-border services. This would allow drivers of tourist coaches to work on 12 consecutive days - something that would not otherwise be allowed under the general rules on rest days for drivers of passenger vehicles. By postponing the vote Parliament will be able to examine this agreement and if appropriate take account of it in the legislation.
Stricter rules for admission to the road transport sector
By adopting a report by Sylvia-Adriana Ticau (PES, RO), by 634 votes in favour to 288 against with 45 abstentions, Parliament has set the outlines for stricter licensing rules for those providing road transport services. It endorses, in particular, proposals to ensure transport managers are properly qualified, provisions on the good repute of an operator, and the withdrawal of licences of operators guilty of serious infringements.
Transport providers must be of "good repute" to obtain an operating licence and MEPs adopted a list of infringements which may lead to the loss that status. Transport operators also need provide proof of their financial standing and short term solvency, and provisions are included to prevent operators working via "letterbox companies".
Qualified managers must be a resident of a Member State. They must give evidence of their professional competence and if serious infringements are committed under their responsibility, they will be disqualified and will not be able to work as a transport manager within the EU. But MEPs said minor infringements should not disqualify managers and also simplified the financial requirements.
Finally, a number of amendments tighten provisions on the storage and exchange of data in the national transport data registers in order to protect individuals. Texts adopted

Current mitigation efforts on climate change “insufficient”, say MEPs in interim report
2008-05-22 - 17:48
Pouring cold water on “scientifically unsubstantiated efforts” to discredit studies on the effects and causes of climate change, calling for additional research on the effect of biofuels, and warning that current policies are not enough to stem global warming in the long-term are the key points of the EP interim report on “the scientific facts of climate change”. The report says existing climate change mitigation policies will be insufficient to reduce global GHG emissions over the next decades. The interim report was adopted with 566 votes in favour, 61 against and 24 abstentions.
Kyoto targets within reach – but “more ambitious” cuts needed
Speaking in the debate in Strasbourg, the rapporteur Karl-Heinz FLORENZ (EPP-ED, DE) said: "The climate change problem is both a challenge and an opportunity (to develop new technologies, create new jobs):we need a third industrial revolution and additional studies "to dispel any remaining doubts. In the future we need to be bale to do twice as much with a litre of fuel than we do now, we have to increase energy efficiency. now comes the difficult part: addressing the facts mentioned in this report."
Committee Chairman Guido SACCONI (PES, IT) referred to the IPCC report and said: "This is not [simply] a current of thought, the consensus [on climate change] verges on 100%"... This is "unprecedented in scientific history" and climate change is here, here to stay. As this report and the climate change package show, it's not only the earth's climate that is changing, the political climate has changed, as well."
Current research, according to the report, shows “the risk of serious impact on our planet if measures are not taken swiftly” to reduce CO2 and other greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Keeping this in mind, warn MEPs, existing climate change mitigation policies and related sustainable development practices will be “insufficient to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions over the next decades”. The level of global GHG emissions "must be reduced by 50% to 85% compared to 2000 to avoid serious risks", they emphasise. Although most EU Member States are making “good or even excellent progress” in their efforts to comply with their burden-sharing targets – thus “raising the likelihood that the EU will reach its Kyoto target by 2012” – they will have to reduce emissions “in a more ambitious way” to meet long-term EU targets.
In as much as they reiterate their commitment to the EU's objective of limiting the global temperature increase to less than 2°C above pre-industrial levels, MEPs believe that efforts to curb emissions should aim at staying "well below the 2°C target". Such a level of warming, they conclude, "would already heavily impact on our society"
Something for the sceptics
Although MEPs acknowledge that scientific progress “has always been marked by uncertainties,” they regard the science of climate change "as sufficiently settled" and criticise “scientifically unsubstantiated efforts to portray the results of studies into the causes and effects of climate change as doubtful, uncertain or questionable”. The underlying causes of global warming, they affirm elsewhere, “are predominantly man-made.”
Wanted: more research on biofuels’ environmental impact
Finally, the text calls for “additional research into the impact of the policy of promoting biofuels and their effects on the increase of deforestation, the expansion of cultivated land and world food supplies”.
Next steps
The interim report, drafted by Mr Florenz addresses only the scientific facts of climate change. The final report, meanwhile, to be adopted by the end of the EP Climate Change Committee’s mandate, will include recommendations on future EU integrated climate change policy, on adaptation and mitigation measures, as well as Parliament’s position in international negotiations for a post-2012 climate change framework.

Better social and environmental conditions needed when EU vessels are scrapped on Asia's shores say MEPs
2008-05-22 - 17:48
Acting on environmentally damaging practices and on dangerous working conditions under which cargo ships are dismantled, primarily in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, is asked by the House. MEPs also ask the Commission to set up a list to register and monitor 'pre-waste ships', and a list of preferred ship recycling facilities in an own-initiative report drafted by Hans Blokland (IND/DEM, NL). Up to 600 large cargo ships of over 2 000 dead weight tons (dwt) are dismantled worldwide. They are scrapped and torn apart, each year, for re-use of the steel and other valuable materials they contain. In 2010, it is predicted that nearly 800 single-hull oil tankers will have to leave service. Approximately 100 warships and other government vessels flying EU flags - most of them French and British - are expected to be decommissioned in the next 10 years, according to the Commission's document.
MEPs warn that the current situation at the scrapping sites is bound to deteriorate further and that the issue should have been acted upon already ten years ago. MEPs call for effective measures to be taken at EU level before 2010, prior to the adoption of the IMO Convention and prior to the peak year of the accelerated phase-out of single-hull tankers.
The House considers it ethically unacceptable that children are used by some dismantling contractors to do hard and hazardous work.
Increase EU's capacity for dismantling and create a register
Ship owners use a loophole that allows EU ships to at the same time be classified as waste and a ship under different regulations, and thus circumvent the ban on export of hazardous waste. The report criticizes the lack of political will to close the loopholes and to tackle the structural hiding of responsibility in the shipping sector, which leads to a systematic disregarded for regulation and for the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal.
The House calls upon the Member States and the Commission to implement the Waste Shipments Regulation more effectively by means of stricter inspections and supervision by authorities in Member States, with a view to empowering port states, flag states, and states with jurisdiction over owners (waste generators) to declare a ship to be 'end-of-life' and therefore as waste regardless of whether or not that ship is still operable.
In order to enforce the rules and close loopholes the report calls for worldwide regulation by the International Maritime Organisation, which according MEPs would be the most effective way to protect the environment and public health
However, since it is anticipated that such conventions are unlikely to enter into force before 2012, the report also calls for the Commission to establish a list to register and monitor 'pre-waste ships', as well as a list of preferred ship recycling facilities.
Even with such lists established, there would still be a lack of OECD ship dismantling facilities. However, since it is legitimate to move ships from OECD- to non-OECD-countries for scrapping, provided that they first have their toxic components removed, the report calls for immediate measures to develop the dismantling and pre-cleaning industry in the European Union. EU - approved dismantling sites in Asia is another option suggested by MEPs.
Transfer of technology and fund for ship dismantling
The report also calls for Calls on the Commission to promote the transfer of know-how and technology, thereby helping dismantling yards in Southern Asia to comply with international safety and environmental requirements.
MEPs welcome the proposal to establish a fund for ship dismantling. Available financial mechanisms, including a compulsory insurance requirement and the use of port fees, should be investigated. Text adopted - Green Paper on better ship dismantling

EU criminal law to protect the environment
2008-05-22 - 17:48
Criminal sanctions should be employed to punish all severe offences committed against environment to ensure EU legislation in this field is properly applied. If the directive is approved, illegal conducts seriously damaging environment would be considered as crimes in all Member States. The Parliament has reached a first-reading agreement with the Council on the proposed legislation. MEPs, by adopting the report by Hartmut Nassauer (EPP-ED, DE), agreed on the principle that governments should apply criminal measures to punish any illegal behaviour likely to seriously injure people or damage air, soil, waters, plants and animals, when committed intentionally or with serious negligence.
During the debate in Strasbourg, the rapporteur strongly welcomed the proposed legislation. Commenting on the fact that, for the first time, the EP will approve a comprehensive piece of legislation implying the use of criminal law, he said: "we are setting a precedent". He then advocated the possibility that the use of criminal sanctions may be extended to other fields than protection of environment.
Criminal law applies in case of infringement of Community legislation
The overall aim of the approved report is to ensure that all Member States consider as criminal offences a series of conducts provoking damages to the environment. In other words, if in a EU country one of the crimes listed in the report is currently subjected only to civil sanctions (e.g. a fine), the entry into force of this legislation would oblige national government to apply "effective, proportionate and dissuasive" criminal penalties to that specific case.
The EP also agreed that the discussed directive would only apply to cases of infringement of the EU legislation on the protection of environment, according to the list annexed to the report.
Sanctions for trading of protected fauna and ozone-depleting substances
The approved text lists the emission of radiation into air, soil or water, the disposal of waste, the production, storage and transport of nuclear materials, among the offences that would be sanctioned by the criminal code, when likely to seriously injure people or the environment.
MEPs also backed the inclusion of the possession, killing or possession of protected fauna and flora species, the deterioration of a habitat within a protected site, and the manufacture and distribution of ozone-depleting substances.
Court's ruling of October 2007
The Parliament further amended the original Commission proposal to make the directive consistent with a decision of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) of October 2007.
According to the ECJ, the EU has competence to adopt criminal measures only when there's a "justifiable need", e.g. in the common transport and environment policies. Nevertheless, the Court ruled that the EU cannot specify the type and level of the criminal sanctions. Therefore, MEPs deleted the article of the Commission text providing the extension and duration of the proposed sanctions. Text adopted - Protection of the environment through criminal law

Export-ban of mercury and mercury compounds from the EU by 2011
2008-05-22 - 17:48
The export of mercury and mercury compounds from the EU will be prohibited from 15 March 2011, according to a second reading compromise between representatives of the EP and the Council which was confirmed by the European Parliament. Any export from Mercury from the EU, one of the world's biggest mercury exporters, will be prohibited from 15 March 2011 - 3 months earlier than proposed by the Council; the Commission had proposed 1 October 2011. In addition to metallic mercury, the export ban will also cover other mercury compounds as for example cinnabar ore, mercury chloride and mercury oxide. Compounds for research and development, medical or analytical analysis purposes are not covered by the prohibition.
Parliaments rapporteur, Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL, EL), commented on the compromise: "I am glad we managed to extend the export ban of metallic mercury to its more toxic and dangerous compounds and examine, by January 2010, the need to extend it even more, by including other mercury compounds and products containing mercury, in an effort to close all loopholes. We also brought forward the legislation and ensured the safe storage of mercury, by predominantly environmental and health criteria. This is the best compromise we could have realistically hoped to obtain, with some Member States ferociously opposing it. It is a source of great relief to everyone fighting to exclude mercury from our daily lives and avoiding making the developing world Europe's dumping ground."
Safe storage of mercury stocks
The regulation introduces the obligation to store mercury waste either in salt mines, in deep, underground, hard rock formations, or in above-ground facilities "in a way that is safe for human health and the environment" before eventually being disposed of.
The Commission shall keep under review ongoing research activities on safe disposal options, including solidification of metallic mercury and submit by 1.1.2010 a report to Parliament and Council and if appropriate a proposal for revision of the directive not later than 15. March 2013.
Ban of mercury imports and extension of export scope to be examined by Commission by 2010
The Parliaments first-reading request, supported also by the Environment Committee, to ban also mercury imports into the EU is not included in the compromise, but the Commission has to examine together with the Member States and the relevant stakeholders by 2010 if there is a need for such a ban. Furthermore the Commission will examine, if the export ban shall be extended to other mercury compounds, mixtures with a lower mercury content and products containing mercury, in particular thermometers, barometers and sphygmomanometers.
Uses and hazards of mercury
Mercury can come from waste recycling (e.g. fluorescent lamps, batteries), natural gas cleaning or the industrial treatment of non-ferrous metals. It is used above all in the chlor-alkali industry, which has undertaken to convert to techniques that are less dangerous to health and the environment; the old methods produce large quantities of highly toxic calomel (mercurous chloride).
Mercury is highly toxic to humans, especially when transformed into methylmercury. It is also bio-accumulative, meaning that it concentrates in the food chain. Numerous scientific studies blame it for cardiovascular and immune-system ailments. It can affect the brain development of unborn children, even in minimal doses.
Mercury use is declining both in the EU and globally. Global demand is around 3,400 tonnes per year, with the EU-25 accounting for 780 tonnes in 2005.
Across the world, the main uses of mercury are in small-scale gold mining, the chlor-alkali industry and production of vinyl-chloride monomer, the basis of PVC plastic. In the EU only the chlor-alkali industry remains a significant user, and it is progressively phasing out the use of mercury-containing cells in its production of chlorine.4
The regulation will enter into force after its formal adoption by Council and 20 days after its publication in the EUs Official Journal. Text adopted - Banning of exports and the safe storage of metallic mercury

REACH: MEPs do not oppose chemical substance testing methods
2008-05-22 - 17:48
The European Parliament has refrained from opposing the adoption of a draft Commission Regulation on Reach-compliant substance testing methods for chemical substances, since it got assurances from the Commission, that in the future new non-animal test methods will be approved in a quicker and more transparent way. MEPs had threatened to exercise their right to stop the new legislation, if the Commission would not commit itself to change its procedures to encourage non-animal test methods. Test methods for chemical substances are regulated in different legislation at the moment and shall be shifted into a new Commission Regulation under REACH. At the same time new test methods, including alternative test methods to replace animal testing, will be integrated in the new Regulation. Before new test methods can be included they must be scientifically validated but have to be also approved in a regulatory procedure which is taking momentarily a long time.
In the resolution adopted with 508 votes in favour, 6 against and 8 abstentions, MEPs criticise that the Commission has not included a number of scientifically validated alternative test methods to animal tests in the regulation just because the regulatory procedure has not been terminated yet. They want to guarantee that new non-animal test methods can be applied as soon as possible. During the elaboration of the REACH regulation the promotion of alternatives to the animal testing of chemicals was an issue of prime concern to MEPs and is now included among the goals of REACH.
MEPs nevertheless refrained from opposing the draft Commission Regulation (a right the EP has since the proposal is to be dealt with under the first-ever regulatory procedure with scrutiny to be carried out in the Environment Committee) since they got formal assurances from the Commission that in the future the approval of non-animal test methods will be more transparent and quicker.

EU should take a leading role on access to environmental justice
2008-05-22 - 17:48
MEPs urge the EU to take a leading role in the negotiations on the EU strategy for the third Meeting of the Parties to the Aarhus Convention, including the elaboration of a possible wider scope of the Convention to cover sustainable development in all its dimensions. MEPs say that synergies with other multilateral environmental agreements and other relevant international organisations and Conventions (in particular the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety) should be created. The Aarhus Convention deals with the access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters. From 11 to 13 June 2008 the forthcoming third Meeting of the Parties (MOP-3) is to be held in Riga, Latvia. The Aarhus Convention entered into force on 30 October 2001, was ratified by the EC in 2005, has at the moment 41 parties.
The resolution was adopted with 426 votes in favour, 10 against and 3 abstentions.
Aims of the meeting (inter alia) should be according to the European Parliament:
- increase of citizens awareness of their rights and responsibilities under the Aarhus Convention
- ensure that work on access to justice continues by ensuring that public authorities are aware of their obligations
- full implementation of the Convention is needed (Commission shall set god example) and other countries should become parties to Convention.
The legislative instruments which implements the remaining part of Convention in the EU (on access to justice in environmental matters) is blocked in Council, MEPs urge Commission and Member States to resume work to transpose the remaining part in EU law. Text adopted by the EP (click on 22 May)

Burma: MEPs condemn slow response from Burmese authorities and ask them to open up to international aid
2008-05-22 - 17:48
In adopting a resolution on the tragic situation in Burma, the House condemns the slow response to this grave humanitarian crisis by the Burmese authorities and ask Burma to open cyclone-affected areas to international humanitarian aid operations and to immediately grant visas to aid workers. If the Burmese authorities continue to prevent aid from reaching those in danger, they should be held accountable for crimes against humanity before the ICC, says the resolution. MEPs call on the Burmese Government to put its people's lives first and ask South-East Asian nations to use their influence with the Burmese authorities to open Burma for immediate access by all possible humanitarian relief.
MEPs stress the urgent nature of the assistance to be delivered to the suffering population as the weather conditions in the affected area worsen owing to the beginning of the Monsoon. Affected farmers should receive assistance to plant a new crop of rice in time.
Burma is asked to open cyclone-affected areas to international humanitarian aid operations and to immediately grant visas to aid workers. MEPs reiterate that the sovereignty of a nation cannot be allowed to override the human rights of its people as enshrined in the UN principle of the 'responsibility to protect'.
MEPs deplore the distorted priorities of the regime in pushing ahead with its "so-called referendum on the sham constitution".
ASEAN, China and India's influence
The House welcomes the agreement, reached at the summit of ASEAN, India and China in Singapore on 19 May 2008, to allow the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to coordinate the international relief efforts.
MEPs urge the Governments of China and India to use their influence with the Burmese authorities in order to open Burma for immediate access by all possible humanitarian relief. Text adopted by the EP (click on 22 May)

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
MEPs call for comprehensive legislation to combat discrimination
2008-05-22 - 17:48
The European Parliament adopted a report calling on the Commission to adhere to its commitment to propose a "comprehensive directive" to combat any discrimination in access to goods and services on grounds of sex, race, religion, disability, age or sexual orientation. The own-initiative report adopted with 362 votes in favour, 262 against and 56 abstentions, also demands effective sanctions and support for victims. Speaking in the debate, Liz Lynne (ALDE, West Midlands, UK) called for comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation. "We must move away from the piecemeal approach, there can be no hierarchy of discrimination. A new directive must cover discrimination to access and services on all grounds that have not been covered as yet under Article 13 legislation: disability, age, religion or belief and sexual orientation. Race and Gender are already covered, as is employment. The Commission made the commitment to a comprehensive directive in its work programme for 2008: There appears to be some backtracking on this and they might only bring forward legislation on disability and nothing else, this is not acceptable. Every EU citizen must be treated equally."
A comprehensive directive to end hierarchy of protection
The report on the progress made in equal opportunities and non-discrimination adopted on Tuesday reminds the Commission of its commitment to put forward a comprehensive directive to outlaw discrimination in goods and services on all grounds - covering disability, age, religion or belief and sexual orientation - "to complete the package of anti-discrimination legislation".
Discrimination on grounds of gender, and racial or ethnic origin is already covered by two existing directives. Parliament calls for "putting an end to the hierarchy of protection against different grounds of discrimination". It would not "make sense to outlaw discrimination in one area whilst allowing it in another", they say.
Defeat for attempt to block further EU legislation
An amendment tabled by the EPP-ED group which deplored discrimination but said that "a non-specific directive prohibiting discrimination" was not "the appropriate tool for dealing with the complex needs of individuals" was defeated with 284 votes in favour to 371 against.
Combat all forms of discrimination
MEPs stress that any new directive would have to prohibit all forms of discrimination, including direct and indirect discrimination, in all areas that fall under EU competence as well as education, lifelong learning, social protection and social security, housing and healthcare, images of discriminated groups in the media and advertising, physical access for people with disabilities to information, telecommunication, electronic communications, transport modes and public spaces, social advantages and access to and supply of goods and services which are available to the public.
The report also states that future legislation has to include specific provisions to combat multiple discrimination "which can be invoked on either one or a combination of more than one of the grounds".
Differences in treatment based on nationality or language which may constitute indirect discrimination is also included in the report.
Deficiencies in implementation of existing legislation
Moreover, the Parliament is concerned about the deficiencies in the transposition and implementation of the existing directives on equal treatment in employment and occupation (Directive 2000/78/EC) and of persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (Directive 2000/43/EC) by some Member States. MEPs, therefore, urge the Commission to continue pressure on Member States through infringement and non-compliance procedures to fully transpose these directives as soon as possible.
They also believe that exceptions linked to marital status in the Employment Directive 2000/78/EC has limited the protection against discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation offered by the Directive.
Effective sanctions and assistance for victims
Sanctions against a violation of national provisions must be "effective, proportionate and dissuasive", say MEPs. They recall that the burden to act is often on the victim to challenge the perpetrator "often with neither support from any public authority nor access to public funding for legal aid". Therefore, "Member States should ensure that victims of discrimination are automatically assisted in legal proceedings, if necessary by public funding through national legal aid schemes", says the report.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Increasing the number of women scientists - gender parity implies at least 40 % female representation
2008-05-22 - 17:48
In adopting a report on the under-representation of women in the world of science, Parliament calls for gender balance on decision-making bodies, mainstreaming of the male-female dimension in research programmes and support for scientific careers for women to increase the number of women scientists in the EU. MEPs criticise the unambitious and insufficient EU target of 25 % and remind the Commission and the Member States that gender parity implies at least 40 % female representation. Research is a key sector for the EU's economic development: Europe needs to recruit 700,000 additional researchers under the Lisbon strategy for growth and employment.
However, women researchers are in a minority within the EU, comprising of only 35% of researchers in government and the public sector and only 18% of researchers in the private sector. The higher up the academic ladder one goes, the fewer women there are. Although women account for over 50% of European students and 43% of PhDs, they only hold 15% of senior university posts, which sharply reduces their influence over research decisions.
The report by Britta THOMSEN (PES, DK) seeks to address the low number of women in decision-making bodies and a lack of transparency in recruitment procedures and the persistence of stereotypes in Europe's teaching systems. "The subject of women and science is related to the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy. Positive actions are needed to quickly improve the situation", said the rapporteur. It was adopted by 416 votes for, 75 against and 164 abstentions.
Gender balance in decision-making bodies
To bring more women into science, MEPs call on the Commission and the Member States to opt for more transparent recruitment processes and to require a gender balance in evaluation panels and selection committees, ensuring they consist of at least 40% women and at least 40% men.
Moreover, notes the report, one of the priority areas for EU action in the Roadmap for Gender Equality is equal representation in decision-making, including a target of 25% of women in leading positions in public sector research.
Fighting stereotypes and mainstreaming the male-female dimension in EU programmes
Universities, research institutes and private businesses are encouraged to adopt and enforce equality strategies in the organisation, including more "gender neutral" approaches to evaluating performance.
The report considers that Gender Action Plans within the proposal and evaluation stage of the EU's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) is an essential part of the EU's gender equality programme and therefore should remain an integral part of European research funding.
Encouraging scientific careers for women
The report calls on the commission and the Member States to take positive action to encourage female researchers, such as setting up support programmes for young women scientists and strengthening networking among female scientists at national, regional and EU level.

Learning the lessons of the PEACE programme for Ireland
2008-05-22 - 17:48
The experience gained from the PEACE programmes in Ireland, positive results and best practice, what may be improved, challenges still to be faced and lessons to be learned are set out in an own-initiative report by Bairbre DE BRÚN (GUE/NGL, UK) adopted by the European Parliament. The report was adopted with 603 votes in favour, 21 against and 12 abstentions. Lessons from these programmes could help elsewhere, within and beyond EU borders. The possibility of creating a Europe-wide network of regions and cities living with, or emerging from, conflict and exclusion is now under discussion, notes the report.
Speaking in Irish in the debate in Strasbourg on Monday (19 May), Bairbre DE BRÚN (GUE/NGL, Sinn Féin, Northern Ireland, UK) stressed that the PEACE programmes are a sound investment in building an enterprise economy in Northern Ireland and the border areas. These programmes, and the International Fund for Ireland, have engendered confidence by empowering local firms and communities, she noted, stressing the need to keep on funding support groups for victims and survivors and other work even after the formal end of the programmes.
Lessons
Local empowerment is essential to peace-building, because civil society participation improves policy making and governance.
Experience in dealing with EU funds, and in developing provision mechanisms that involve the voluntary sector, non-governmental organisations and local authorities, could serve in other, similar funding programmes.
Establishing a network of enterprise centres in deprived areas contributes to economic and social development, and helps boost confidence and hope.
Co-operation among participants in EU-funded programmes should not stop once EU funding comes to an end - government departments are asked to consider how to maintain this work, so as to ensure that mainstream funding continues thereafter.
When structuring future initiatives, the Commission is asked, in relation to its task force on Northern Ireland, to replicate the "active citizenship" approach from the PEACE I and PEACE II programmes, [and to step up its support for infrastructure improvement].
Cross-border work is central to regenerating urban and rural communities, and should be further developed, as should [co-operation between local chambers of commerce and] working relationships and forums for the voluntary and community sectors on both sides of the border [and for voluntary organisations that already work on a cross-border basis].
Funding programmes should make widespread use of both large and small-scale local consultations and include schemes that allow for the approval of small grants to fund work that is needed at short notice [as well as schemes that allow for long-term sustainability and can make a contribution to local communities].
A reduction in bureaucracy is needed to ensure that small projects are not overburdened.
Progress takes time. Peace-building is an evolutionary process, and individual grants need longer time frames to allow projects to make a difference.
It is important to consult the voluntary and community sectors in order to develop local strategies, and local businesses are also influential participants.
Development in rural areas requires greater synergies between rural and regional development funding than has been the case to date.
A database could be created as a learning tool for work on peace and reconciliation at home and abroad, including success stories from projects funded by PEACE I, PEACE II and the International Fund for Ireland. Experience from projects under these programmes should inform other international peace-building work, as part of a two-way process.
PEACE programmes
PEACE programmes benefit a wide range of sectors, areas, groups and communities and encourage cross-community projects. The bulk of PEACE funding is managed by local partners and NGOs, enabling various sections of the community to work together.
The Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation 1995-1999 (PEACE I), allocated €750m to 15,000 projects. Designed with a lot of local community input, it helped legislators to learn how to work with voluntary sector and community partners.
The EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation 2000-2006 (PEACE II), allocated €994m to 7,000 projects. PEACE II placed more emphasis on the economy and economic viability, but some of the "bottom-up" approach was lost, says the rapporteur.
The current PEACE III programme (2007-2013) is expected to provide total funding of about €333m. It stresses reconciliation, and seeks to use the work of Hamber and Kelly.
Since 1989, the EU has also been a key contributor to the International Fund for Ireland, established by the Irish and British governments in 1986. The other contributors are the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
Under PEACE II programme measure 4.1, there was an exchange of experience at project level between areas across Europe and further afield, including Albania, Belarus, Moldova, Serbia, the Ukraine and Bosnia. Text adopted on the Evaluation of the Peace Programme

Violence against the Roma goes beyond Italy, say MEPs
2008-05-22 - 17:48
Recent violence against the Roma in Italy prompted MEPs to put this issue on its agenda for Tuesday and debate it with the Commission. MEPs called on Member States to enforce respect for fundamental rights and to facilitate the inclusion of the Roma in society. European Commission representative Vladimír ŠPIDLA "vehemently condemned the atrocities against the Roma", and asked the authorities of all Member States to "guarantee their security", pointing out that the previous week's events "are not an isolated case". "Racist violence feeds on populism, as we have seen in many Member States", he said, declaring that "it is the very meaning of European Union to overcome racist hatred, pogroms and destruction by fire".
The Commissioner observed that "the EU and Member States must do their utmost to improve the social inclusion of the Roma and also reiterated that Community law guarantees that Romanian citizens "enjoy the same freedoms as those of other countries of the Union, and that the Commission "will ensure that their rights are respected".
Political group speakers
"The situation of the Roma is terrible everywhere in Europe", not just in Italy, said Lívia JÁRÓKA (EPP-ED, HU). "All governments are to blame, of right and left, because they have not succeeded in promoting the integration of the Roma in society", she continued, adding that "this is a question that should not be over-politicised (...) it is important that the Italian government should do its best to combat discrimination and not expel the Roma from Italy".
For Martin SCHULZ (PES, DE), "the left, like the right, shares common values" here, and "one cannot touch the dignity of human beings". He too noted that the problem "arises not only in Italy but also everywhere else in the Union, and this is because we have been unable to integrate our minorities". "We must strive to say that the Roma need action by all European citizens to enable them to integrate (...), and I consider that the Roma cannot be victims of those who want to run a right-wing populist policy", he declared.
"I congratulate the Commission on its very fine speech here, said Viktória MOHÁCSI (ALDE, HU). Returning from a visit to Italy, the MEP said that "during the election campaign, a number of stereotypes were used against the Roma, which made them scapegoats. We are now seeing the result of this campaign". She felt that "the Italian government is hard on the weak and weak with the strong: when there are difficulties, rather than taking on the Camorra, it blames the Roma, instead of tackling the real problems".
"This Parliament is not the place for polemics against such a government. What has happened is hard acts, acts of racism (...). Legislation must give us the solution: the rules must be respected, all the rules. Including those against squatting and forcing children to beg", commented Monica FRASSONI (Greens/EFA, IT).
The European Parliament "would have done better to monitor this harmonised fear which seems to be creeping into all European countries", said Cristiana MUSCARDINI (UEN, IT), adding that "when other countries were shooting at third country nationals, Italy did not allow clandestine migrants to drown in its territorial waters".
"There is a directive (that of 2004) that must apply to all", said Roberto MUSACCHIO (GUE/NGL, IT), adding that "we reiterate this to the current government, whose first acts were scandalous". He noted that "mobility is part of European citizenship" and asked that the Roma be granted the status of a "transnational European minority". He also criticised "those who use fear for electoral ends".
For Gerard BATTEN (IND/DEM, UK), "what is happening is an example of the clash of rivalries", provoked by "putting in place an international state". Whilst criticising "ethnically motivated atrocities", he urged listeners to "think of the realities engendered by the presence of so many immigrants", since "Europe no has no frontiers". He asked that "each country be able to have the immigration policy that it wishes, according to its needs".
Luca ROMAGNOLI (NI, IT) asked whether the "Spanish socialists" knew "how many crimes can be attributed to nomads" in Italy. He also asked the Union to "create a Roma state in the East, where they could govern themselves autonomously".

EU consumer policy strategy - MEPs call for standard contracts and conditions for contracts
2008-05-22 - 17:48
Parliament adopted a report on EU consumer policy strategy (2007-2013) which says that since the greatest obstacles to the development of an internal market in retailing include uncertainties regarding consumer contracts, the report supports the Commission in its efforts to introduce standard contracts and conditions for contracts concluded on-line which would have the same force in all the Member States. The report was adopted with 438 votes in favour, 84 against and 166 abstentions. Group actions and collective redress
MEPs note that in some, but not all, Member States elements of a specific consumer redress system already exist, such as joint actions, group actions, representative actions, test cases and skimming-off procedures; points to the fact that, as a result, consumers may face different legal provisions in cross-border cases in this respect.
MEPs call on the Commission to carefully assess the issue of consumer redress in the Member States, and that in respect of cross-border proceedings and possible systems of collective redress, extensive research should be carried out, drawing on experience around the world, with special regard to the concerns expressed at the excesses and drawbacks of the US model, and dealing clearly with the question of an appropriate legal base for such an instrument at EU level.
Parliament asks the Commission then to present, if appropriate, options for a European framework providing all consumers with effective access to the different redress mechanisms of the Member States for the settlement of cross-border complaints.
The report considers that the needs of consumer protection can be satisfied by legislation only if it is better, simpler and prepared with the involvement of all the competent Commission Directorates-General.
Funding for consumer organisations
The report emphasises the important role played by consumer organisations in improving consumer culture. The House considers strong, independent consumer organisations to be the basis of an effective consumer policy and hence calls on the Commission and the Member States to provide adequate funding for such organisations.
27 national mini-markets
The report calls for measures to ensure that the 27 national mini-markets within the EU will actually be transformed into the largest retail market in the world. The European Parliament takes the view that this requires that citizens feel equally safe shopping via the internet or at the local corner shop, and that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can rely on the same simple rules throughout the internal market. MEPs call on the Commission to consider ways of improving protection for SMEs, in particular by means of the Small Business Act.
European Consumer Ombudsman
The House calls on the Commission to explore the merits of establishing a special European Consumer Ombudsman in the European Ombudsman's office. The report notes that a number of Member States have consumer ombudsmen in several sectors, helping consumers to deal with economic operators; believes this approach could be examined by the Commission on a country-by-country basis.

Soaring food prices: investment in agriculture needed in developing countries
2008-05-22 - 17:48
Priority should be given to investment in agriculture, aquaculture, rural development and agribusinesses in developing countries. Fairer international trade rules and an assessment of the effects of speculation on food prices are also underlined by MEPs in a joint resolution adopted in Strasbourg. On agro-fuels, the Parliament wants production to be linked to strong sustainability criteria and to see second generation bioenergy developed. Right to food
The EP reaffirms the right to food and the need to improve access for all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life. Two billion people still live in dire poverty and 850 million human beings are hungry daily. The resolution was adopted with 485 votes in favour 52 against and 7 abstentions.
The Council should step up its commitments to the Millennium Development Goals by adopting an EU MDG Agenda for Action at the June European Council. The House invites the Commission to analyse the effect of speculation on food prices and to come up with appropriate measures.
Sustainable food production
Analysing the discrepancies between farmgate prices and those charged by the major retailers should be done by Commission and the Member States. An impact assessment of the role of retailers in the food chain, as retail food prices is also called by MEPs.
The current EU cereal stocks would last only 30 days, and questions whether our food stocks are at the right level, says the resolution which calls for better forecasting of agricultural output.
Priority needs to be given to food over fuels and biofuel production should be linked to strong sustainability criteria. The House accepts that EU subsidisation of crops intended for biofuel production is no longer justified, but emphasises that only 2-3% of EU agricultural land is currently being used for this kind of production and media reports blaming biofuels for the current food crisis are exaggerated as far as the EU is concerned.
MEPs call on the Commission and the Member States to do more to promote the use and production of second‑generation bio-energy.
The current crisis demands an immediate and thorough discussion among the EU institutions and the Member States on the role that modern biotechnology can play in ensuring the continued production of food at reasonable prices, says the resolution.
Better development policies
The House calls for an urgent and substantial increase in investment in agriculture, aquaculture, rural development and agribusinesses in developing countries, focused on poor farmers and small‑scale farming. 75% of the world’s poor population lives in rural areas, but that only 4% of official development assistance (ODA) is dedicated to agriculture.
Small farmers in poor countries, who are mainly women, need to have access to land, financial services and credit, high-yield seeds, irrigation systems and fertilisers, says the resolution. MEPs call on the EIB to investigate possibilities for the immediate setting up of a guarantee fund in support of national micro-credit and loan schemes and risk-hedging schemes that operate close to the needs of local food producers.
EU Member States and the international community are asked to meet the extraordinary emergency appeal of the World Food Programme to assist it in facing up to the new challenges in the fight against hunger. Text adopted by the EP (click on 22 May)

Trade in raw materials and commodities- MEPs concerned about supply
2008-05-22 - 17:48
In a report adopted by the European Parliament on trade in raw materials, MEPs express their concern that increasing demand for raw materials on world markets and the trend to restrict free access to raw materials in third countries by trade distorting measures may undermine the EU's competitiveness. MEPs would like to see developing countries benefiting from the extraction of natural resources on their territories. China's increasing demand and its role in Africa is once again pointed out. MEPs underline that access to raw materials and commodities is vital for the EU economy, due to its lack of domestic supply. The House urges the Commission to address the issue of free and fair access to raw material markets in the framework of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), while fully respecting restrictions based on developmental grounds for least developed countries (LDCs).
Concern about the trend to restrict free access to raw materials in third countries by trade distorting measures is underlined. The report asks the Commission to negotiate non-discriminatory access to raw material markets in return for access to energy-saving, renewable and resource-efficient technologies in all bilateral negotiations on free trade agreements.
LDCs and MDGs
The House regrets that many developing countries and in particular LDCs have been locked into the production and export of raw materials and commodities whose volatile prices have been declining over the long term, constituting a serious impediment to the alleviation of poverty as well as the realisation of the MDGs.
Increasing commodity prices have contributed to significant improvements in the external accounts of some developing countries, dependent on primary commodities, also says the report. MEPs support current efforts in developing countries and in particular in LDCs to diversify their economies and develop economic activities at more advanced stages of the production process.
The European Union has already phased out its tariffs on agricultural products from the LDCs (through the Everything But Arms initiative) and from many ACP countries (through Economic Partnership Agreements), according to the European Parliament.
In a report adopted by the European Parliament on trade in raw materials, MEPs express their concern that increasing demand for raw materials on world markets and the trend to restrict free access to raw materials in third countries by trade distorting measures may undermine the EU's competitiveness. MEPs would like to see developing countries benefiting from the extraction of natural resources on their territories. China's increasing demand and its role in Africa is once again pointed out.
MEPs also urge the Commission to use aid-for-trade as a tool for development as well as strengthen existing mechanisms for transfer of technology. Promoting transparency of revenues stemming from raw materials via programmes like the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) process is advocated.
The report calls on the Commission to review its compensatory finance scheme, FLEX, to ensure it is responsive and effective in supporting developing countries and in particular LDCs.
World food crisis
On the food crisis, MEPs are concerned that a growing proportion of the earth's resources are used for livestock raising and reaffirmed the right to food. They acknowledge that speculation plays a significant role in the setting of prices of raw materials and commodities with increased volatility as a consequence.
MEPs recommend that measures are taken on a European and international scale in order to ensure moderate prices as an immediate way out of the food crisis. The House demands increased levels of humanitarian aid to alleviate the food crisis which is threatening the lives of 100 million persons.
The House rejected a call for a moratorium on agrofuels. On Thursday, Parliament voted on a resolution on rising food prices in the EU and in developing countries.
China
Lastly, the House points out that the new trading policy of some emerging countries, especially China, searching for raw materials worldwide, in particular in Africa, is having a major and negative impact on the European Union's access to commodities in this continent, because of an approach based on one-to-one relations between states and neglecting references to human rights, corporate social responsibility and environmental and social standards.

"Transform priorities and time-lines into reform plans," say MEPs to Turkey
2008-05-22 - 17:48
In its latest progress report on Turkey, adopted by a large majority of 467 for, 62 against and 61 abstentions, the European Parliament welcomes recent legislative activities in the country, while insisting that the speed of reforms must pick up. The own-initiative report, drawn up by Ria Oomen-Ruijten (EPP-ED, NL), "welcomes the commitment of Prime Minister Erdogan that 2008 is going to be the year of reforms" and "urges the Turkish government to fulfil its promises" by implementing them. While the Parliament stresses that "modernisation is first and foremost in Turkey's own interest," it also notes that "further delays will seriously affect the pace of negotiations."
The role of the judiciary and the military in modern Turkey
The House is "concerned about the implications of the AK Party closure case," and "expects the Turkish Constitutional Court to respect principles of the rule of law, European standards and the Venice Commission guidelines on the prohibition of political parties," asking the Turkish parliament to bring the constitution into line with these standards.
The report also considers the recently adopted changes to Article 301 of the Penal Code to be a "first step towards a fundamental reform of that article as well as other articles of the Penal Code, and looks forward to further moves in this respect." The Parliament adds that in its view "the repeal of Article 301 and other legal provisions representing an illegitimate restriction on freedom of expression as guaranteed by international law would be the best solution."
The report "welcomes the fact that in 2007 democracy prevailed over attempts by the military to interfere in the political process," and encourages the government to "make further systematic efforts to ensure that the democratically elected political leadership bears full responsibility for formulation of domestic, foreign and security policy" and that "the armed forces fully respect this responsibility by fully and unambiguously acknowledging civilian control."
The Kurdish question
Parliament urges the Turkish government to launch "a political initiative favouring a lasting settlement of the Kurdish issue," including a "comprehensive master plan to boost the socio-economic and cultural development of the south-east of Turkey." It also calls for "real possibilities to learn Kurdish within the public and private schooling system" and its use in broadcasting, public life and public services. While considering that a possible ban of the DTP would be "counterproductive to a political solution," and deploring the "many court cases brought against elected mayors and other politicians for using the Kurdish language," as well as the recent conviction of Leyla Zana, the report "calls upon the DTP party, its members of parliament and mayors to distance themselves clearly from the PKK," and calls on the PKK to declare and respect an immediate ceasefire. At the same time, MEPs also urged Turkey "not to engage in any disproportionate military operations violating Iraq's territory."
Gender issues
In light of the drafting of a new constitution, the report stresses that it should "ensure gender equality, avoid the use of vague criteria such as general morality, refrain from perceiving women primarily as family or community members and reaffirm women's human rights as their individual rights." It also notes "the disappointment and concern of part of the population that the lifting of the ban on wearing headscarves in universities was not part of a broader package of reform based on a wide ranging consultation of civil society."
Current affairs
Finally, MEPs expressed their concern about "the excessive use of force by Turkish police against demonstrators at this year's May Day parade in Istanbul." During the debate held on Wednesday morning, speakers of political groups from all over the political spectrum defended Joost Lagendijk (Greens/EFA, NL), the Chair of the EP Delegation for relations with Turkey, who has come under attack from Turkish opposition party CHP in the past few weeks.
Debate preceding the vote
In the debate on Wednesday morning, rapporteur Ria Oomen-Ruijten (EPP-ED, NL) said: "Since the last report, we have seen some very positive developments in Turkey (the Law on Foundations, some reform of Article 301). We have a mixed picture, and a lot more needs to be done in order for Turkey to keep its promises to the EU and to its own people." Noting that 2008 was supposed to be the year of reforms, she added that "a new constitution is the only way the government can ensure separation of state and religion, and all civil society representatives need to be involved in this process." Vittorio Agnoletto (EUL/NGL, IT) announced that his group would be abstaining during the vote on the report, as "it does not deal adequately with the Kurdish issue."
Rapporteur (Oomen-Ruijten) said that since the last report, we have seen some very positive developments in Turkey (Law on Foundations, some reform of Article 301). We have a mixed picture, a lot more needs to be done, in order for Turkey to keep their promises to the EU and to their own people. This is a balanced report, but three main messages: we are concerned with regard to the case against the AKP party, hopefully the constitutional court will follow international law on this issue. We welcome the fact that in 2007 the country stood up to the military. 2008 was supposed to be the year of reforms. We want to ensure that Turkey remains a lay state. Separation between church and state is creating friction in Turkish society. Nearly 50% of citizens are concerned about the state of the secular state. A new constitution is the only way the government can ensure separation of state and religion, and all civil society representatives need to be involved in this process.

Chinese earthquake - MEPs express solidarity and welcome rapid response
2008-05-22 - 17:48
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the recent earthquake that hit China, killing tens of thousands of people, expressing its "sincere condolences and solidarity to the people of China and to the numerous victims." MEPs welcome the "prompt response to the disaster by the Chinese authorities by means of their emergency operation," and note "with appreciation China's readiness to accept foreign assistance." MEPs also welcome "the fact that the Chinese and foreign media are being allowed to provide detailed and accurate information on the disaster." The resolution was adopted with 525 votes in favour, 4 against and 4 abstentions.
Members urge the Council and Commission to provide emergency aid, technical assistance and reconstruction aid through the ECHO programme, and support the contribution which the EU Member States are making through the 'Civil Protection Mechanism', coordinated by the Commission." The House "underlines the importance of good governance in preventing and preparing for possible natural disasters," and "calls for development of the technology for a comprehensive and effective early warning system to prepare populations to cope with earthquakes and other natural disasters."
In the debate, all political groups expressed their sympathies and condolences, calling on the Commission to help with all means possible to ease the humanitarian disaster. Commissioner Louis Michel noted that the EU has contributed over €10 million already, including €2 million for supplies such as tents and blankets which the Chinese authorities have requested.

European Parliament calls for a political solution in Lebanese crisis
2008-05-22 - 17:48
In the aftermath of the recent wave of violent clashes in Beirut, and the recent agreement on power-sharing in Doha, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on Lebanon. The House welcomes the Doha agreement, and calls on all forces in the country to respect the Lebanese army and disarm. The resolution notes that "the security of the country and of all Lebanese people is dependent on the disarmament of all armed groups, especially Hezbollah." The Parliament's resolution, adopted by 520 votes in favour, 6 against and 13 abstentions, "welcomes the Doha Agreement reached by the parties on the election of General Sleiman as President of the Republic in the coming days, the creation of a new National Unity government and the adoption of the electoral law." The House "invites all the parties involved to support the Lebanese army so that it can guarantee fully the functioning, security, law and order, sovereignty and stability of Lebanon," noting that "the security of the country and of all Lebanese people is dependent on the disarmament of all armed groups, especially Hezbollah."
The House reiterates its support for the UN forces in the country (UNIFIL), the international tribunal to try those who assassinated former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, and Commission and Council efforts to support reconstruction in Lebanon. The resolution also calls on Syria to "refrain from all interference that can have a negative impact on Lebanese internal affairs and to play a constructive role in seeking to establish stability in the country."
EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering made a declaration at the beginning of the voting session, saying: "It is with great relief as well as hopeful and sustained encouragements that we very warmly welcome, as the European Parliament is about to adopt a resolution on the matter, the solid and comprehensive agreement reached by the Lebanese political leaders in Doha. Stressing the positive reactions expressed by neighbouring states and other countries concerned, the European Parliament calls on all the parties to fully implement the agreement. We reiterate our unfading support to the legitimate and constitutional Lebanese political institutions and to the Lebanese army, as well as to their efforts in ensuring Lebanon's stability, sovereignty and territorial integrity."

Ensuring pan-European coverage for mobile satellite services
2008-05-22 - 17:48
Rules providing for systems providing mobile satellite services - such as broadband internet or mobile TV - to be selected at EU level in the future were backed by the European Parliament. MEPs approved a first-reading compromise, negotiated with Council beforehand, which aims to improve accessibility, speed, and quality of electronic communications services especially in rural areas. The report was adopted by 652 votes in favour with 16 votes against and 10 abstentions.
Mobile satellite systems can offer a wide range of pan-European telecommunications and broadcasting services - from high-speed internet through mobile TV to emergency communications. The decision as adopted by Parliament lays down Community procedures for the selection of operators providing mobile satellite services as well as provisions for a coordinated authorisation by national authorities.
The aim is "to facilitate the development of a competitive internal market for mobile satellite services across the Community and to ensure gradual coverage in all Member States", says the text.
Services have to reach at least half of the EU's population in the future
The text of the decision says that no more than 15 MHz for Earth to space and 15 MHz for space to Earth can be assigned to one applicant.
"MEPs and ministers from Member States on the periphery of the EU were very concerned that the selection criteria might favour operators who could only provide a service covering the centre of Europe", said the rapporteur Fiona Hall (ALDE, North East, Liberal Democrat, UK) during the plenary debate in Strasbourg. She stressed that the text on which Parliament, Council and Commission agreed offered "a realistic compromise given the technical and economic constraints that the industry is under".
The new legislation obliges a system operator to cover at least 60% of the EU's overall land area from the time the system starts operating. After 7 years at the latest the mobile satellite service must be provided within all Member States covering at least 50% of their population and 60% of each Member States land area.
Selection should emphasise pan-European coverage
If the demand exceeds the amount of radio spectrum available, the European Commission will select operators following certain criteria. Strong emphasis will be put on pan-European geographic coverage (with 40% weighting). Consumer and competitive benefits, spectrum efficiency and public policy objectives like protection of health, safety and security shall each account for 20% of the eligibility.
Background
The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) has designated the 2 GHz radio frequency band for use by mobile satellite systems. The radio spectrum from 1980 to 2010 MHz is used for Earth to space (upstream) communications and the spectrum from 2170 to 2200 MHz for space to Earth (downstream) communications. Member States, who own the radio spectrum, have agreed to give up their national rights on spectrum allocation to make these frequency bands available for a common European approach.

Promote sustainable industries but avoid unemployment and carbon leakage, say MEPs
2008-05-22 - 17:48
The EU's climate change and renewable energy goals should be seen as a chance for EU industries to become world leaders in sustainable technologies, says an own-initiative report on industrial policy proposed adopted by the European Parliament. Yet, a relocation of European industries to countries with less strict environmental policies should be avoided as well, stress MEPs. The report was adopted with 443 votes in favour, 62 against and 21 abstentions. "The EU's environmental goals should not be seen as a threat to industry", says the own-initiative report drafted by Romana JORDAN CIZELJ (EPP-ED, SI). Rather the EU's renewable energy and climate change objectives should be regarded "as an opportunity to gain a first mover advantage and make industry in the EU a world leader in environmentally friendly and socially acceptable technologies, products and services", stress MEPs.
Avoid relocation of European industries, unemployment and 'carbon leakage'
They underline that the Commission's Action Plan for sustainable industrial policy, which it plans to put forward on 14 May, should facilitate the gradual transition towards a low carbon and energy- and resource-efficient industry (amendment 5). At the same time, the European Parliament stresses that unemployment and 'carbon leakage' should be avoided i.e. the EU's strict climate policy goals should not prompt companies to relocate their production to countries with a less strict climate policy which would lead to increased CO2 emissions by these countries and to higher unemployment in the EU. Thus, MEPs urge the Commission to set up global sectoral agreements which reduce the environmental impact of specific industries worldwide
As "the EU is completely dependent on imports of several metals", MEPs ask the Commission to propose integrated measures on how to guarantee sustainable access to raw materials.
Introduce a European patent and combat counterfeiting
Moreover, MEPs call for a transparent, simplified intellectual property rights policy "that is actually enforced". Hence, the Council should introduce as soon as possible a European patent while the Commission should keep on combating counterfeiting by seeking global solutions in this area.
Cut red tape and remove tax obstacles for SMEs
The House also calls on the Commission to "properly apply the so-called 'think small first' principle" in all EU policies. Therefore, MEPs "strongly support" the Small Business Act which the Commission plans to present on 2 July. This Small Business Act should be a legislative proposal which includes "new, concrete initiatives" to cut the red tape for SMEs. The proposal should also guarantee that SMEs have access to financial resources and to research infrastructure, say MEPs.
The report also stresses that an EU-wide market for venture capital should urgently be established "by removing existing regulatory and tax obstacles to venture capital investments in Europe's most innovative small firms". Text adopted by the EP (click on 22 May)

Visa policy
The European Parliament calls on the US to end discrimination between EU citizens on visas
2008-05-22 - 17:48
MEPs call for Member States involved in bilateral talks with the US on visas to respect EU law and for the US to end discrimination among Member States in a resolution adopted today. They also recall that the EU could temporarily restore a visa requirement for US citizens if reciprocity is not reached. Members adopted a resolution by 511 votes in favour, 29 against and 7 abstentions. MEPs take note of the bilateral talks going on between the US and several Member States (Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) on participation in the American "Visa Waiver" programme, which could allow their citizens to travel to the US without a visa. They recall that the EU Council is responsible for establishing rules on this matter and that it has exempted US citizens from a visa requirement, while the US still maintains it for nationals of some member states. MEPs also adopted an amendment asking the Commission to ensure, in its negotiations with the US, that HIV positive travellers would also benefit from the Visa Waiver program, from which they are excluded.
MEPs therefore consider that any form of discrimination between European citizens should be forbidden, even outside the EU and call on the US authorities to observe the principle of reciprocity and to ensure the same rights for citizens of all Member States. Otherwise, MEPs warned, the Council would be allowed to restore temporarily a visa requirement for third country citizens.
Concerns about data protection
MEPs say that several elements of the upcoming agreements could fall under Community and EU competence, notably the treatment of PNR data or Schengen crime-related data. They recall that access for the US to EU databases should be fully agreed by the EU.
On April 18 2008, the Council agreed on the one hand on a "twin track" approach, giving a mandate to the Commission to negotiate on all community-related issues, and on the other hand adopting "red lines" that the member states must respect in their dialogue with the US,.
Members support the Commission in its negotiations and the “red lines” defined by the Council to be respected by member states. They urge the EC and the US to conclude negotiations before June 2009. Text adopted by the EP (click on 22 May)

Animal health strategy - cloning for economic purposes should be banned say MEPs
2008-05-22 - 17:48
MEPs support the objectives of the Commission's Animal Health Strategy for the EU, but call for more ambition and stress that such objectives can only be achieved with a sufficient and clearly defined budget. MEPs strongly support vaccination, which according to them should be recognised as one of the more important methods to prevent diseases. The European Parliament strongly believes that the cloning of animals for economic purposes should be banned. The report by Janusz WOJCIECHOWSKI (UEN, PL) welcomes the strategy, which will reinforce the EU's "protection mechanisms and preparedness in the face of the onset of new epizootic diseases", such as the H5N1 virus of avian flu, foot-and-mouth and the blue tongue virus which have devastated herds in the UK and other parts of the EU and have had an important impact on meat consumption and citizen's trust towards the farming sector.
The strategy aims to strengthen public health protection and food safety, reduce the occurrence of animal diseases, support economic growth by favouring the freedom of circulation of animals and animal products, and promote animal welfare and environment protection.
Although these aims are supported, the report on behalf of the Agricultural Committee highlights a number of issues where the Commission's strategy "fails to pay sufficient attention".
Financing the strategy
The report calls for the Commission to clarify the role of the EU, Member States and the agricultural sector in financing the animal health measures, for example, ensuring biological security on farms, vaccination programmes, scientific research and higher animal welfare standards.
Mr Wojciechowski draws attention to the fact that the common animal health policy is one of the most integrated EU policies and states that "most of its funding should be covered by the Community budget, which should not preclude the financial responsibility of the Member States and farmers".
Use of vaccinations as part of disease eradication operations
Parliament strongly supports action to increase the use of emergency vaccinations as part of disease eradication operations, to introduce income guarantees for owners of vaccinated animals "since they may face problems selling products from vaccinated animals", and to expand "EU vaccination banks".
The report states that measures should be applied to "reduce the number of healthy animals slaughtered and disposed of, such as tests to prove that animals are free from pathogens", and that it is essential to ensure the availability of "humane means of carrying out any necessary culling of animals that will spare them unnecessary suffering".
To ensure the "indiscriminate circulation of products derived from vaccinated animals", the report calls on the Commission and Member States "for a ban on consumer labelling of products derived from vaccinated animals" and to use "effective public communication strategies regarding the harmlessness of products derived from vaccinated animals".
The report supports the development of vaccination strategies for all relevant species and diseases, and recalls Parliament's amendments to the 2008 EU Budget to increase appropriations for the development of vaccines and testing methods.
Prevention of risks
Parliament notes that compensation funds for animal owners based on a reserve system strengthen individual and shared responsibility with detecting and eradicating disease, and believes that the compensation system should be combined with risk-prevention incentives for farmers and the possibility of covering indirect losses from disease-eradication measures through national insurance instruments.
The report points out that "high stocking densities in intensive farming systems may increase the risk of disease spread and hamper disease control" and that "the same could happen in other farming systems if disease control measures are not well implemented". MEPs also stress the importance of distance between farms and transporting animals in controlling epidemic diseases . They call for tightening EU animal transport rules (including, the introduction of GPS tracking for lorries) or: they propose a 9-hour ceiling on animal transport times.
Furthermore, members call for precaution when reintroducing animal proteins into animal feed and efficient control mechanisms in order to avoid avoidance cross-contamination of animal proteins from different species in farm animal feed and cannibalism.
International aspects
MEPs urge the EU to defend its high animal health and welfare standards at an international level within the WTO and to possibly become a member of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) to "increase animal health and welfare standards globally".
Committee members are concerned that European products could be undermined by imports from third countries where the farmers do not face the same obligations with regards to animal health and welfare. For example, the delay in taking measures to ensure that imports of Brazilian beef came only from cattle that were free of foot-and-mouth disease at the end of 2007 undermined "public confidence in the EU animal health regime."
As the EU is the world's largest importer of food and animal products, the report considers that, "in view of the risk of infection-carrying or diseased animals being brought into the EU, veterinary and sanitary checks at EU borders need to particularly thorough and stringent", including ascertaining whether animals have been reared in accordance with EU animal welfare standards instead of only checking documents.
The committee stresses the importance of animal health inspections within third countries and asks for an increase in the financial resources of the Commission's Food and Veterinary Office.
What is next
This own initiative report will be followed by Commission legislative proposals to be adopted under co-decision. A Commission Action Plan with detailed timetable is expected for the summer (July or September). Text adopted by the EP (click on 22 May)

MEPs adopt written declaration on rheumatic diseases
2008-05-22 - 17:48
EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering announced that the written declaration on rheumatic diseases had been adopted. The declaration calls on the Commission and Council to attach more importance to rheumatic diseases in the new Community strategy on health, given their high social and economic costs. More than half of all MEPs (400 out of 785) have now signed the declaration meaning it becomes an official position of the European Parliament. The declaration put forward by Edite ESTRELA (PES, PT) Adamos ADAMOU (GUE/NGL, CY), Dorette CORBEY (PES, NL), encourages Member States to establish and promote the implementation of national plans to fight rheumatic diseases. Parliament wants the Commission and Council to develop a Community strategy on rheumatic diseases and draw up a Council recommendation on the early diagnosis and treatment of rheumatic diseases and to develop a strategy to improve access to information and medical treatment.
MEPs point out that rheumatic diseases are chronic complaints which cause pain, suffering and disability and that 30% to 40% of people have musculoskeletal symptoms, and whereas such symptoms affect over 100 million people in Europe.
Parliament says that rheumatic diseases represent the main cause of disability and premature retirement among workers and it is estimated that people over 65 will account for up to one-quarter of the European population by 2030, and whereas a majority of people over 70 present chronic or recurrent rheumatic symptoms. Finally, the House points out that the adoption of social and health policies based on an analysis of the needs of those with rheumatic diseases would reduce the economic and social costs associated with these diseases (1 to 1.5% of GNI in developed countries).

Parliament calls for a global ban on depleted uranium weapons
2008-05-22 - 17:48
In a resolution adopted on depleted uranium (DU) weapons, the House calls for a moratorium on their use, increased pressure for an international treaty to ban them, and more research on these weapons. The resolution "strongly reiterates its call on all EU Member States and NATO countries to impose a moratorium on the use of depleted uranium weapons and to redouble efforts towards a global ban." The resolution was adopted with 491 votes in favour, 18 against and 12 abstentions. Depleted uranium is used in ammunition, to increase the strength of casings for penetrating armour. Upon impact, however, the depleted uranium can be dispersed in the form of DU dust, which can cover large areas of conflict zones, and have averse health effects both for soldiers and civilians, even long after the conflict is over.
The Parliament addressed an oral question to both the Commission and the Council on the subject. Annemie Neyts (ALDE, BE), one of the question's authors, asked "what specific measures can be taken to halt exposure to such DU for both soldiers and civilians?" Another author, Ana Gomes (PES, PT) noted that "the most basic cautionary principle should get us to stop manufacturing such weapons."
The Council presidency replied that since no consensus exists on this topic in the Council, there's not much it can do at this juncture. Commissioner Louis Michel noted that military issues of this nature lie outside the competence of the European Commission, but expressed his willingness to conduct a study to re-examine the effects of DU exposure on human health. He also noted that the Commission does fund efforts such as projects to remove unexploded ordinance out of post-conflict zones, citing the example of Lebanon, where 5 million euros of EU funds have been spent for this purpose.
The joint resolution adopted by Parliament "urges the Member States to adhere to paragraph 1 of the UN resolution adopted on 5 December 2007 and to submit a report with their views on the effects of the use of armaments and ammunition containing depleted uranium." It also calls on the Member States and the Council to take the lead in working towards an international treaty--through the UN or through a 'coalition of the willing'--to establish a ban on the development, production, stockpiling, transfer, testing and use of uranium weapons as well as the destruction or recycling of existing stocks, should there be conclusive scientific evidence of harm caused by such weapons."
The resolution "strongly reiterates its call on all EU Member States and NATO countries to impose a moratorium on the use of depleted uranium weapons and to redouble efforts towards a global ban." It also urges Member States "not to use depleted uranium weapons in ESDP operations and not to deploy military and civilian personnel in regions where no guarantee can be given to the effect that depleted uranium has not been, or will not be, used."

Development and cooperation
Follow-up to the 2005 Paris Declaration on aid effectiveness
2008-05-22 - 17:48
Simplifying aid procedures and phasing out economic policy conditionality are among the demands of the European Parliament in a report on aid effectiveness to developing countries. To be more efficient, aid should also be disbursed according to partners´ own priorities and timetables, says the report adopted with 443 votes in favour, 8 against and 11 abstentions. The report also underlines the necessary fight against corruption. The Paris Declaration, endorsed on 2 March 2005, is an international agreement to which over one hundred Ministers, Heads of Agencies and other Senior Officials adhered and committed their countries and organisations to continue to increase efforts in harmonisation, alignment and managing aid for results with a set of monitorable actions and indicators.
The 'international aid effectiveness agenda' established by the Paris Declaration in 2005 aims to ensure that the ultimate objective of the aid system as a whole, namely the fight against poverty, is being met.
With this in mind, the report drafted by Johan VAN HECKE (ALDE, BE) calls on the Commission to set up two new instruments: an indicator to monitor parliamentary scrutiny in the countries receiving development aid which will increase accountability and permit more strategic forms of oversight, and a revision of the Donor Atlas initiative to promote cross-country policy dialogue between European donors and tackle the problem of orphan countries and sectors.
MEPs call for the simplification of aid procedures and "considers that increasing transparency of information on aid flows is a critical objective for improving the effective use of aid and mutual accountability".
In recognition of the role of corruption in obstructing the effectiveness of aid, the report calls on the Commission to "ensure greater accountability as well as transparency of countries' public financial management systems" and to take practical measures to fight corruption, for example, by supporting civil society initiatives.
Member States and the Commission are urged to "phase out policy-oriented conditionality" to support a common understanding on key priorities, and the report stresses the need for the international financial institutions and donor countries to publish the conditions for granting development aid, "so that genuine democratic control can be exercised by parliaments, local authorities and civil societies".
The report also stresses the need to disburse aid according to the partners' priorities and timelines, and supports the Commission's choice to increasingly use budget support, enabling national parliaments, local authorities, civil society and the EP to trace the results of the EU contributions.
Finally, the role of women and diasporas are highlighted in the report, as there is a disproportionate impact of poverty on women and the involvement of people of foreign origin in a partnership between the EU and their country of origin "is a powerful factor of integration".
UK and Ireland
In 2007 Ireland reached its highest ever level for development aid with 0.54% of GNP, an increase of 6.7% on its 2006 figures. Within the European Union, only Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands and Luxembourg allocate a greater percentage of GNP to overseas development assistance than Ireland.
The UK is among the eleven EU Member States to reduce its development contributions, resulting in the percentage spent on development aid across the EU falling from 0.41% of GNP in 2006 to 0.38% in 2007. The EU Member States have spent less on development aid than they had promised, with 1.8 billion euros missing. Text adopted by the EP (click on 22 May)

Human Rights: Sudan, Belarus and Burundi
2008-05-22 - 17:48
As usual Parliament adopted three human rights resolutions at the end of its Strasbourg plenary session on Thursday. In these resolutions, MEPs condemn Sudan for failing to cooperate with the International Criminal Court, call for Belarus to release political prisoners and end intimidation of the opposition, and urge all sides in Burundi to respect the ceasefire agreement. Sudan’s persistent failure to cooperate with the ICC condemned
MEPs urge the authorities in Khartoum to surrender "without further delay" Ahmad Harun and Ali Kushayb, currently subject to arrest warrants of the International Criminal Court for war crimes and crimes against humanity. They condemn Sudan’s failure to cooperate with the ICC. The European Council meeting June is asked to adopt "targeted EU punitive measures" against some Sudanese officials.
In April 2007 the ICC issued an arrest warrant against Sudan’s former Minister of the Interior Ahmad Harun and former Janjaweed militia leader Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman, also known as ‘Ali Kushayb’, on 51 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Ahmad Harun is now the Minister for Humanitarian Affairs and Ali Kushayb – who was in Sudanese custody on other charges at the time the warrants were issued – was released from jail in October 2007, says the resolution.
MEPs urge the authorities in Khartoum to arrest and surrender the two ICC suspects without further delay. They urge the Sudanese Government to ratify the Statute of the ICC and to cooperate unconditionally with the International Criminal Court.
The ICC’s Chief Prosecutor, Luis Moreno Ocampo, will report on 5 June 2008 for the seventh time to the UN Security Council on the progress of its investigations in Darfur.
The European Council of 19-20 June is asked to adopt targeted EU punitive measures against a clearly identified group of Sudanese officials. These sanctions would include freezing and seizing assets and measures denying access to EU banks for any financial transaction or payment.
EU Member States and the European Commission are asked to ensure that their development aid to Sudan is not delivered via Ahmad Harun’s Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs.
MEPs call on the EU to exert pressure on China to join the international efforts to end the conflict. China is also asked to use "its considerable leverage" on the Government of Sudan as the main provider of income for the Government of Sudan from oil sales. China should stop delivering weapons to Sudan.

Call for Belarus to release political prisoners and end intimidation of the opposition
MEPs urge the Belarusian authorities to release political prisoner Aliaksandr Kazulin and to stop using intimidation and politically motivated prosecutions against activists of the democratic opposition and civil society. The House expresses solidarity with the democratic opposition of Belarus in a resolution adopted this Thursday.
The House condemns the sentences given to Syarhei Parsyukevich and Andrei Kim on 22 and 23 April 2008 in Minsk for their participation in the entrepreneurs' demonstrations of 10 January 2008. They also deplore the reportedly excessive force used by Belarusian security forces against and the arrests of peaceful citizens gathered in Minsk on 25 March 2008 to mark the ninetieth anniversary of the Foundation of the Independent Belarusian People's Republic.
MEPs urge the Belarusian authorities to release immediately and unconditionally the remaining political prisoner, Aliaksandr Kazulin, and to stop using intimidation, harassment, targeted arrests and politically motivated prosecutions against activists of the democratic opposition and civil society in Belarus.
On 21 November 2006 the European Union declared its readiness to renew its relationship with Belarus and its people within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy as soon as the Belarusian Government demonstrates respect for democratic values and for the basic rights of the Belarusian people, recalls the resolution.
Belarus is the only country in Europe which still has the death penalty.
Upcoming parliamentary elections
The House urges the Belarusian authorities fully to implement OSCE (Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe) standards in the organisation of the parliamentary elections scheduled for autumn 2008.

Burundi: parties asked to respect ceasefire agreement
MEPs call on all parties to respect the ceasefire agreement concluded on 7 September 2006 after 14 years of civil war. Since 17 April 2008 fighting has again erupted between government troops and the rebel National Liberation Front in Burundi, forcing thousands of civilians to flee their homes and resulting in the deaths of 50 rebel fighters.
MEPs call on all parties to respect the ceasefire agreement concluded on 7 September 2006, resume negotiations. Negotiations between the government and the National Liberation Front (FNL) broke down in July 2007 when the FNL walked out of the Joint Verification and Monitoring Mechanism created to oversee implementation of the ceasefire accord signed in September 2006.
The House urges the FNL, and its leader Agathon Rwasa, to engage constructively in the peace process.
The latest bout of fighting is part of a series of clashes which have left 35 000 people displaced, bringing the total number of internally displaced persons to over 100 000. The critical humanitarian and socio-economic situation endangers regional stability , according to the resolution.
MEPs call on the neighbouring states to ensure they do not serve as bases for the rebel movement, and welcomes Tanzania’s decision to cease acting as a haven for FNL leaders. Tanzania wants to return its Burundian refugees to Burundi, while Burundi is still taking in thousands of Rwandan and Congolese refugees.
The Commission should give priority support to programmes for better governance and democratic state management; health policies, through the creation of health centres and the essential renewal of the hospital network; free primary education and renewing the country’s infrastructure, say MEPs.
Peace and reconciliation commission
The House calls for the establishment of a peace and reconciliation commission to help restore a climate of confidence and stability. Governments of the EU Member States should support such an initiative financially and logistically.
The resolution was adopted with 75 votes in favour, none against and no abstentions. Resolutions adopted (click on 22 May)
