City of Justice - The Hague
Next week the Parliament will vote on a report about Europol, the European Police Office, which has its seat in The Hague – a city that stands like no other for the rule of law and cooperation in justice, also hosting the International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and Eurojust. The EU’s current programme in the Area of Freedom, Justice and Security was also agreed in The Hague in 2004.
As the EP gets ready to debate Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra's (EPP-ED) report on Europol in Plenary on Monday, our "Cities of Europe" series focuses on The Hague. Check out our previous stories on Berlin and Lisbon via the links below .
The Hague and the EU’s Area of Freedom, Justice and Security
Heads of government agreed in 1992 at the Maastricht Summit to set up a joint European Police Office. Europol started operations in January 1994 as the Europol Drugs Unit and by January 2002, its mandate had extended to all serious international crime.
In November 2004, EU Member States adopted the Hague Programme for EU action on terrorism, criminal justice, security, and the fight against organised crime, which also foresees joint action on fundamental rights and citizenship, migration and visa policies and asylum law. This is a follow up to the 1999 Tampere programme, which was responsible for the setting up of Eurojust in The Hague in 2002. Eurojust aims to help the fight against serious crime by facilitating cooperation and exchange between investigators and prosecutors.
A long history in international law
The Hague has a long history developing laws governing relations between states and private international law through the Hague Conventions:
The Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 deal with the laws of warfare and conflict resolution and underpin international law.
The Hague Conference on Private International Law is an international organisation with more than 60 member states, which develops international conventions on family law, child protection, property, litigation and international financial and commercial law.
The International Court of Justice , the only United Nations organ not based in New York. It aims to settle legal disputes submitted to it by UN Member States, on the basis of international law, and to give advisory opinions to UN organs and agencies.
More recent developments
More recently The Hague has been prominent in international law on crimes against humanity and war crimes:
It hosts the International Criminal Court, set up in 2002. The EP strongly supported the setting up of the Court.
The ad hoc International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia , which tried Slobodan Milošević, amongst others, for crimes against humanity, is based there.
More about the city
Th e Hague is the third largest city in the Netherlands after Amsterdam and Rotterdam. Amsterdam is the capital of the country, but the government and the two houses of Parliament, as well as the Supreme Court are based in The Hague.
In the 17th century it became the administrative centre of Holland. But it was only under French occupation in 1806 that The Hague was formally given city rights, preparing for a considerable expansion of the city in the second half of the 19th century and in the 20th century.
