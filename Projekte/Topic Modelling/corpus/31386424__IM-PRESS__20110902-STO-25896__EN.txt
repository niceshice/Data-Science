Volunteer! Make a difference Some research suggests helping others is one of the keys to happiness. This week the European Parliament will welcome more than 1500 young volunteers from across Europe to celebrate their work, reach out to non-volunteers and - who knows - maybe promote happiness.
Millions of Europeans work in their communities during their free time without being paid – in schools, hospitals, and sports clubs, protecting the environment, providing social services and helping people in other countries. However 75% of the population do not do any volunteering.
EP Vice-President Gianni Pittella, is one of the MEPs behind the event. "People decide to volunteer for many reasons: helping building a community, understanding what it is to give time, take the initiative to build a project and last but not least also spending time together," he said. "Volunteering is also an important way to value human commitment to achieving big results."
"I have been strongly in favour of this event being hosted in the EP as it is an excellent chance for the European Parliament to give a strong impetus to the European Year on Volunteering and allows Members to engage directly with young volunteers in a political discussion on their vision on Europe and volunteering," Mr Pittella said.
MEP Katarína Neveďalová is Vice-President of the European Youth Forum. "Volunteering gives the opportunity to meet new people, get a lot of experiences and change things," she said. "Young people should volunteer because it opens new horizons for them. So when, if not now ? I still believe that one person can change the world and this person is for sure a volunteer. Volunteers are sharing their free time with others and changing things for the better. They deserve our big thanks."
The press conference will be streamed live and we will have a slideshow Friday featuring some of the volunteers and their experiences.
