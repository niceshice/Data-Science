Delegations
2005-11-09 - 10:33
A delegation of four members of the European Parliament will travel to Egypt today to witness the first phase of parliamentary elections to be held there on 9 November. Parliament's delegation is led by Edward McMillan-Scott (EPP-ED, UK) and includes Joost Lagendijk (Greens/EFA, NL), Francesco Speroni (IND/DEM, IT) and Jana Hybaskova (EPP-ED, CZ). The elections will take place in three phases - the first one on 9 November and the last in early December
This is the first time that the European Parliament is sending a delegation to witness elections without being invited. There will be no other international delegations present in Egypt, as the Egyptian government has refused any international observation of the elections.
Mr McMillan-Scott said he wanted " this procedure to apply in all sensitive or significant elections throughout the countries coming under the Neighbourhood Policy ". The EU Neighbourhood Policy is designed to enhance existing partnership relations with neighbouring countries and move towards a significant degree of integration. It provides additional support, including financial and technical support.
