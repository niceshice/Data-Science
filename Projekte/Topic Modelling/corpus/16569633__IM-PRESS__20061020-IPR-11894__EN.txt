Development and cooperation
2006-10-26 - 17:50
In adopting a resolution on EU-South Africa relations, MEPs welcome the Commission's approach which is to take steps towards an EU-South-Africa Strategic Partnership and to propose a coherent long-term framework for cooperation.
The House emphasises that this Strategic Partnership should provide a single framework under which the existing cooperation instruments can improve performance in the interests of the South African population and economy. MEPs also emphasises that the Strategic Partnership should be complementary to the EU-Africa Strategy and incorporate existing strands of work on the Development Cooperation Instrument, Economic Partnership Agreements(EPAs) and other ongoing negotiations.
Parliament stresses that the Action Plan should have poverty alleviation as its overriding objective, in line with the Cotonou Agreement and with a view to achieving the MDGs, and takes into account the effect of the Strategic Partnership on the countries of the region and on the EPA negotiations.
The House also stresses that tackling the HIV/AIDS crisis, with a balanced approach between prevention (with an emphasis on sexual and reproductive health), treatment and cure, must remain a political priority for the South African Government. MEPs welcome the Government's decision in favour of a programme to deliver anti-retroviral drugs, but nonetheless insists that its implementation be urgently improved.
