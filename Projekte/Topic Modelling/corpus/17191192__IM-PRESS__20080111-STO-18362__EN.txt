By 2010, 6 of the EU's biggest airports will be at capacity
MEPs began the new year by discussing plans to establish common rules on charges at Europe's airports. EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering opened the session by saying the environment and climate change along with safeguarding Europe's competitiveness and jobs would be key areas for the Parliament this year.
Mr Pöttering welcomed Malta and Cyprus into the eurozone and said the swift ratification of the Lisbon Treaty by all EU members is the "main priority" for 2008.
The opening phase of proceedings also provided a reminder of the case of Chinese dissident and Sakharov Prize nominee, Hu Jia, arrested recently by the Chinese authorities for "inciting subversion" in a move strongly condemned by President Pöttering. Irish MEP Avril Doyle (EPP-ED) took the floor to urge the Chinese "not to ignore the commitment they have made to the international community to improve the human rights situation".
Airport charges
Monday focused on a legislative report on airport charges by German Socialist Ulrich Stockmann. It sets out common principles for levying airport charges at Community airports. The directive aims to prevent any abuse of a dominant position in the market by individual airports and airlines subject to different pricing levels. The Parliament's Transport Committee argues EU rules are needed because not all states have a functioning, non-discriminatory and comprehensible procedure for calculating charges.
In a bid to focus the measures where they are really needed, the Transport Committee recommends that the Commission's proposed rules apply only to airports whose annual traffic number is over 5 million passengers, rather than the 1 million suggested by the Commission, restricting their effect to 67 EU airports. Since the development of new airport infrastructure is becoming a major challenge in the EU, the rapporteur proposes to include the costs of improved infrastructure projects in the calculation of the charges.
Other Monday debates
The House on Monday also discussed the future of the automobile industry. The report by German Liberal Jorgo Chatzimarkakis says that research funding needs to be increased to meet binding CO2 targets in the car industry.
A report by Transport Committee chairman Paolo Costa (ALDE) concerning the abolition of discrimination in transport rates and conditions in order to reduce the administrative burdens on businesses was discussed.
