Being named a European Capital of Culture gives cities a chance to shine and to attract artists and visitors from across the EU, as well as having long-term benefits in attracting jobs and people. But the focus must be on the European dimension, and what Europe can learn from the city, MEPs say.
The directors of the 2005 and 2006 capitals of culture, Cork and Patras respectively, discussed the programme with the parliament's culture committee Monday. Mary McCarthy, Director of Programme Development for Cork, said that while being a capital of culture was a "fantastic opportunity...little material was available" to help with the organisation of the 5000 events. Ruth Hieronymi, a German Christian Democrat said the EU "should find a way to ensure there is greater support and encourage the links with the institutions."
Ms McCarthy said the "most successful projects were pan-European (and) brought Europe to Cork." As part of the project Cork invited 100s of artist to live in the city for a year and share their cultures. But she noted that business isn't clear about what the concept really means, making it hard to attract sponsorship.
Talking about 2006, Giorgios Panagiotopoulos, Communications Director and spokesman for the project, said Patras aims to cover "every aspect of European cultural heritage."
Austrian social democrat Christa Prets who will report on the Commission's proposal on the future of the culture capital programme, said "the focus on the EU dimension should be stressed with less focus on the regional dimension." Olaf Schwencke, Chairman of the German Association of the European Foundation for Culture, agreed. "What can the city of culture add to the EU dimension, ...what can Europe learn from the city?" he said.
Looking to the future, Bert van Meggelen, director of Rotterdam 2001, said that cities of culture "have become a focus for debate on urban renewal" as they are where people want to be. "Cities are becoming more generic and that causes similar problems, but the resolutions cities find aren't the same," he said. "Those are the issues cultural cities should deal with."
