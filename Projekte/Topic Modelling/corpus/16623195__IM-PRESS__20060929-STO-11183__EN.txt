MEPs put the EU's finances in 2006 under the spotlight today
Tuesday in Strasbourg MEPs will vote on whether to sign off on the expenditure of the EU's institutions and Agencies for 2006. Known as the "budgetary discharge" procedure, the discharge is the decision by which MEPs close the life of a budget cycle. It decides whether to grant the discharge based on a report by the Court of Auditors' and recommendations from the Council. The purpose is to verify if the money was spent properly and verify precise revenue and expenditure.
The discharge represents the political control of the budget. The discharge procedure can produce three outcomes: the granting, postponement or refusal of the discharge.
MEPs will debate and vote on 30 reports about financial expenditure on everything from the Court of Justice to the European Environment Agency. Parliament's Budgetary Control Committee is recommending that MEPs vote to grant a discharge in all cases.
This year the Budgetary Control Committee has welcomed the Commission's progress towards a more efficient use and control of EU funds - in particular the Common Agricultural Policy. However it still seeks to improve supervision of structural funds and external actions .
MEPs on the Committee focused on improving rules on MEPsâ€™ own administrative expenditure. Members on the Committee are also committed to establishing a formal statute for MEPs' assistants.
A refusal to grant the discharge is a "nuclear option" in Parliament's supervisory arsenal, regarded as a serious political sanction. It last happened in December 1998, one of the series of events leading to the resignation of the Santer Commission on 15 March 1999.
