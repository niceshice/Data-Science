The European Parliament is sending a delegation of MEPs to the UN Climate Change Conference in Bali between the 11th and 14th of December.
The EP delegation, which will consist of members from the three committees most involved with parliamentary work on climate change -- the Environment, Industry and Climate Change Committees -- will organise a Round-Table of parliamentarians (featuring lawmakers from countries participating in the Conference), hold numerous high-level meetings with other delegations and civil society organisations, and liaise daily with the European Commission and Council.
Parliament’s role in tackling climate change
The European Parliament is co-legislator (with the Council) on issues such as the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, the decision to cap emissions from the aviation sector, the proposal on renewable energies, the law on curbing car emissions, as well as projects on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and Sustainable Coal.
The EP delegation will also hold three press conferences -- two, jointly with the European Commission, on Tuesday 11 December and Friday 14 December; the other, following the parliamentary round table, on Wednesday 12 December.
Commitments made under the Kyoto Protocol for reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions run to 2012. It is the EU's aim to ensure that the Bali Conference will mark the first step in building a post-2012 framework on climate protection. The Conference, hosted by the Government of Indonesia, will bring together representatives of over 180 countries, along with observers from intergovernmental and nongovernmental organisations.
