Simone Veil chairing the 1979 plenary session
Remember 1979? It was the year when Margaret Thatcher was elected, Ayatollah Khomeini came to power and the Sony Walkman was born. The year also marked the first direct elections to the European Parliament. In total 410 members from 9 countries were elected through universal suffrage. Some of the '79 intake included such luminaries as Jacques Chirac, Willy Brandt and Nobel Peace Prize winner John Hume.
Francis Wurtz, a French United Left MEP who was elected that year gave us his impressions on how the EP has changed over the last 26 years. "Incontestably, the introduction of the co-decision procedure and the accession of the 10 new countries in 2004 were the biggest changes," said Mr Wurtz. This new power is welcome but he feels the Parliament has lost some of the "Romanticism" of the early years.
In contrast, MEPs from the 10 new EU countries elected in 2004 have a different perspective. Richard Falbr, a Czech Socialist MEP, finds the EP "more collaborative and less partisan" than his experience of a national parliament. Even in his brief time at the institution (he was an observer in 2003) he finds that the number of votes Parliament is asked to take "has increased dramatically."
The point about the atmosphere of the Parliament is echoed by Latvian Green MEP Tatjana Ždanoka, who remarked that in post-Soviet countries such as hers, those "who disagree with you tend to be your enemy." Here she finds it more agreeable as "people tend to have respect for conflicting opinions."
Another survivor of the class of 1979, British Liberal MEP, Bill Newton Dunn, thinks that in terms of the powers of the institution "things have changed considerably for the better". He recalls that the Parliament met originally in Strasbourg and Luxembourg until the latter was dropped.
Since '79 elections to the European Parliament have taken place at five-yearly intervals in 1984, 1989, 1994, 1999 and 2004. The last election returned 732 Members from 25 EU countries.
