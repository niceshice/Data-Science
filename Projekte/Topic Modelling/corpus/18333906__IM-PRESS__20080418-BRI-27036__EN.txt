2006 budget discharge: better supervision of the Structural Funds
Parliament signed off the accounts of all the EU's institutions and agencies for the financial year 2006. However, it is also calling for monthly follow-up meetings where a Commission will report on the supervision of the Structural Funds and certain other matters.
How to fight organ shortages and "transplant tourism"
Reducing the organ and donor shortage is “the main challenge that EU Member States face with regard to organ transplantation”, says the European Parliament. MEPs propose a wide range of measures, including a European donor card, to tackle problems like organ shortage, transplantation risks and organ trafficking.
Drugs policy: civil society can play a key role, say MEPs
In adopting a report on the Green Paper on the role of civil society in drugs policy in the European Union, the European Parliament indicates that civil society has an essential role to play in promoting the emergence, definition, implementation, assessment and monitoring of drug policies.
Fighting crime and terrorism while safeguarding privacy
The European Parliament adopted a non-binding report on a proposal for closer cooperation between EU Member States in the fight against terrorism and cross-border crime. The EP backs the plans but wants to beef up the rules on personal data protection. The report was adopted with 529 votes in favour, 65 against and 24 abstentions.
Forward movement the best medicine against stagnation, says Slovenian President
In his address to Parliament on Wednesday (23 April), Danilo Türk , the President of Slovenia, the current holder of the EU presidency, described the EU as a great historic achievement but stressed that it must keep moving forward and play more of a role as global leader. In particular, Europe would have to use all its creativity to tackle the issues of global warming, human rights, immigration and enlargement.
MEPs set out priorities for 2009 including reducing administrative burdens
In adopting a joint resolution on the Commission’s Annual Policy Strategy for 2009, MEPs support Commission proposals aimed at reducing administrative burdens, recalls its determination to reach, and support for reaching, the goal of a 25% reduction in administrative burdens by 2012, and urges tangible results sooner rather than later. The House regards this as a key priority, in particular for SMEs, and as an essential contribution to reaching the Lisbon targets.
2009 EU budget: Parliament's priorities
Among the issues already influencing the debate on next year's EU budget are the European Parliament's new legislative and budgetary powers if the Lisbon Treaty is ratified and the membership of the next Commission and EP. A report by Jutta HAUG (PES, DE) on the budget framework and priorities for 2009 is the first programming text adopted by MEPs as part of preparations for the EU's next annual budget.
MEPs debate visa waivers for EU travellers to USA
The question of visa waivers for Europeans travelling to the USA was the subject of a debate on Wednesday (23 April) between MEPs, the Council and Commission. The Council have already adopted a decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations with the US on conditions for participation in the visa waiver programme that come under Community law. The decision does not apply to the UK and Ireland as they do not take part in the common visa policy.
Clearer rules on European Ombudsman's access to information
Proposed changes in the rules governing the European Ombudsman's access to information held by EU bodies and evidence given to him by EU civil servants, are set out in a report adopted by the European Parliament on the Ombudsman's Statute. The key aim of these changes is to boost citizens' confidence in the Ombudsman's work. The report was adopted with 620 votes in favour 18 against and 18 abstentions.
Volunteering empowers you say MEPs
Volunteering is good for you, your community, your region's economic development and your national economy. It also helps build the "social capital" that public policies need to succeed. Over 100 million EU citizens volunteer, and every €1 spent on supporting them generates a return of between €3 and €8 - a contribution that should appear in national accounts, says a report by the European Parliament. Promoting volunteering through Community policies, supporting voluntary action using EU funds, and recognising and committing to voluntary activity at EU level helps to establish direct links between citizens, their communities and the Union, explained rapporteur Marian HARKIN (ALDE, IE).
Go-ahead for EU law to encourage mediation for cross-border legal disputes
Parliament and Council have reached agreement on a proposed directive to promote the use of mediation as a faster and cheaper alternative to going to court in civil and commercial cross-border disputes. MEPs approved the Recommendation for second reading by Arlene McCARTHY (PES, UK) and the common position was declared adopted without amendment.
China's policy in Africa: MEPs on the alert
MEPs point the finger at investments made by China with no strings attached in African countries ruled by oppressive regimes, in a report on the effects of China's growing presence in Africa adopted with 618 votes in favour, 16 against and 17 abstentions. This policy helps perpetuate human rights violations, say MEPs who also highlight Beijing's role in the spread of arms and the conditions under which natural resources are being exploited.
Parliament's priorities for the 10th European Development Fund
MEPs adopted a report urging that the European Development Fund (EDF) be incorporated into the EU budget "in order to increase the consistency, transparency and effectiveness of development cooperation and guarantee democratic scrutiny". MEPs want to see democratic scrutiny by the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) of national strategy papers - the main instruments for implementing the EDF - as this would be a step towards conferring institutional power over development policy on the JPA and the EP.
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: progress towards EU
The European Parliament reiterates that the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's bilateral name dispute with Greece should not obstruct FYROM's EU accession process in a report adopted today by 601 votes in favour, 52 against and 30 abstentions.
Burma: broadened and more targeted sanctions needed, say MEPs
Broadened and more targeted sanctions, a worldwide arms embargo and the release of political prisoners including Aung San Suu Kyi, recipient of the 1990 Sakharov prize, are among the demands of MEPs in a resolution adopted by Parliament on Thursday, 24 April. The Burmese military junta led by General Than Shwe intends to hold a referendum on a new Constitution on May 10, 2008.
MEPs demand the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages in Colombia ahead of key summit
In adopting a joint resolution on the Fifth EU-LAC Summit in Lima, the European Parliament reiterates its belief that action to combat terrorism must be carried out with full respect for human rights, civil liberties and the rule of law. The House demands the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages in Colombia, with priority being given to those who are sick.
Green light for establishment of European satellite navigation system Galileo
The European Parliament gave its backing to Galileo's deployment phase which paves the way for the European satellite radio navigation system to be operational by 2013. Parliament's rapporteur Etelka BARSI-PATAKY (EPP-ED, HU) said: "Galileo will be the first common European infrastructure. Galileo and EGNOS are made-in-Europe programmes and no programmes of a particular Member State or a particular company. This project is a step towards a stronger Europe."
Environmental impact of New Flame shipwreck off Gibraltar
In a resolution on a recent shipwreck off the coast of Gibraltar, MEPs ask the Commission to check whether the authorities took the right measures to avoid the accident and, if not, to take legal action. They ask for information on the content of the cargo and plans for removing the vessel. They also believe the accident makes the case for tougher EU maritime safety measures.
Market-based instruments for the environment
The European Parliament adopted an own- initiative report on the Green Paper on market-based instruments for environment and related policy purposes. MEPs welcome the Green Paper but regret the absence of an in-depth analysis on the merits of differentiation between market-based instruments (MBIs) targeted at the consumer as opposed to the producer level. The report was adopted with 479 votes in favour 53 against and 5 abstentions.
Preparations for the COP-MOP meetings on biological diversity and biosafety
In adopting a resolution on preparations for the COP-MOP meetings on biological diversity and biosafety, MEP say that they are deeply concerned at the continued loss of biodiversity and at the European Union’s ever increasing ecological footprint, which extends the impact on biodiversity well beyond the borders of the European Union. The resolution was adopted with 546 votes in favour 7 against and 11 abstentions.
Towards a reform of the World Trade Organisation
MEPs adopted a report entitled "Towards a reform of the World Trade Organisation" calling for a redefinition of the role and format of Ministerial Conferences and observes already the tendency of WTO members to prefer more informal methods of coordination and decision-making at this level and notes that no Ministerial Conference was convened in 2007.
More transparency and accountability needed in bodies setting international accounting standards
In a report drawn up by Alexander RADWAN (EPP-ED, DE) and adopted by 373 votes in favour to 21 against with 13 abstentions, Parliament welcomes the moves made by the IASB – the body which draws up the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) which EU law requires stock exchange-listed companies to use for their accounts – and the International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation – the IASB’S oversight body – have made to redress these deficiencies, but it argues that there is more to be done. A debate should be launched, it says, on integrating the IASB into the system of international governance with the IMF, OECD and World Bank.
Human rights: Zimbabwe, Iran, Chad
The European Parliament adopted three human rights resolutions at the end of the week's Strasbourg plenary session. In these resolutions, MEPs call for Zimbabwe's election results to be released immediately, they highlight issues of women's rights and the number of executions in Iran, and lastly they call for dialogue between government and rebel groups in Chad.

Budgetary control
2006 budget discharge: better supervision of the Structural Funds
2008-04-28 - 12:50
Parliament signed off the accounts of all the EU's institutions and agencies for the financial year 2006. However, it is also calling for monthly follow-up meetings where a Commission will report on the supervision of the structural funds and certain other matters. Parliament welcomes the commitment by the Commission to give a monthly report in the Committee in charge of the implementation of the 2006 discharge follow up where every month one Commissioner in charge will present the development in his/her area of responsibility, covering national declarations, annual summaries and the EU's external activities.
The EP rapporteur on the Commission's 2006 discharge, Dan Jørgensen (PES, DK), the decision to grant discharge to the Commission was adopted by 582 votes in favour 77 against and 18 abstentions.
Structural Funds: a practical solution
The proposal to monitor (on a quarterly basis) the Commission’s own action plan on better supervision of the structural funds provides a practical solution to the thorny issue of the management of these funds, the key issue in this year's procedure.
MEPs regard as “a major achievement” the Commission’s undertaking “to correct all individual errors found in the Court’s annual report on 2006” with the commitment to make 100% corrections in all cases of “serious breaches of public procedure”. However, MEPs also want the Commission to present “objective, clear and full information on its capacity to recover unduly paid monies”.
In addition, the Parliament welcomes the fact that as a result of the 2006 discharge the Commission has “finally committed itself to apply a policy of suspending payments as soon as possible following the detection of serious weaknesses in the system”.
“Firm support” for national management declarations welcomed
Another important issue is national management declarations, which represent a major innovation in the management of Community funds and are already used in a number of Member States (Netherlands, Denmark, United Kingdom and Sweden).
The European Parliament is critical of what it sees as the Commission's hitherto “tacit acceptance of Member States’ collective irresponsibility” (with the exception of the above four countries) concerning the EU's financial management. However, it welcomes the “firm political support” now given by the Commission for such declarations, although it says the Commission should encourage them more strongly
External activity: one final effort
The European Parliament believes the management of the Community’s external aid raises numerous questions. It considers that, following this discharge procedure, the Commission is showing increasing awareness of the importance of the transparency and visibility of external aid (of all kinds, whether managed by the Commission or jointly managed via international partners).
MEPs accept the Commission’s proposal to discuss the matter of a definition for non-governmental organisations following the results of the Court of Auditors’ ongoing audit of NGOs (announced as part of the court’s work programme for 2008). Lastly, they say EU external aid should be more visible on the ground and more accessible to audit activities in cases of joint management of aid, in particular with the United Nations.
EP discharge - in line with the Bureau’s recommendations
MEPs also approved that the European Parliament be granted its discharge for 2006 with 597 votes in favour 50 against and 40 abstentions.
Among key points of the 2006 Parliament discharge (rapporteur: Javier Pomes Ruiz , EPP-ED, ES), the question of Members’ own administrative expenditure was the subject of a number of amendments, one of which (a compromise) welcomes the decisions of the Conference of Presidents and the Bureau on this matter. The House believes that the working party on the Members’ statute, the assistants’ statute and the pension fund (set up following the decisions of those senior EP bodies) should include a member (yet to be designated) of the Budgetary Control Committee.
Parliament also point out that assistance to Members calls for flexibility and mobility, while the new statute for assistants should set minimum standards for pay and social rights in conformity with applicable European legislation.
In this connection, shortly before the vote on the 2006 EP discharge, Vice-President Martine Roure (PES, FR), who chairs the working party on the Members' statute and assistants, urged MEPs to give her their “full support” in finding a solution to this matter.
MEPs not to employ family members
The House says that service providers must be paid [when fulfilling a contract for an MEP] by a payment agency based in their own Member State, and that MEPs may not employ members of their family.
Voluntary pension fund
The House also says it is “surprised” at the recommendation by the Conference of Presidents of 13 March 2008 that MEPs be allowed to acquire new pension entitlements under the voluntary pension fund following the entry into force of the new Members’ statute. The discharge resolutions for 2004 and 2005 had stressed that this fund’s activities should be limited, from the start of the next term, to making payments for entitlements already acquired. For this reason, the European Parliament insists that the Working Group (of the Bureau) on the Members’ Statues should respect the decisions taken by Parliament.
Discharge – a political process
The European Parliament also uses its resolution to stress the political nature of the discharge voted by Parliament. In this context, it aims for both:
closer cooperation between Parliament’s Bureau and the Budgetary Control Committee; and better linkage between the budget setting procedure and the discharge process.
Finally, the House welcomes and supports “the firm commitment of [Parliament’s] President to ensure the statute for assistants enters force at the same time as the new Members’ Statute.”
United Kingdom and Ireland
The European Parliament's report urges the Commission to improve checks in the UK "which did not comply with Community legislation when allocating entitlements and paying Single Payment Scheme (SPS) and rural development aid to landlords for land let to and farmed by lessee farmers". It also calls for better checks in some Member States (Austria, Ireland and the UK) "who have failed to correctly apply certain key elements of the SPS and extended consolidation of entitlements beyond the provisions of the regulation".
Budget discharge: background
The purpose of the budget discharge procedure is to enable Parliament to make a political appraisal of how the EU budget has been spent and to recommend improvements.
The procedure begins each year at the EP when the Court of Auditors presents its Annual Report. Parliament then embarks on its own assessment of the way the budget was used. MEPs seek to ensure that any problems flagged up by the Court of Auditors or in investigations by the Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) are given political prominence and remedied by improvements in the system.
Parliament's Rules of Procedure say the House may invite Parliament to grant, postpone or refuse discharge in respect of implementation of the budget. This enables MEPs to express their approval or disapproval of the way EU funds have been spent. The Commission must act upon any comments or recommendations in Parliament's resolution.
By granting a discharge through a resolution voted in April, Parliament approves the implementation of the budget in respect of the relevant financial year.
If Parliament concludes that there are serious issues to be addressed, it will postpone the granting of discharge. The Commission then has to take swift action to remedy the problems.
A refusal to grant discharge has no legal consequences but may be regarded as a serious political sanction. This has happened twice in the past twenty years, first in 1984 and then in December 1998, in the latter case leading to the resignation of the Santer Commission on 15 March 1999.
The discharge decision regarding the general budget managed by the Commission concerns by far the largest share of the EU budget, which goes to finance EU policies in the Member States. However, some 80-85% of EU funds are managed and monitored primarily by national and local administrations, under a system of "shared management" with the Commission. Only a small part of the budget is managed directly by the Commission itself.

How to fight organ shortages and "transplant tourism"
2008-04-28 - 12:50
Reducing the organ and donor shortage is “the main challenge that EU Member States face with regard to organ transplantation”, says the European Parliament. MEPs propose a wide range of measures, including a European donor card, to tackle problems like organ shortage, transplantation risks and organ trafficking. Although the use of human organs for transplantation has steadily increased in recent years across the EU, the number of people requiring a transplant is still greater than the number of organs available for transplant. The own-initiative report drafted by Adamos Adamou (GUE/NGL, CY) recalls that currently many thousands of patients in Europe, with a significant mortality rate, are registered on waiting lists. The report was adopted with 653 votes in favour 14 against and 16 abstentions.
Mr Adamou said: "10 people die, waiting for an organ donation. It is in our hands to send a forceful message to the Commission but also above all to the Member States and our Governments. The time has come to take action as European citizens, to mobilise existing resources, to coordinate, to exchange expertise and best practices, to sensitise public opinion, to embrace altruism and to become donors ourselves."
Organ donation has to remain “strictly non-commercial”
The European Parliament stresses that organ donation must stay “strictly non-commercial” and should be made altruistically and voluntarily, ruling out payments between donors and recipients. Compensation should be possible only to make good expenses and inconveniences related to the donation. “Any commercial exploitation of organs is unethical and inconsistent with the most basic human values”, and organ donation out of financial motivation “degrades the gift of an organ to a mere commodity which constitutes a violation of human dignity”, say MEPs.
Prevent organ trafficking and "transplant tourism"
The report stresses that “organ trafficking undermines the credibility of the system for potential voluntary and unpaid donors”. The Commission and Member States are asked to take measures to prevent "transplant tourism", including drawing up guidelines to protect the poorest and most vulnerable donors from being victims of organ trafficking and adopting measures that increase the availability of legally procured organs. Moreover, Member States should take the necessary measures to prevent insurance companies reimbursing costs incurred in obtaining illegal organ transplantation.
Europol to act on organ trafficking
MEP regret that Europol did not come up with a survey on organ selling and trafficking because Europol claims that there are no documented cases. The House refers to reports of the Council of Europe and the WHO which give clear evidence that the organ trade is also a problem for EU Member States and asks the Commission and Europol to improve monitoring of cases of organ trafficking and draw the necessary conclusion.
A European donor card
The European Parliament proposes to introduce a European donor card, complementary to existing national systems. MEPs also note that those who are not suitable donors should be encouraged to carry a card to that effect as well in order to facilitate a swift identification of organs. Additionally, Member States should make it possible to appoint a legal representative who can decide on donation after one's death, states the report.
Organ sharing and new biotechnology to tackle organ shortage
Establishing well-structured operational systems and promoting successful models in and between Member States and at international level is of “utmost importance” to fight organ shortage more effectively, say MEPs. They call on the Commission to promote research in biotechnology which, in the future, “may offer the possibility for researchers to grow organs from existing tissues and cells, either from the patients themselves or from other tissue donors”.
MEPs support reinforced cooperation between Member States leading to increased organ sharing between EU Member States. In particular small Member States with a limited donor pool could clearly benefit from European co-operation, says the report. The Commission should, therefore, facilitate alliances between national transplantation organisations in Member States.
Transplant hotline for better information
MEPs stress that “a very effective way of increasing organ availability is to provide more information to the public”. They propose establishing a transplant "hotline" with a single telephone number managed by a national transplantation organisation and manned 24 hours/day, which can rapidly provide relevant and accurate information.
Adult stem cell treatment
The report notes that several clinical trials in humans have proven the efficiency of adult stem cell treatment in several cell replacement therapies.
Reduce transplant risks
Finally, MEPs recognise that it is “vitally important to improve the quality and safety of organ donation and transplantation” to reduce transplant risks. Hence, the House looks forward to the Commission’s proposal for a directive setting requirements to assure the quality and safety for organ donation across the EU. However, the forthcoming legislative framework should not create an additional administrative burden nor should it jeopardise the use of existing good practices or lead to a decrease in the number of potential and actual donors, stress MEPs.

Drugs policy: civil society can play a key role, say MEPs
2008-04-28 - 12:50
In adopting a report on the Green Paper on the role of civil society in drugs policy in the European Union, the European Parliament indicates that civil society has an essential role to play in promoting the emergence, definition, implementation, assessment and monitoring of drug policies. With its experience gained at grass-roots level, its innovative capacity and its potential in terms of the exchange of information and sound practices, civil society can bring significant added value to planned measures. However, in order to do so, civil society must be recognised and supported in both its internal and external dimensions. The report was adopted with 600 votes in favour, 35 against and 32 abstentions.
Civil society – the internal dimension: MEPs stress the importance of action by civil society in the achievement of the objectives set out in the EU's drugs strategy as regards prevention, the provision of information and the management of problems associated with drugs dependencies. They call upon all parties involved at both EU and Member-State level to better recognise the role of civil society in terms of damage-reduction, rehabilitation and social-reintegration policies. At the same time, MEPs call on the Commission and Member States to promote civil society initiatives, particularly those aiming to: i) reinforce the prevention of and information on the risks associated with drug use; ii) treat drug addicts in prison; iii) establish special preventive procedures in “at-risk” metropolitan areas; iv) organise, with the cooperation of parents’, students’ and teachers’ organisations, awareness and prevention campaigns on drugs and their harmful effects on health; v) implement damage-reduction policies through direct contact with people in the street and in neighbourhoods; vi) establish reintegration projects for street children and disadvantaged families.
Civil Society – the external dimension: MEPs call for a strengthening of the external dimension of the EU’s drug strategy in order to have a sustainable impact on drug-producing countries. The experience of European NGOs that are active in this area should also be taken into account in order to help the countries in question to switch local cultivation to therapeutic and medical uses. In particular, they call on the Commission and Member States to explore forms of cooperation with civil society organisations involved in the promotion of legal substances derived from coca leaves. Other initiatives have also been proposed such as those set out in the European Parliament and Council Recommendation of 25 October 2007 on the production of opium for medical purposes in Afghanistan or through the possibility of combating illegal poppy plantations by means of spraying, which is not harmful to humans, animals or the environment. Cooperation with the science industry is also highly recommended as well as with international networks of associations active in the area of combating drugs (for example, the Vienna NGOs Committee on Narcotic Drugs or the “Beyond 2008” initiative which aims to promote the role of civil society within the General Assembly of the United Nations (UNGASS) regarding drugs).
Role of the media : given the vital role of the media, and particularly digital media, in raising awareness among citizens, especially young people at risk of becoming drug addicts, MEPs call for these to become privileged partners in the fight against drugs by establishing awareness measures specifically aimed at female drug addicts. In this respect, MEPs call for targeted campaigns on the damaging effects of drugs to the physical and mental health of young girls, pregnant or breastfeeding women and on maternal health and the transmission of drugs between mother and foetus. Information campaigns should also be targeted at young consumers, in other words children and minors.
Role of the church : The report acknowledges that churches and religious communities have been very active in the fight against drugs, and their experiences should therefore be taken into account in the formulation, implementation and assessment of drugs policies.
MEPs also highlight the importance of the Civil Society Drugs Forum , which represents the first step towards more concrete and constructive involvement of European civil society associations in the dynamics of the EU in terms of the prevention of and fight against drug use. While regretting the selection process for participants in the Forum, MEPs recall that its aim is to establish direct contact with associations that are on the front line in the fight against drugs.
More financial means : MEPs request that, subject to budgetary control, the EU becomes involved at a financial level in supporting civil society activities. They call on Member States to cover as far as possible, through public financing, the services proposed by professional civil organisations and request that financial measures be set out in order to assist voluntary organisations and parents’ associations that take action in the fight against drugs. While they welcome the launch of the 2007-2013 “Specific Programme on Drugs Prevention and Information”, they regret the delay in the implementation of the funding made available in connection with that Programme.

Fighting crime and terrorism while safeguarding privacy
2008-04-28 - 12:50
The European Parliament adopted a non-binding report on a proposal for closer cooperation between EU Member States in the fight against terrorism and cross-border crime. The EP backs the plans but wants to beef up the rules on personal data protection. The report was adopted with 529 votes in favour, 65 against and 24 abstentions. The draft Council decision under consideration - put forward by Germany - seeks to incorporate into Community law the Prüm Treaty, adopted on 27 May 2005 outside the EU framework, initially by Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Austria. The treaty strengthens cross-border cooperation on terrorism, crime and illegal immigration and provides for exchanges of DNA data, fingerprints and other information as well as joint police operations. If it is incorporated into EU law, there will be guarantees on data protection, which is the weak point of the Prüm treaty.
MEPs wary over data protection
The European Parliament (whose report by Barbara Dührkop Dührkop (PES, DE) approves the proposal but wants data transfers under the new decision to be governed by the future framework decision on data protection. MEPs believe transfers should be subject to control by the European Data Protection Supervisor. The Parliament's report also introduces a clear definition of "personal data" and calls for a ban on exchanging DNA and fingerprints of innocent people. Text adopted by the EP on 22 April 2008

Forward movement the best medicine against stagnation, says Slovenian President
2008-04-28 - 12:50
In a speech to MEPs on Wednesday, Danilo Türk, the President of Slovenia, the current holder of the EU presidency, described the EU as a great historic achievement but stressed that it must keep moving forward and play more of a role as global leader. In particular, Europe would have to use all its creativity to tackle the issues of global warming, human rights, immigration and enlargement. Introducing Mr Türk , EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering said that Slovenia, the first of the group of states that joined the EU in 2004 to take on the EU presidency, had a number of responsibilities. These included not just leading the current European Union but also acting as a model to the countries of the western Balkans, showing them that EU membership with all its benefits is a possibility for them too.
President Türk opened by saying "This Parliament, and indeed the European Union as a whole, is a magnificent embodiment of a great vision – a vision of durable peace and prosperity brought to the peoples of Europe by the spirit of cooperation and ever stronger integration."
He added that "the European Union will continue to face complicated questions in an increasingly globalised world" but will continue to be a great success story "if it retains its dynamism".
Global warming
The president then moved on to two areas where leadership is particularly needed: global warming and human rights. Of the former, after referring to the EU's target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020, he said "the task ahead is likely to be difficult" but "difficult moments like this represent real tests of leadership". Indeed, "the international community is facing a stark choice: either to continue with incremental methods and face a disaster, or to try to muster a transformative approach". Ultimately, "Incrementalism will not do. Transformation - even though hard to achieve - is the order of the day".
Human rights
Turning to human rights, Mr Türk said "Massive and systematic violations persist in may parts of the world". He stressed that "EU leadership is particularly necessary at this stage when global action in the field of human rights is lagging behind". Indeed, "the overwhelming concerns with terrorism and other security challenges, coupled with responses to those challenges which are ill-advised or not well thought through seem to have reduced the level of sensitivity for human rights. The EU has to fill the gap." He stressed the need for the EU to help make the UN Human Rights Council and the International Criminal Court more effective and "to look at new ways of engaging with the UN Security Council".
Immigration and integration "the next testing ground for Europe's creativity "
Within the EU, the rights of asylum seekers and of immigrants in general must not be overlooked. Mr Türk stressed that "international action for human rights in its various forms can be effective if it proceeds from a solid platform, from scrupulous respect for human rights at home. This includes protection of human rights of migrants and asylum seekers and careful application of law in the cases involving allegations of terrorism."
He added "creativity is required with regard to the integration of immigrants and their communities. Economic prosperity and upward social mobility of immigrants are key to successful policy in this domain". To achieve this, "integration has to include effective access to good quality education, including linguistic education, and access to universities." And "success has to be made visible. Persons of immigrant origin who have succeeded should appear on TV and in other media and be seen as examples of success." These issues "represent the next testing ground for Europe's creativity", he argued.
Enlargement: Turkey, western Balkans, Ukraine, Moldova
Turning to enlargement, Mr Türk said "While it is obvious that all those aspiring for membership will have to fulfil the membership criteria, none of them should be precluded from membership only for reasons of political inconvenience or cultural prejudice".
For example, "the EU needs Turkey" and "should not deprive Turkey of the perspective of membership as this has already been granted. The credibility of the EU is at stake."
In addition, "the European Union cannot accept a 'black hole' in the Western Balkans". The region needs a framework to help these countries discuss their common problems and move towards meeting the EU membership criteria. Ukraine and Moldova also need the prospect of EU membership. They must not be denied that opportunity, said Mr Türk, and this will require a pragmatic approach from the EU.
Forward movement through leadership, creativity and pragmatism
Summing up, the Slovenian president said "The European Union would be well advised to exert global leadership in such matters as global warming and human rights. Creativity will continue to be central in the search for effective policies of immigration and integration. The value of pragmatism will remain undiminished in all matters related to further expansion, which is needed to ensure the role of the EU as a global leader."
"All this may sound ambitious", he acknowledged. "But forward movement has always been the best medicine against stagnation. Our time is no different in that regard".

MEPs set out priorities for 2009 including reducing administrative burdens
2008-04-28 - 12:50
In adopting a joint resolution on the Commission’s Annual Policy Strategy for 2009, MEPs support Commission proposals aimed at reducing administrative burdens, recalls its determination to reach, and support for reaching, the goal of a 25% reduction in administrative burdens by 2012, and urges tangible results sooner rather than later. The House regards this as a key priority, in particular for SMEs, and as an essential contribution to reaching the Lisbon targets. Parliament urge the Commission to submit a legislative proposal on the European Private Company Statute and draw attention to the need for an overall review together with a review of the General Product Safety Directive. The resolution was adopted with 304 votes in favour, 240 against and 23 abstentions.
The House points to the overriding importance of safeguarding the stability of financial markets and reassuring consumers in the light of the current financial crisis. MEPs note that the current crisis shows the need for the European Union to develop oversight measures in order to increase investor transparency, establish better valuation standards, improve prudential supervision and rate the role of rating agencies.
Parliament also points out that the EP will be examining the consequences of the recent ECJ ruling on the Viking, Laval and Rüffert cases, starting with a debate in plenary, followed by Parliament’s report on challenges to collective bargaining.
MEPs regret the low priority given by the Commission to culture and education matters in the 2009 Annual Policy Strategy.
Inclusion of maritime and inland waterway in emissions trading scheme
The House welcomes the Commission’s wish to reduce emissions related to the transport of goods and calls on the Commission to submit a legislative proposal on the inclusion of maritime and inland waterway transport in the emissions trading scheme.
Parliament takes the view that cohesion policy should remain a Community policy in accordance with the Treaty and the solidarity principle, and therefore rejects all attempts to renationalise this policy.
Cross-border healthcare directive awaited
The European Parliament awaits the Commission’s proposal on cross-border health, whilst underlining that the Member States’ competences in this area must be respected. MEPs looks forward to the pact on mental health and also reiterates its commitment to improving health care in Europe, including support for an EU strategy dealing with the fight against cancer, cardiovascular diseases and other common serious diseases, as well as rare diseases.
Communicating Europe
MEPs call on the Commission to place the citizen at the centre of the European project. The House urges the Commission to further focus its efforts in the development of an effective communication policy in order to provide citizens with the means to understand the EU better, especially in the year of the European elections.
Finally, Parliament underlines the importance of swiftly implementing the right of initiative for citizens as provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon and reminds the Commission of its commitment, in the light of the proposed regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 on access to documents, to develop greater transparency and access to documents.

Budget
2009 EU budget: Parliament's priorities
2008-04-28 - 12:50
Among the issues already influencing the debate on next year's EU budget are the European Parliament's new legislative and budgetary powers if the Lisbon Treaty is ratified and the membership of the next Commission and EP. A report by Jutta HAUG (PES, DE) on the budget framework and priorities for 2009 is the first programming text adopted by MEPs as part of preparations for the EU's next annual budget. It takes account of the changes set to take place in 2009 that will have a major impact on the budget. Some are linked to the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty: the shift in the EP-Council balance of budgetary power in Parliament's favour and the scrapping of the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory spending. Others will follow from the 2009 European elections and the end of the present Commission's mandate. The MEPs elected in 2009 must be ready to use the new budget procedure in time for the 2010 budget.
Reduced budget margins
In contrast to previous years, the report does not refer directly to the Commission's Annual Policy Strategy (APS). MEPs nevertheless take note of the priorities proposed by the Commission for 2009, namely climate change and sustainable development. But they are surprised that at this early stage the Commission "has already embarked on a reprioritisation exercise", including in those headings of the multiannual financial framework which have "a particularly small margin". MEPs call on the Commission to present a "clear and transparent" preliminary draft budget that can be understood by the public, is realistic and enables Parliament and Council to "thoroughly scrutinise" the implementation of the different EU programmes and policies.
MEPs say they are concerned that it is now more difficult to distinguish operational from administrative expenditure by the Commission, as well as by the Commission’s practice of outsourcing spending on staff, which they say reduces the transparency of the administrative expenditure in the budget.
In their negotiations with the Council, Parliament expects to make use of all the powers conferred on it under the interinstitutional agreement, including the flexibility instrument if necessary. The report stresses the importance of the solidarity principle, arguing that it must remain one of the EU's guiding principles, particularly for regional and development policy.
Later in the year, the Budgets Committee will make an initial assessment of the 2009 preliminary draft budget, which will be presented at the July plenary session. Text adopted: 2009 budget, Section III - Commission: budgetary framework and priorities for 2009

Visa policy
MEPs debate visa waivers for EU travellers to USA
2008-04-28 - 12:50
The question of visa waivers for Europeans travelling to the USA was the subject of a debate on Wednesday between MEPs, the Council and Commission. Last week, the Council adopted a decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations with the US on conditions for participation in the visa waiver programme that come under Community law. The decision does not apply to the UK and Ireland as they do not take part in the common visa policy. On behalf of the Council, Slovenian interior minister Dragutin MATE set out the current state of play. A two-track system has been agreed, under which the Commission, on the basis of a mandate just granted by the Council, will negotiate with the USA on certain issues of exclusive Community competence, while Member States will be able to negotiate bilaterally with the USA on other issues. Electronic approval via internet of visa applications will be possible and the US will only require the same personal data as now. Once an application is authorised it will be valid for two years.
Commissioner Jacques BARROT also spoke of the two-track system, adding that key issues in negotiations with the USA would be the principles of reciprocity and respect for fundamental rights, including data privacy. He hoped for rapid progress and said the ultimate aim was visa-free travel with fair treatment for all EU citizens
Political group speakers
On behalf of the EPP-ED group, Urszula GACEK (PL) welcomed the announcement of a two-track approach. She said it sent a clear signal to the USA that it could not pressure smaller countries over matters such as passenger name records. "Individual Member States must have the possibility to negotiate separately to get the best deal for their own citizens but we also need a common EU position", she said, adding that she hoped for "a swift conclusion to these negotiations".
For the Socialist group, Claudio FAVA (IT) stressed that the Commission's negotiating mandate was for all Member States, and looked forward to their all being included in the Visa Waiver Program. Bilateral agreements are "completely unacceptable", he said, stressing that the US government "must respect the EU's political unity and treaty remit".
Visa and asylum policy fall within the EU's remit, and there should be no bilateral negotiations in these areas, he added, looking forward to the day when US visas would be waived for all EU citizens, on a reciprocal basis.
For the ALDE, Sophia IN 'T VELD (NL) welcomed Mr Mate's statement that visas are for citizens, not for Member States. She was worried by Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff's recent statements on the (non-)privacy of fingerprints. "If PNRs go beyond the EU/US accord, does this mean that the accord lapses?", she asked.
Neither was she reassured by talk of electronic visa authorisation. "The twelve principles are well and good, but what about the exceptions?", she asked, stressing the need for guarantees that the system will work, and hence for parliamentary scrutiny.
Konrad SZYMAŃSKI (UEN, PL) welcomed the Commission's efforts to achieve equal treatment for all citizens, but felt that this issue had made the EU's limits clear. "The talks have failed, and the US will be signing bilateral agreements", he said, noting that "the Commission alone is not always able to act", and saying he was not surprised that some countries had decided to go it alone.
Dimitrios PAPADIMOULIS (GUE/NGL, EL) said "the Americans' decisions to sign separate agreements with countries that fall within Community remit is very offensive to the EU" and nobody should have the right to do so without there being oversight provided by the European Parliament and the European Union.
Jana BOBOŠÍKOVÁ (NI, CZ) said such agreements are "subject to the political will of the Member States" and the European Commission should stop punishing those that are trying to thwart terrorism through data-sharing agreements.
British speaker
Baroness Sarah LUDFORD (ALDE, UK London, Liberal Democrat) wanted to know if the Commission and the Council will give an assurance that the EU will not, as part of the negotiations, allow access to EU databases like the Schengen Information System and the Visa Information System (VIS). As rapporteur on the VIS, "I achieved a general ban on transfers to third countries from the VIS database, and I want to know if that is threatened in any way."
Secondly, do the Commission and Council accept that going down this blind alley of mass surveillance and collection of personal data on everybody – 99% of whom will be completely innocent – risks being a distraction from trying to catch the 0.1% who may be a terrorist danger or an organised crime suspect?
Today, a top anti-Mafia prosecutor in Italy is warning that Mafia crime is spreading its tentacles across Europe because it is being neglected for lack of proper cross border cooperation and criminal justice systems not working together. Is that not our top priority? And it is not being done because it is a harder nut to crack." Full debate in Parliament - 23 April 2008

Ombudsman
Clearer rules on European Ombudsman's access to information
2008-04-28 - 12:50
Proposed changes in the rules governing the European Ombudsman's access to information held by EU bodies and evidence given to him by EU civil servants, are set out in a report adopted by the European Parliament on the Ombudsman's Statute. The key aim of these changes is to boost citizens' confidence in the Ombudsman's work. The report was adopted with 620 votes in favour 18 against and 18 abstentions. Changes in the Ombudsman's statute were requested by the Ombudsman himself, Mr Diamandouros, in a letter sent to EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering in July 2006.
The report setting out amendments to the statute of the European Ombudsman and his staff is drafted by Anneli JÄÄTTEENMÄKI (ALDE, FI). The EP voted only on the main body of text of the resolution, and the final vote has been suspended so as to negotiate and reach an agreement with Council. The rapporteur also urged the Commission and the Council to express their position on Parliament's proposal.
Clearer rules on access to confidential documents
Parliament adopted an amendment to a provision that obliges all EU institutions and bodies to provide the Ombudsman with the information he requests. This amendment deletes the current caveat that information may be refused on grounds of secrecy, which Members felt that citizens could interpret as restricting the Ombudsman's right to acquire information.
The new text spells out the rules on the handling of classified information obtained by the Ombudsman and his staff in the course of their inquiries. The report says that they would be required not to divulge any sensitive information or any document falling under the scope of the Community legislation regarding the protection of personal data.
Officials bound to testify
MEPs also agreed to change the rule on the testimony of EU officials. The approved text deletes a requirement that Community civil servants must testify "in accordance with the instructions from their administrations". Again, the European Parliament feels that this wording might mislead citizens into thinking that officials are not always required to tell the truth.

Regional policy
Volunteering empowers you say MEPs
2008-04-28 - 12:50
Volunteering is good for you, your community, your region's economic development and your national economy. It also helps build the "social capital" that public policies need to succeed. Over 100 million EU citizens volunteer, and every €1 spent on supporting them generates a return of between €3 and €8 - a contribution that should appear in national accounts, says a report by the European Parliament. Promoting volunteering through Community policies, supporting voluntary action using EU funds, and recognising and committing to voluntary activity at EU level helps to establish direct links between citizens, their communities and the Union, explained rapporteur Marian HARKIN (ALDE, IE).
Speaking in the debate in Strasbourg, Marian Harkin said "Member States can play a significant role by producing regular satellite accounts, so that the value of volunteering and not-for-profit institutions can be measured. The figures for many countries, including the US, Belgium, the Czech Republic and Canada, indicate that not-for-profit institutions account for between 5% and 7% of GDP. Policymakers cannot ignore these figures and must take them into account when formulating policy. Furthermore, for every euro organisations spent on supporting volunteers, they received an average return of between 3% and 8%. Not even the European Central Bank can match that rate of return."
VAT exemptions
The report calls on the Commission and Member States to consider introducing VAT exemptions for voluntary organisations on purchases intended for the accomplishment of their objectives and, in specific cases, exemption from the payment of VAT on goods and services donated to voluntary organisation.
Volunteering nurtures solidarity
Volunteers help to implement projects under EU-funded initiatives such as the LEADER (rural development) programme, INTERREG (linking European regions) and the Northern Ireland PEACE Programme, notes the report, which calls on the Commission to put in place a system across all funds that recognises the contribution of volunteering towards co-financing EU-funded projects, and to devise mechanisms for costing and using it as a means of matching funding for them.
Volunteering is also "a major force nurturing civil society and strengthening solidarity", and supporting community development programmes, says the report, which notes that "re-stimulating" volunteering may be especially necessary in those Member States, such as those emerging from a post-communist transition period, where voluntary activity "has come to be associated with actions of a compulsory nature".
The report stresses that volunteering and voluntary activity should in any event not take the place of paid work.
Corporate volunteering
The report encourages firms to help fund initiatives to promote and enhance volunteering, as part of their corporate social responsibility strategies. It also urges Member States to create incentives for business to fund and support the voluntary sector, so as to help transfer corporate skills and know-how to the public sector and to improve the quality of life locally, by encouraging "self help" solutions to local problems.
Satellite accounts
The report recommends that all Member States produce regular non-profit institution (NPI) "satellite accounts", and include volunteer work in them, to enable policy makers to take account of NPIs in policy formulation. It also suggests that volunteering be made a specific category in EUROSTAT accounts.
Volunteering as an education
The report calls on the Commission, Member States and regional and local authorities to promote volunteering through education at all levels, including degree programmes, so that learning during volunteering is recognised as part of lifelong learning.
Making life easier for voluntary bodies
The report encourages Member States, regional and local authorities and voluntary organisations to develop plans to recognise, value, support, facilitate and encourage volunteering, and to work in partnership to do so.
It also urges Member States, regional and local authorities to help voluntary bodies to access sufficient and sustainable funding, without excessive form-filling, red tape or bureaucracy, while maintaining controls on public expenditure.
The European Commission is asked to put in place a Plan V for Valuing, Validating and ensuring Visibility of Volunteers, to mainstream "volunteer-friendliness" across all areas of policy and legislation, and to investigate the introduction of a legal basis in Community law whereby voluntary organisations would be exempted from paying VAT on purchases.
Promoting volunteering
The report encourages Member States to promote volunteering within all communities, both real and virtual, e.g. family volunteering, or volunteering in marginalised groups or groups that might not traditionally volunteer.
It also asks the Commission to review its visa policy for non-EU participants in recognised EU volunteer programmes with a view to introducing a more liberal visa regime in particular towards volunteers from EU neighbouring countries.
Finally, the report calls on local and regional stakeholders, voluntary organisations and the media to inform citizens about opportunities to volunteer. Resolution adopted on 22 April 2008 on the role of volunteering in contributing to economic and social cohesion

Judicial cooperation
Go-ahead for EU law to encourage mediation for cross-border legal disputes
2008-04-28 - 12:50
Parliament and Council have reached agreement on a proposed directive to promote the use of mediation as a faster and cheaper alternative to going to court in civil and commercial cross-border disputes. MEPs approved the Recommendation for second reading by Arlene McCarthy (PES, UK) and the common position was declared adopted without amendment. Mediation can provide a cost-efficient and quick extra-judicial resolution of disputes. The Commission's proposal for a directive to promote its use everywhere in the EU has reached its final stage. As the common position has now been adopted, the new provisions on mediation in cross-border cases will be need to be implemented within three years.
Right to choose mediation to solve dispute
MEPs and the Council agreed that recourse to mediation must always be voluntary, even if, in some cases it is advised by a court. In any event an EU citizen who chose a mediation procedure to resolve a dispute would not thereby be precluded from recourse to an ordinary court.
To ensure that any agreement reached by the parties to mediation proceedings is enforced, the text specifies that the agreement should be applicable in all Member States.
Confidentiality ensured
The Council had endorsed MEPs' first-reading position on confidentiality, to ensure that neither mediators nor the parties involved in the proceedings may disclose information regarding the mediation.
The approved text also asks Member States to provide training for national mediators and to encourage the drawing up of voluntary codes of conduct to guarantee a fair trial. At a later stage, EU governments could post the list of trained mediators on the internet.
An opt-out means that the legislation will not apply to Denmark. Resolution adopted on 23 April 2008 on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on certain aspects of mediation in civil and commercial matters

China's policy in Africa: MEPs on the alert
2008-04-28 - 12:50
MEPs point the finger at investments made by China with no strings attached in African countries ruled by oppressive regimes, in a report on the effects of China's growing presence in Africa adopted with 618 votes in favour, 16 against and 17 abstentions. This policy helps perpetuate human rights violations, say MEPs who also highlight Beijing's role in the spread of arms and the conditions under which natural resources are being exploited. According to Ana Gomes (PES, PT) who drafted the report: "China's growing presence in Africa, with its positive and negative impacts, is challenging EU-Africa relations. The EU must therefore develop a coordinated response to the Chinese 'go out' policy, which is aimed at procuring oil and other natural resources. We need to engage in dialogue with China and Africa. At the same time, the EU should remain committed to its own approach towards development cooperation, making aid conditional on compliance with respect for human rights".
The EU should devise a strategy to meet the new challenges raised by emerging donors in Africa, such as China, including a coordinated approach between different Member States and EU institutions. It should also enter into a dialogue with China, in order to discuss methods and aims of development policy, says the report.
Investment in Africa
Unlike the EU, which ties its investment to respect for human rights and good governance, China makes most of its investments without laying down any particular conditions. Such investment in countries suffering from bad governance by oppressive regimes helps perpetuate human rights abuses, say MEPs.
The EU should encourage Chinese export-credit agencies, including the Exim Bank, to conduct systematic environmental assessments of infrastructure projects in Africa, such as dams, roads and mines, believes the House.
The report also calls on the EU to actively promote transparency regarding revenue generated by natural resources. MEPs argue that a clause requiring the investment of "a percentage of profit in local community development" should be included in international conventions on energy resources extraction or exploration.
MEPs call on the EU and China to discuss, develop and formulate, whenever possible, their African strategies with a view to a responsible commitment, aimed at fostering sustainable development and the pursuit of the MDGs. The House stresses the importance of formulating constructive dialogues within a multilateral framework with all relevant actors in the continent, in particular the AU and NEPAD. In this context, MEPs call on the EU to encourage the creation of an African Partnership Forum engaging all major donors and investors and China.
Arms and conflicts in Africa
MEPs urge the EU to call on China "to suspend any arms trade deals with those governments that are responsible for human rights violations, are involved in conflicts or on the brink of war", such as Zimbabwe, Sudan, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia and Eritrea.
In addition, says the report, China should increase the transparency of its national arms export control regime, namely by ensuring complete reporting on exports to the UN Register on Conventional Arms Exports.
The EU should maintain its arms embargo on China, adds the House, for as long as China continues to export arms to armed forces and armed groups in countries, many of them in Africa, that fuels and perpetuates conflicts and perpetrate gross violations of human rights.
Peacekeeping and non-interference
MEPs call on the EU to encourage China to continue increasing its participation in UN or African Union (AU) peacekeeping missions in Africa "by also supplying combat troops, when necessary". The EU is also urged to encourage China to assume its responsibilities as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, including the "responsibility to protect" civilians.
Role of parliaments
Lastly, MEPs stress that the European Parliament is willing to engage with the Chinese National People's Congress, the Pan-African Parliament and African national parliaments in a dialogue aimed at fostering sustainable development and enhancing their scrutinising capabilities.

Parliament's priorities for the 10th European Development Fund
2008-04-28 - 12:50
MEPs adopted a report urging that the European Development Fund (EDF) be incorporated into the EU budget "in order to increase the consistency, transparency and effectiveness of development cooperation and guarantee democratic scrutiny". MEPs want to see democratic scrutiny by the ACP-EU JPA of national strategy papers - the main instruments for implementing the EDF - as this would be a step towards conferring institutional power over development policy on the JPA and the EP. Believing that a posteriori examination of the EDF budget discharge by the European Parliament is not an adequate means of democratic scrutiny, the European Parliament proposes that the Council confer on Parliament, pending the EDF's incorporation into the EU budget, an institutional role relating to the entire process of monitoring and assessing the Fund's programming.
The report was adopted with 637 votes in favour 23 against and 14 abstentions.
Call to focus on health and basic education
As to the EDF's policy priorities, the House maintains that the undertaking given in the context of the development cooperation instrument (DCI) to devote 20% of funds to health and basic education by 2009 should apply to all European development policy spending, including the EDF.
MEPs deplore the Council’s decision of 11 April 2006 that the African Peace Facility should be financed by the EDF, since this takes funds away from development in order to use them for foreign policy purposes. They believe the peace facility should be regarded as a Common Foreign and Security Policy instrument and not a development tool.
The report criticises the fact that the gender dimension has not been included in the 10th EDF as a specific area of action.
The European Parliament is also against any attempt to tie to the allocation of integrated regional programme funds to participation in an Economic Partnership Agreement.
The EDF is the EU's main instrument for development cooperation with the ACP countries and the Community's overseas territories. The 10th fund, covering the period 2008-2103, has a budget of €22 682 million. Text adopted on Programming Implementation of the 10th EDF

The European Parliament reiterates that the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's bilateral name dispute with Greece should not obstruct FYROM's EU accession process in a report adopted today by 601 votes in favour, 52 against and 30 abstentions. The report by Erik Meijer (GUE/NGL, NL) on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia welcomes the government's achievements “in the implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement”, which deals with the political aspects of inter-ethnic relations in the country, while noting the “continuing discrimination against the Roma community.”
The House also welcomes the fact that the government has pledged to rebuild the mosque that was damaged in the otherwise “professional and effective” police operation in Brodec on 7 November, 2007. MEPs also commended the government’s economic performance, and the adoption of several crucial laws on prosecutors.
While welcoming the entry into force of the visa facilitation and readmission agreement between the country and the EU, MEPs underline the difficulties citizens still face when trying to enter the EU. At the same time, Members regret the signing of a bilateral immunity agreement between the US and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, granting exemption from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court in the Hague, which “contradicts EU standards and policies.”
Name dispute
On the consistently contentious issue of the country’s bilateral name-dispute with Greece, the report welcomes the increased bilateral cooperation, as well as people-to-people contacts between the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Greece.
The report notes with satisfaction that, since the adoption of Parliament's above-mentioned resolution of 12 July 2007, bilateral talks have been held in the region, under the auspices of the United Nations and assisted by Special Envoy Matthew Nimitz, with a view to finding a mutually acceptable solution to the difference that has arisen over the name of the country.
MEPs note the increased dynamics in the negotiations and call on both sides to seize the opportunity to immediately resume negotiations in light of the important progress made recently and to reach a compromise solution, so that the issue does not continue to represent an obstacle to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's membership of international organisations, as provided for in the Interim Accord of 1995, which is still in force.

Burma: broadened and more targeted sanctions needed, say MEPs
2008-04-28 - 12:50
Broadened and more targeted sanctions, a worldwide arms embargo and the release of political prisoners including Aung San Suu Kyi, recipient of the 1990 Sakharov prize, are among the demands of MEPs in a resolution adopted by Parliament on 24 April. The Burmese military junta led by General Than Shwe intends to hold a referendum on a new Constitution on May 10, 2008. According to the new Constitution, 56 military officers will be guaranteed places in the 224-member lower house of parliament. And 110 seats out of 440 in the upper house are also reserved for the military.
MEPs deplore the fact that the constitutional referendum process is devoid of any democratic legitimacy and condemns the rejection by the Burmese Government of the proposals made by the UN Special Envoy, Mr Ibrahim Gambari, to allow an open and inclusive campaign in the run-up to the constitutional referendum. The resolution was adopted with 551 votes in favour, 7 against and 8 abstentions.
Broadened and more targeted sanctions
MEPs urge the Council to renew its targeted sanctions, and to broaden them, focusing on restrictions on access to international banking services for military-owned companies, conglomerates and businesses closely linked to the military or whose earnings benefit the military, and restrictions on access to personal business opportunities, health care, shopping, and foreign education for their children for selected generals and their immediate families. The resolution also urge the Council to comprehensively and explicitly prohibit selected individuals and entities from making any financial transactions that pass through clearing-house banks or otherwise using financial services in the EU's jurisdiction.
MEPs also call on the Council to consider further targeted sanctions, such as a complete ban on new investment, a ban on the provision of insurance services for investment in Burma, and an embargo on trade in key commodities that provide significant revenue to the military government.
Political prisoners and September crackdown
The resolution calls for the "immediate and unconditional release" of political opponents of the regime and more than 1,800 political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, the leaders of the ’88 Generation Students, and the leaders of the Shan Nationalities League for Democracy arrested in 2005.
MEPs calls for the regime to account for all casualties and missing persons from last September’s crackdown on protests by Buddhist monks and democracy activists and to establish the whereabouts of missing monks and nuns.
The resolution calls on the Council to review sanctions against specific human rights benchmarks such as: the release of political prisoners and all other persons arbitrarily detained for exercising their basic human rights to free expression, association and assembly; an accurate official accounting of the numbers, whereabouts and conditions of individuals killed, arrested, and detained by the security forces.
Worlwide arms embargo
MEPs urge the EU to campaign for a worldwide arms embargo on Burma. The EU arms embargo on Burma is ineffective, as the military government purchases its military goods in China, Russia and India, says the resolution.
On the current trade negotiations with ASEAN countries, the resolution urges ASEAN to put substantive pressure on the Burmese authorities to bring about democratic change. MEPs support the efforts of the EU's special envoy on Burma, Piero Fassino, to promote dialogue with ASEAN countries. Adopted resolution on the situation in Burma

MEPs demand the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages in Colombia ahead of key summit
2008-04-28 - 12:50
In adopting a joint resolution on the Fifth EU-LAC Summit in Lima, the European Parliament reiterates its belief that action to combat terrorism must be carried out with full respect for human rights, civil liberties and the rule of law. The House demands the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages in Colombia, with priority being given to those who are sick. Parliament considers that their release should be effected by unilateral decision of the FARC or any other organisation by which they are being held or, failing that, under an emergency humanitarian exchange agreement. The resolution was adopted with 542 votes in favour 12 against and 12 abstentions.
MEPs propose that in the economic and commercial field the creation of the Euro-Latin American global interregional partnership area should be based on a model which is compatible with both the WTO and regionalism, to be applied in two stages:
(a) a first stage involving the conclusion, at the earliest opportunity, of the negotiations on the EU-Mercosur, EU-Andean Community and EU-Central America Interregional Partnership Agreement and the deepening of the existing EU-Mexico and EU-Chile agreements;
(b) a second stage, to be completed in 2012, involving the conclusion of a global interregional partnership agreement ensuring legal and institutional support and full geographical coverage for the various strands of the strategic partnership and providing for the free movement of persons and biregional trade through a deepening of both the integration agreements within Latin America and the Union's partnership process with all countries and regional groupings.
Strengthening institutional promotion and forecast mechanisms
MEPs recommend:
(a) establishing a Euro-Latin American Foundation, of a public-private nature, for the promotion of dialogue between the partners on similar lines to those already existing for other geographical areas such as Asia or the Mediterranean; calls on the Commission to draw up a detailed proposal in this sense;
(b) establishing a Biregional Centre for Conflict Prevention, dedicated to the early detection of the causes of potential violent and armed conflicts and to seeking how best to prevent them and stop them from escalating;
(c) repeats its suggestion to create a Migration Observatory responsible for permanently and closely monitoring all issues in connection with migratory flows in Latin America.
Size of the Eurolat Assembly
MEP consider it essential to strengthen the parliamentary dimension of the strategic partnership and supports the Latin American request in which the number of Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly members required in order to facilitate the inclusion of the recently constituted Mercosur Parliament is put at 150.
Finally, the House considers it essential to strengthen the parliamentary dimension of the strategic partnership and ensure suitable inclusion of the recently constituted Mercosur Parliament in the Euro-Latin American Assembly.

Green light for establishment of European satellite navigation system Galileo
2008-04-28 - 12:50
The European Parliament gave its backing to Galileo's deployment phase which paves the way for the European satellite radio navigation system to be operational by 2013. Parliament's rapporteur Etelka BARSI-PATAKY (EPP-ED, HU) said: "Galileo will be the first common European infrastructure. Galileo and EGNOS are made-in-Europe programmes and no programmes of a particular Member State or a particular company. This project is a step towards a stronger Europe." A new regulation lays down security requirements for Galileo and the European Geostationary Satellite Navigation Service (EGNOS), to be managed by the Commission and the European Global Navigation Satellite System Supervisory Authority. Galileo infrastructure contracts will be put out to competitive tender.
The deployment phase, in which all space and ground-based infrastructure is to be established, will run from 2008 to 2013. The exploitation phase will follow. The compromise text, negotiated with Council and Commission in informal meetings, took on board most of the amendments proposed by the Industry committee on 29 January.
The text was adopted by 607 votes in favour with 36 votes against and 8 abstentions.
Controlled access to security technologies
The amended regulation asks the European Commission to lay down the main technical requirements for controlling access to the technologies that provide security to Galileo and EGNOS. Member States should adopt national security regulations that guarantee at least the same level of protection for EU classified information on the two programmes as is required for the industrial security of EURATOM, says the new text. If the operation of the systems should pose a risk to the security of the EU or the Member States, joint action should be taken under the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
European GNSS Supervisory Authority will monitor security procedures
Following MEPs’ criticism that the role of the European GNSS Supervisory Authority (GSA) was not clearly set out in the Commission proposal for the deployment phase, the agency’s tasks were revised.
Originally designed to be the licensing authority for private undertakings within the public-private partnership first planned, the GSA will now instead monitor the implementation of security procedures and perform system security audits. The authority’s tasks will also include the preparation of the commercialisation of the systems, including market analysis. The Commission is asked to formally align the structures for the programmes' management with the GSA's new role.
The compromise also took on board the European Parliament's call for the Commission to guarantee the protection of personal data and privacy by integrating it into Galileo's technical set-up.
Guarantee fair competition and minimise dependence on one supplier
The regulation will also stipulate public procurement rules. Infrastructure contracts will be split into six main packages (system engineering support, ground mission infrastructure completion, ground control infrastructure completion, satellites, launchers and operations) and additional work packages. The competitive tendering of all packages should take place in a single procedure and any one company or group may bid for no more than two of the six main work packages.
In order to prevent any possible abuse of dominance or long-term dependency on single suppliers, the amended text takes up the European Parliament's suggestion to apply dual sourcing – i.e. using two different suppliers for one product. The aim of this procurement procedure is to improve the overall control of programme, cost and schedule. Moreover, at least 40% of the total value of the activities should be subcontracted to companies which do not belong to the prime contractor of any of the main work packages, says another adopted EP amendment.
High-quality services at fair prices
Galileo's deployment phase, which runs until 2013, will be entirely funded by the EU, which, by investing €3.4 billion, will become “the owner of all tangible and intangible assets created or developed under the programmes”. Member States, third countries or international organisations may provide additional funding.
In 2010, the Commission should table a proposal on the public funds and commitments needed for the exploitation phase over the next financial programming period, starting in 2014, says the compromise text. This proposal would also have to include a revenue-sharing mechanism and objectives for a pricing policy to guarantee that costumers receive high-quality services at fair prices adds the text.
Galileo Inter-institutional Panel
Given the uniqueness of the programmes and the Community’s ownership of the satellite radio navigation systems, Parliament, Council and Commission agreed to set up a new inter-institutional framework, the Galileo Inter-institutional Panel (GIP) which will be composed of three representatives each of the Council and the Parliament, and one representative of the Commission. The GIP will follow closely the implementation of the GNSS programmes, the international agreements with third countries, and the preparation of the satellite navigation markets.
Next steps
In the course of the on-going In-Orbit-Validation phase a first set of experimental Galileo satellites will be launched. The first of these satellites, GIOVE-A, was successfully launched in December 2005; the launch of GIOVE-B from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan is planned for this Sunday 27 April 2008, 00:15. Thereafter, four out of the 30 Galileo satellites will be launched to validate the functioning of space and related ground infrastructure.

Environmental impact of New Flame shipwreck off Gibraltar
2008-04-28 - 12:50
In a resolution on a recent shipwreck off the coast of Gibraltar, MEPs ask the Commission to check whether the authorities took the right measures to avoid the accident and, if not, to take legal action. They ask for information on the content of the cargo and plans for removing the vessel. They also believe the accident makes the case for tougher EU maritime safety measures. The shipwreck occurred on 12 August 2007, following a collision near the coast of Gibraltar between a double-hulled oil tanker and the bulk carrier New Flame, which resulted in the sinking of the latter. MEPs note that this kind of accident does not have the same environmental impact as that of tankers but still raises concern: the New Flame is currently lying on the seabed, containing 42,000 tonnes of load and at least 27,000 tonnes of scrap metal, and could thus affect water quality.
Legal action by the European Commission?
Parliament notes that the Government of Gibraltar, the UK and the Spanish authorities have expressed willingness to collaborate in order to manage the accident and its consequences for the maritime and coastal environment.
However, it also calls on the Commission "to verify if the competent authorities complied with their obligations" under the EC Treaty so as to avoid the disaster, and to adopt, if appropriate, "the necessary legal measures".
The resolution calls on the Commission to forward to Parliament all information on the case provided by national and regional authorities, especially on the request for anti-pollution vessels to be provided by the Community aid mechanism for civil protection assistance. Parliament also stresses that all the authorities must remain vigilant concerning potential opportunist and illegal emptying of fuel tanks and ballast waters.
More prominent EU role needed in maritime safety
MEPs emphasise the swift response by the European Maritime Safety Agency to a request for assistance from the Spanish authorities, and they stress that Parliament has frequently pushed for more resources for the Agency. They also point to the merits of the third maritime safety package, already approved by the EP but still under first reading in Council. And they call on the Commission to submit further legislation on storing bunker oil in double-hull tanks as well as other measures.
The resolution was adopted by 555 votes to 7, with 6 abstentions. Text adopted on New Flame Shipwreck

Market-based instruments for the environment
2008-04-28 - 12:50
The European Parliament adopted an own- initiative report on the Green Paper on market-based instruments for environment and related policy purposes. MEPs welcome the Green Paper but regret the absence of an in-depth analysis on the merits of differentiation between market-based instruments (MBIs) targeted at the consumer as opposed to the producer level. They also criticise the fact that the Green Paper concentrates mainly on atmospheric pollution and global warming, and by and large disregards the other negative impacts of production and distribution processes and consumption patterns on the environment.
The Commission is urged to develop a clear strategy on the use of MBIs to price environmental damage and correct related market failures. This strategy should cover taxation, the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) review, trade, and technology policy. The report was adopted with 479 votes in favour 53 against and 5 abstentions.
Polluter pays
The report recognises that MBIs constitute important tools for implementing the ‘polluter pays’ principle, and that they are one of the most effective ways of achieving environmental objectives at reasonable cost. MEPs stress, however, that these instruments cannot be a substitute for environmental legislation, which lays down targets to be achieved and standards to be complied with, and that their effectiveness depends on how they are coordinated with and complement other instruments. MEPs also take the view that social consequences resulting from the implementation of MBIs should be compensated for by specific policy measures such as floor prices, rate reductions, subsidies etc. for low-income households.
Members emphasise the important role of environmental taxation in achieving environmental objectives. MEPs particularly support proposals to allow Member States to reduce VAT rates or offer tax credits for energy efficient products and energy saving materials.
The report points out that, despite the unanimity requirement in the area of taxation, the treaties offer the possibility of enhanced cooperation, and draws attention to the existence of the open coordination method. Member States are, therefore, called upon to make progress on the issue of environmental taxation at European level in order to prevent all forms of fiscal dumping.
Members stress the urgent need for a revision of the EU ETS, which currently has too narrow a field of application given the numerous greenhouse gas (GHG) sources and sectors involved. The Commission is called to strengthen the EU ETS by establishing a progressively tightening cap and extend it to all first-tier emitters as the main means of achieving the 2020 GHG reduction targets.
The European Parliament believes that an increased use of MBIs in the transport sector is particularly important in order to fully internalise the environmental and social costs of all transport modes. The Commission is called upon to present, by 2009, a legislative proposal for GHG reduction in the area of maritime transport, which is not currently subject to any Community or international legislation in this area.
The report also welcomes the Commission's proposal to include aviation activities in the EU ETS, but considers that parallel and complementary measures, such as a kerosene tax and NOx emission charges, are necessary in order to address the climate change impacts from this sector. In addition, MEPs call for the revision of the Energy Taxation Directive to be carried out rapidly, and in conjunction with that on heavy goods vehicles, in order to bring about a rapid reorientation towards environment conscious behaviour in the various sectors of the economy.
Stressing the importance of supporting the development of passive, positive energy housing, the European Parliament calls on the Member States to strengthen their incentive policies for the construction sector, to facilitate a reduction in energy demand and CO2 emissions.
Members also call on the Commission to rapidly propose a roadmap for the gradual, but rapid, abolition of EHS in accordance with the European Council’s decision on the review of the sustainable development strategy. On this matter, they expect the Commission, when it revises the Community guidelines on state aid for environmental protection, to take proper account of the need to influence production, traffic, transport and consumption patterns, and to reduce waste.
Lastly, the report calls on the European Union to distinguish gross economic wealth per inhabitant from net economic, social and environmental wealth as the true progress indicator (TPI). The European Commission and the Member States are called upon to study in more depth the possibility of measuring European growth using ‘green’ indicators, which factor in the wealth lost as a result of environmental damage.

Preparations for the COP-MOP meetings on biological diversity and biosafety
2008-04-28 - 12:50
In adopting a resolution on preparations for the COP-MOP meetings on biological diversity and biosafety, MEP say that they are deeply concerned at the continued loss of biodiversity and at the European Union’s ever increasing ecological footprint, which extends the impact on biodiversity well beyond the borders of the European Union. The resolution was adopted with 546 votes in favour 7 against and 11 abstentions. Parliament calls on the Commission and the Member States to show leadership and conviction by agreeing to and facilitating concrete measures for the protection of biodiversity, both domestically and internationally. The report was adopted
The European Parliament urges (inter-alia) the Commission and the Member States to :
– ensure that the COP 9 decisions are geared to implementing the CBD's Programme on Protected Areas and to strengthening the implementation with a view to the 2010 targets, with particular reference to the CBD's Programme of Work on Forest Biological Diversity,
– financially support the LifeWeb Initiative aimed at matching voluntary commitments by parties for the designation and management of protected areas with voluntary commitments from donors for dedicated (co-)financing,
– consider that achieving conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity should be amongst the top priorities for COP 9,
– ensure the recognition of effective management and financing of protected areas and their network as a vital necessity, and the adoption of innovative and permanent financial mechanisms, as they contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity,
– carry out an EU impact assessment on droughts and water scarcity caused by climate change and its effects on wildlife habitats, highlighting the zones where migratory birds nest, and promoting international cooperation to protect migratory birds and the seasonal wetlands which provide them with water and food,

Towards a reform of the World Trade Organisation
2008-04-28 - 12:50
MEPs adopted a report entitled "Towards a reform of the World Trade Organisation" calling for a redefinition of the role and format of Ministerial Conferences and observes already the tendency of WTO members to prefer more informal methods of coordination and decision-making at this level and notes that no Ministerial Conference was convened in 2007. The report calls for the introduction of a more democratic system of decision-making at the WTO that takes into account the views of the entire membership, which comprises countries at varying levels of development.
Parliamentary dim ension
The committee stresses the importance of the parliamentary dimension of the WTO in order to enhance the democratic legitimacy and transparency of WTO negotiations. The report stresses the importance of the work done by the Parliamentary Conference on the WTO, which is organised jointly by the European Parliament and the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), whose activities could be stepped up.
Balanced secretariat
The report stresses that the role of the WTO secretariat is critical, and believes that it is important that the secretariat has a proportionate representation of officials from developed and developing countries in order for it to discharge its mandate more effectively.
Pre-accession
The European Parliament calls on the WTO members to consider the idea of a special pre-accession status for candidate countries which, while not having yet concluded their bilateral market access negotiations with their key partners in the organisation, pledge to take on without delay all the obligations resulting from the application of the existing rules.
The report stresses that the decision on whether or not to admit a new member country to the WTO should always be adopted on the basis of strictly commercial considerations. Text adopted on "Towards a reform of the World Trade Organisation"

More transparency and accountability needed in bodies setting international accounting standards
2008-04-28 - 12:50
MEPs are calling for improvements to the governance of the International Accounting Standards Board and the International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation to address concerns that they may lack transparency, and accountability since they are not under the control of any democratically elected parliament or government. In a report drawn up by Alexander Radwan (EPP-ED, DE) and adopted by 373 votes in favour to 21 against with 13 abstentions, Parliament welcomes the moves made by the IASB – the body which draws up the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) which EU law requires stock exchange-listed companies to use for their accounts – and the International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation – the IASB’S oversight body – have made to redress these deficiencies, but it argues that there is more to be done. A debate should be launched, it says, on integrating the IASB into the system of international governance with the IMF, OECD and World Bank.
More European representation and more public oversight
MEPs believe that since the EU is the largest jurisdiction which has adopted the IFRS, there should be more representatives of a European background in the standard setting bodies, and that all trustees of the IASB should come from nations that have signed up to the IFRS, or intend to do so.
Parliament wants to see a public oversight body set up involving all IASCF/IASB public stakeholders, including legislators and supervisors, and a body representing market participants, which would deliver an annual report on the functioning of the IASCF/IASB. Such a body could also be responsible for selecting and appointing trustees in a transparent manner with a geographically balanced representation of all stakeholders.
More use of impact assessments and involvement of stakeholders
The report urges IASB to carry out impact studies among all interested parties before adopting new accounting standards.
As for the funding of the IASB, MEPs want to ensure that all user groups are adequately involved, that there is no conflict of interest between financiers and users and that access to the standards themselves is made universal. They call on the Commission to examine whether and how it might be able to contribute to funding the IASCF/IASB.
MEPs are keen to ensure the IFRS themselves are interpreted in a consistent manner. They ask the Commission to develop an EU structure as an international partner for third country bodies on this issue and to guarantee uniform interpretation and application. They want Parliament to be seriously consulted on the IASB work programme.
IFRS for SMEs – too complicated for most
The report says that the IASB’s proposed version of the IFRS for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) is far to complicated for most of them. While it might be a transitional option for larger SMEs hoping to expand, it should not be used for enforced harmonisation of SME accounting standards on this basis. Parliament says the Commission should arrange a proper consultation procedure for an EU accounting framework for SMEs.
Convergence with GAAP and fair-value
Among other points, the report emphasises that convergence with third-country standards (such as US GAAP) must be based on a prior assessment of the impact and merits of changes for EU companies and users of financial statements. It also calls for the “fair value” principle to be limited in scope, noting that it can be costly and lead to unrealistic valuations in some circumstances.

Human rights
Human rights: Zimbabwe, Iran, Chad
2008-04-28 - 12:50
The European Parliament adopted three human rights resolutions at the end of the week's Strasbourg plenary session. In these resolutions, MEPs call for Zimbabwe's election results to be released immediately, they highlight issues of women's rights and the number of executions in Iran, and lastly they call for dialogue between government and rebel groups in Chad. Zimbabwe: democracy must prevail, say MEPs
In a resolution on Zimbabwe supported by five EP political groups but not the Socialists, Parliament calls for the immediate release of all the original results of the recent elections and for the democratic wishes of the Zimbabwean people be respected. Other African and international actors must play their part too, say MEPs.
In the wake of the elections of 29 March, the resolution "insists that the democratic wishes of the Zimbabwean people be respected" and "urges all those who wish to participate in the future of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the forces of democratic change".
It "calls on the Zimbabwean Electoral Commission immediately to release all the original election results". A similar request has been made by the South African Development Community (SADC). In addition, the Zimbabwean Government is urged "to honour its own commitments to democratic principles, human rights and the rule of law" as a signatory to various international treaties.
The post-electoral political violence against supporters of opposition parties is strongly condemned, as is the arrest of foreign journalists. MEPs call for the lifting of all restrictions on freedom of the press and assembly and for the release of the 36 citizens arrested in the course of a peaceful protest against the delayed publication of results.
The role of the international community
Parliament welcomes the recent acknowledgement by South Africa's ruling African National Congress party that Zimbabwe has entered a 'state of crisis' and "trusts that this will lead to positive action". It also calls on the African Union to help resolve the crisis.
South African dockers are commended for refusing to unload arms bound for Zimbabwe's security forces from the Chinese cargo ship An Yue Jiang. The resolution calls on all SADC countries to refuse to unload the cargo. The Chinese Government is urged to cease arms exports to Zimbabwe and to order the return of the An Yue Jiang to Chinese waters.
Lastly Parliament calls on the EU Council "to ensure that all Member States rigorously apply existing restrictive measures", but also to accelerate preparation of the emergency measures that will be put in place as soon as the democratic transformation in Zimbabwe has taken place.

Iran: continuing concern about women's rights and executions
In its resolution on Iran, Parliament criticises the deteriorating human rights situation in the country, including the sharp increase in executions, although it welcomes the release of a women's rights activist and another woman sentenced to death for adultery. The role of the Supreme Leader and the Head of the Judiciary in these and other decisions is mentioned and the Iranian parliament is urged to keep up the momentum by reforming the penal code.
MEPs first welcome the release of Khadijeh Moghaddam, a prominent women's rights and environmental activist (albeit on the high bail of 1 billion rials = €50,000), and Mokarrameh Ebrahimi, who was sentenced to death for having an extra-matrimonial. They note the role of the Supreme Leader and the Head of the Judiciary in these and other cases.
Freedom of expression and women's rights
Next, however, the resolution condemns the repression of civil society movements in Iran, including women’s rights defenders such as those involved in the One Million Signatures Campaign. It also urges the authorities to end the persecution of those peacefully exercising their right to freedom of expression and to release all prisoners of conscience.
MEPs also want the Iranian Parliament and Government "to change the discriminatory Iranian legislation which, among other things, excludes women from the most senior State offices and appointment as judges, denies them equal rights with men in marriage, divorce, child custody and inheritance, and determines that any evidence they give before a court carries only half the weight of that given by a man".
Death penalty: Iran executes more children than any other country in the world
In addition, the EP "reiterates its strong condemnation of the death penalty in general, calls for an immediate moratorium on executions in Iran and is appalled that that country continues to have the highest number of executions of child offenders in the world and that the moratorium on stoning is still not fully implemented".
A ray of hope is seen in "directives recently issued by Head of Judiciary Sharoudi on banning public executions without prior consent and detentions for long periods without charge". MEPs want the newly elected Majlis (parliament) to go further, and "speedily to pass the pending reform of the Iranian Penal Code, with the aim notably of abolishing stoning and executions of child offenders" and "to move towards a moratorium on the death penalty".
EU action
Lastly, the resolution calls on the Council and the Commission to monitor the human rights situation in Iran and to submit to Parliament in late 2008 a report with proposals for funding projects under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights.

Turmoil in Chad
Parliament's resolution on Chad, adopted by 50 votes to 1, with 5 abstentions, highlights the scale of the problems facing the country, with internal political unrest as well as a huge influx of refugees from neighbouring countries. MEPs call for dialogue between the government and rebel groups and urge the international community to boost its aid to Chad.
There are more than 250,000 Sudanese refugees in eastern Chad, over 57,000 refugees from the Central African Republic and 180,000 internally displaced persons. The government faces rebel groups (one of which briefly penetrated the capital, N'Djamena, in February) but has itself been accused of widespread human rights abuses.
Persecution of opposition condemned
Today's resolution condemns the persecution and arbitrary arrest of opposition politicians and journalists. It calls on the Chadian Government to clarify the situation of any who are still being detained and highlights the case of opposition leader Ibni Oumar Mahamat Saleh, who was arrested on 3 February 2008 and has not been heard of since.
Although crises in neighbouring Darfur (Sudan) and the Central African Republic have had a huge impact on Chad, with large numbers of refugees spilling over the borders, the EP "denounces any attempt by the Chadian Government to use Sudan and Darfur as a smokescreen for hiding political dissent within Chad".
Inclusive approach the best solution to political impasse
It "stresses the need for politics in Chad to become more ethnically and geographically representative", argues that "no lasting solution can be found without a genuine process of national reconciliation and of global dialogue" and "reaffirms that a real and comprehensive, all-inclusive inter-Chadian dialogue must be convened as soon as possible", "bringing the rebel groups into the political process".
The EP acknowledges the usefulness of the UN-approved EUFOR TCHAD/RCA military mission for guaranteeing the safety of camps for refugees and displaced persons and of humanitarian organisations. However it "regrets that, in terms of troop composition, EUFOR does not sufficiently reflect the diversity of the European Union, and calls on the Member States which have not yet done so to contribute to providing the necessary troops and matériel so as to guarantee its European identity".
More aid needed from international community
Turing to the increasingly serious humanitarian and security situation in Chad, Parliament "calls on the international community to scale up its aid to meet the 2008 Humanitarian Appeal for Chad" and "stresses that donor contributions are urgently required to ensure that purchases are completed in the coming months so that food reaches eastern Chad on time".
Lastly, Parliament calls for human rights violations to be prosecuted and punished in accordance with international human rights law. And it backs the MINURCAT mission tasked with supporting the Chadian courts and prisons systems and with training the 'Chadian police for humanitarian protection'.
