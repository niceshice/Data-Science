This afternoon MEPs will discuss the state of European culture when they meet in Brussels. One report focuses on preserving distinctive European culture and supports a cultural heritage label for things like goods and monuments. Some 6 million people work in the cultural field and the second report looks at ways of encouraging more cultural initiatives through funding and innovation.
European heritage label
Support for a European heritage label for goods, memorials and monuments is one of the proposals in the own initiative report by Portuguese MEP Vasco Gra√ßa Moura (EPP-ED).
The report also identifies literature and music as being threatened by globalisation, the former through the proliferation of best sellers and the latter through digitisation and piracy.
Another proposal is for 2010 to be made the European year to celebrate the life of Chopin and 2011 the European year of Greek and Latin classics.
The House will debate the report Wednesday afternoon.
Job creation in the cultural field
With almost 6 million people employed in the cultural field and this figure likely to grow, the report by French Socialist Guy Bono looks at ways of supporting the industry through investment in the creative economy. It envisages the creation of tax credits and VAT exemptions to encourage cultural industries.
MEPs on the culture committee would also like the European Commission to consider setting up something similar to the MEDIA programme to help digital libraries, music, theatre and publishing.
Intellectual property rules also need a rethink, according to the report, given the prevalence of digital piracy. However, it does not support draconian measures. "Criminalising consumers who are not seeking to make a profit is not the right solution to combat digital piracy,"
"The central message of this report is to find a balance between the possibility to access cultural events and content while ensuring cultural diversity and genuine income to the right holders," said Mr Bono.
MEPs back subtitles for public service TV
With more than 83 million people across the EU suffering from partial or full hearing loss, the use of sub-titles is vital for them to understand TV. This afternoon a written declaration, signed by a majority of MEPs, will be adapted, calling on public service broadcasters across the EU to provide subtitles. The BBC has already pledged to subtitle all programmes by April 2008.
