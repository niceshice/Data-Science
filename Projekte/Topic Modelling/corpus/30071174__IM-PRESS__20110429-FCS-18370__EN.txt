euro coins ©Getty Image Plenary vote 9 June 1094 amendments Are European Union countries, still facing economic crises, ready to support the ambitious EU 2020 growth strategy, or will it get tangled up in the claims of member states preoccupied by what they contribute to the budget and what they get back? And, if they do come up with a budget to support the 2020 targets, what will happen to traditional policy areas? These issues will be tackled when the EU negotiates its long-term budget, the so-called multiannual financial framework (MFF) for 2014-2020.
The MFF determines EU expenditure for the next 7 years, broken down by policy area. It will be accompanied by a new proposal on own-resources to ensure income. The Commission will present a proposal in June, which will be the starting point for discussions likely to continue well into 2012.
The Special Policy Challenges Committee (SURE) was tasked with defining the European Parliament’s position on the long-term budget ahead of negotiations with the Council. The work was divided into three phases:
Phase 1 (July-December 2010): Discussions on technical and horizontal issues (for example: the Europe 2020 strategy, the duration, structure and size of the MFF)
Phase 2 : (January-March 2011): Discussions on specific policy priorities (agriculture, cohesion, energy, development aid, external relations…)
Phase 3 (April-June 2011): Negotiations on a common EP position + vote on report
With the vote in plenary, the committee's role ended, but the EP is still involved in talks about the future shape of the budget and was one of the key players in a conference mid-October. Find out more in the first section.

Martin Schulz: "EU needs reasonable budget to boost Europe's growth at a time of austerity"
EP president Martin Schulz and Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt "The European Parliament will not accept less money for the European budget." These were the words with which the Parliament's president Martin Schulz opened the conference on the EU's long-term budget framework for 2014-2020 on 22 March. Only with a reasonable budget can Europe invest to boost growth at a time of austerity, Schulz said. He added that the EU budget should be fully funded by own resources, thus avoiding arduous negotiations with member states over national contributions.
The conference, which was attended by 42 members of 21 different national parliaments, focused on the EU's budget for 2014-2020: how it should be financed and what it should be spent on. Today, about 75% of the EU budget comes from member state contributions based on their gross national income. As a result negotiations on the EU budget centre on what each member states contributes and gets out of it. To reduce member states' contributions, the Commission has proposed a financial transaction tax and a simple value-added tax resource, which would make it easier to agree on budgets. In principle the Parliament supports both suggestions. Schulz remarked that it would not work if heads of state kept giving the EU new tasks to do while at the same time cutting the funds needed to implement the policies. Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt added that it was important to get the budget reform right, as the opportunity to do so only arises every seven years. She said that a good budget should focus on research and development, green policies and solidarity, especially with poorer regions. Jose Manuel Barroso , president of the European Commission, said the EU budget was an instrument for investment and not an investment for Brussels or the institutions. The budget would be used to support projects in regions and cities all over the EU. Budget commissioner Janusz Lewandowski said the financial transaction tax could halve member states' contributions by bringing in €54 billion for the EU budget, assuming that two-thirds of the income from the tax would go to the EU budget and one third to national budgets. Andreas Mavroyiannis , Cyprus's deputy minister for European affairs, said the real questions were being obfuscated by talks on the dependency on national contributions and member states' insistence that net contributions are not excessive. Eva Kjer Hansen , chair of the Danish parliament's European affairs committee, warned that it was not clear how the financial transaction tax would affect growth and competitiveness and that it was unlikely that it would gain the necessary support from member states. Danish Liberal Democrat MEP Anne Jensen , one of the MEPs responsible for drafting the Parliament's position on the long-term budget, said the EP wanted to have a simple system without exemptions or rebates. It was not about higher net taxes, but about focusing on the quality of the expenditure side. She said it was also important to cut national contributions. French Social-Democrat MEP Pervenche Berès said she supported the financial transaction tax as it taxes an area of activity that has thus far escaped taxation. Milan Cvikl , from the Court of Auditors, warned that revenue from the financial transaction tax was likely to be volatile, as the volume of financial transactions is subject to variation.

Parliament weighs up cost and benefits of taxing financial transactions
Figures on the proposed financial transaction tax Two-thirds of Europeans might support the idea, but that does not mean it is not controversial. Taxation commissioner Algirdas Šemeta defended the Commission's proposal for an EU-wide tax on financial transaction in front of the EP's economic committee on 20 March 2012. The Commission claims the tax will deter risky trading and ensure the financial sector pays it fair share to get the EU out of the crisis. However, critics fear it could lead to firms taking their trade elsewhere.
The financial transaction tax is sometimes referred to as a Tobin tax, as it is based on an idea by American economist James Tobin. In the 1970s he proposed a levy on currency exchange small enough to not disrupt the economy but sufficient to discourage harmful speculation. Why the financial sector is being targeted Public debt in the EU has surged from below 60% of gross domestic product to 80% due to the financial crisis. Member states had to spend €4.6 trillion to bail out the financial sector. The financial sector also enjoys a tax advantage of about €18 billion per year because there is a value added tax exemption for financial services, according to the European Commission. The proposal The European Commission proposes to have a financial transaction tax in all 27 member states to be levied on all transactions on financial instruments between financial institutions when at least one of the participants to the transaction is located in the EU. Shares and bonds would then be taxed at a rate of 0.1% and derivative contracts at a rate of 0.01%. It is believed that this tax could raise up to €57 billion a year. Benefits The Commission believes that the tax would help to shift some of the cost of the bailouts to support the financial sector away from tax payers to the companies that have benefitted from this support. In addition it could help to discourage risky trading activities, which is believed to have contributed to the development of the current economic crisis. Together with reducing competitive, the tax could assist in defusing future crises. The revenue of the tax could be shared between member states and the EU, which could use it as an own resource in order to reduce national contributions to the EU budget. Criticism Opponents of the tax believe it could lead to traders taking their business outside the EU, which would lead to job losses while the tax fails to meet its aims. Next steps The EP's economic and monetary affairs committee will scrutinise the plans before making a recommendation to MEPs, who are expected to vote on the proposal during the June plenary.

Time for radical reform on EU revenues - Lamassoure
MFF conference ©European Union 2011 "Now is the time for radical reform, to give substance to the EU Treaty provision that expenditure is to be financed by EU own resources, meaning tax resources," EP Budget Committee Chair Alain Lamassoure said during a workshop on new resources for the EU budget.
During the conference on the future financing of the EU, Thursday and Friday in Brussels, MEPs and MPs discussed the future of EU "own resources", spending priorities for the future and how to get maximum value from every euro spent from the EU budget with representatives from governments, NGOs and the European Commission.
Opening the conference, EP President Jerzy Buzek said, "we need to be able to respond better to future crises. To create jobs, we need to ensure growth, competitiveness and a strong internal market. For that we need a solid EU budget....Every euro spent from the common budget lessens the burden on national budgets."
Division remains on proposals for own resources
MEPs and MPs from several national parliaments agreed on the need to overhaul the current system of resources, but differed on how to proceed. The Commission proposal to introduce new EU own income resources like a financial transaction tax (FTT) and a new VAT system, was generally welcomed, but many speakers raised doubts about how the proposal could be put into practice and others said any tax must be global not just at EU level.
There were also concerns that a new VAT system would increase the overall tax burden.
The current EU revenue system is "extremely complex and incomprehensible to EU citizens" and should be reformed "to increase citizens' interest in what they pay for" ALDE leader Guy Verhofstadt said.
Spending priorities
Participants also agreed that funding for regional policy projects is too complex. "The challenge is not spend more, but to spend better. Resources should be better prioritised," said Peder Lundquist, the Danish Deputy Secretary for the EU budget and multiannual financial framework (MFF). He called for more "honesty" in EU spending: "If programmes do not deliver it is better to stop them."
Danish Presidency to hold a follow-up conference
The conference is a first and follows Commission proposals on new own resources and the MFF in June. Denmark takes over the rotating EU presidency from Poland in January and in response to a call from Mr Lamoussure for a conference to facilitate the "conclusions of negotiations on both own resources and the MFF" Danish European Affairs Minister Nicolai Wammen promised a follow-up conference for the first half of next year.

MEPs mixed on proposals for long-term EU budget
Barroso during the MFF debate In a lively debate, the European Commission's proposals for the long-term budget for 2014-2020 attracted many criticisms but some kudos from MEPs. Opening the debate Tuesday, EP President Jerzy Buzek said the multi-annual financial framework (MFF) would be one of the most important issues dealt with in the EP over coming months.
Commission President José Manuel Barroso said the budget won't cost more but will be more effective by focusing on shared goals aimed at bringing growth and employment and directly linked to the EU's 2020 growth strategy. "Without growth we can't get back on the path to prosperity." By linking policies and seeking synergies "a euro spent at EU level can mean savings at member state level," he said.
The next MFF is "the most important and most challenging task of the Polish presidency" Secretary of State for European affairs and economic policy Mikołaj Dowgielewicz said, promising that "the EP is going to be briefed and debriefed on every debate". The Polish presidency has invited EP representatives to participate in an informal meeting for European Affairs ministers in July in Poland, he added.
Salvador Garriga Polledo , for the EPP, regretted the freezing of the budget. The failure to include the 5% increase of 5% as demanded by MEPs "will leave us without any margin for negotiating with the Council if it finally rejects the proposal of the Commission and reduces the resources," he said.
Green group leader Daniel Cohn-Bendit also criticised the budget freeze and backed a financial transaction tax to increase the EU's own resources. "If you take 1% of all financial transactions you would have €20-30 billion. It would be a new tax and it would not be for the ordinary man to pay, but for the financial institutions that profit massively from the EU."
Martin Schulz , leader of the S&D group, accused many EU governments of a schizophrenic approach to budget negotiations. "Many member states want the EU to fulfil more European tasks with less money - that will not work!" He called on Parliament to back the Commission with a huge majority to fend off countries who want to cut the budget. "This debate will be decisive for the future of Europe," he said.
Miguel Portas for the GUE/NGL group said Europe needs a real budget to solve its problems and stressed the importance of a financial transaction tax, wondering why it took the Commission so long to back the idea.
Liberal leader Guy Verhofstadt was much more positive, saying that Mr Barroso had lived up to his promise of a bold and radical MFF based on own-resources. Now the main task will be to win public support in the face of "wrong arguments" from those against own resources, Mr Verhofstadt said. Own resources are not extra taxes, but a way for the public to have direct control over the EU budget, he said. A claim disputed by Martin Callanan of the ECR, who said, "nobody believes you when you say that more European taxes will result in less contributions from Member States."
"This MFF proposal is yet another wish list by a European elite that every day becomes more and more distant from the concerns of ordinary people," Mr Callanan said. A budget freeze is the right way to go at a time of austerity across Europe, he added.
Marta Andreasen for the EFD was even more critical. The MFF is "an effective increase of 11%", she said, criticising the proposals as misleading and lacking in transparency. "The previous MFF was supposed to make the EU the most competitive knowledge based economy in the world and look what happened with that...is this supposed to get us out of the current crisis."

2014-2020 budget freeze not possible unless agreed policies are slashed
Salvador Garriga Polledo The European Parliament has issued a challenge to the Member States who want to freeze the EU's next long-term budget covering the period 2014-2020. These countries should spell out which priorities they would drop as a consequence of the freeze, say MEPs. If all the objectives and policies agreed for the EU are to be completed, a minimum increase of 5% is needed compared to the 2013 budget, says Parliament.
"We have to put an end to this bad habit of entering into a political commitment without having enough funding to back this... Reducing the EU budget is not a viable option for those of us who believe in a competitive Europe" said Salvador Garriga Polledo (EPP, ES), the MEP responsible for the report on the seven-year budget, known as the multiannual financial framework (MFF) or financial perspective.
"The MFF needs to reflect the EU 2020 strategy and other agreed policies. When we are asking for increases, it is not because we are inventing things. We just want a realistic and implementable budget", added Jutta Haug (S&D, DE), chair of Parliament's Special Committee on Policy Challenges, which had worked for a year to produce the report. The resolution embodying the committee's conclusions was adopted on Wednesday by 468 votes to 134, with 54 abstentions.
Fears for research, infrastructure and other policies
MEPs feel that freezing future budgets at the 2013 level "is not a viable option". An increase of at least 5% over the 2013 level - as they propose - would mean that the EU budget would be roughly 1.11% of the EU's total GNI, compared to the 1.06% expected for 2013.
MEPs urge the Member States who advocate a frozen or reduced long-term budget to state exactly which policy priorities they want to drop in order to make room for a budget cut. Parliament fears that budget restrictions could jeopardise the already agreed boost for research and innovation (from today's 1.9% of GDP to 3%) as well as investment in infrastructure, foreign policy and enlargement.
Regional policy (cohesion and structural funds) and farm spending should remain at current levels, says the resolution. Regarding regions whose GDP per capita stands at between 75% and 90% of EU GDP, MEPs urge the Commission to establish an intermediary category for the next budget period to give these regions a clearer status and more security in their development. Furthermore, investment in energy infrastructure should go up. Savings could possibly be made on EU administration, for instance, if the European Parliament were to have a single seat.
New resources, no more rebates
MEPs criticise the current funding system, which relies almost entirely on national contributions and has become extremely complex. The EU Treaty says that the EU-budget "shall be financed wholly from own resources". The current funding method places disproportionate emphasis on net balances between Member States, contradicts the principle of EU solidarity, dilutes the European common interest and largely ignores the advantages of financing policies at EU level, they argue.
A system of real own resources would be "fairer, more transparent, simpler and equitable", say MEPs, whilst at the same time stressing that budget reform need not affect the size of the budget and would not increase the overall tax burden on citizens. They also call for an end to the "rebates, exceptions and correction mechanisms" that have accumulated within the current system.
Flexibility
One problem with the current MFF is the lack of flexibility it allows within annual budgets. If something new or unexpected comes up, it is hard to adapt the budget to accommodate it. MEPs would therefore like to see a "global MFF margin" to be created, consisting of unused margins, de-committed and unused appropriations from the previous year.
Next steps
Parliament is the first EU institution to set out its position on the next long-term budget. On 29 June, the Commission is to table two proposals, one on the next MFF and the other on own resources. Negotiations will then begin. The current multi-annual financial framework ends in 2013.

EU budget for 2014-2020 should rise at least 5%: SURE Committee
A chip for an electron microscope The policy challenges committee called for an increase of at least 5% in the EU's next long term budget over 2013 levels and new sources of income in a vote on 25 May. They said freezing future budgets, as demanded by some EU countries, is not a viable option, adding that the budget structure must clearly reflect the EU 2020 sustainable growth strategy.
When adopting the report by Salvador Garriga Polledo, MEPs on the so-called SURE Committee also called for an end to all rebates, exceptions and corrective measures. They highlighted the following budget areas as key:
more money for research and innovation (up to 3% of GDP 1.9%)
more investment in energy infrastructure
maintaining funding for regional policy and agriculture at current levels
investment in foreign policy priorities and enlargement
New resources system
The MEPs criticised the current funding system, which relies almost entirely on national contributions from EU countries, placing a "disproportionate emphasis on net balances between member states". They want a "real own resources system" that would be "fairer, more transparent, simpler and equitable" and would not increase the overall tax burden on EU citizens and that would mean an end to the "rebates, exceptions and correction mechanisms" in the current system.
Structure, duration of long-term budget
In order to bring the budget into line with the EU 2020 sustainable growth strategy, the committee called for the future budget structure to be organised around the following headings and subheading:
1. Europe 2020, including
1a - Knowledge for growth
1b - Cohesion for growth and employment
1c - Management of natural resources and sustainable development (including agriculture)
1d - Citizenship, freedom, security and justice
2. Global Europe
3. Administration
The committee also proposes a special place in the budget for large strategic investment projects like Galileo (satellites) and ITER (nuclear fusion).
They suggest one more 7-year budget cycle as a transitional solution, followed by 5-year-cycles, starting in 2021 to bring it into line with the parliamentary term.
One problem with the current Multi-Annual Financial Framework (MFF) is the lack of flexibility it allows within annual budgets. If something new or unexpected comes up, it is hard to adapt the budget to accommodate it. To create a more flexible budget, MEPs want a "global MFF margin" to be created, which can be drawn upon in the context of the annual budgetary procedure.
What's next
The report will be debated in plenary 8 June and voted 9 June. The Commission is due to come up with the proposals on the next long-term budget and a new own resources system 29 June.

Jutta Haug: Defining an EP-position on the long term budget
ITW Jutta Haug The Special Committee on Policy Challenges (SURE) was set up last year to define Parliament's position ahead of negotiations on the next long-term EU budget covering 2014 – 2020. We talked to Committee Chair, German Socialist Jutta Haug about the EP's priorities and its ability to influence negotiations.
Ms Haug hopes to be able to present a clear EP position on the long term budget by the summer. "On 9 June we will hopefully have a Parliament position for negotiations with the Council on the next MFF. Rapporteur Salvador Garriga Polledo and I are keen to have the support of three quarters of members for the report. With three quarters of the votes, we can really go out and say: This is the Parliament’s position."
A budget in line with EU 2020 targets
So far more than 1000 amendments have been tabled to the draft report, but Ms Haug is confident that the Parliament will be able to get a strong common position. She stressed the importance of "streamlining the EP-position (in line with) the targets of the Europe 2020 strategy ” and thereby creating "smart, inclusive and sustainable" growth. If the ambitious EU 2020-targets are to be met, there must be a reliable budget. "We simply can't come along with less money than in the current MFF".
Cohesion and agriculture account for about 75% of the total EU budget. "We need the necessary budget to reform these policies. There must be a fairer distribution among and within member states, for example when it comes to direct payments to farmers. And the cohesion policy needs to be continued. It's a clear vision that poor regions have to close the gap with richer ones. They need help, not only with money, but also with ideas, guidelines and legislation. This all happens within cohesion policy," she said.
More money for research and innovation is another priority. "We not only need more money for research and innovation as such, but also for applied sciences," she said, underlining the importance of better cooperation between small and medium sized companies and universities to "transform European intervention into commercial products...We need this for the competitiveness of the European Union".
New own resources system to strengthen European unity
The "own resources" budget system (eg EU taxes and levies) has largely been replaced by national contributions, which has placed a "disproportionate emphasis" on the battle between net payers and net receivers in the Council, Ms Haug said. A "real own resources system" would mean that the budgetary decision-making process would focus more on European visions and priorities than on net balances.
"We need to get rid of this geographical system, so you no longer can say: this is German money, this is Finish money and this is Danish money and say instead, this is money from European citizens and European enterprises. We need to create a real own resources system. I don’t know why the Council is so reluctant. The finance ministers and heads of states should acknowledge that they would be able to avoid a lot of discussions between net payers and net receivers… I really hope that at least some of the member states will follow our approach and convince the others to change the current income system," she said.
Lisbon Treaty opens door to more EP influence
Historically the Parliament had very limited influence over long term budget discussions. "The last three MFFs were negotiated in the Council after the 'night of the long knives'. When the Council presented their results, we could only say yes or no," Ms Haug said.
The Lisbon Treaty states that the long term budget has to be set up by the Council after the consent of the EP. "This is the door through which we will try to influence negotiations in the Council. I hope that the Hungarian Presidency will come up with a proposal on how negotiations with the Parliament will take place. The Hungarian, Polish, Danish and Cypriot presidencies have already confirmed that they are willing to negotiate with us." Jutta Haug
History of own-resources system
Budget vote 13-12-1979 The EU's "own resources" budget system has gradually been replaced by gross national income-related contributions from EU countries, which has fuelled intensive battles between net payers and net receivers. MEPs on the SURE Committee want to shift to a "more European" and "less intergovernmental" income system for the EU budget. Read on for a short overview of the history of the EU's own resources system.
1951-1970: From national contributions to the emergence of own resources
The European Coal and Steel community (ECSC), set up in 1951, was financed through direct levies on coal and steel production.
When the European Economic Community (EEC) was set up in 1957, it didn’t have any own resources so was financed by a mixture of levies and contributions from the six founding countries.
The first levies were on agriculture in 1962, when the Common Agricultural Policy was established, but were insufficient to finance the EEC so member states continued to make financial contributions.
In 1970 the Treaty of Luxembourg expanded the EP's budgetary power, giving it the last word on "non-compulsory expenditure" (essentially everything but agriculture, which made up the biggest part of the budget). It also replaced member state contributions with "the Communities' own resources" - customs duties, agricultural levies and an annually adjusted percentage of the harmonized VAT base.
1970-1988: own resources system
EU countries were responsible for collecting and transferring levies to the Commission, but often had little interest in ensuring that the own resources system was functioning correctly. Collection costs were estimated at an average of 5%, and after some years it was decided that countries could deduct collection costs directly and transfer just 90%.
From 1975-1985 the system was based on a maximum of 1 % of VAT, but in 1985 the Council raised the ceiling to 1.4%.
Growing tensions over financing led to the annual budget being rejected in 1979, 1982 and 1984.
1988-1999: 4th own resource
To put a stop to the annual fight over the budget, Commission President Jacques Delors came up with the idea of a long-term EU budget, known as the financial perspective, which imposed annual ceilings on payments and commitments for the Community’s own resources over a five-year period.
In addition, a proportion of each member state’s gross national product was added as a fourth own resource . The idea was to match member state payments more closely with their economic wealth.
The aim of the long-term budget was to ensure the budgetary stability necessary for the establishment of the internal market, but this meant a loss of influence for the Parliament as the fourth own resource created a more intergovernmental structure.
1999-2011: "net contributor", "net beneficiary"
Member states began to advertise their net positions and define who was paying the most. Individual "contributions" began to appear in national budgets, putting European funds in competition with national spending and leading to an erosion of the "own resources" concept.
Over recent years, there have been significant changes to the own resources system. In 1999 the amount EU countries could deduct from traditional own resources rose to 25% and in 2004 the maximum VAT-based payment was cut to 0.5%. Income from customs duties and agricultural levies has dropped, meaning the GNI resource is now by far the largest source of income for the EU budget at about 75% in 2010 (compared with 40% in 2000).
Need for reform
SURE committee members hope for a return to the "old own resources spirit" of 1957, with a clear aspiration for "financial autonomy". MEPs also want 1% EU VAT (1%), an EU carbon tax and a financial transaction tax in order to secure a more independent and less intergovernmental EU-budget.
