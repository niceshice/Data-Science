MEPs want foreign calls capped at 40 cent a minute
A new "Euro-tariff" that could take up to 70% off the cost of roaming charges was last week backed by Parliament's Industry Committee. It proposes a flat rate of 40 cent a minute anywhere in the EU and with a vote in full plenary due on 9 May, lower mobile phone costs while abroad are a step closer. The two largest blocs in the Parliament - the European People's Party (EPP) and the Socialists (PES) both welcomed the deal which was hailed as a compromise between consumers and businesses.
Parliament's rapporteur Paul Rübig said that "roaming charges are set to tumble - this is a major success for European consumers and a clear signal to Europe's telecom industry" said the EPP member. The Vice-President of the PES Robert Goebbels called it "a victory that will help consumers right across the EU for many years to come".
You Roam in, for example, Rome, - and then you pay the price
Most of us know the story, you go abroad on holiday or for a business trip and at some point we either make or receive a telephone call. When the bill comes the charges are normally a lot higher than the rate you pay at home. According to the European Commission, roaming costs for consumers can be as much as five times the amount they cost the operators for the service. At present roaming costs vary enormous from one EU country to another - ranging form €0.58 to €5 euro a minute.
The number of people affected by high roaming charges is enormous with 147 million people making or receiving calls while abroad last year.
"Roaming revenue" for operators is considerable - worth an estimated 8.5 billion euro a year to the telephone industry.
40 cent max to make calls: 15 to receive them
Intense discussions surrounded the setting of the Euro-tariff with MEPs finally agreeing to a 40 cent a minute cap for phone calls and a 15 cent cap for calls received. Both of these will be subject to VAT. The Committee agreed that "all existing and new roaming customers shall automatically be accorded a Euro-tariff", unless they "opt-out" for a cheaper operator package. They can switch to and from a Euro-tariff at no charge within 30 days.
In addition to this MEPs would also like operators to introduce a system whereby consumers would be informed by automatic SMS of the cost of calls whenever they enter another country. This would go hand in hand with extra information about tariffs across the EU. Part of this information campaign would be a "price simulator" for consumers.
However, it was decided that roaming regulation would not cover data communication services and that, for now, SMS and MMS would not be regulated.
So, what happens next?
The next step is a vote in plenary on 9 May where the full House gets a say on the Industry Committee's proposal. Following that, EU ministers will discuss the Parliament's amendments when they meet in June. If they reject the proposals it will go to a second legislative reading which will take more time.
The main bones of contention are how the "opt out" and opt-in" choices will work and the exact level of the tariff. At present the proposals for the tariff from the Parliament, Council and Commission range from 40 to 52 cents to make a call and 15 to 25 cent to receive one.
Nevertheless, the price of using a phone whilst abroad is certain to fall dramatically soon - good news for Europe's consumers!
