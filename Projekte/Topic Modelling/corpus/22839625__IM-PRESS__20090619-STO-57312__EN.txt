The image, taken by Sicilian photographer Mimi Mollica, has been chosen as the best of those submitted over the last seven months. Mimi took the photo to draw attention to the plight of thousands of migrants who die en-route from Africa in hope of a better life in Europe. It was one of many excellent entries we received after asking you to send us your photos on issues ranging from pollution to the European elections.
Some of the photos were of a Spanish woman lost in prayer, a father and son walking down a cobbled road and of a Polish student voting in Denmark. All of the photos can be found on "Flickr" photo account you can access through the first link below.
