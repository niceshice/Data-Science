Visiting vibrant Vilnius
Lithuania's capital Vilnius will complete the pairing for 2009. With a population of almost 600,000 Vilnius is covered by forests and ancient churches, which were later transformed into museums by the communists.
Two rivers cross the city: Neris and Vilnelė. The town also has a self styled "republic" inside it - the "Užupis Republic" inhabited by artists who celebrate its independence on April 1. The sculpture of an angel is a well known moment in the area.
The year of culture kicked off with a modern music and dance project followed by a music and light show directed by Gert Hof.
The highlights for the forthcoming year include "Art in Unusual Places", "Vilnius Book Fair", "Street Musician Day" and "The Oak Mystery" (theatre and music performance). As Lithuania celebrates its millennium in 2009, other events like The Millennium Song Festival of Lithuania "Songs of the Centuries" are also not to be missed.
What is it all about?
The European Capitals of Culture project began in 1985 with Athens taking the first plaudits. The objective was to highlight the diversity of the continent's cities but also the shared characteristics of the different cultures.
The high profile award can enable chosen cities to transform their tourism and cultural industries, attracting grander and more high-brow projects. MEPs from the Parliament's Culture Committee play a role in selecting the final winners.
