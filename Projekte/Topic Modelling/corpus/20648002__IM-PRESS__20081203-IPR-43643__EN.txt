Parliament adopted a resolution on the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports strongly criticises the current political impasse on the non-adoption of the Common Position and urges the French Presidency, and otherwise the forthcoming Presidencies, to resolve the issue by ensuring that the Common Position is adopted without further delay.
The adoption of the Common Position will make the Code a legally binding arms export control instrument for all EU Member States. This year marks the tenth anniversary of the EU Code on Arms Exports, yet, despite calls from Parliament, the failure of the Council to adopt the Common Position since 2005 has left "the issue unresolved".
Parliament is convinced that the adoption of the Common Position on the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports to third countries is vital for the orderly implementation of the future Directive on intra-Community transfers of defence-related goods and for an efficient control of arms exports.
EU to gain in credibility
The resolution reiterates that the EU's contribution to an internationally binding Arms Trade Treaty will strongly gain in credibility as soon as its own arms exports regime becomes legally binding.
Parallel measures to be taken
Parliament also stresses that the following measures should be taken in parallel with the adoption of the Common Position:
(a) preventing irresponsible arms transfers by a strict application of the Code's criteria to both companies and national armed forces;
(b) preventing illegal arms trafficking by air and sea; improving and applying brokering controls by calling on all Member States that have not yet done so to incorporate the letter and spirit of the 2003 EU Common Position on the control of Arms Brokering into their national legislations;
(c) prompt investigation of recent allegations relating to violations of arms embargoes;
(d) preventing the selling-off to private brokers of arms collected in the course of ESDP and SSR operations and other EU initiatives, and their subsequent transfer to other regions of violent conflict or tension;
(e) improving the transparency and quality of data submitted by EU Member States in the context of the Annual Report on the Code of Conduct.
