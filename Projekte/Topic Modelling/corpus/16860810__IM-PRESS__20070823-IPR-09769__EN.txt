How to match national fleets to existing resources?

In a report adopted in the European Parliament on Member States' efforts to achieve a sustainable balance between fishing capacity and fishing opportunities, the House calls on the Commission to adopt the relevant initiatives for the possible transition from a fleet management system based on restricting vessel tonnage and power to a scheme under which fishing effort can be controlled through management by "geographical fishing areas"
The Commission's annual report on Member States' efforts to achieve a sustainable balance between fishing capacity and fishing opportunities describes the situation of the fleet and its development over 2003-2005, broken down by data for the continental fleet and for the fleet in the outermost regions, together with a series of assessments of the content of reports forwarded by national administrations. The report drawn up by Paulo CASACA (PES, PT), adopted in plenary, relates to this information.
MEPs urge the Commission rapidly to submit proposals for guidelines that will ensure that the Member States present "harmonised information making it possible to carry out comparative analyses of developments in the various national fleets" and provide each of the Member States with disaggregated information on the level of catches by vessels operating in its coastal areas.
The EP considers it "unacceptable" that Member States fail to comply with their obligations to gather and forward data in relation to matching their fishing capacity to the state of stocks and calls on the Commission to "consider this non-compliance as serious misconduct and penalise it accordingly", as is the case for fishermen's obligations as regards catch data..
States with large fleets such as Italy and France were late submitting their reports, and one of the main states, the United Kingdom, did not submit any report at all, notes the rapporteur.
Management by geographical fishing areas
In view of the current situation and the continuing existence of overcapacity, "it might be desirable to reconsider the usefulness of the current schemes for bringing the Community fleet into line with fishing opportunities, leaving room in the Community policy on fisheries conservation and management for other more efficient systems which may themselves lead to capacity reductions even greater than those laid down by Community legislation", states the report.
MEPs call on the Commission to adopt the relevant initiatives for the possible transition from a fleet management system based on restricting vessel tonnage and power to a scheme under which fishing effort can be controlled through management by geographical fishing areas and the use of appropriate technical measures for the sustainable management of resources.
The Commission should also submit proposals to improve the safety of small-scale coastal and artisanal fishing vessels in the EU aimed at increasing the size and power of engines and renovating vessels so as to improve the hygiene and safety conditions on board, "without thereby implying an increase in fishing effort."
Protect the marine environment and rebuild fish stocks
The report reiterates the need for a "more wide-ranging approach" to measures to protect the marine environment and rebuild fish stocks, in particular by considering and studying certain factors which have a significant impact on the marine environment and the state of fish stocks, such as coastal and offshore pollution, industrial and agricultural effluents, bottom dredging and maritime transport, to complement current management methods. According to the EP, a Community initiative in this area is a "priority.".
There has been a gradual reduction in the overall capacity and power of the fleet (approximately 2% per year) but "there has been no reduction in the level of exploitation of stocks", notes the report, since the technical improvements made to vessels cancel out or exceed the possibilities as regards yield and fishing effort that these "modest reductions" represent.
"Member States are still not sufficiently involved in matching the size of the fleet to the available resources", says the rapporteur. "Perhaps in view of the economic and social consequences of adopting measures which would be consistent and necessary but also highly unpopular, the Member States are pursuing a policy of 'laisser faire, laisser passer', in the hope that normal developments, the ever sharper fall in catches, will themselves cause the fleet to cease operating owing to the lack of any economic interest, since exploiting the resources will no longer be viable", he adds.
The EP underlines that dialogue and the industry's participation in all measures laid down to achieve a balance between the fleet and the state of resources are essential conditions if these measures are to prove effective.
Specific Regional Advisory Council for the outermost regions
With regard to the capacity of the fleets registered in the outermost regions and its variation between 2003 and 2005, the results show that the fleet registered in the Spanish and Portuguese outermost regions has been significantly reduced both in terms of tonnage and power. For the French overseas departments there has been a slight decrease in the total number of vessels and their tonnage and an increase in power.
The EP calls on the Commission to submit a proposal for the setting-up of a specific Regional Advisory Council for the outermost regions of the EU.
