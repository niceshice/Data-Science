How to make labour law fit for the 21st century?
Employment policy
2007-06-19 - 09:43
"If labour law is to meet the challenges of the 21st century, it must focus to a large extent on employment security throughout a worker's life rather than protecting particular jobs", says an own-initiative report adopted by the Employment Committee on Monday. MEPs call for active labour policy that makes it easier to find a job, and to move from one job to another.
This non-binding report states that EU labour law should reinforce employment contracts of an indefinite duration as the general form of employment. Any non-standard forms of work, such as fixed-term contracts, temporary contracts obtained through employment agencies, recurring freelance contracts and project contracts, should go hand-in-hand with support for workers who find themselves in transit from one job to another. So for example, during this transition period, when it is "strictly necessary to become more employable through experience of training and re-qualification", workers should be entitled to some level of income support.
This own-initiative report was adopted by 40 votes in favour, with one against and five abstentions.
"Sufficiently flexible" working time arrangements
Working time arrangements should be "sufficiently flexible" to meet the needs of employers and employees and to enable people to better balance work and family life, as well as to safeguard competitiveness and improve the employment situation in Europe, says the report, drafted by Jacek Protasiewicz (EPP-ED, PL) .
MEPs also call on Member States to remove the restrictions on access to their labour markets, so as to improve worker mobility within the EU.
Reduce administrative burdens
Furthermore, the report stresses the need to simplify administrative procedures for firms, and especially for new and small and medium-sized enterprises. "Excessive administrative burdens" could deter employers from taking on new workers even during times of economic growth, it notes. To combat exploitation of undocumented workers, labour law should be better enforced and legal employment should be made easier, states the text.
Implement existing legislation
Committee members regret that existing EU rules are not properly implemented or enforced. Member States should, for instance, review and adapt their social security systems and implement active policies to invigorate the labour market. MEPs also believe it important to achieve "a degree of consistency" in the field of labour law, which may be achieved though collective agreements and the open method of co-ordination.
