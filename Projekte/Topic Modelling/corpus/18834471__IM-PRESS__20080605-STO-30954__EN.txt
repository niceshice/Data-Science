The future of Europe's electricity market could be looking up Green energy, more choice and lower prices - that is the aim of the "3rd energy package" currently before Parliament. Next week in Strasbourg MEPs will have their say on two proposals on electricity and the proposed creation of an EU-wide Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators. A key measure on the table is liberalising Europe's gas and electricity markets by separating production and supply.
In a vote on 28 May, MEPs on the Industry Research and Energy Committee backed a report drafted by British Conservative MEP Giles Chichester calling for an "Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators" with regulatory powers - contrary to the Commission's original plan which favoured more of a coordination role.
Call for an accountable agency
Industry MEPs want the Agency to be fully accountable - reporting regularly to the House and with an EP vote on the Director. The Industry Committee also says it should be based in Brussels, although a final decision on the headquarters is up to EU heads of state and government.
The Agency will have a key role is setting guidelines for the energy market. The proposal envisages distribution networks called "European Network on Transmission System Operators for Electricity" (ENTSOE). They would be responsible for:
security rules, including interoperability and procedures for emergency situations
grid connection and access rules
cross-border capacity allocation and congestion management rules
network-related transparency rules
energy efficiency rules
a 10-year investment plan
What is the 3rd energy package?
At the heart of the 3rd energy package are plans to separate the operation of gas pipelines and electricity networks ("unbundling") from production. In practice it would mean that companies cannot generate power and own the grid. This division of production and supply is intended to allow more competition into the energy market and encourage investment in outdated infrastructure. The hope is that it will also increase investment in renewable energy. In a resolution adopted by the European Parliament last July, MEPs supported the principle of unbundling.
On Tuesday 17 June MEPs will debate and vote on the Energy agency and on an "internal market in electricity" (drafted by British Socialist Eluned Morgan) and "conditions for access to the network for cross border exchanges in electricity" - where the rapporteur Spanish MEP Alejo Vidal-Quadras (EPP-ED).
