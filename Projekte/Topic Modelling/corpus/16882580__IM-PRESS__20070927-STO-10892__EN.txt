Desertification is an increasing problem
Climate change features big on the European Parliament agenda this week with over 200 MEPs and MPs gathering to discuss climate change management on Monday and Tuesday, a hearing on global warming and desertification on Wednesday and a meeting of the temporary committee on climate change on Thursday. You can watch some of the events live via the live video link below.
The Joint Parliamentary meeting will be on "climate change - rising to the challenge." It will consider national concepts, European and national strategies on renewable energies, best practices and the reduction of emissions in the building sector by modernising public and private housing.
The meeting, organised by the EP and the Portuguese Assembleia da República, will be chaired by the Presidents of the two Parliaments: Hans-Gert Pöttering and Jaime Gama. Guest speakers include Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas and Portugal's Environment Minister Francisco Nunes Correia. Commission President José Manuel Barroso will give a statement on Tuesday.
MEPs and MPs from EU countries and from candidate countries will attend. Watch live from 1500 Monday and 0900 Tuesday .
“Stop desertification: together we can!”
Africa has learned to live with dry lands and strong, brief rains, but climate change is aggravating these problems and changing traditional weather patterns. One consequence is growing desertification and the degradation of land in dry regions. Over 250 million people are directly affected and about 1 billion people worldwide are at risk. On Wednesday the Development Committee and the Temporary Committee on Climate Change, will discuss the magnitude of the problem and what the EU should do with representatives from Africa and from international organisations.
Climate change committee
In a meeting on Thursday, the Temporary Committee on Climate Change will discuss ways to limit climate change to 2 degrees Celsius, ahead of the 13th Conference of countries that have signed the Kyoto protocol, in Indonesia 3-14 December. It will also discuss the future of international efforts to stop climate change after 2012, when the Kyoto protocol expires.
Renewable Energy House
In the final event of this week on climate, EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering will visit the Renewable Energy House in Brussels on Friday. The house is a showcase for the integration of innovative renewable energy technologies in a 120-year-old building, which now hosts the offices of European organisations for renewable energy.
