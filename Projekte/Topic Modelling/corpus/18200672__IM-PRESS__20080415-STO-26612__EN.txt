Guy Bono MEP doesn't want non-profit pirates criminalised
The music and film industry is reeling from the impact of online piracy. The film industry alone believes it loses up to 40% of revenue a year. In the UK, France and Germany, governments are pushing for tougher EU treatment of internet pirates. But is this too tough for people who download music for pleasure? On 10 April MEPs backed a report by French Socialist Guy Bono against criminalising people who are not committing piracy for profit. We spoke to him about his report.
Your report calls on EU states to avoid measures such as the "interruption of internet access" to fight digital piracy. Why are you against blocking access to the internet for software pirates?
It goes against people's freedoms and human rights: to cut internet access for those who illegally download material we would need to access their computers and to filter their data, which is an attack on privacy .
Around 80% of people who download materials are youngsters who do not feel they are doing something really illegal. A couple of warnings will not stop them from doing that. It is natural that people exploit the possibilities of the internet! In my youth there was a similar problem with cassettes: we would get a CD from friends and copy it to a tape. This did not kill the disc.
Some measures which have been suggested are disproportionate to the act of downloading. Depriving young people of the internet is a disaster: who can find a job without the internet these days? Of course, if a person profits, sanctions have to be applied. But in that case there is no need to access sensitive data to know who did it. Illegal downloading is done by only 13% of population – it is not as catastrophic as they say. The CD/DVD industry is in crisis, there's no doubt about it, and downloading contributes to it. However, it is not the only cause. Criminalising internet users won't solve the industry crisis.
What is the most efficient way to combat digital piracy?
I think that we need to gather consumers, artists and telecom operators around the table. The EU could set up a program equivalent to MEDIA (which supports cinema) for the disc industry. VAT rates for cultural products could be decreased. Telecom operators also have their share to pay: the internet is a source of major revenue for them while creating losses for artists.
Let's be harsh with those making money from piracy, but let's not have imprisonment - it is not murder! Downloading must be accompanied by financial compensation. Illegal downloading resembles leaving a TV within a reach of a child saying that he has no right to touch. It's human nature – we end up doing it. After explaining that this should not be done the kid will do it once or twice, but finally he will understand it is not allowed. Here we have a similar situation. With the right education we can reduce the extent of illegal downloading.
Is illegal downloading stealing from the artist?
As long as this is not done for profit, young artists are actually favourable to downloading, as this is a way to make themselves known. Those who are already well established are mostly unhappy about it. We have to ge up-to-date, our time is about using the internet: why block access? What’s the use of cutting the internet subscription of a youngster? Prohibition never solved anything.
