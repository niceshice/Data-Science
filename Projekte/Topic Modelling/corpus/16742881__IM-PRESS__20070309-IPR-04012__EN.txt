In a resolution on non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament adopted by a large majority, the House calls upon all States whose activities violate the non-proliferation regime to stop their behaviour and to comply fully with their obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The EP wants to be better informed and involved in the preparation of the forthcoming 2010 NPT Review Conference.
While reaffirming that the NPT is the cornerstone of the global nuclear nonâ€‘proliferation regime, they urge the Presidency to produce regular progress reports in the years leading up to the 2010 Review Conference on the implementation of each of the 43 measures adopted in the EU Common Position of 25 April 2005 relating to the 2005 NPT Review Conferenc e.
The EP wants to send a delegation to Vienna to participate in the NPT PrepCom which will take place in Vienna from 30 April to 11 May 2007. The resolution also asks the Presidency to include representatives of the European Parliament in the EU delegation (a precedent set by the delegation to the UN Program of Action Review Conference in New York in 2006)
Finally, the European Parliament invites the Council and the Commission to clarify the steps they envisage to strengthen the Non-Proliferation Treaty and to pursue multilateralism, as set out in the December 2003 EU Strategy against the Proliferation of Materials and Weapons of Mass Destruction .
