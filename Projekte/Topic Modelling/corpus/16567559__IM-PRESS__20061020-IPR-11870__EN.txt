MEPs approved a recommendation for second reading on the European Payment Order, a procedure designed to speed up the settlement of cross-border payment claims.
The aim of the European Payment Order (EPO) is to enable individuals and businesses to enforce uncontested payments using an EU-wide standard procedure. Under the new regulation it will be possible, for example, to claim payment of unpaid bills for purchases made via mail orders or Internet retailers through a simple procedure.
The current situation is a burden on many businesses, which find it difficult to deal with unfamiliar legal procedures in foreign countries. They experience delays and unexpected costs in recovering debts.
Small businesses in particular should benefit from a simpler and cheaper procedure for pursuing payments across the EU. The EPO will only apply to cross-border cases and cannot be used for property disputes arising from a matrimonial relationships and wills.
At first reading, MEPs amended the Commission proposal to further simplify the procedure. They wanted to ensure that the application forms to introduce a European Payment Order, annexed to the regulation, were user-friendly, suitable for on-line use and required a minimum of free text.
Parliament is satisfied with the outcome of negotiations with Member States, as the Council accepted all Parliament's first-reading amendments. The draft regulation will become law at this second reading stage.
