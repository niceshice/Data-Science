President Pöttering: “Europe needs a fresh start"
Midweek in Plenary saw MEPs debate the outcome of last week's EU summit and the forthcoming "Berlin Declaration" on the future course of the Union. During the day, President Pöttering, delivered a reprimand to Polish MEP Maciej Giertych who had published a pamphlet with the Parliament's logo, which contained anti-Semitic and xenophobic sentiments. The House also debated the future of Europe's aviation industry
Controversial MEP Maciej Giertych reprimanded
Chairing the opening of the Wednesday's session, Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering rebuked the Maciej Giertych for the content of his pamphlet "Civilizations at War in Europe". He said that the publication was "a serious breach of fundamental rights and, in particular, the dignity of human beings to which our institution so strongly adheres". Mr Pöttering dissociated the Parliament from the work saying that it had made no financial contribution to its publication.
A Berlin Declaration for the future
In a few days time EU leaders will agree a Declaration to be signed in Berlin on the EU. Timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome it is likely to reflect on the achievements of the Union and what role it should play in the future. Mr Pöttering will represent the Parliament in the negotiations. He said that Parliament's position would rest on four parts:
Achievements since 1957 - peace, prosperity, spread of democracy.
Transparency and subsidiarity as "cornerstones of the Community method".
Fundamental values of the EU.
Future challenges facing the EU: "energy policy and climate change, European common foreign and security policy, internal security and civil rights, and a socially responsible approach to society entailing strong economic success".
The President reiterated the position of the Parliament in support of the Constitutional Treaty and said the Declaration should not just be between governments but must include the Parliament as well. “Europe needs a fresh start. Together we need to muster the courage and the will to meet the challenges of the 21st century" he concluded.
EU Summit
A mood of optimism tinged by realism coloured the debate into the European Council on 8-9 March, in which EU leaders agreed to cut CO2 emissions 20% by 2020.
For the European People's Party Marianne Thyssen counselled caution saying "we cannot rest on our laurels", whilst Martin Schulz of the Socialist group congratulated EU leaders on what they had achieved. However he stressed that "we want to go further".
Monica Frassoni for the Greens said that "unilateral reduction will not help us to maintain the level of increase of under 2 degrees Centigrade."
Françoise Grossetête of the European People's Party said that "acts must follow words otherwise it would be sheer hypocrisy on the EU's part."
Airbus and the aeronautical construction industry
Representatives of the Council and the Commission were in Parliament yesterday to talk about the
Aeronautical construction industry - although MEPs preferred to bring the subject back to the issue of the Airbus company.
Airbus is a joint undertaking by several European countries and has factories and design offices all over the EU. Recently it has had to make many of its employees redundant - prompting a summit between France's President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Angela Merkel over the crisis.
Some MEPs criticised bad management with heavy social consequences and called for an alternative to the restructuring programme, possibly with public financial support.
Others also called on Airbus to produce quality aircraft rather than deliver promises to different governments around Europe.
