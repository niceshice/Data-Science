Swedish MEP Jan Andersson on a decent day's work
Employment policy

What exactly constitutes "decent work" and how can we ensure that more people have access to it? The term is one used by the International Labour Organisation and the European Trade Union Confederation to mean a productive task with a fair income. Swedish Social Democrat Jan Andersson chairs the Parliament's Employment Committee and has just returned from a session of the UN Commission for Social Development in New York. In an exclusive interview he gave us his thoughts on "decent work".
What is your definition of "decent work"?
My definition is work with a decent salary: a salary you at least can live on. But it is not only a salary, it is also good health and safety in the work place, it is influence on your working situation, the possibility of changing it so it suits you, and also today the possibility of life long learning so that you can develop as a person in the work life. The salary is important for life outside work, but other elements are important for work, like health and safety.
Is a minimum wage a way to favour decent work?
Yes and no. You should not focus on a minimum wage. There is always a risk that the minimum wage becomes the maximum wage. You need a minimum wage policy as a last resort, but then you must be very aware that the minimum wage is not the goal: the goal is the normal wage and a better wage than the minimum wage.
Were you satisfied with the outcome of the UN session? Did it live up to your expectations ?
I do not know if I had any expectations as it was my first visit to the UN. We did it for different reasons. I think the EU and the European Parliament should be more active at the global level, not only security policy, but also about environmental policy, trade policies and also decent work and decent working conditions all over the world.
Our aim was to have contacts so that we as a Parliament can play an important role in the global debate. If we do not have dialogue, and improve conditions for workers around the world, there is a risk that protectionist forces in Europe, who want to close our borders, will grow stronger. It is in our interest and it is also in the interest of people outside the EU that we have this kind of dialogue on decent work.
How does the EU work to promote decent work?
We can't decide what happens in other countries. We can be a good example ourselves. We could also raise this issue when we discuss trade, we should discuss issues about environmental standards but also social standards. Should we then say to countries in Africa "you should have the same rules that we have"? No! There are core rules like the ILO convention including the right to be part of an organisation and to fight against child labour. We should promote these conventions all over the world.
How is the situation in the EU?
In a global perspective it is good. But we should not be too proud. The situation around the EU is not perfect and we have big differences within the EU.
The main long-term challenges are workers' ability to influence the workplace and lifelong learning. In today's society, it is important to have a good salary but the main problem is to have the right education. The more you learn the better salary you get, usually.
What about the informal economy?
The black economy is a problem because it is gigantic. In many countries the informal economy is bigger than the formal economy. In the EU it is a big problem because it affects the formal economy. It is a challenge for us to limit the black economy as much as possible. But you also have many differences around the Union.
What are the next steps?
Decent work will be an issue in the coming years. Work is linked to trade and also to the environment, and we will have a bigger debate on how climate change and the need to change the way we live affects employment. We also have to link decent work and sustainable work.
