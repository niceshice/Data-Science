1 in 10 people across Europe have a disability ©Belga/B Rettedal MEPs on the Human Rights Committee have backed a potentially huge shift in the way Europe treats its 50 million disabled citizens. They backed EU membership of a UN Convention that treats disability not as a social welfare issue but as a human rights issue and a legal issue. This is a step away from the current practice of treating disabled persons as objects of charity and social protection.
If the convention is adopted into EU law it would give disabled people rights in areas like education, employment and transport.
UN Convention still unratified
At a hearing on the issue held by the Human Rights Sub-Committee the Chair, Finnish Green Heidi Hautala regretted the reluctance of several EU member states to ratify the UN Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
Parliament passed the Convention in April last year and called on governments to ratify it. In the Parliament there is cross-party group of MEPs from different nationalities and political stripes to promote disability issues.
Disabled and their NGOs must participate
Speaking at the Hearing Erzsébet Szöllősi, Vice President of the European Disability Forum, stressed the importance of "the participation of people with disabilities (and groups that represent them) in the implementation of the Convention and the involvement of civil society".
The EU is already engaged in extending rights to disabled people in transport, telecom services and education through the European Disability Strategy (2004-2010) and through the Disability Action Plans.
