Spain's PM José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero
Meeting in Brussels for a two day Plenary session MEPs debated the Charter of Fundamental Rights which should come into force under the new Reform Treaty. Later Spain's Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero addressed the House where he outlined his vision for the future of the European Union. He also thanked the Parliament for being able to "repel pessimism" about Europe. MEPs later debated gun control.
Spanish PM Zapatero lays out his vision to MEPs
Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero used his speech to the House to outline his vision of which direction the European Union should take. He told MEPs of the importance that Spain attaches to the southern dimension of the EU's Neighbourhood Policy.
He went on to highlight the role of the EP in the debates over the draft Constitution and the Reform Treaty. He said that "at difficult times, the European Parliament has been able to repel pessimism. You deserve our congratulations for this." He then added: "The pulse of Europe beats more strongly here than anywhere else."
Reaction of MEPs
After the speech, it was the turn of MEPs to react and put their questions. Many expressed appreciation for the Spanish PM's commitment to Europe, with many also remarking - each from their own perspective - on the strong support of the Spanish people for the draft constitution when it was put to them in a referendum. But also some critical voices were heard about the position of the Spanish government, for example saying that the EU structural funds were not used in Spain in line with the objectives of the Kyoto protocol.
Mr Zapatero was speaking as part of the Parliament's ongoing debate with European leaders being asked to outline their vision of Europe. Read our detailed report of Mr Zapatero's speech and MEPs' reactions by clicking the first link below.
Sales and ownership of guns
MEPs debated new rules on the acquisition and possession of weapons, especially with a view to internet sales and guns "converted" by criminals. They also called for the European Firearms Pass to be upgraded.
Rapporteur Gisela Kallenbach (Greens/EFA, DE) commented that "we were looking to find a balance between the security interests of citizens and the legitimate demands of hunters and sportsmen." The vote on the new rules takes place on Thursday. For more on the issues involved, see our separate report at the second link below.
TV Without Frontiers, Railways
Parliament also discussed new stricter rules on TV advertising and product placement. Rapporteur Ms Ruth Hieronymi (EPP-ED) demanded in her report that commercial breaks will be permitted only every 30 minutes. The maximum of amount of advertising should not exceed 12 minutes per hour. The report will be voted on Thursday.
The MEPs further debated measures to revitalise European railways. The main focus was on removing obstacles to the free circulation of trains throughout the European rail network.
