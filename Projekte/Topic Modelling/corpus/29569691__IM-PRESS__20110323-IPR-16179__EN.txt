Plans to raise the quota for duty-free wine imports from the Republic of Moldova were backed by Parliament on Thursday. Since Moldova has been experiencing difficulties with its traditional export markets, notably Russia, the European Commission proposed to increase the duty-free quotas from 100,000 hectolitres (hl) to 150,000 hl for this year, from 120,000 hl to 180,000 hl for next year, and to 240,000 hl per year from 2013 onwards.
MEPs approved the Commission proposal with 563 votes in favour, 14 against and 14 abstentions.
