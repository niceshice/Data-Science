The graphics and printing sector in the Netherlands has suffered from large-scale redundancies, and six out of the twelve Dutch provinces have been affected by the global drop in demand for printed media material.
The Netherlands had applied for €2,649,148 to help find new jobs for 800 workers made redundant by 52 firms in the Zuid-Holland and Utrecht regions.
A further €1,849,086 was requested for 551 workers made redundant by 26 firms in the Noord-Holland and Flevoland regions.
Finally, €718,140 was requested for 214 workers made redundant by nine companies in the Overijssel region and €667,823 for 199 workers made redundant by 14 firms in the Noord-Brabant region.
EGF aid helps redundant workers to find new jobs by providing training and job-search assistance.
