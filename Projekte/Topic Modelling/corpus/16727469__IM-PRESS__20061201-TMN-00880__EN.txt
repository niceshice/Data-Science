Liberalising services without undermining social welfare: mission accomplished for Parliament
Free movement of services
2006-12-07 - 17:39
The directive on services in the internal market, approved by the European Parliament in November 2006, is one of the EU's most important projects of recent years. Its aim is to bring to life the fourth "fundamental freedom" of European integration (after the free movement of people, goods and capital), while not undermining workers' rights. It has also been a success for the EP, which as early as its first reading managed to thrash out a compromise enabling supporters and opponents of the directive - both in the governments of the 25 Member States and within Parliament itself - to agree how to reconcile the interests of consumers, workers and service suppliers.
The services sector accounts for nearly two-thirds of Europe's economy but, to realise the full potential of this market, it had to be opened up and made more competitive. The draft services directive unveiled in early 2004 by former Internal Market Commissioner Frits Bolkestein aroused great controversy, even boosting the "no" vote in the French referendum on the EU constitution. The chief bone of contention was the "country of origin principle", which would have allowed service providers to operate in another Member State under rules applicable in their country of origin. In the European Parliament, as in the European population as a whole, some feared this would pave the way for unhealthy competition between Member States, and indeed "social dumping"; others stressed the need to make the free movement of workers easier and to improve competitiveness in the service industries. Member States' representatives within the Council were deeply divided. In Parliament, however, MEPs managed to overcome their differences and hammer out a legislative text which will allow greater crossborder competition in the internal market in services while preserving European social welfare standards.

Competitiveness and workers' rights: balance restored at first reading
Ten committees within the Parliament examined the Commission's draft directive. MEPs debated for eighteen months on ways of reaching a consensus on the legislation. In February 2006, just a few days before the first reading vote in plenary, this sometimes stormy debate culminated in an agreement between the two biggest political groups in Parliament, the EPP-ED (Christian Democrats and Conservatives) and the PES (Socialists).
By the end of the first reading in plenary, the most contentious features of the text had been withdrawn, among them the "country of origin principle". This was replaced by a clause headed "freedom to provide services", which will allow Member States to limit this freedom under certain well-defined conditions. The new version of the text also excluded social services of particular importance to some countries, which had been included in the original version of the directive. The new text also stated more explicitly that the directive will not affect labour legislation in the Member States nor working or employment conditions, including contractual relations between employer and employee, whether based on legislation or collective bargaining agreements.
The bulk of this compromise, which reaffirmed the goal of removing obstacles to the free movement of services while protecting workers' rights as governed by national law, was subsequently accepted by Member States. On this basis, the Council of Ministers adopted a common position in July 2006 which Parliament was able to approve at second reading without amendment.
Services to be provided, subject to certain rules
The directive, which is set to apply throughout the EU from early 2010 at the latest, should make it much easier for service providers to set up shop and conduct business in another Member State. For example, a company wishing to manage a hotel in another state will no longer have to deal with several different authorities at national, regional or local level but with a single authority through a "one-stop shop" which will deal with all the formalities. Procedures will be streamlined and simplified and discriminatory red tape banned.
It will also be simpler than in the past to provide services temporarily in another Member State. The directive explicitly outlaws certain restrictions on the freedom to provide services used until now by some Member States. For example, it will no longer be possible to require mountain guides to have a fixed residence in the territory of the country where they wish to do this job temporarily. However, temporary service providers must comply with the labour and social legislation of the state where they work. Any employees sent temporarily by a company to another state will have the same rights as their local counterparts. This applies to rules on safety and hygiene, working hours and conditions and the minimum wage.
Lastly, the directive will have no effect on labour law or workers' rights won through collective bargaining. This was confirmed by the Commission in a declaration before the second reading vote on 15 November 2006, to dispel any remaining doubts among MEPs.
Services covered, services excluded
The following are covered by the new directive:
- business services (such as management consultancy, certification and testing, facilities management and maintenance, advertising, recruitment services, commercial agents);
- services provided both to businesses and consumers (such as legal or tax advice, estate agents, architects and builders, trade fairs, car rental and travel agencies);
- consumer services (such as tourism, including tour guides, leisure, sports centres and amusement parks).
The following are excluded from the directive:
- non-economic services of general interest (education and public health);
- certain social services provided by the state or by providers mandated by the state (social housing, support for people in need, child-care);
- services already covered by other EU sectoral legislation (financial services, transport services) and others which will be covered by specific legislation in future (such as healthcare);
- audiovisual and electronic communications services (including mobile phones);
- activities involving the exercise of public authority, such as notaries;
- taxation.
Lastly, services of general economic interest (water, gas and electricity supplies) are covered by the directive's provisions on freedom of establishment in another Member State. However, the rights granted under the directive to service providers wishing to supply a service abroad temporarily will not apply to these services. In addition, certain professions such as lawyers are covered by the directive but only with regard to aspects not covered by other sectoral regulations in force in the EU.
