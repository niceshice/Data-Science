Sugar: more compensation for restructuring, say MEPs

In a consultative vote on the European Commission's plans for speeding up reform of the sugar sector, the European Parliament today called for improvements to the way the restructured sugar regime will operate, to avoid arbitrarily reducing quotas and thereby penalising the European sugar industry.
The reform launched in 2006, which was meant to restore the balance to the European sugar market by cutting prices and production, has not produced all the desired effects. The restructuring regime, intended to give financial incentives to the less competitive producers to leave this sector, has only led to the withdrawal of 2.2 million tonnes (Mt) from the market in the first two years. The target is a reduction of 6 Mt by 2010.
In May 2007, the Commission unveiled a package of proposals seeking to make this regime more attractive to encourage producers to give up around 3.8 Mt in quotas. If this goal is not reached in 2010, it wishes to apply a linear reduction to the Member States' quotas.
While supporting the Commission's goals, Parliament adopted a number of amendments designed chiefly to increase the compensation to producers and to the regions. MEPs were voting on two reports by Katerina Batzeli (PES, EL) under the consultation procedure.
Optimising the restructuring regime
To encourage greater abandonment of quotas, MEPs call for firms to have the option of restructuring in two stages: those which have already renounced quotas should be able - once the forecasts for 2008/2009 have been published - to increase their applications for renunciation by 30 April 2008.
To encourage producers to withdraw from production more quickly, MEPs suggest increasing the restructuring aid introduced in 2006 to €625 instead of €218.75 for 2008/09. To encourage producers to withdraw from production more quickly, MEPs suggest that restructuring aid granted to firms which renounce part of their quotas or do not use their production facilities should be increased to €401.50 for 2006/2007 and 2007/2008, €343.75 in 2008/2009 and €286 in 2009/2010.
Parliament also stresses the need for undertakings to devise business development plans to diversify revenue and employment. It adds that restructuring plans must be prepared in consultation with growers and that the growers must be informed about their future before the sowing period.
In addition, MEPs want there to be an option for the restructuring fund to continue operating for one extra year if necessary.
Support for small growers and bioethanol
Under the Commission proposal, beet growers will be able to take the initiative to renounce up to 10% of an undertaking's quota. MEPs believe that in this context priority must be given to small-scale growers so that they can renounce, on favourable terms, the right to transport beet.
Parliament also calls for 100% compensation in the case of firms which partially dismantle their production facilities provided they shift towards bioethanol production. Until now, the aid granted for partial dismantling was 35%.
Boosting aid for producers and regions
MEPs call for producers to receive 25 % of aid for restructuring. The Commission, in its latest proposal, seeks to set the figure at 10%. In the first two years of the reform this same could vary from Member State to Member State provided it is not less than 10%.
Parliament wants to increase from €237.5 to €260 euros per tonne of quota renounced the additional aid to beet growers - which the Commission proposes to grant for 2008/09 and retroactively for growers who have already abandoned production over the two years of the reform. And MEPs want the option to be retained of continuing this aid until 2009/2010.
MEPs also call for aid for diversification paid to the regions affected by restructuring to be kept at the current level of €109.5 per tonne of quota for sugar renounced up to 2009/10 (the regulation adopted in 2006 provides for this aid to fall to €93.80 in 2008/09 and €78 in 2009/10).
Linear reduction of quotas in two stages
If a linear reduction of national quotas is needed in 2010, Parliament believes this too should be carried out in two stages. The first stage should concern only Member States or undertakings which, for 2008/09, would not have made a voluntary renunciation or would have renounced less than 13.5% of their quota. In a second stage, the formula proposed by the Commission would be used.
MEPs also propose taking into account any renunciations made by Member States and undertakings when calculating the final reduction.
Withdrawal from the market
Given the full implementation and entry into force from 2010 of the 'Everything But Arms' initiative (which will allow developing countries to export sugar duty-free to the EU), MEPs believe it is essential to extend up to 2015 the application of the scheme allowing preventive withdrawal of a part of production if there is a surplus on the European market.
In addition, the EP wants the Commission to take any decision on withdrawals for 2008/09 by 4 February 2008 (instead of 16 March, as in other years) so that beet growers can act accordingly before the sowing season.
With Parliament now having voted, the Council of Ministers, which has the final say, is expected to adopts its common position tomorrow or the day after.
