A full plate for newly-elected MEPs The new Parliament hasn’t come together yet but there are many issues on its agenda already — both new ones and also old ones inherited from the previous term. Here are just some examples of what will be on EP’s table in the near future. Once you've read some of the issues below, we want to hear from you about what you would like MEPs to concentrate on.
Your money: To avoid financial crisis in the future the MEPs will look at a proposal to establish a European supervisory body for banks and to ensure tighter scrutiny of executive pay to discourage them from risky deals.
MEPs will also be deciding together with EU Governments the new budgetary framework for the 7 year period after 2013 and allocating money for different priorities.
Your energy: Energy-efficient houses and a new label for tyres showing fuel-efficiency, safety and noise performance are just some measures to mitigate climate change and ensure energy security. Greater fuel efficiency could also mean cheaper fuel costs for drivers across Europe.
Your mobility: Rules on compensation for delays and cancellations for passengers in bus, coach and maritime transport and assistance for disabled passengers will be up for a second reading.
The House will also have a 2nd reading for rules on the use of information and communication technologies to make transport safer and cleaner and to reduce traffic congestion. Amendments aim to take better account of cyclists and pedestrians.
Your food: The EP will look at the proposal to provide clear information on contents of salt, sugar or fat and the country of origin of food.
Your health: A proposal to facilitate medical treatment anywhere in the EU will be presented for a second reading. It aims to clarify the conditions of treatment and reimbursement of the costs.
Your work: Since there was no agreement on the change of the working time rules in the last Parliament, the Commission might present a new proposal.
Your family: An EP committee asked for extension of the maternity leave to 20 weeks (instead of 14) and 2 weeks of compulsory paternity leave. The next term MEPs will vote on it.
Your communication: In its last term Parliament insisted on a prior court ruling before blocking any internet access. Thus the "telecoms package" could be subject to conciliation proceedings between Parliament and Council. Among other issues: consumer rights and privacy protection.
Your neighbours: The EP will debate on the accession of new EU members and on a balanced immigration policy.
