Charlemagne Youth Prize 2009 - new deadline for applications The deadline for the submission of applications for the Charlemagne Youth Prize has been postponed to 16th February. This will give more candidates the opportunity to participate in the second edition of the Prize. The procedure for the submission of applications is simple and straightforward.
The Charlemagne Youth Prize targets young people aged between 16 and 30 who have been involved with projects helping to promote understanding between peoples of different European countries.
Organised by the European Parliament and the Foundation of the International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen, the Charlemagne Youth Prize winners will receive funding of €2,000 - €5,000 for existing projects that foster a shared sense of European identity and cooperation. Representatives of the best projects from each of the 27 EU Member States will be invited to Aachen, in Germany, on 19 May 2009, to participate in the award ceremony.
As well as promoting European and international understanding, the winning projects could serve as role models for young people living in Europe. In particular, the organisers are looking for practical examples of Europeans living together. The projects can focus on the organisation of youth events, youth exchanges or Internet projects with a European dimension.
Last year a Hungarian youth project "Students without Boundaries" was awarded the first Charlemagne Youth Prize. Thanks to this project, more than one hundred students from Romania, Slovakia, Hungary, Ukraine and other countries gather every year for leadership workshops on European issues. The second and third prize went to the United Kingdom and Greece respectively.
Application forms to easily fill in are available in 22 languages at the site below or from the European Parliament Office in Dublin.
