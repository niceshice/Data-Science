In adopting a joint resolution of the PES, ALDE and Greens/EFA groups on strengthening European legislation in the field of information and consultation of workers, MEPs call on the Commission to review and update European legislation concerning consultation and information of workers, in order to ensure a coherent and efficient framework of law, guarantee legal certainty and improve the articulation of social dialogue between the national and the European levels.
The European Parliament calls on the Commission to present it with a timetable for the review and modernisation of European legislation on information and consultation, on collective redundancies, on safeguarding employeesâ€™ rights in the event of transfers of undertakings and, especially, on the long-awaited revision of the Directive on European Works Councils (EWCs).
The House calls on the Commission to take prompt action to ensure that proper implementation takes place in the Member States as regards information and consultation of workers and to notify those Member States where information and consultation directives are not implemented.
MEPs note in particular that Directive 94/45/EC of 22 September 1994 on the establishment of European Works Councils is either not being implemented at all or that there are large and unjustified discrepancies between the ways that Member States choose to implement it. MEPs call on the Commission to report rapidly and in full to the European Parliament and to notify Member States where required.
Finally, the European Parliament calls on the Commission, therefore, to improve further the coordination of its policies in the various fields, including social affairs, economic and monetary affairs, industry, and research and development, and to encourage the social partners to take an active part in developing a coherent set of policies aimed at maintaining a strong, innovative and competitive European industry.
Philip Bushill-Matthews (Conservative, West Midlands) said that although his group was not a signatory to the resolution, the EPP-ED group agreed with the thrust of the resolution and would vote in favour.
