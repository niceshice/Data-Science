Plans for an EP/ Commission joint register of lobbyists and other interest groups were backed by the Constitutional Affairs Committee on Tuesday. The committee hopes the Council of Ministers will join this "transparency register". MEPs add that all lobbyists should be made to register, and also urge that their exchanges with lead MEPs be listed in a "legislative footprint" annex to parliamentary reports.
"This is a step forward, but obviously we will have to take others after this", said rapporteur Carlo Casini (EPP, IT), in a debate on Monday. His reports were unanimously approved in committee on Tuesday.
Greater transparency
MEPs argue a joint register of the two institutions will enhance transparency, as citizens will find all the information on people talking to the EU institutions in one place. This "one-stop shop" system should also facilitate the registration of representatives of specific interests.
The "lobby" register would be renamed the "transparency" register to make it easier for non-commercial organisations, such as think-tanks, to join.
Voluntary v. mandatory registration
Registration would not be mandatory, even though this is what many MEPs would wish. The committee points out, however, that the "agreement will provide a strong incentive for registration since it will render it impossible for anyone to procure a badge giving access to Parliament without first registering".
At the same time, the committee reiterates its call for mandatory registration of all lobbyists in the common transparency register. MEPs also call on the Council of Ministers to join the common register as soon as possible, and welcome the fact that the Council has indicated it will do so.
A working group chaired by Parliament's President Buzek is also working on tighter codes of conduct for both lobbyists and MEPs.
"Legislative footprint" and other improvements
The committee also backs plans for a "legislative footprint" annex to reports drafted by the MEPs. This annex would list all the lobbyists whom the rapporteurs met while drafting their reports.
The new joint register will also provide additional information, such as the number of individuals involved in all activities relating to the register, and the level of EU resources received by the registrant. It will also clarify precisely which activities are covered by the register, and set out procedures for handling complaints and sanctions.
Financial declarations
In a separate report on Parliament's rules of procedure, the committee proposed that MEPs should update their financial declarations "as soon as changes occur", and at least once a year.
Background
Parliament has had a lobby register since 1996 and the Commission since 2008. Parliament passed a resolution in 2008 calling for a joint register, including the Council of Ministers. Parliament and the Commission then set up a working group that agreed in November 2010 on arrangements for a joint register.
Parliament must now formally approve this agreement on the "transparency" register, in plenary vote scheduled for May. The common register is scheduled to be available online in June 2011.
