Budget
Plenary sittings
2010-10-07 - 15:13
The European Parliament on Thursday voted €11,951,544 in European Globalisation Adjustment Fund aid for 1,649 redundant workers in Denmark and Spain. In Denmark, support goes to former workers at two firms in the Syddanmark region, Linak A.S. and the Danfoss Group. In Spain, it goes to Galicia, where 82 companies had to make staff redundant in the first quarter of 2009.
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was established to provide support for workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation or the financial crisis and to help them reintegrate into the labour market. The annual ceiling on aid from the fund is €500 million.
For details of the decision on each case, and general information on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, please see the links below.
