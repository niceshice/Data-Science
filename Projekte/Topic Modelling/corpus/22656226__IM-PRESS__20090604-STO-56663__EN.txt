Euro-election results night - 7 June, testing the political heartbeat of Europe. The results of the European elections from the 27 Member States will be officially declared from 22:00 CET on Sunday 7 June. Turnout estimates will be available from 21:00. For the results you can access either the Parliament’s website which will include photos, analysis and results in 23 languages or EuroparlTV online featuring debates from Brussels, MEPs’ reactions and press conferences. We’ve also set up a special “twitter” micro-blog with constant updates from Brussels during the evening.
On election night itself the EP building in Brussels will host a special screening in the debating chamber with the results from 22.00 onwards and press conferences with leading MEPs. There will also be debates about the political, economic and social state of the European Union.
