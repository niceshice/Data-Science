Minute's silence for victims of terrorism
On Monday afternoon, prior to the opening of the Plenary session, a special ceremony was held with around 580 school students from around Europe to mark International Day against Terrorism. Sunday, 11 March was the third anniversary of the terrorist attack in Madrid, in which 192 people died. This day also serves to commemorate the London bombings of 7 July 2005.
MEPs expect a Berlin Declaration worthy of today's EU
The debate on the Berlin Declaration, to be signed on 25 March to mark the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Rome Treaty, was introduced by Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering, who has been mandated by the EP political group leaders to represent Parliament in the discussions on the text, which will be a joint declaration of Parliament, Council and Commission.
Equality between men and women: a roadmap to show the way forward
The European Parliament calls on the European Commission to give practical effect to its "roadmap for equality between women and men". Above all, MEPs want the principle of equal pay for equal work to be applied, paternity leave encouraged, action taken against violence, better integration of immigrant women and promotion of respect for women's rights in the EU's external relations.
Open skies EU-US agreement - MEPs call for it to be endorsed
MEPs adopted a resolution on the recent draft EU-US Opens Skies agreement recognising the importance of the EU-US aviation agreement not only in its own right but also as a model for later agreements. MEPs call on the Council Ministers of Transport to endorse the 2 March 2007 draft agreement during its meeting of 22 and 23 March 2007
Air travel - common safety standards to be guaranteed by European Aviation Safety Agency
MEPs recommend giving the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) the power to impose fines on airlines or other aviation players if safety standards are not correctly implemented. This came as they gave the go-ahead for an expansion of the Agency's role to help establish common, and properly enforced, safety standards for all airlines flying in Europe, whether EU-based or not.
MEPs call for speedy ratification of Maritime Labour Convention
Parliament adopted a report drafted by Mary-Lou McDonald (GUE/NGL, IE) which urges that the EU Member States ratify as swiftly as possible the Consolidated Maritime Labour Convention adopted by the International Labour Organisation in 2006. The convention aims to improve working conditions for seafarers, thus reducing unfair competition on the global market as well as making merchant shipping a more attractive profession.
Corporate social responsibility: a new partnership
The increase of social and environmental responsibility by business, linked to the principle of corporate accountability, represents an essential element of the European Social Model and of Europe's strategy for Sustainable Development, according to the European Parliament which adopted an own initiative report by Richard Howitt (PES, UK) on Corporate Social Responsibility.
Community action on the provision of cross-border healthcare
In adopting a resolution on community action on the provision of cross-border healthcare, MEPs welcome the Commission initiative to launch a consultation procedure on the best form of Community action with a view to providing a framework for cross-border aspects of health-care.
Euro-Mediterranean relations - MEPs stress the importance of dialogue between cultures
MEPs adopted a joint resolution on Euro-Mediterranean relations stressing the importance of dialogue between cultures and religions, by reaffirming the need for respect for common values and the development of the rule of law, democracy and human rights.
Parliament adopts report on beef and veal produce
Parliament gave its verdict on a Commission proposal to clarify the distinction between the different types of meat currently sold in the EU under the name "veal". In a report by Bernadette Bourzai (PES, FR), the House welcomes the Commission's approach while demanding further guarantees for consumers.
More EP involvement is needed on non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament
In a resolution on non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament adopted by a large majority, the House calls upon all States whose activities violate the non-proliferation regime to stop their behaviour and to comply fully with their obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The EP wants to be better informed and involved in the preparation of the forthcoming 2010 NPT Review Conference.
Islands and natural and economic constraints
The Commission should consider allowing state aid to be granted to island regions "where fuel and energy costs clearly adversely affect the competitiveness of the communities living on them" says an own-initiative report adopted by the European Parliament with 473 votes in favour, 26 against 35 abstentions.
Human rights: killings in Guatemala and Cambodia, abuses in Nigeria
Parliament adopted its customary three human rights resolutions at the end of the plenary session on Thursday. The first is a response to the assassinations in Guatemala of three Members of the Central American Parliament. The second looks at the murder of trade unionists in Cambodia. In the third, the Nigerian government is pressed to deal with a range of issues ahead of the elections next month.
Attack on Galina Kozlova and oppression of Mari minority in Russia condemned
In a parliamentary resolution, MEPs roundly condemned the recent attack on Mari activist Galina Kozlova and called on the Russian authorities to "bring the perpetrators of these acts to justice and ensure respect for freedom of expression." The House emphasised the importance of minority languages and cultures in the Russian federation, and called on the Commission to raise the issue during the regular EU-Russia human rights dialogue.

Opening of March Strasbourg Plenary - minute of silence for victims of terrorism
2007-03-19 - 13:44
On Monday afternoon, prior to the opening of the Plenary session, a special ceremony was held with around 580 school students from around Europe to mark International Day against Terrorism. Sunday, 11 March was the third anniversary of the terrorist attack of 11 March 2004 in Madrid, in which 192 people died. This day also serves to commemorate the London bombings of 7 July 2005. At the opening of the session, Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering made a speech on this subject. He told the House "We must keep the memories of these people alive and show solidarity with their families". Continuing, he said,"Terrorism is a blow to freedom and democracy. Terrorism is an attempt through blind violence to destroy values that the EU and the Member States believe in." He stated that "It is a crime that cannot be tolerated under any circumstances."
He emphasised that "The EU and the international community must fight together against terrorism in all its forms". Indeed, "We need a strong and united Europe. In order to fight terrorism effectively, we must go beyond our present narrow cooperation to find the right policies". He stressed, however, that Guantánamo was "not in line with Europe's view of law".
The President also referred to the Italian journalist Daniele Mastrogiacomo of the newspaper La Repubblica, who has been kidnapped by the Taleban in Afghanistan, as well as the German citizen and her son kidnapped in Iraq. He urged their captors "to release them unharmed", insisting that "we cannot be blackmailed by violence".
The House then observed a minute's silence.
Agenda changes for the week
Moving on to the week's plenary agenda, the House voted to make one change: the Kyösti VIRRANKOSKI (ALDE, FI) report on Biotechnology: prospects and challenges for agriculture, was referred back to the Agriculture Committee for further work.
The President also announced that during the week, he would be signing the INSPIRE directive with the Council presidency. INSPIRE, which stands for "infrastructure for spatial information in Europe", will require EU governments to make geographical data available more easily, thereby supporting common policies to protect the environment.

MEPs expect a Berlin Declaration worthy of today's EU
2007-03-19 - 13:44
The debate on the Berlin Declaration, to be signed on 25 March to mark the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Rome Treaty, was introduced by Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering, who has been mandated by the EP political group leaders to represent Parliament in the discussions on the text, which will be a joint declaration of Parliament, Council and Commission. The declaration, said Mr Pöttering, would consist of sections on the EU's achievements since 1957; on issues such as the equality of the Member States, transparency and subsidiarity as "cornerstones of the Community method"; a key section on the fundamental values of the EU (notably, said Mr Pöttering, "the inviolability of human dignity", which was clearly "the political starting point and objective"); and another on future challenges facing the EU, with the emphasis on "energy policy and climate change, the European common foreign and security policy, internal security and civil rights, and a socially responsible approach to society entailing strong economic success".
Regarding the Constitution, he added that the European Parliament still "firmly supports the constitutional treaty" and stressed that this would not be simply an intergovernmental declaration, but one involving the Parliament and Commission too.
Concluding, the President said "the achievements of the last 50 years have been extraordinary. Fifty years on, however, Europe needs a fresh start. Together we need to muster the courage and the will to meet the challenges of the 21st century".
Council President Steinmeier
For the Council, German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier emphasised that the EU had "a true success story" to celebrate, in which MEPs had "played a decisive role". Now, he said, "if we want to win the trust of the people of Europe, we must show that the European Union makes sense for them". Last week's summit had been a great success, showing that "the EU can act where the people expect action from us", for example on climate change and energy. It was important to build on that success in the Declaration.
On the key areas of the Declaration referred to by Mr Pöttering, Mr Steinmeier said the part on the EU's achievements would emphasise peace, stability and prosperity, including "overcoming the division of our continent". He pointed out that the EU's core principles had "become a model for integration in other parts of the world". The section on values would refer to "human dignity, freedom and responsibility, mutual solidarity, diversity and tolerance", since the EU "is more than an economic entity: it is a community of values". The part on future challenges would cover "energy, climate change, a viable common foreign and security policy, organised crime and terrorism, and solutions to illegal immigration".
A key message would be the importance of Europe's "social model", showing that "economic competition can be reconciled with social and environmental responsibility". He concluded: "Let's highlight what brings us together".
Commissioner Margot Wallström
Commissioner Wallström said the Berlin meeting will be an important occasion not only "to highlight all that unites us and emphasise our common values and principles", but also "to put forward our shared objectives and ambitions, underline our mutual respect and solidarity and reiterate our determination to build a better and stronger Union for the benefit of all citizens".
The German Presidency has been working hard to make the Berlin Declaration text "short and accessible", an "easy read with a shelf-life of more than a few days or weeks", she continued, adding that we should "look ahead to inspire Europeans for the future". Yet "stating what we value is not an easy task", she acknowledged. This meant that the decision to involve Parliament and the Commission was fully justified.
The text should be "concrete without being too specific", she said, and should reflect the EU's "genius": its ability to balance the particular with the general, the individual with the collective, by promoting growth and economic development within a strong social framework".
The EU of 27 is "just as strong and bold" as its earlier incarnations, opined Ms Wallström, adding that "enlargement has added dynamism to our work". The EU is "not 'obsessed with navel-gazing' and 'detached from citizens' concerns'", stressed Ms Wallström, adding that "if we are concerned about our institutions, it is because we want them to work well".
Ms Wallström concluded by predicting that the Berlin Declaration would bring "a momentum and urgency to efforts to settle the constitutional and institutional debate", and will "show a European Union united in its commitment to meet the aspirations of our citizens and bring to the future work of the Union the same dynamism and achievement that we have enjoyed for 50 years of the European adventure".
Speaking in the name of Parliament's Constitutional Affairs Committee, Jo Leinen (PES, DE) said it should not be difficult to reach agreement on three of the five areas in the Declaration. The section on past achievements was "straightforward". The part on values should also be simple: in addition to the "standard" values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, solidarity and equality were important to Europeans, so the "European social model" should be mentioned. The section on future challenges was obvious too: "we face a handful of mega-problems" he said, such as climate change.
He thought it might be "harder to describe what is special about the EU" and he urged a reference to the "Community method", which "sets the EU apart from all international organisations", notably through the role of a directly elected parliament. Lastly, he wanted to see an acknowledgement that the current treaties are not up to the task and that "we need a new foundation, new methods and options". In other words, "we must commit ourselves to the new treaty".
Political group speakers
EPP-ED leader Joseph Daul (FR) recalled that his group had always striven for a more integrated, deeper Europe, "united in defence of its freedoms", including those of "entrepreneurship and the freedom to work".
Thanks to the Rome Treaty, "war is no longer a reality" in Europe, but that "we have not all been equal in this successful adventure. Whereas we have all striven to acquire freedom, peace and prosperity, some of our countries were subject to restriction, censorship and uncertainty, oppressed as they were by communist dictatorships. Some of our citizens suffered under the Communist yoke, but they are now back in the EU family, and the EU is breathing with both lungs", he said.
Mr Daul recalled that 2007 is also the 60th anniversary of the Marshall Plan: "Without the help from our American friends and without their decisive commitment to Europe, neither the Schuman Declaration nor the Treaty of Rome would have had such an easy birth".
Mr Daul listed Europe's key challenges today as "demography, globalisation, polarisation, energy supplies and climate change", and also "the fight against international terrorism". A prerequisite for the success of Europe's future generations, in an unstable and increasingly borderless world, is their confidence in their ability to adapt, without delay or hesitation, to the rapidly changing reality, he said, concluding that what is required of our generation is "level-headedness and political courage".
For the Socialist group, Martin Schulz (DE) began by stating "I don't think we ought to talk about the text but rather the context of the declaration." He commented that "expectations [about this text] are high ..[..]..We all get the feeling that this is a watershed moment ..[..].. Maybe we will continue with success or else we might end up moving away from integration into an uncertain future."
Mr Schulz pointed out that the Berlin declaration is called upon to deliver a very strong message of hope and that we cannot just sit back and say that we have been very successful over the past 50 years. He spoke of the danger of intolerance, of "things that we thought we'd overcome." He said that to stop this, a message should be delivered to young people, saying "yes, we've achieved all this but you have to do something too." Mr Schulz spoke of the importance of looking after the world's climate, providing decent opportunities for young people and their children to "grow up in peace and have prospects." He concluded by saying that "we need new methods ..[..].. we're launched on a new track for the future."
For the Liberal group, Graham Watson (ALDE, UK), pointed to this "significant birthday [as] a good occasion to take stock." He stated that "the Berlin Declaration must reflect less our pride in the past, more our determination for the future." Commenting on the proposed Declaration, he stated that "to debate a Declaration without even a draft is bizarre ..[..].. Don't be surprised if many of us have doubts."
Mr Watson went on to say that "we want a declaration which will bring our citizens back on board the European project" and that "an enlarged and open Europe needs greater solidarity between its nations and its citizens." He spoke of the current global challenges and of the "opportunity to explain to citizens why now more than ever integration is important."
Lastly, Mr Watson advised the German Presidency to "keep it short ... the kind of text one might nail on to the door in Wittenberg".
On behalf of the UEN group, Cristiana Muscardini (IT) quoted Robert Schuman who said that "Europe will have to be built together if built at all." She pointed out that a Union of 27 cannot work with rules which were set for a union of 15 and went on to say "our historical roots ...need to be clarified for the future ..[..]..if we're to deal with others, we need first of all to know ourselves."
Ms Muscardini added "we need to recognise that our future is different from our past" and make extra efforts on dialogue and ensuring the security of our external borders. She stated "there is no real culture unless there is a recognition of the dignity of the individual". She also spoke of the importance of respecting trade rules and of the dangers of fundamentalism. Ms Muscardini concluded by quoting Robert Schuman when he said that "world peace cannot be safeguarded without creative efforts."
For the Greens/EFA group, Daniel Cohn-Bendit (DE) began by calling for a more inclusive approach to the drafting of the declaration. A celebration of prosperity and the rule of law must not overlook poverty and those who have no rights. If the declaration is to be "something that the people will notice", there ought to be more specific objectives, e.g. on climate change: a target of no more than 2 degrees of global warming, resource-efficient use of materials and 100% use of renewable sources of energy within the next 50 years.
Turning to immigration, he stated that the debate on this issue should acknowledge the 50m legal immigrants living in Europe today. "Immigration should not be regarded as a threat to Europe". The immigrants who are here legally and have rights are too often "bundled into the same box" as illegal immigrants. "We can and should be proud", he said, of what has been achieved in terms of human rights and freedom for minorities.
On behalf of the GUE/NGL group, Francis Wurtz (FR) stressed the need for consultation. However, he said, the Berlin declaration could be useful for adopting an honest and critical approach towards the EU, to address what might be seen as "a crisis of confidence" among the peoples of Europe. The declaration needs to look at the day-to-day realities of ordinary people, he said, in order to make relevant to them the "Europe that is being created". The legitimacy of the social and economic model is being questioned, Mr Wurtz added, and the Berlin declaration offers the opportunity to "breathe...new meaning into this wonderful European adventure."
For the Independence and Democracy group, Nigel Farage (IND/DEM, UK) mocked the optimism of earlier speakers and reflected that there were present those who seemed to think that the Berlin declaration "may even be able to control the weather in the future." Contrasting EU levels of GDP and R&D investment with those of the US, Mr Farage emphasised the economic challenges that needed to be addressed in a practical and constructive manner. Lastly, he urged the House to "Please please please...ask the peoples of Europe" about the declaration.
Bruno Gollnisch (FR), the leader of the Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty group, argued that the declaration should focus upon the young people of Europe, to tackle the unemployment and poverty that still exists. It should not be difficult, he stressed, for young people to be able to find a job to enable them "to start a family and buy a few possessions." This should be the minimal, crucial objective for a declaration that is to set out the future of Europe.
British and Irish MEPs
Roger Helmer (UK) for the non-aligned MEPs, told the House "This Berlin Declaration fails to recognise that the EU is making us poorer, less democratic and less free". The "elephant in the room" was the Constitution, which "should be dead" but which EU leaders were determined to bring back somehow, despite the No votes in two referendums. They would use every procedural trick to avoid further referendums, but "when the backlash comes" from the people of Europe, he said, "it will sweep away this failing European project".
Proinsias De Rossa (PES, IE) made a very specific point about the content of the Declaration, saying "I want to draw attention to the fact that not a single speaker referred to the non-sectarian nature of the European Union and how important it is that the Declaration make clear that the European Union respects all religions, that it is a secular organisation and that it must maintain its democratic and secular nature if it is to maintain its cohesion. "
Council and Commission responses
In his reply for the Council, Mr Steinmeier said the debate had shown "it is not easy to agree on the values to include" in the Declaration. It would "be hard to fit in all the topics" that everyone wanted. He stressed, though, that the aim was not just to "produce a declaration" but "genuinely to take stock" of the past and present.
He rejected Mr Cohn-Bendit's reaction to his original comments on illegal immigration, saying he had simply emphasised the need for a joint approach on this issue.
To the rest of the House, he said that 90% of their concerns matched the Council's discussions last week, so there was no need to fear that the Council would overlook anything. Ultimately, however, a key aim must be "to formulate our views in a manner that is widely comprehensible" to the people of Europe. For this reason he was sceptical about the idea of using terms such as "Community method".
For the Commission, Ms Wallström made two additional remarks .
First, she said, "the European construction is not 'ready' and will never be 'ready' - we are constantly adding another piece to this puzzle or architecture of Europe. How do we illustrate our vision of the future to the 20 year-olds of today?" she asked, rhetorically.
Secondly, "we shall not be able construct Europe if the people are not behind us, and so we must be open with the public", she said, pointing out that "we can't negotiate the contents of a 2-page document with 450 million people". "Let's put together what we are proud of, and formulate a vision for the next 50 years", she concluded.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Equality between men and women: a roadmap to show the way forward
2007-03-19 - 13:44
The European Parliament calls on the European Commission to give practical effect to its "roadmap for equality between women and men". Above all, MEPs want the principle of equal pay for equal work to be applied, paternity leave encouraged, action taken against violence, better integration of immigrant women and promotion of respect for women's rights in the EU's external relations. The policy of gender equality should be treated by the Commission as "an indispensable requirement of respect for the rights of the individual", says the European Parliament in an own-initiative report, which was adopted, with amendments, by a large majority. During the debate, the rapporteur Amalia S ARTORI (EPP-ED, IT) noted that the starting point of the Women's Rights' Committee's was the promotion of the individual's rights, and that "when putting the promotion of rights in the centre, we must also establish zero-tolerance when these rights are not respected."
Equal pay for equal work
MEPs call for national measures to help women enter the labour market "on a footing of equal dignity and equal pay for equal work" and for the implementation of "concrete strategies to reinforce female entrepreneurship" MEPs also callon the Commission to revise Council directive 75/117/EEC on the approximation of laws on the application of equal pay for men and women.
Elsewhere, the report calls on Member States to appoint a national official to take charge of gender equality under the Lisbon strategy's employment and growth objectives .
Reconciling work and family l ife
The report calls on the Commission, in collaboration with the Member States and its social partners, to encourage the creation of policies to reconcile family and working life, for example those designed to:
- ensure that the cost of motherhood is borne by society as a whole;
- make care services and assistance more accessible and flexible;
- actively encourage fathers and male cohabitees to make use of available flexible working time options and take on household chores and family work, for example by laying down an initial form of paternity leave;
Action against violence and trafficking in human beings
MEPs urge the Commission to strengthen measures to protect women and children against all forms of violence, including slavery, crimes of honour, trafficking in human beings and polygamy. They want indicators to be devised on these forms of violence.
MEPs also want the Commission to gather, as soon as possible, comparable and reliable data on trafficking in human beings with a view to reducing the number of victims, as well as carrying out a study on the causal correlation between legislation on prostitution and trafficking for sexual exploitation and disseminating best practices, including actions taken relating to the demand side. The Commission should also, provided that a legal basis is determined, present a proposal for a directive on combating violence against women.
The report also calls on the Member States to introduce compulsory registration of acts of female genital mutilation performed by persons involved in health care and to withdraw the licence of doctors who practice it.
A key condition in external policy
"Respect for women’s rights must be an essential condition of the EU’s neighbourhood, foreign and development policies", says the House. MEPs stress that the respect for women's rights must also be key condition of accession negotiations with applicant countries.
MEPs find that the EU should "show greater commitment" towards political dialogue with third countries and to giving financial support linked to development, with a view to promoting gender equality. They stress the importance of promoting the education of girls at all levels, ensuring equal access to training programmes fostering female entrepreneurship, guaranteeing them equal access to labour markets and to means of production such as land, credit and technology. A call is also made for greater efforts to be made to protect girls against all forms of violence.
The EP urges the Commission and the Member States to take appropriate measures, as part of their development cooperation policies, to encourage better representation of women by ensuring that women have the same opportunities as men and by encouraging their participation in professional associations and political planning and decision-making bodies.
The report also calls on the Commission to ensure coordination between the EU and the UN as regards equal opportunities policies and girls’ rights.
Integrating migrant women
The report also calls on the Commission "to take practical steps to promote the emancipation and economic and social integration of migrant women, including "measures to foster language skills and understanding of the rights and duties deriving from the Community acquis, international agreements, the principles and laws applying in host countries (which, among other things, prohibit polygamy under the cloak of family reunification) and from the Union’s core values".
The role of media
MEPs believe that if the media were to publicise good examples of both women’s roles in society and their achievements in all sectors, this would help greatly to combat the negative stereotypes which women face. They, therefore, call on the Commission to encourage measures, under the Media 2007 programme for example, to raise awareness in the media, of the stereotypes that they convey and to promote equal opportunities, particularly with a view to informing and raising awareness among young men and women.

Transport
Open skies EU-US agreement - MEPs call for it to be endorsed
2007-03-19 - 13:44
MEPs adopted a resolution on the recent draft EU-US Opens Skies agreement recognising the importance of the EU-US aviation agreement not only in its own right but also as a model for later agreements. MEPs call on the Council Ministers of Transport to endorse the 2 March 2007 draft agreement during its meeting of 22 and 23 March 2007 The House calls upon EU and US negotiators to reach a balanced aviation agreement as soon as possible. The House welcomes, therefore, the text for a new draft agreement agreed upon by EU and US delegations on 2 March 2007 as an important step towards an integrated transatlantic aviation market that will be to the benefit of consumers.
MEPs would have preferred the conclusion of one balanced overall agreement covering all aspects of market opening and regulatory convergence to a phased approach employing partial agreements.
Market opening
Parliament emphasises that a new EU-US aviation agreement should be balanced in terms of market access, considering also such issues as cabotage, right of establishment, ownership and de facto control and state aid. MEPs, therefore, prefer the inclusion of cabotage in the agreement, as without cabotage an agreement will tend to be in favour of US carriers, who are allowed flights between points in different EU Member States, whereas EU carriers are not allowed flights between points in the US.
MEPs regret that no progress has been made on cabotage and that the possibility for EU carriers to exercise effective control over a US airline is still limited, even with the extended ownership clauses.
Safety and security
Parliament calls on the Commission and the US, to review the efficiency of the additional security measures enforced since 2001 so as to eliminate overlapping and weak links in the security chain.
MEPs advocate the concept of 'one stop security', checking passengers and luggage only at the start of their journey and not again at every transfer.
Environment
MEPs recognise that the aviation sector has several negative environmental effects, in particular as a source of noise and as a contributor, like other modes of transport, to climate change, and that these effects will increase with the growth of aviation. The House underlines the need for both the EU and the US side to take effective measures to reduce the negative environmental impact of aviation, without prior exclusion of any regulatory, financial or other instrument to achieve this goal.
MEPs welcome the Commission's proposal to include aviation in the European emissions trading system to reduce the impact of the aviation sector on climate change. The House calls on both parties to exchange best practices on noise reduction, acknowledging differences in local circumstances.
British Labour MEP sounds a note of caution
Brian Simpson (Labour, North West) said during the debate on 13 March: "With over 40% of the EU-US market, this particular agreement is of great interest, of course, to the United Kingdom. While I accept that the agreement could deliver some benefits to consumers, it has still to my mind failed to address some fundamental issues and has a number of question markets over it. In particular, the deal falls well short of providing the kind of access to the US market that a number of EU carriers would like. It does little with regard to ownership of US airlines and appears little different from previous deals rejected by the European Union.
So, in my opinion, those who enthusiastically welcomed this agreement may need to pause a little and examine it in more detail to see what it delivers for the EU. I know the ultimate goal is to create an open aviation area with the US and I indeed support any agreement that would unlock the transatlantic aviation market. But the question is: does this deal help deliver that? To me it is a deal that promises the EU jam tomorrow and gives the US the jam today. However, if this agreement does go ahead, then we must ensure that a clear timetable is quickly put in place with real and serious incentives on both sides to move forward to a second stage deal that delivers a fully open aviation market.
In short, I do not think this deal is a disaster, but it is not as great as the Commission would have you believe. It is merely a first step and one that would appear to benefit the US. I look forward in future agreements to the United States giving something a bit more substantial back and for that country to stop over-protecting its aviation industry."
Conduct of negotiations
Finally, MEPs call on the Commission to ensure full information and consultation of the European Parliament and of all relevant stakeholders before and throughout second-stage negotiations.

Air travel - common safety standards to be guaranteed by European Aviation Safety Agency
2007-03-19 - 13:44
MEPs recommend giving the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) the power to impose fines on airlines or other aviation players if safety standards are not correctly implemented. This came as they gave the go-ahead for an expansion of the Agency's role to help establish common, and properly enforced, safety standards for all airlines flying in Europe, whether EU-based or not. The EASA should be given the power to impose fines on airlines or other aviation players if safety standards are not correctly implemented. The House gave the go-ahead for an expansion of EASA's role to help establish common safety standards for all airlines flying in Europe, whether EU-based or not.
The decision includes giving EASA new roles across the whole field of aviation and airline behaviour, including the conditions for operating aircraft and issuing, maintaining, limiting or suspending an operator's certificate. The Agency will also have competence over pilots' licences, to ensure they meet standards of knowledge, skill and language proficiency.
Sources of information on abuses or non-compliance, notably whistleblowers, should be given adequate protection with the aim of encouraging the reporting of such events and reducing the number of accidents. The EASA was set up in 2002 to help provide a high, uniform level of aviation safety across Europe, by drawing up common standards, overseeing their application in the EU and promoting them at world level.

Corporate social responsibility: a new partnership
2007-03-19 - 13:44
The increase of social and environmental responsibility by business, linked to the principle of corporate accountability, represents an essential element of the European Social Model and of Europe's strategy for Sustainable Development, according to the European Parliament which adopted an own initiative report by Richard Howitt (PES, UK) on Corporate Social Responsibility. The report underlines that Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policies should be promoted on their own merits, neither as a substitute for appropriate regulation in relevant fields, nor as a covert approach to introducing such legislation. Agreeing with the Commission of the term, the EP defines CSR as "the voluntary integration of environmental and social considerations into business operations, over and above legal requirements and contractual obligations" The Commission is called upon to encourage dissemination of good practice resulting from voluntary CSR initiatives and believe that the Commission should also consider establishing a list of criteria for enterprises to respect if they claim to be responsible.
MEPs welcome the Commission communication’s objective to link CSR to the economic, social and environmental aims oh the Lisbon Agenda and the trend for lager companies to publish voluntary social and environmental reports in recent years. The Plenary reminds the Commission to bring forward a proposal on the annual accounts of types of companies which includes requirements for social and environmental reporting alongside financial reporting.
The EP urges the EU to adopt a European standard for product labelling where observance of human rights and fundamental workers' rights are part of the labelling scheme and recalls previous consideration given to the appointment of an EU ombudsman on CSR to undertake independent enquiries on CSR-related issues at the request of companies or any stakeholder group.
EU-based translational companies with production facilities in third countries have to abide by core ILO standards, social and environmental agreements to achieve world-wide balance between economic growth and environmental standards, MEPs underline. Parliament wants SME to participate in CSR and suggest that the Commission targets their participation through joint working with intermediary bodies, offering specific support for the participation of cooperative/social economy businesses through their specialist associations.
The Parliament recommends that future CSR research goes beyond the simple “business case” for CSR, to focus on the link between competitiveness and sustainable development, at the macro level (the EU and Member States), the meso level (industry sectors and supply chains) and the micro level (SMEs), and the interrelationship between them, as well as the impact of current CSR initiatives and possible violations of CSR principles.
Background:
CSR represents business taking more direct responsibility for managing its social and environmental impact, becoming more openly accountable not simply to employees and their trade unions, but also to wider 'stakeholders' including investors, consumers, local communities, environmental and other interest groups.
The EU response to the CSR debate emanated from the Commission's call to business to for help combat social exclusion in the mid 1990s, the European Parliament resolution of 1999 calling a binding code of conduct to govern EU companies' environmental, labour and human rights compliance worldwide, together with the 2000 call of EU Heads of State for businesses to support CSR as part of the Lisbon Agenda. The Commission Green and White Papers on CSR in the early 2000s put CSR on the agenda for EU institutions, and the setting up of a European Multistakeholder Forum enabled a debate to take place amongst stakeholders.

MEPs call for speedy ratification of Maritime Labour Convention
2007-03-19 - 13:44
Parliament adopted a report which urges that the EU Member States ratify as swiftly as possible the Consolidated Maritime Labour Convention adopted by the International Labour Organisation in 2006. The convention aims to improve working conditions for seafarers, thus reducing unfair competition on the global market as well as making merchant shipping a more attractive profession. The consultation report, drafted by Mary-Lou McDONALD (GUE/NGL, IE), endorses with minor amendments the proposal for a Council decision authorising Member States to ratify the Convention, which incorporates all existing conventions and recommendations on maritime labour adopted by the ILO since 1919 into a single text. It lays down labour standards applicable to the crews of vessels with a gross tonnage of 500 tonnes or more engaged in international voyages or sailing between foreign ports.
The Convention will enter into force upon ratification by at least 30 states, which must together represent at least 33% of the world’s entire merchant shipping tonnage.
With 80% of maritime accidents being linked to human error, the rapporteur stresses the importance of speedy ratification and implementation of the Convention, which should not pose any problem as all EU Member States voted in favour of the Convention in Geneva in February 2006.
The rapporteur points out that it is important to normalise the status of seafarers in order to limit the negative effects of globalisation, namely social dumping, which penalises seafarers and ship-owners complying with the rules in force, and to define decent working conditions. Ratification and entry into force of the Convention would represent an important contribution from the EU to the promotion of decent labour standards worldwide.

First reading deal on prudential assessment of bank takeovers
2007-03-19 - 13:44
Parliament has given a first reading to a directive changing European rules on how mergers of banks and other financial institutions are approved. Since the text adopted has already been agreed in informal negotiations with the Council, the proposals should enter force without further changes. When a bank or similar financial institution changes ownership, more is at stake than the usual competition issues considered for any takeover or merger: the relevant financial supervisory authority also needs to consider whether the new ownership would have implications for the bank’s financial stability. Amid concern that these approval processes were sometimes acting as a barrier to cross-border mergers and acquisitions, the Commission proposed to tighten up the European rules on the procedures followed by financial authorities with a view to greater clarity and legal certainty.
The text adopted, on the advice of the rapporteur, Wolf KLINZ (ALDE, DE) includes the following provisions, among others:
• where the Commission proposed that supervisory authorities should take their decision within 30 working days of being notified of a proposed acquisition, the new text sets the limit at 60 working days;
• the relevant supervisory authority may interrupt this period to ask for necessary additional information from the proposed acquirer, as long as it does so NO more than 50 days into the period; the interruption can be for up to 20 working days (or 30 in the case of non-EU acquirers or those not already subject to financial supervision under EU directives);
• five criteria are set out as the only basis for the decision of whether the acquisition is in line with "sound and prudent" management of the organisation concerned: the reputation of the proposed acquirer and proposed management, the acquirer's financial soundness, whether they will comply with EU prudential requirements, and whether they might be involved in money laundering or terrorist financing;
• it is made clear that Member States may not impose more stringent requirements than those set out in the directives as amended.
The Commission originally proposed that it should be able to request the supervisory authorities for the documents on which their decision is based. Rather than providing new powers, the text as adopted includes a statement in the introductory section, reminding Member States that, under the Treaty, they should cooperate with Commission by providing information needed to determine whether they, the Member States, have infringed their obligations under the directive.

Online music: MEPs call for binding EU legislation
2007-03-19 - 13:44
The European Parliament says there should be binding legislation on the online music market, ensuring European cultural diversity is safeguarded. Reacting to the Commission's recommendation proposing to open up the market to competition, MEPs were critical both of the procedure chosen and the substance. By adopting the own-initiative report by Katalin LÈVAI (PES, HU) on the cross border management of copyright for online music services, MEPs criticise the Commission's decision to put forward a non-binding recommendation and call instead for a framework directive to be proposed under the codecision procedure. This would also have the advantage of allowing Parliament to participate fully in the legislative process. The Parliament says this new proposal should guarantee the protection of EU cultural diversity and safeguard small artists and local repertoires.
At present, music artists' rights are controlled by Collective Rights Management societies (CRMs), each enjoying a national monopoly. Artists are represented by their national CRM society in their own Member State and in the other EU countries by virtue of reciprocal bilateral agreements. The European Commission proposes, in its recommendation, to open up the copyright market to competition. Licensing of online rights is often restricted by territory and those interested in trading music on the web have to negotiate in each Member State with the respective CRM. The Commission proposes to create multi-territorial and pan-European licences and to let the artists choose which CRM should represent them, regardless to where they reside. This, the Commission says, would enhance both competition and technological innovation.
Controlled competition to safeguard diversity
According to the EP, however, this proposal risks hampering national and local music markets, instead of benefiting the stakeholders, such as artists and publishers. MEPs, therefore, propose introducing controlled competition to encourage modernisation and competitiveness in the online music market, while protecting cultural diversity and creativity. MEPs agree with the Commission that pan-European licenses should be available from any CRM. Nevertheless, they ask the Commission to ensure, in its new proposal, the protection of local and niche repertoires by asking CRMs to provide consumers with a diversified range of music products. They call for measures to avoid strengthening the position of most profitable artists at detriment of lower-earning ones and to assure that all right-holders, irrespective of their nationality, receive a fair share of royalties. These measures would include the prohibition of exclusive mandate between major right-holders and CRMs for the collection of royalties to avoid undermining the position, in the market, of minority repertoires. Finally, Parliament asks the Commission to conduct an impact assessment of such a global licence on the economic and social situation of authors.

Parliament adopts report on beef and veal produce
2007-03-19 - 13:44
Parliament gave its verdict on a Commission proposal to clarify the distinction between the different types of meat currently sold in the EU under the name "veal". In a report by Bernadette BOURZAI (PES, FR), the House welcomes the Commission's approach while demanding further guarantees for consumers. There are two main types of veal production in the EU at present. In most Member States, especially France, Italy, Belgium and Germany, the term 'veal' is used for the meat of animals fed mainly on milk and slaughtered before the age of eight months. In a minority of countries (mainly Spain and Denmark), the animals are fed almost entirely on grain and only sent for slaughter after 10 months.
In the Netherlands, the two types exist in parallel: the 'white veal' (or milk-fed) sector (around 85% of the total) and the 'pink veal' (or grain-fed) sector.
'White veal' is usually regarded as being of better quality and it costs 2-3 euros more per kilogramme to produce. Yet both types are sold under the high-value name 'veal'.
To ensure fairer competition on the market and clarify matters for consumers, the Commission is proposing that meat be described according to the age at which the animal is slaughtered, as this is easier to monitor than the type of feed used. Thus, from July 2007 the following terms would be used:
- 'veal' for meat from animals aged 8 months or less;
- a term such as 'young beef' for animals aged over 8 months but no more than 12 months (though not in the case of Britain and Ireland);
- 'beef' for meat from animals over 12 months old.
For Britain and Ireland, the terms would be:
- 'veal' for meat from animals aged 8 months or less;
- 'beef' for meat from all animals over 8 months old.
In addition, the Commission is proposing to make it compulsory for labels to indicate the category of meat with a letter ('X' for veal, 'Y' for young beef) as well as the age of slaughter. Other information could also be given, such as the type of feed. Derogations would be allowed for the Netherlands, Denmark, Spain and Greece.
European veal production totalled just over 800,000 tonnes in 2005. Five Member States account for 85% of the total: France (30%), the Netherlands (25%), Italy (18%) and Belgium and Germany (6% each). France and Italy alone account for nearly 70% of consumption.
This Regulation, says MEPs, should not apply to the meat of bovine animals aged twelve months or less for which a protected designation of origin or geographical indication is registered.
View of European Parliament
The report by Bernadette Bourzai, adopted under the consultation procedure, approves the harmonisation measures proposed by the Commission but opposes the idea of derogations. It also calls for Member States to be allowed to impose penalties in the event of failure to comply.
In addition, says the House, the regulation should apply not only to fresh, frozen or deep-frozen meat but also to prepared, processed or cooked meat products. Lastly, MEPs suggest that the categories 'X' and 'Y' be replaced by 'V' for veal and 'Z' for young beef.
Council's position
In debates in Council in recent months a majority of Member States have broadly supported the Commission proposal and appear to have a similar position to MEPs regarding sanctions on fraud and the lettering to be used for different categories of meat. However, some states want derogations in certain areas. The Commission is keen for the procedure to be completed in time for the regulation to enter into force on 1 July this year.

Parliament adopts report on social services of general interest in the EU
2007-03-19 - 13:44
In its report on "social services of general interest in the European Union (SSGI)" the European Parliament welcomes the Commission's initiative to provide a specific conceptual and legal framework for this sector. MEPs state that health services, which were not included in the Commission's communication on the subject, are also SSGI. The report by Joel Hasse Ferreira (PES, PT), which was adopted by a large majority. According to MEPs, social services of general interest (SSGI) form one of the pillars of the European social model and "play an essential part in securing civic peace and the European Union’s economic, social and territorial cohesion". SSGI should not be seen as "a burden on public authorities", as they contribute to economic growth, prosperity, employment and social cohesion. Consequently, MEPs consider it a mistake to set up "a false opposition" between rules on competition, public aid and the market on the one hand, and concepts of public service, general interest and social cohesion on the other. Rather, positive synergies between the economic and social aspects should be promoted. Nevertheless, the rules on competition, public aid and the internal market must be compatible with public service requirements.
Although the House favours the establishment of public-private partnerships, the report stresses that the Member States’ public authorities are free to decide whether SSGI should be provided by mutual associations, other forms of social organisation or private businesses. Yet, public authorities should also be able to check at any time that the service providers are abiding by certain principles and values.
Adequate budgetary resources and vocational training for staff
MEPs criticise that, in some Member States, regional or local authorities are not allocated "sufficient budget resources to enable them to deliver services of the highest standard in terms of quantity and quality". Member States should therefore guarantee that any transfer of powers to regional and local authorities for the purpose of delivering SSGI is accompanied by "adequate budgetary resources". Moreover, the Commission, the Member States, and service providers should develop vocational training initiatives which enable the staff of social services to cope with circumstances such as stress, shift work or night work, and certain dangerous or demanding activities.

More EP involvement is needed on non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament
2007-03-19 - 13:44
In a resolution on non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament adopted by a large majority, the House calls upon all States whose activities violate the non-proliferation regime to stop their behaviour and to comply fully with their obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The EP wants to be better informed and involved in the preparation of the forthcoming 2010 NPT Review Conference.
While reaffirming that the NPT is the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime, they urge the Presidency to produce regular progress reports in the years leading up to the 2010 Review Conference on the implementation of each of the 43 measures adopted in the EU Common Position of 25 April 2005 relating to the 2005 NPT Review Conference.
The EP wants to send a delegation to Vienna to participate in the NPT PrepCom which will take place in Vienna from 30 April to 11 May 2007. The resolution also asks the Presidency to include representatives of the European Parliament in the EU delegation (a precedent set by the delegation to the UN Program of Action Review Conference in New York in 2006)
Finally, the European Parliament invites the Council and the Commission to clarify the steps they envisage to strengthen the Non-Proliferation Treaty and to pursue multilateralism, as set out in the December 2003 EU Strategy against the Proliferation of Materials and Weapons of Mass Destruction.

Pôttering reprimands Maciej Giertych MEP over pamphlet
2007-03-19 - 13:44
The President of the European Parliament Hans-Gert Pöttering reprimanded non-attached Polish MEP Maciej Giertych following his publication of a pamphlet ("Civilizations at War in Europe") containing anti-semitic and xenophobic statements in accordance with Article 147 of the Rules of Procedure. President Pöttering had already clearly condemned "Statements based on racism or anti-semitism" as being "against the fundamental values of the European Union". President Pöttering said to the plenary in Strasbourg: "On this occasion I deeply regretted what is objectively a serious breach of the fundamental rights and in particular the dignity of human beings to which our institution so strongly adheres.
On this basis, I have decided, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Rule 147, that a reprimand should be imposed on you, which is the first of the measures referred to in the aforementioned rule. The plenary, together with the other relevant political bodies of the House, will be duly informed once you are notified of this penalty. During my presidency, I intend to safeguard both the freedom of expression and the standard of conduct of Members, as well as the honour of this House. As I declared on 13 February 2007 in my inaugural address to the plenary, tolerance and respect for others are important European values, which are at the centre of my political priorities and to which the European Parliament is deeply committed. I trust you will understand that the European Parliament, which thrives on lively political debate and unfailingly condemns all forms of xenophobia, should under no circumstances be associated with the views published in your brochure."
President Pöttering has been previously assured by the Parliament's administration that the European Parliament has not made any financial contribution to this publication.
Rules 147 (see links) of EP Rules of Procedure states:
1. In exceptionally serious cases of disorder or disruption of Parliament in violation of the principles laid down in Rule 9, the President, after hearing the Member concerned, shall adopt a reasoned decision laying down the appropriate penalty, which he shall notify to the Member concerned and to the presiding officers of the bodies, committees and delegations on which the Member serves, before announcing them to plenary.
2. When assessing the conduct observed, account shall be taken of its exceptional, recurrent or permanent nature and of its seriousness, on the basis of the guidelines annexed to these Rules of Procedure(1).
3. The penalty may consist of one or more of the following measures:
(a) a reprimand;
(b) forfeiture of entitlement to the daily subsistence allowance for a period of between 2 and 10 days;
(c) without prejudice to the right to vote in plenary, and subject, in this instance, to strict compliance with the Members' standards of conducts, temporary suspension, for a period of between 2 and 10 consecutive days on which Parliament or any of its bodies, committees or delegations meet, from participation in all or some of the activities of Parliament;
(d) submission to the Conference of Presidents, pursuant to Rule 18, of a proposal for the Member's suspension or removal from one or more of the elected offices held by the Member in Parliament.
Rule 9.2
2. Members’ conduct shall be characterised by mutual respect, be based on the values and principles laid down in the basic texts on which the European Union is founded, respect the dignity of Parliament and not compromise the smooth conduct of parliamentary business or disturb the peace and quiet of any of Parliament's premises.

Development and cooperation
Local authorities "under-estimated and under-exploited" in development process
2007-03-19 - 13:44
Local authorities in developing countries should be given a much broader and more powerful role in the process of managing aid from European funds, according to a report adopted by the European Parliament. The report, drafted by Pierre SCHAPIRA (PES, FR), says that the role of local authorities in development has "so far been under-estimated and under-exploited", due to a lack of sufficient political dialogue on the allocation of EU aid. The House emphasises the need for "direct, appropriate funding", stating that local authorities should be involved in "each phase of the cooperation process".
Lack of genuine involvement
The importance of involving local authorities in the cooperation process, through effective political dialogue, was acknowledged in the Cotonou Agreement (2000). Yet despite clear guidelines set out by the European Commission, the report finds that "local authorities in developing countries have only been involved in the implementation of projects and not in the elaboration of development policies".
Part of the problem concerns the lack of a clearly defined role for local authorities in the development process. Local authorities should be identified separately from non-State actors, and consideration should be given to "their sphere of competence, legitimacy and democratic control, experience in management of local affairs and involvement in the implementation of public policies".
The report adds that local authorities have "added value in terms of implementing sectoral programmes", such as those involving health, education and essential public services, but are at present "often excluded from this process."
Decentralisation and local authority action
The focus of EU aid should be decentralisation, the report suggests, and that this aid should be transferred directly to local authorities. The European Parliament also emphasises that recognising and harnessing local authority action are issues which should inform the revision of the coming development instruments in 2008/2009.
Furthermore, MEPs call for the creation of an international monitoring centre for local democracy and decentralisation, in partnership with local authority organisations, in order to enable and regulate the measures which will allow local authorities to play a much more significant role in the development process.

Regional policy
Islands and natural and economic constraints
2007-03-19 - 13:44
The Commission should consider allowing state aid to be granted to island regions "where fuel and energy costs clearly adversely affect the competitiveness of the communities living on them" says an own-initiative report adopted by the European Parliament with 473 votes in favour, 26 against 35 abstentions. State aid for single market access
Given that fuel cost fluctuations can make transportation between island regions and mainland Europe "significantly more burdensome", the European Commission's next regional state aid guidelines should include a "regime allowing operating aids", says the report, which the House endorsed by a large majority.
State aid policy needs to be implemented more flexibly, notably as regards transport links such as sea and air ports, so as to give islands access to the single market on equal terms with mainland regions, adds the report, which also calls on the Commission to think about how the "market investor" (state aid eligibility) test could be adjusted to reflect the realities of life on islands that may lack such investors.
Ultraperipheral, or just insular?
Whereas measures to assist the EU's outermost, "ultraperipheral" regions have a strong legal basis in EC Treaty Article 299, the equivalent rules for islands (EC Treaty Article 158 and the Amsterdam Treaty Declaration on Islands), "have never been the subject of implementing provisions", notes the report.
Sustainable development
The report encourages island communities to use the EU financial and management facilities JASPERS and JEREMIE in order to foster the growth of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, as part of a drive to diversify island economies and promote sustainable development. It also calls on the Commission to carry out a cross-sectoral study of opportunities to support sustainable tourism within the regional strategies of islands that are far from centres of population.
Data for policymakers
To help policymakers to take account of islands' special characteristics, the report urges EU Member States to establish specific mechanisms for gathering and sending local data to the European Spatial Planning Observation Network (ESPON). It calls on the Commission to update the island statistics last gathered in 2003, to define new statistical indicators better suited to measuring economic development, and to report on them regularly, including "best practice" examples.
The report also asks the Commission to set up, within the Directorate-General for Regional Policy, an administrative unit for the islands, like the outermost regions unit, to ensure that policy developers take systematic account of the special needs of islands and their permanent and seasonal populations.

Community action on the provision of cross-border healthcare
2007-03-19 - 13:44
In adopting a resolution on community action on the provision of cross-border healthcare, MEPs welcome the Commission initiative to launch a consultation procedure on the best form of Community action with a view to providing a framework for cross-border aspects of health-care. MEPs point out that the aspects of cross-border healthcare cover both patient mobility, the mobility of healthcare professionals and the provision of healthcare from another country. The resolution also points out that the ECJ rulings specifically address the problem relating to patients' rights to seek treatment abroad, and subsequently get reimbursed by their national health insurance schemes. The House considers, therefore, that ensuring legal certainty as regards the reimbursement of the costs for cross-border healthcare is one of the priority issues for both patients, national health insurance systems and healthcare providers. MEPs underline the need to clarify procedures and conditions for reimbursement in various cases.
MEPs urge the Commission to develop common principles and basic guidelines for healthcare in order to guarantee patient safety. The House takes the view, also, that the development of harmonised health indicators (such as blood test standards) at Community level is very important for the development of exchange of best practice, particularly between health professionals. MEPs consider that the EU must play an important role in improving the availability of information for patients on cross-border mobility by coordinating cooperation between Member States in this field. Parliament considers that patient mobility must always be a matter for free patient choice and that no pressure must be brought to bear on patients' freedom of choice.
The House stress the need to ensure patient safety in all circumstances regardless of where and how healthcare is provided. MEPs call for clarity on the responsibilities between authorities in supervising healthcare providers and for effective information exchange between national authorities on the registration and disciplinary status of health care professionals. Parliament considers it necessary to create a mechanism for appeals on malpractice in cross-border healthcare. Parliament points out the necessity for common classification of the health services in the EU.
The House points out that, in almost all cases, healthcare and medical treatment require follow-up, which may take a long time. MEPs recognise the need for clear rules on the division of tasks and responsibilities between healthcare providers during the different stages of treatment and care. MEPs consider the introduction of a legislative framework at Community level as the best way to ensure legal certainty for patients, national healthcare systems and for private healthcare providers. The House believes that it is also the best way to enhance the optimal use of healthcare resources and speed up access to treatment.
MEPs consider it necessary to incorporate in the legal framework a mechanism for data collection and exchange of information between national authorities on healthcare providers, their registration and disciplinary status, and available expertise. Parliament believes also that the creation of a network of European Centres of Reference would bring considerable benefits to the treatment of diseases. The House appeals to the Member States to introduce a one-stop shop approach for complaint procedures for patients. The House considers it necessary, for patient safety, to incorporate into the legal framework a duty that national authorities exchange registration and disciplinary information about healthcare professionals engaging in cross-border healthcare.
The House calls on the Commission to pay special attention to the provision of information to patients on their rights and obligations and introduce appropriate provisions in its legislative proposal. Finally, the European Parliament believes that the forthcoming Community framework can provide an opportunity to empower European citizens as patients as well as encourage Member States to develop their healthcare systems.

External/international trade
Euro-Mediterranean relations - MEPs stress the importance of dialogue between cultures
2007-03-19 - 13:44
MEPs adopted a joint resolution on Euro-Mediterranean relations stressing the importance of dialogue between cultures and religions, by reaffirming the need for respect for common values and the development of the rule of law, democracy and human rights. The House considers that no terrorist act can be justified in any circumstances, that terrorist acts cannot be justified by the pursuit of political or religious objectives and that the fight against terrorism cannot legitimise the stigmatisation of any particular culture, civilisation or religion. MEPs call on all countries to abide by their legal obligation to respect human rights and international humanitarian law in the fight against terrorism.
The European Parliament call on the Commission to do everything possible to bring about the setting up of democracy and human rights committees with all countries signatory to the ENP action plans, and calls on the partner countries to respect their undertakings in this connection, particularly with regard to individual cases.
Parliament reiterates its call to all contracting parties to the Euro-Mediterranean association agreements to translate the human rights clause into a programme for action to enhance and promote respect for human rights and to put in place a mechanism for the regular assessment of compliance with Article 2 of the Association Agreement, in order to make it more effective and more binding.
The House highlights the necessity to address women’s rights within the EuroMed Dialogue and stresses the importance of legislative reforms to support gender equality. MEPs underline the importance of women’s participation in political, economic and social life as well as in the media. The House calls for improvement of women’s access to education and healthcare especially in the southern states of the partnership.
MEPs call on the Council and Commission and the governments of the partner countries to give prime importance to environmental problems and in particular to tackle the consequences of urban concentration and industrial and commercial activities on both sides of the Mediterranean.
The House calls on the Commission and the Member States to promote respect for social and trade union rights when implementing financial and technical aid to the partner countries.
MEPs call for a major development of investments in the region as part of the European strategy with regard to financial policies and resources in the regional and intra-regional dimension of the Partnership, which would constitute value added for this strategy. The House invites the Commission, as was decided when the EU budget for 2007 was adopted, to ensure that, when drawing up the relevant strategy papers and related programmes, total resources for regional and multilateral activities are maintained at the level achieved in the 2000-2006 period; taking account of the fact that, according to the Commission, this level has reached 20 % of the total amount.
Finally, the European Parliament stresses the need to strengthen cooperation on security of energy supply in the Mediterranean region through measures involving the diversification of domestic energy resources, especially at local and regional level, the promotion of energy efficiency, particularly at decentralised level, conservation methods, the development of new technologies that present no public or environmental risk, research and development activities and the strengthening of financial options for sustainable energy projects.
An own-initiative report by Kader ARIF (PES, FR) on the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area regrets the fact that Barcelona's three main objectives (establishment of a common area of peace and stability; creation of an area of shared prosperity through an economic partnership and the creation of a FTA; cooperation in social, cultural and human affairs to promote a dialogue between cultures in the region) are still far from being achieved.
The House stresses that customs duties still account for a substantial share of the SEMCs' (the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean countries) tax revenue. The House considers, therefore, that it is necessary for the timetable for any subsequent reduction to be carried out to take into account the economic progress made by the SEMCs and the time needed to implement equitable tax reforms designed to offset the reduction in customs revenues.
Financial and technical assistance
MEPs regret the fact that the EU has been unable to make available funding which is commensurate with the objectives of the Barcelona Process, this being one of the causes of the accumulated delays in creating the FTA. The resolution notes that the lack of financial attractiveness is a major brake on FDI in the SEMCs, with negative effects on the region's economic growth.
The House recalls that investments have a very important impact in terms of subcontracting, propagation of know-how and meeting training needs in a region which as a whole is under-industrialised, and in terms of job creation.
Agriculture
The report considers that the opening-up of agricultural markets should be defined jointly and implemented progressively and asymmetrically, while providing for the possibility of a certain number of exceptions and time schedules and taking into account the EU's and the SEMCs' joint prospects for this sector and the differences between, and individual characteristics of, the agricultural sector in different countries.
The textile sector
The House reiterates its concern about the consequences of the end of the Multifibre Arrangement on 1 January 2005 and the abolition of quotas for the performance of the textile and clothing sector in the SEMCs and the EU. The resolution points out that this sector plays a crucial role in the economies of many SEMCs and some European countries. Parliament stresses that implementation of a programme aiming to improve the sector’s competitiveness, with Commission support, would serve a useful purpose. The House considers that the major difficulties faced by the textile sector could inevitably have adverse consequences for the economy of EU countries and the SEMCs and, indirectly, the establishment of the FTA. The European Parliament considers that, when the EU's new commercial and investment strategy with regard to China and, more generally, European commercial policy towards Asia are formulated, their possible impact on SEMCs and EU countries should be taken into account.
Lebanon
MEPs deplore the systematic destruction of Lebanon's economic system and infrastructures during the recent conflict with Israel, which will cause delays in the country's development and the establishment of the FTA. The House notes the results of the conference of 25 January 2007 on the reconstruction of Lebanon, and supports the efforts to organise international aid to that country in the long term. MEPs calls for the EU, in the context of the current peace process, to continue to provide sufficient financial support to help the Lebanese to cope with the challenges of the economic and social reconstruction of their country, following the conflict of July 2006. The House expresses its strong concern about the situation of the Palestinian territories and consequently calls on the Council and the Commission, in cooperation with the international community, to provide the Palestinian population with essential humanitarian aid. MEPs note that Israel has transferred part of the Palestinian tax and customs revenues which it was holding, and calls on the Israeli Government to pay the remainder of these frozen sums as a matter of urgency. The House urges the Commission to insist on compliance with the clauses relating to the Barcelona Process, in particular the human rights clause included in the Association Agreements and the various action plans, in order to achieve a true area of freedom and security in the region.

Human rights: killings in Guatemala and Cambodia, abuses in Nigeria
2007-03-19 - 13:44
Parliament adopted its customary three human rights resolutions at the end of the plenary session on Thursday. The first is a response to the assassinations in Guatemala of three Members of the Central American Parliament. The second looks at the murder of trade unionists in Cambodia. In the third, the Nigerian government is pressed to deal with a range of issues ahead of the elections next month. Killings of parliamentarians in Guatemala
In response to the assassinations in Guatemala on 19 February of three Members of the Central American Parliament (PARLACEN) and the subsequent murder of the presumed killers, the European Parliament, in a resolution adopted by 57 votes to 0 with 1 abstention, calls on the Guatemalan authorities to face up to their responsibilities.
On 19 February the three parliamentarians (all from El Salvador) and their driver were murdered as they drove towards the PARLACEN plenary meeting. The alleged perpetrators of these crimes, who worked in the Guatemala Police Department, were themselves subsequently killed "in bizarre circumstances which have still not been clarified", says the resolution. Television journalists who covered the murder of the four police officers have received death threats.
A deep-rooted problem
This is not an isolated case. Several thousand homicides are committed every year in Guatemala but arrests are made in only 2% of cases. Threats and burglaries are suffered by witnesses and legal representatives of genocide victims and human rights organisations.
Organised crime is "deeply entrenched in the public institutions" and "has penetrated the Guatemalan police", contributing to "an atmosphere of impunity, and the deterioration of public safety", says the resolution. This "points to the need to assume political responsibility".
Government is responsible for protecting judiciary and human rights activists
In its resolution the European Parliament first expresses "its total repudiation of all the murders concerned, and transmits its condolences to the victims' relatives".
The EP then says it "expects the Guatemalan Government to guarantee full independence, liberty and security to the Guatemalan judicial authorities in their investigation of these crimes" and "calls for the full cooperation of the political, judicial and police authorities in Guatemala and El Salvador in the investigation of the events".
More widely, MEPs call on the government "to protect the judicial agents, the victims of crimes against humanity who are seeking justice, the human rights activists, and the witnesses who can help the trials progress". The EP "welcomes the restructuring and purge of the security forces introduced by the government".
Combating impunity
The resolution urges the Guatemalan Parliament to "ratify the agreement signed on 12 December 2006 by the Government of Guatemala with the United Nations setting up an International Commission of Inquiry against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG)". The Guatemalan Parliament is also pressed to ratify the Statute on the International Criminal Court.
Lastly, the EP calls on the European Commission, under the cooperation strategy with Guatemala for 2007-2013, to promote "the rule of law, the fight against impunity, full respect for human rights and support for the Government of Government in capacity building of its security forces on the basis of human safety criteria".

Murder of trade unionists in Cambodia condemned
The background to the resolution on Cambodia - which was adopted by 59 votes to 0 with 0 abstentions - is the murder of several trade unionists in recent years, the unreliable conviction of two people for one of the murders and the general lack of respect for the rule of law and basic rights in the country.
Trade unionists not safe
The murders of Hy Vuthy, Chea Vichea and Ros Sovannarith are the most prominent cases cited by the resolution, although other trade unionists in Cambodia "have been victims of serious harassment, intimidation and physical attacks in the past year".
Two individuals, Born Sammang and Sok Sam Oeun, were arrested for the murder of Chea Vichea and sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment "despite the lack of any credible evidence against them", says the resolution.
The EP is "seriously concerned that these cases demonstrate that there is still no guarantee of the independence and impartiality of the judiciary".
Khmer Rouge tr ials
Nor is there any guarantee of the judiciary's ability to conduct the trials of the Khmer Rouge leaders in the specially created court (the ECCC) without political interference, say MEPs. This court has not started work, because of disagreements between Cambodian and international judicial officers on the court's draft internal rules.
Cambodian authorities must tackle judicial and other problems
Parliament's resolution therefore "condemns the killing of Hy Vuthy and all other acts of violence against trade unionists; urges the Cambodian authorities to launch an urgent, impartial and effective investigation into the murders of Hu Vuthy, Chea Vichea, Ros Sovannarith and Yim Ry" and "calls on the authorities to give Born Sammang and Sok Sam Oeum a prompt retrial which complies with international standards".
It also "insists that the Cambodian Government must put an end to the prevailing climate of impunity and effectively apply the law to violators of human rights and civil liberties".
More broadly, the authorities are urged "to engage in political and institutional reforms with a view to building a democratic State" and "to ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, in accordance with international human rights standards and international conventions ratified by Cambodia".
The Cambodian Government must also "allow the Khmer Rouge Tribunal to start operating without further delay, in accordance with international standards of judicial independence, fair trial and due legal process, as agreed with the UN in June 2003".
Human rights and democracy: a cornerstone of Cambodia's agreement with EU
Lastly, MEPs remind the Cambodian Government that "it must meet its obligations and commitments with regard to the democratic principles and fundamental human rights" under its Cooperation Agreement with the EU. The Council and the Commission of the EU are asked "to address the concerns over human rights and the rule of law in Cambodia in their contacts with the Cambodian Government".

Nigeria urged to tackle abuses ahead of elections
Looking ahead to the elections in Nigeria in April, the European Parliament voted, by 36 votes to 24 with 1 abstention, for a resolution put forward by the EPP-ED group condemning a wide range of human rights and democracy abuses in that country. This replaced a joint draft resolution, supported by several political groups, which focused on the single issue of a draft law in Nigeria seeking to ban same-sex marriage and criminalise homosexual activity.
Need for government to tackle human rights violations
In the adopted resolution the European Parliament "calls on the Nigerian Government to take immediate and effective measures to protect its citizens, put an end to the violence, the widespread corruption and the impunity for the perpetrators of human rights violations, and actively promote respect for human rights".
It also calls on the Government "to abolish the death penalty and to intervene in individual cases of persons tried under Sharia law and sentenced to death, amputation, flogging or other inhuman and degrading treatment that violates the Nigerian Constitution as well as international human rights law".
MEPs welcome "the multilateral agreement among 26 western and central African countries against trafficking in women and children, as well as other efforts made in this domain by the Nigerian authorities". However, they call on the Government "to take further measures in this area as well as in tackling the exploitation of children through child labour".
Call for clean elections
The EP argues that past state and national elections in 1999 and 2003 "could not be considered as free and fair due to widespread fraud and violence". Therefore all stakeholders in the forthcoming national elections in April are called upon "to publicly declare their commitment to ending political violence, killings, intimidations and other human rights abuses as well as impunity for such crimes".
The Nigerian Government is also pressed "to address pre-election concerns regarding limitations on the independence of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), abusive conduct and harassment by security forces, and any other obstacle to freedom of expression and opinion and other basic requirements for free and fair elections".
No to ban on gay marriage
Lastly, turning to the topic on which the non-adopted joint draft resolution had focused, MEPs call on the Nigerian Parliament "not to adopt the 'Same Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act' in its current form, since it contains infringements of the basic human rights of freedom of expression and opinion, in particular when it envisages a five-year prison sentence for anyone involved publicly or privately in positive representation of or advocacy for same sex relationships".

Human rights
Attack on Galina Kozlova and oppression of Mari minority in Russia condemned
2007-03-19 - 13:44
In a parliamentary resolution, MEPs roundly condemned the recent attack on Mari activist Galina Kozlova and called on the Russian authorities to "bring the perpetrators of these acts to justice and ensure respect for freedom of expression." The House emphasised the importance of minority languages and cultures in the Russian federation, and called on the Commission to raise the issue during the regular EU-Russia human rights dialogue. On 25 January of this year, Galina Kozlova, a member of the board of the Mari national organisation Mari Usem, and wife of Vladimir Kozlov, chair of the Mari council, was attacked and suffered severe head injuries. The attack follows a series of attacks on Mari activists and journalists in the Mari El republic, and no convictions or arrests have been made. The Mari are a Finno-Ugric minority in Russia, concentrated in the Mari El republic. They are pushing for full cultural and linguistic rights, such as access to secondary and higher education in their language.
The Parliament's resolution calls for a "speedy, comprehensive and independent inquiry by federal, and local judicial authorities into the attacks." It also calls on the Government of Mari El "to halt political retribution and intimidation" and to "refrain from undue political interference in the affairs of educational and cultural institutions." MEPs insisted that Russian authorities enable "quality education in a person's native language at all levels," and called on the Commission to raise the issue of Finno-Ugric minorities during the regular EU-Russia human rights dialogue.

Petitions
MEPs concerned about illegal bird hunting in Malta
2007-03-19 - 13:44
In adopting a resolution on illegal bird hunting in Malta with 300 votes in favour, 253 against and 35 abstentions, MEPs takes note of the report on the fact-finding mission of the Committee of Petitions during which the facts were examined in situ from 9-12 May 2005, and supports the recommendations in the report. The European Parliament has received several petitions against the practices of spring hunting and trapping of migratory birds in Malta, including a petition from the Belgian Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, signed by 300 000 Europeans, more than 4000 of whom from Malta. 115 000 Europeans, notably from the UK, petitioned the Maltese Government in February 2007 in protest against the spring hunting. The Committee on Petitions has examined the allegations made in the petitions and dispatched a delegation to Malta to establish the facts of the situation in situ.
The report on the fact-finding mission concluded that, although certain efforts had been made by the Maltese authorities responsible seeking to bring national legislation and its application into compliance with Community law, the sustainability and survival of populations of several species of migratory birds still face serious threats from illegal and indiscriminate hunting and trapping when birds of these species pass through Malta during their spring migration.
The House shares the concerns expressed in the report on the fact-finding mission, in particular in respect of the authorisation of spring hunting of resting migratory birds and trapping and illegal hunting of protected species, including in areas protected under Community law. MEPs condemn all types of illegal hunting in all Member States. The EP calls on the Maltese Government and the Commission to publish their full technical positions on the subject.
Parliament welcomes the Commission's decision to investigate the compliance of Maltese legislation and its application with Directive 79/409/EEC on the protection of wild birds and strongly urges the Commission to redouble its efforts to persuade the Maltese authorities to comply fully with Community law.
The House Calls on the Maltese Government to fully comply with the EU Wild Birds Directive, the relevant Community law and the terms of the Accession Treaty as signed by the Maltese Government. Parliament welcomes the decision by the Maltese Government to address cases of abuse by, inter alia, increasing fines to a maximum of €14 000 and providing for terms of imprisonment of up to two years and the permanent revocation of hunting licences in the case of recidivists. MEPs welcome the decision by the Maltese Government to ban the capturing of finches and the hunting of birds at sea during spring.

Textbooks and lawbooks: MEPs underline the importance of constitutional, educational and police reform in Bosnia-Herzegovina
2007-03-19 - 13:44
While welcoming positive signs of change from Bosnia-Herzegovina, for instance in the police sector, the Parliament noted that constitutional reform was a pressing priority for the country, especially in recent times of increasing ethnic and nationalistic tensions. The adopted report also maintained that "education is the primary vehicle for reconciliation," and suggested ways to reform the sector. The own-initiative report, drafted by Doris PACK (EPP-ED, DE), expresses MEPs' concern about the fact that "formerly moderate parties [...] resorted during the campaign to confrontational and divisive language" in the recent elections. It also condemns the failure to arrest all the war criminals still at large in the country, and the fact that "documents potentially of use to the investigations" have disappeared. (Par 9) The House was also troubled by the "persisting ethnic barriers in Bosnia-Herzegovina" (BH).
At the same time, Members welcomed recent plans to restructure the police forces, and insisted on the country's "clear prospect of European integration" as a basis of EU-BH relations. The committee urged the country's political leaders to undertake necessary reforms, especially with respect to the State's Constitution and education policy. It also recommended establishing a "truth and reconciliation commission for the country," and emphasized the need for implementing public broadcasting reforms.
With respect to education, MEPs argued strongly in favour of "dealing with the burden of the past, including the issue of persons who went missing during the bloody conflict," and noted that this implied "an end to the segregation of different ethnic groups schooled under the same roof, a debate on the creation of a common curriculum for those in compulsory schooling, paying special attention to the way history is taught, and improved continuing training for teachers.
On the constitution, Ms. Pack's report takes the view that "the EU, under the aegis of the EU Special Representative (EUSR), should play a leading role in re-launching the constitutional debate, notably by facilitating the dialogue between the parties." It also warns against any attempt to carve out "mono-ethnic territories," or otherwise undermining the multi-ethnic character of BH.
Finally, the Parliament expressed its satisfaction with the decision to reconsider closing down the Office of the High Representative (OHR), whose mandate runs out on 30 June of this year. The Peace Implementation Council (PIC), which oversees the OHR, has recently said it would maintain the office until June, 2008, a position which has been systematically advocated by the EP. Members also welcomed the extension of the mandate of the EUSR in the region, and regretted the recent announcement by Christian Schwarz-Schilling (who currently holds both the post of EUSR and the Head of OHR) to step down in June this year, commending the work he has carried out during his mandate.
