Current EU rules forbid any health food claims for baby food intended for infants from 0-6 months
Â©www.flickr.com/21524179@N08 (nerissa's ring) Baby food makers will not be allowed to mention health claims of DHA Environment MEPs defy European Food Safety Authority and European Commission An application from various baby food manufacturers to laud the presence of DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) in their products has been slapped down by the Parliament's Environment Committee. In a close vote they rejected permission for baby food makers to claim that DHA "contributes to the normal visual development of infants up to 12 months of age". Current EU rules forbid any health claims for babies from 0-6 months.
The Omega 3 fatty acid DHA is found naturally in breast milk and researchers believe it contributes to the development of eyesight and brain development in infants. Many manufacturers already add the substance to their products.
Manufacturers applied for permission to make the health claim for DHA added to baby food (including follow-on formulae) for infants from 6-12 months.
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) gave a favourable opinion on the application and the European Commission proposed to add the health claim "DHA intake contributes to the normal visual development of infants up to 12 months of age" to the list of permitted claims.
MEPs not convinced by laboratory produced DHA
However, recent studies question the beneficial effects of DHA products. The problem is that the laboratory synthesized substances are not the same as the ones naturally present in human milk.
A group of MEPs from the Socialist and Democrat group - Glenis Willmott (UK), Daciana Sarbu (Romania), Nessa Childers (Ireland) and Karin Kadenbach (Austria) drew up a resolution arguing that there is no scientific consensus on the impact that DHA-fortified formulae has on infants.
They argue that more research is needed on the beneficial or harmful effects of added DHA. They believe the health claim could be misleading and might be misused as a marketing tool.

The full European Parliament is likely to put the resolution adopted by the Environment Committee to a vote in April.
