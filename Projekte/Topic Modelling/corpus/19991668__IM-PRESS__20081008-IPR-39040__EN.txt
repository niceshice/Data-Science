Arctic governance: European Parliament deeply concerned about the effects of climate change
Regional policy
2008-10-09 - 12:05
In adopting a resolution on Artic governance, MEPs say that they are concerned at the effects of climate change on the sustainability of the lives of the indigenous peoples, in terms of both the environment (melting icecap and permafrost, rising sea levels) and the natural habitat (the retreating icecap poses problems for polar bears' feeding habits), and underline that any international decisions on these issues must fully involve and take account of all peoples and nations of the Arctic.
MEPs underline that Arctic species and societies have developed very specialised adaptations to the harsh conditions found at the poles, thus making them extremely vulnerable to dramatic changes in these conditions; is very concerned for walruses, polar bears, seals and other marine mammals which rely on sea ice for resting, feeding, hunting and breeding, and which are particularly threatened by climate change.
Parliament calls on the Commission to include energy and security policy in the Arctic region on its agenda, and to propose, in particular, in its expected communication on the region, suitable subjects and joint working procedures for the EU and the Arctic countries in, especially, the fields of climate change, sustainable development, security of energy supply and maritime safety.
Special attention in climate negotiations
MEPs draw attention to the fact that the Arctic region, by virtue of its impact on the world's climate and its singular natural environment, merits special consideration as the EU develops its position for the 2009 COP 15 Framework Convention on Climate Change in Copenhagen.
Parliament supports the Arctic Council in maintaining the Arctic region as a region of low tension, open to international research cooperation, so as to allow its potential as a future energy supplier region to be fully developed within a sustainable environmental framework.
MEPs urge the Commission to take a proactive role in the Arctic by at least, as a first step, taking up 'observer status' on the Arctic Council, and consider that the Commission should set up a dedicated Arctic desk;
New Treaty?
The House suggests that the Commission should be prepared to pursue the opening of international negotiations designed to lead to the adoption of an international treaty for the protection of the Arctic. The House believes, however, that as a minimum starting-point such a treaty could at least cover the unpopulated and unclaimed area at the centre of the Arctic Ocean.
Finally, MEPs say that they remain particularly concerned over the ongoing race for natural resources in the Arctic, which may lead to security threats for the EU and overall international instability.
The resolution was adopted with 597 votes in favour, 23 against and 41 abstentions.
