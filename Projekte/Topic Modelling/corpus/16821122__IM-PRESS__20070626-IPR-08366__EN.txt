European roaming
Before the special plenary debate on the outcome of last weekend's summit, the regulation on mobile phone roaming was signed into law by European Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering and Council President-in-Office Angela Merkel.
Thanks to a first-reading agreement brokered by the European Parliament, the EU's mobile roaming regulation will come into force ahead of the summer holidays, slashing the costs of making and receiving calls while travelling abroad. The regulation enables consumers to benefit from a so-called Eurotariff, a price cap for mobile telephone roaming calls made (€0.49 per minute) and for calls received (€0.24 per minute).
" This is a good day for 140 million mobile telephone users in the European Union ", said Mr. Hans-Gert Pöttering. " The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have acted quickly, decisively and efficiently in the interests of our citizens: in record time - a mere 11 months after the Commission submitted its proposal for a regulation - the new Regulation on roaming will enter into force at the end of this week, on 30 June ."
" From this summer onwards, mobile telephone customers will already have the benefit of permanently reduced roaming charges. [...] To me, this is a good example of a Europe which achieves results, a Union whose action confers practical benefits on its citizens ."
" Sometimes technical legislation is hard for people to understand ," said Chancellor Merkel, "but anyone who has one of these in their pockets [she took out a mobile phone] can grasp the benefits of this regulation".
