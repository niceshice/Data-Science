Waiting for asylum: Zina Rasam and family
Spending years in an asylum centre separated from family and friends and unable to work in the outside community - this is the distressing story that many asylum seekers in Europe currently face. Zina Rasam is a graduate of civil engineering from Iraq. She has been in the Sandholm detention centre near Copenhagen since 2005. On 10 April she spoke to MEPs about her experiences in the camp and her hopes for the future. After the meeting she shared some of her experiences with us.
Zina and her 10 year old daughter joined her husband, who had been in the camp since 2000, at Sandholm over three years ago. She is waiting to hear if her appeal to be granted asylum will be accepted after her initial request was rejected.
Waiting exacts a mental and physical toll
Although conditions at the camp were found to be good by visiting MEPs, the fact that Zina cannot leave means that to all intents and purposes the centre has become a prison. "The hardest thing is that we don't know when we can leave. Spending several years in a centre creates a lot of stress and nervousness," she said. The waiting and uncertainty as to their ultimate fate can take a physical toll. Zina explained that "illnesses like headaches, stomach cramps and high blood pressure are very common".
The meeting in Copenhagen with MEPs was also attended by non governmental organisations who work in the asylum field. Bente Reich is a psychiatrist experienced in dealing with asylum seekers. She told the meeting that "living in an asylum centre for years has serious consequences for the physical and mental health of the asylum seekers". She said "international studies show that the number of attempted suicides within asylum centers is approximately six times higher than outside in the surrounding society."
A strong desire to work and "contribute to society"
For Zina one of the most frustrating aspects of her fate is that she has good academic skills (she is a civil engineer) and would like to use them. "My strongest hope is to one day be able to contribute to society," she said.
The fact that her case as been reopened has given her hope that one day she will be allowed to stay: "I hope I will be able to stay here in Denmark with my husband and daughter. Our future is not in Iraq. I hope to learn Danish soon â€“ my little daughter already speaks Danish very well, and she also wishes to stay here."
Last year the Danish authorities granted asylum to 1275 individuals and gave out a total of over 37,000 residence permits. Zina Rasam and her family are hoping that this year they will be among the lucky ones granted asylum.
