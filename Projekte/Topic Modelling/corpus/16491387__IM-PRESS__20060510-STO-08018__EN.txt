Don't let roaming charges spoil your summer holidays
With the summer holidays coming up, when many Europeans will travel abroad, the subject of roaming charges is again rearing its ugly head. "Roaming" - the use of mobile phones via foreign networks - can prove unexpectedly costly and a hearing at the European Parliament on 4 May looked at whether it's time for the EU to set rules ensuring fair and transparent tariffs.
The hearing jointly organised by the Committees for Industry and Internal market aimed to look at what progress has been made over high roaming costs since a hearing in March 2005. The Commission is currently working on a proposal on international roaming charges, which it could put to the European Parliament and Ministers before the summer break. It would not set an “ideal price”, but would require that international roaming charges are not higher than national roaming charges.
Experts from the mobile phone industry said that several European operators have recently introduced simplified tariff packages, adding that the market is becoming more competitive. They also warned that legislation could lead to less investment in the sector and an increase in national tariffs. They want self regulation. However, a representative of European consumer organisation BEUC said that was too little, too late. MEPs urged price-transparency and wanted full discussion between the regulators and the European Commission before the proposal is finalised.
In the meantime, for those who want to avoid a massive mobile phone bill after the summer holiday, check out the Commission website below, which gives advice on how to reduce roaming costs.
