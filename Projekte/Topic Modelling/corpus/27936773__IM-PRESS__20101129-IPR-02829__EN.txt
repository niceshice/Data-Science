EU Globalisation Adjustment Fund aid worth €8,728,978 for workers in Spain, Poland and the Netherlands was approved by Parliament's Budgets Committee on Thursday. The seven applications now just need final approval by the Council and the full Parliament.
In total, 2,312 redundant workers (retail trade, car and construction sectors) in Spain, 779 former workers in the car and ship building industry in Poland and 613 ex-employees in the ICT sector in the Netherlands are set to receive support.
The Spanish authorities applied for aid to unemployed workers in three regions: Valencia (several firms in the construction and textile sector), Catalonia (the Lear company, producing electrical equipment for cars) and Aragón (several firms in the retail trade sector).
The two Polish applications concern the Wielkopolskie province (two firms in the car industry) and the H.Cegielski-Poznań company, the only Polish manufacturer of marine engines, plus its suppliers.
The Dutch application is for two ICT companies, Getronics and HP, in the region of Noord Holland. Barbara MATERA (EPP, IT) drafted all seven reports.

The fund's annual ceiling is €500 million.
