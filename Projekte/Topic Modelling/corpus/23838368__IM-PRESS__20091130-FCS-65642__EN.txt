The UN Copenhagen Climate Conference "COP15" opens on 7 December ©Belga From December 7 all eyes were on Copenhagen as the world's leaders tried to come up with a post-2012 deal to mitigate climate change. Parliament urged delegates to reach an ambitious, binding deal although this proved impossible. The EU had already adopted its unconditional "20/20/20 by 2020" Climate Package, promising to boost its CO2 reduction to 30%. This focus takes you through the Parliament's preparations for Copenhagen and the debate on 20 January which was marked by disappointment.
In December 2008, the EP gave its backing to the EU’s Climate Package which aims to ensure that the EU will achieve its ambitious climate targets: a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, a 20% improvement in energy efficiency, and a 20% share for renewables in the overall EU energy consumption by 2020. The objective of the "Energy Efficiency Package" is to mobilise EU policy makers and market actors to make buildings, appliances, means of transport and energy systems more energy efficient.
In a resolution adopted in autumn, MEPs called upon the EU to lead the fight for climate protection. It urges an ambitious and legally binding agreement with funding commitments, emission reduction targets for developed and developing countries and sanctions for non-compliance.
The EP also called for emission reductions in the developed world to be at the high end of the 25-40% range by 2020, with a long-term reduction target of at least 80% by 2050 compared to 1990. Emerging economies China, India and Brazil must aim for similar targets, with developing countries as a group limiting their emission growth to 15-30% below "business as usual".

Copenhagen: MEPs urge EU to continue leading fight against climate change
Parliament's expectations for the Copenhagen climate change summit in December included an ambitious and legally binding agreement that will require emission reduction targets for developed and developing countries as well as funding commitments and sanctions for non-compliance.
EU government leaders must demonstrate political leadership to make a success of the summit, say MEPs in a resolution adopted in November. Future generations might not be able to control climate change if global action is further delayed.
The Copenhagen summit should at the very least result in a binding agreement on climate change mitigation targets for industrialised countries and on financing. In addition, a formal process should be established to achieve a comprehensive legally binding post-2012 agreement by early next year. This agreement should become active on 1 January 2013.
A couple of weeks ahead of the COP15 meeting in Copenhagen in December, which is expected to finalise an international agreement on a framework for combating climate change for the period after 2012, MEPs call heads of state and government to give this matter top priority and demonstrate political leadership. They urge the EU to develop an external climate policy and to speak with one voice to maintain a leading role in the COP 15 negotiations.
"The EU has taken up a leadership position in the fight for climate protection and we want to keep it that way in Copenhagen. Therefore we need to stand by our offer: a 30% reduction of Co2 in 2020," said Environment Committee chair Jo Leinen (S&D, DE).
In a resolution adopted by 516 votes to 92, with 70 abstentions, MEPs say the international agreement should ensure that:
developed countries significantly reduce their emissions collectively (at the high end of the 25-40 % range by 2020 and a long-term reduction target of at least 80% by 2050 compared to 1990;
developing countries as a group limit their emission growth to 15 - 30% below "business as usual" but, given their economic weight, China, India and Brazil should commit themselves to targets similar to those of the industrialised countries;
developed countries are made responsible for providing sufficient, sustainable and predictable financial and technical support to developing countries - this support for climate change mitigation and adaptation must be new and additional to Official Development Assistance; about €5-7 billion of this should be fast-start funding for the period 2010 -2012;
the collective contribution of the EU towards developing countries' mitigation efforts and adaptation needs should not be less than €30 billion per year by 2020;
both emission reduction targets and financing commitments need to be subject to a tougher compliance regime, including an early warning mechanism and penalties;
stringent project quality standards must be part of future offsetting mechanisms, to prevent industrialised countries taking away the low-cost reduction options from developing countries and to guarantee reliable, verifiable and real emission reductions;
international aviation and shipping should be integrated into an international agreement with the same binding targets as for other industry sectors and an auctioning of at least 50 % of the allowances;
significant support must be provided to developing countries to halt gross tropical deforestation by 2020 and a Global Forest Carbon Mechanism should be created under the UNFCCC framework.
MEPs emphasise that an agreement in Copenhagen could stimulate a 'Sustainable New Deal' boosting economic growth, promoting environmentally sustainable technologies, reducing energy consumption and securing new jobs in both industrialised and developing countries.
Regarding the input of other developed countries to the Copenhagen conference, MEPs urge the USA to make the goals set during the election campaign binding, thereby sending a strong signal. They stress that it is also extremely important for India to make a contribution, they recognise Japan's commitment to reduce its emissions by 25% by 2020 and they welcome the positive signals from China in the light of these developments.

Environment head Jo Leinen calls for "solidarity" at Copenhagen climate summit
The head of Parliament's Environment Committee Jo Leinen MEP on his return from Washington. "The Obama Administration is very ambitious but the Americans have come quite late" says the head of Parliament's Environment Committee Jo Leinen. The German Socialist MEP is just back from talks with the US Congress ahead of the UN's Copenhagen climate summit in December where he will lead Parliament's delegation. In this interview Leinen says that a lack of targets for CO2 cuts and who is going to finance climate adaption and mitigation are two stumbling blocks.
You are just back from Washington where you met members of the US Congress - what signals did you get? Do you think the US will undertake emission reduction commitments and do you think a transatlantic carbon market will be created?
The Obama Administration is very ambitious in climate protection but the Americans have come quite late. So they are behind the European Union and I hear that for Copenhagen the Congress will not have passed the legislation on climate protection.
So there are many open questions about what will be their commitment in the short term for Copenhagen. In the medium and long term I am sure that we have a change of mindset in US politics and the US technology industry. If the Americans engage in a topic, they want to be number one and they are really competing with Europe in technology.
There are many issues on the table for Copenhagen: targets, climate financing and technology transfer to name three. Which issues do you think have the power to deadlock negotiations?
There are two blocking issues. One is the concrete commitment of industrialised countries on reduction targets for CO2. I think the developing world and the emerging countries want to see concrete binding commitments by the industrialised world who has already burdened the atmosphere for 200 years with climate gases.
The second blocking issue is financing climate adaptation and mitigation in developing countries. So, Europe, USA and Japan have to put on the table concrete proposals on how much money they are ready to give for the developing world for being in the same consensus on the same agreement.
Last week the EU leaders produced a "conditional offer" running short of ambitious objectives laid down by EP Environment Committee. Will the EU still have a strong negotiating position?
The EU is so far the only actor in the world proposing concrete targets on CO2 reduction and a financial framework to help the developing countries. What is coming out of the European Council is not enough, it is too weak and I think it is too timid. So there must be more engagement till Copenhagen to commit a real act of solidarity between the rich world and the poor world.

UN Climate chief Pachauri optimistic about Copenhagen
Indian Scientist Dr Rajendra Pachauri, Chair of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC), is optimistic about Copenhagen. The Chair of the UN panel on climate change has told us that he is optimistic that a change in public opinion will lead to a breakthrough at the Copenhagen climate summit. Dr Rajendra Pachauri also said reductions in emissions can be made without compromising economic output. We put a series of reader's questions to him prior to his appearance with Paul McCartney at the "Less Meat = Less Heat" debate in the Parliament's Chamber on Thursday (3 December) which called for people to eat less meat.
The UN's Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) is the leading body for assessing climate change science. Their assessment reports have formed the basis for policy making and have warned that a temperature rise of more than 2 degrees Celsius in the next century would be calamitous for life on earth.
Joseph Caruana (Malta) asked whether the COP15 (the Copenhagen climate summit) will become the first instance of a diplomatic collision course between developed and underdeveloped world?
I hope not because I think we have a shared interest, every developed and developing country is going to be victims of the impact of climate change, therefore we must realise that we are in it together. There is the principle of common but different responsibilities, which would impose different levels of commitments depending of what the state of other country is.
Some counties, particularly in parts of Africa, Asia and also in Latin America don’t have the capacity to be able to adapt to the impact of climate change. I think that the developed world will have to come to their assistance that is a moral and an ethical issue.
I am optimistic about Copenhagen because I have seen a major change in public opinion over the last 2 years, particularly since the fourth assessment support of the IPCC came out. So I think all of this will come together.
Philip Strothmann (Germany) believes that with likely US proposals and China's offer to reduce their emissions intensity, then a rise in 2° is unavoidable. Is he right?
If we don’t take action, we will exceed 2 degrees Celsius, no question about it.
Whatever agreement we come up with in Copenhagen will certainly not be the last word. Science must inform public policy in this area. The fifth assessment report of the IPCC, which will come up in 2013 and 2014, will provide further information.
Isaak Magerman (Belgium) raised the issue of the industrial revolution and a possible new revolution in production; do you believe that new green technologies can realistically replace existing ones?
Undoubtedly. I was in Germany yesterday and I met Chancellor Angela Merkel. In the case of Germany the government is following proactive policies. They have now installed 5,5 gigawatts of solar capacity. In India we are moving ahead with very ambitious plans to harvest solar energy. There are also enormous opportunities for improving energy efficiency for example in the transport sector in housing and in industry.
If you take all these measures and combine them it is entirely realistic to believe that we can substantially reduce the emissions without any loss of economic output or employment opportunities. That's a matter of fact – some of these measures actually enhance employment opportunities. What we need is political will but as my good friend Al Gore says, "political will is a renewable resource".
Paul Van Rompaye (Belgium) would like to ask whether the goal of cutting CO2 is also an opportunity to redirect the economy away from what he calls "the American consumption model"?
The world has been through several radical and tectonic changes if I may say so. We started as hunter-gatherers and then we saw the development of agriculture.
So I don't see why we should be afraid of major changes taking place now which will ensure that we grow, we develop, we consume in a manner that is consistent with protecting the environment. We have now to bring the environment and climate change centre-stage.
Andres Galindo (Spain) is afraid of a shortage of drinking water in the future; is he right to be?
I would say, he should not be afraid, but he should certainly be aware of the fact that in some parts of the world water stress is going to grow dramatically. We have to create a movement where governments, businesses, civil society and people start looking at water and that there is no such thing as a resource without value ( in the sense that it should not be taken for granted).
Ercan Acar (Turkey) would like to know if renewables can really replace fossil fuels?
I have no doubt that renewables can replace fossil fuels and possibly nuclear power. I think there are several parts of the world, including Europe, that using their imagination and innovation, should be able to use renewables on a large scale.
One thing that you have missed out looking at seriously is the possibility of using North Africa as a location for large scale solar power generation and transport by undersea cables to Europe. Wind is another example. And of course we can use renewables but we have to make sure that in the same time we improve the efficiency of energy use, because the two have to work together.
Backstory: "Less Meat = Less Heat"event on 3 December
The "Less Meat = Less Heat" debate brought together Rajendra Pachauri, Paul McCartney, MEPs and leading scientists to discuss the impact of meat production can have on global warming.
A recent report by the Parliament's Science and Technology Options Assessment (STOA) "Implications of Global Trends in Eating Habits for Climate Change, Health and Natural Resources" looked at the how large amounts of water and feedstock are used to produce meat and how the production of meat produces large amounts of greenhouse gases.

EU's fight against climate change in 10 points
As the UN climate conference starts in Copenhagen today (7 December), the world leaders have 12 days to reach the post-Kyoto agreement. We suggest you to take a look at the 10 major issues of how EU's is combating climate change.
Emission reduction: Within the emissions trading system (ETS), the EU will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20% by 2020 from 1990 levels, or by 30% in event of an international agreement. The EP has called for 40% reduction of emissions by 2020 by developed countries and at least 80% reduction of emissions by 2050.
Shared efforts : binding national targets for each EU Member State to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from non-ETS sources (e.g. road and sea transport, buildings, services, agriculture and smaller industrial installations), between 2013 and 2020. These sources currently account for about 60% of all EU greenhouse gas emissions.
Capturing CO2: A legal framework for new carbon dioxide capture and storage technology (CCS) allowing storage of CO2 permanently and safely underground in geological formations. Industrial installations and power plants account for around 40% of all CO2 emissions in the EU.
Greener cars: new emission performance standards for new passenger cars registered in the EU. The regulation sets an average target of 130g CO2/km plus additional measures to achieve a further 10g/km reduction. Passenger cars currently account for 12% of overall EU emissions of CO2.
More renewables: by 2020 renewable energy - hydro power, solar, wind, biomass or geothermal sources - should make up at least 20% of the EU's total energy consumption. In 2005 renewable energies accounted for less than 7% of the EU's total energy consumption. The directive lays down mandatory national targets through promoting the use of renewable energy in the electricity, heating, cooling and the transport sector.
Less CO2 from fuels: suppliers should reduce greenhouse gas emissions caused by extraction or cultivation, transport and distribution, processing and combustion of fuels, by up to 10% by 2020. The cuts in greenhouse gas emissions could be achieved, for example, by using more biofuels, alternative fuels or by reducing "gas flaring and venting" at production sites.
Energy efficient tyres : new tyre-labelling system will allow drivers to choose fuel efficient tyres. A quarter of all CO2 emissions in the European Union coming from road transport. This legislation should help reduce the emissions as from November 2012.
Energy efficient buildings : All buildings built from the end of 2020 onwards must have high energy-saving standards and be powered to a large extent by renewable energy. When doing major renovations, owners will be encouraged to install "smart meters" and replace heating, hot-water plumbing and air-conditioning systems with high-efficiency alternatives such as heat pumps.
Energy efficient products: new layout of the energy efficiency label for household appliances and other energy-saving products allowing for additional classes (with "A+++" for the most energy-efficient products), but limits the total number of energy classes to seven. In future any advertisement promoting price or energy efficiency of fridges, washing machines or ovens will have to indicate the product's energy class.
EP getting greener : eco-Management and Audit scheme (EMAS) has been put in place to cut its carbon footprint by 30% by 2020. Since 2008 the EP has only been using "green electricity" in its places of work.

Copenhagen: the city of high environmental standards sets high climate protection hopes
A woman walks between displays, entitled "Cool Globes," an exhibition about combating global warming and climate change in the Kongens Nytorv area in the centre of Copenhagen on 7 December 2009. ©Belga/A Dennis As the delegates from 192 countries try to shape a new global climate protection deal in the city of the Little Mermaid, let's look at the Copenhagen climate summit in facts and figures and take a glance at what hides behind COP15, IPCC, ETS, CCS and other climate jargon.
Around 110 heads of state and government will take the negotiations relay from diplomats next week. For its part, Parliament will send a 15-strong official delegation, which will be joined by Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek.
12 days in Copenhagen
COP15 is the 15th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate taking place from 7 to 18 December. The conference will attract around 15,000 participants.
Climate neutrality (Carbon footprint and offsetting) - COP15 will be climate neutral: The organisers are minimising greenhouse gas emissions and offsetting unavoidable ones through an energy efficiency project to reduce CO2 emissions and improve air quality in Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital and one of the world’s most polluted cities. The climate impact of the flights by the official European Parliament delegation will also be offset.
The Danish organisers are trying to present a good example to the world. They already have or will implement a number of steps to make the country more energy efficient:
There will be no goody bags, the money will be used for scholarships
Limousines for VIPs will use bio-ethanol from plant waste/straw
Delegates will get free rental bikes and public transport passes
There's no bottled water, tap water will be served in biodegradable cups
Organisers guarantee a minimum of 65% organic food and drink
Teleconferencing allows participation from afar
LED spots will be used, saving 80-90% energy
Copenhagen is serviced by electric busses
It has 350 kilometers of cycle tracks and 33% bike to school or work
1/5 of Danish electricity is from wind power

One day to go at Copenhagen COP15: can the world deliver?
Jo Leinen, head of the EP delegation: "By summer 2010 there must be deal for a new legally binding agreement." "The atmosphere is cold not only outside in Copenhagen, but also inside the Bella Centre," said the head of EP delegation Jo Leinen arriving in Copenhagen on Monday. Four days later, on the eve of the end of the conference it is still unclear where the complex negotiations will lead. Some 120 world leaders will make a final decision tomorrow.
"Chaotic" is how the participants describe the atmosphere inside Bella Centre where 15,000 participants and over 1,400 journalists have gathered. That's if they were able to enter - the queues outside the centre in freezing temperatures are 5-6 hours.
Indians, Africans, NGOs and ministers from all over the world rush from one meeting to another with messages on how to save the world from the disastrous consequences of climate changes. A huge balloon illustrates the volume of 1 tonne of CO2.
US, China tough negotiators
After days of negotiations, the high-level phase of the talks began with the environment ministers and negotiators from 193 countries on Tuesday. The 120 heads of state and governments, including US President Barack Obama, arrive today and tomorrow.
Karl-Heinz Florenz, the vice-chair of the EP delegation to COP15, describes the US and China as tough negotiators. "Another problem is that the G77 (developing countries) are not speaking with one voice."
Waiting for the breakthrough
The 15-strong EP delegation has been following the negotiations closely since Monday and hopes for a breakthrough. They have met with the EU presidency and MEPs from India, China, Brazil and Japan.
Negotiations at stalemate
Mr Florenz said in an EP Facebook chat yesterday: "We are at a critical point in the negotiations...we have to stop this game if you go forward, then we follow. Everyone has to go forward."
Jo Leinen, the chair of EP delegation said today: "The post-Copenhagen process will be as important as Copenhagen. By summer 2010 there must be deal for a new legally binding agreement."
EU must stand firm
He said the EU must stand firm on its climate change objectives. "Weakening the 30% target would put Europe's leadership in the climate negotiations into question ...and would encourage other states to move their climate protection targets."
Thursday EP President Jerzy Buzek goes to Copenhagen and the EP will provide an overview of existing and planned '"cap and trade" systems, including the EU emission trading system (ETS) and the planned "cap and trade" scheme in the US.

A (Copenhagen) Climate of disappointment: 20 January debate
A snow-covered "Cool Globe" in Copenhagen, 19 December 19, 2009 © Belga/Afp/A.Dennis A gloomy inquest rather than angry recriminations marked the mood when the European Parliament debated the Copenhagen climate conference Wednesday (20 January). There were a few rays of optimism with Jo Leinen MEP, the head of the EP delegation to Copenhagen saying the EU needed to find "strategic partners" in the run up to the next climate conference in November. Others welcomed progress on financing as developed countries committed $30 billion to help developing states adapt.
The word "disappointing" cropped up repeatedly during the afternoon's debate although many said the EU should continue to move forward and not become dependent on the commitments of others. Dutch EPP Member Corien Wortmann-Kool, who attended the conference, said that the EU's "30% must still stand". She went on to appeal for people not to lose hope: "We have to review our strategy but we still have to cling to our ambition."
French ALDE Member Corinne Lepage said, Europe had "to maintain our position as world leaders". She called for "a robust and ambitious strategy to move the economy in a more energy efficient direction."
At the conference there was movement on climate as all developed countries (including the US) agreed to work within the same international framework. The Copenhagen Accord, which is not legally binding, also includes a " method for verifying " developing nations' emission reductions. In addition developed countries committed themselves to pay $30 billion between 2010 and 2012 in climate support to developing countries.
However, the conference failed to come up with any legally binding targets.
Speaking in the plenary Finnish Green Satu Hassi ( Greens/EFA ) said for the first time in a UN document there is a reference to 2 degree limit. However, she also said "it is quite clear that there are some who wanted to sabotage the agreement" and called for a reform to the UN decision making system.
The EP is voting on the resolution of the results on COP15 in February's plenary. The next UN summit on climate change takes place in Mexico 29 November - 10 December 2010. The end of 2012 is the deadline for the ratification of a new global climate deal.
