MEPs focused on top EU jobs in a plenary debate with Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt and Commission President José Manuel Barroso on the outcome of the October European Council. MEPs voiced concerns about the tight timetable for appointing candidates, their qualifications, and gender issues.
Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt announced that the Swedish presidency will hold an extraordinary summit on 19 November to fill the positions created by the Lisbon Treaty. There they will "nominate the President of the European Council, the High Representative and the Secretary General of the Council."
Commission President José Manuel Barroso said "I want a new Commission composed of competent and committed Europeans. I also want a Commission with a strong democratic mandate."
Joseph Daul (EPP, FR) told Mr Barroso that "once the Member States have designated their candidates [for Commissioners posts] you should move as quickly as possible to establish their portfolios, so that they can be heard by the EP in hearings which we want to be as in-depth as possible."
Hannes Swoboda (S&D, AT) asked "are you ready to talk to the Heads of State to ensure that we have a gender and a geographical balance [in the Commission] and are you prepared to ensure that there are powerful ladies involved?"
Guy Verhofstadt (ALDE, BE) underlined that the position of the President of Council should be filled by "somebody who believes in EU integration, is not a eurosceptic, and believes in the community method which takes Europe forward."
Rebecca Harms (Greens/EFA, DE) observed "Mr Reinfeldt, unfortunately I'm not able to congratulate you because there is as yet no sign of any strong men or women coming forward."
Timothy Kirkhope (ECR, UK) affirmed that "some [government leaders] are even trying to divide the European Union into two classes of citizens, by saying that only individuals coming from Member States in the Schengen area and the Eurozone should be eligible."
Lothar Bisky (GUE/NGL, DE) suggested "it would be a good idea if the Heads of State and Governments were to use the summit for more practical and concrete politics."
William Dartmouth (EFD, UK) commented on the new post of the High Representative: "the problem facing Europe is not too few diplomatic missions but too many unemployed."
