Parliament adopted a non-binding report by the Chairman of the Industry, Research and Energy Committee - Giles CHICHESTER (EPP-ED, UK) on the management of the European Satellite radio-navigation programme. The report was adopted with 555 votes in favour, 27 against and 27 abstentions.
The purpose of the proposal is to amend Council Regulation 1321/2004/EC to enable the European GNSS Supervisory Authority (responsible for the European Satellite Navigation programmes - Galileo and EGNOS) to complete the development phase of the Galileo programme after the Galileo Joint Undertaking is wound up. the Galileo Joint Undertaking should be wound up on 31 December 2006 and its activities transferred to the Supervisory Authority. To this end, it is necessary to amend Council Regulation 1321/2004/EC on the establishment of structures for the management of the European satellite radio navigation programmes.
