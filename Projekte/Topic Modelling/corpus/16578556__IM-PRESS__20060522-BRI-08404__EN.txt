Debate on the future of Europe with Guy Verhofstadt
2006-05-29 - 18:05
MEPs will debate the future of Europe with Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt. This is the first in a series of debate with leaders of EU countries. The debate will commence at 3pm on Wednesday and last two and a half hours.
On 8 September 2005, Parliament's Conference of Presidents decided " debates in Parliament should be opened up to Heads of State and Governmen t so that they could present their visions of the future of Europe, in the same way as Mr Juncker and Mr Blair had addressed Parliament, their respective points of view on the matter having fuelled debate ".
On 16 March 2006, the Conference of Presidents " recalled that the initiative to invite Heads of State and Government to open debates in Parliament had been agreed by the Conference of Presidents at its meetings on 7 and 8 September 2005 in the framework of the ‘debate on the future of Europe’ and agreed that a fair balance should be insured between invitees from old and new Member States " .
On 8 and 9 May, the European Parliament and national parliaments held a two-day meeting on the future of Europe co-chaired by EP President Borrell and Austrian Federal Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel.
At the recent informal summit in Klosterneuburg, Austria’s Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik, current President of the Council of the EU said: “The period of silence on the Constitutional Treaty has ended. Talks have got moving again. The state of shock prevailing in 2005 has given way to the resumption of a meaningful discussion. It was by no means always certain this would be the case”.
She described the result of the talks as the “emergence of the first building blocks of a new consensus in the debate on the future of the EU”. The view that the plan for a constitution should be pursued as a European project had not been in dispute. “Nobody pronounced the constitution dead”, she said. The foreign ministers also demonstrated the common will to set milestones for the Constitutional Treaty. “Nobody demanded an open-ended extension of the period of reflection. By 2009 at the latest, we must have clarity regarding our new legal basis”, Plassnik declared, adding that the incoming presidencies would continue work on this matter.

Situation of prisoners in Guantanamo
2006-05-29 - 18:05
The Council and Commission will make statements on the situation of prisoners in Guantanamo.
In October 2004, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on Guantanamo. In this resolution, MEPs reaffirmed that, in the face of the threat of terrorism, one of the prime duties of democracies is to protect their citizens with resolve, to fight terrorism firmly and tenaciously and to detect and dismantle any terrorist networks.
MEPs strongly reaffirmed that this fight cannot be waged in breach of international law and at the expense of established basic, shared values such as respect for human rights, the rule of law and the relevant Geneva Conventions.
MEPs noted with satisfaction that some detainees have been granted increasing entitlement to private conversations with independent lawyers; insists, however, that every detainee should be treated in accordance with international humanitarian law and tried without delay in a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal, in application and demonstration of the very values we stand for.
In the report by Elmar Brok (EPP-ED, DE) on transatlantic relations, MEPs in the Foreign Affairs Committee stress the need to put an end to the current legal limbo in which the detainees held in Camp Delta, Guantánamo Bay Naval Base have been placed since their arrival there, to guarantee them immediate access to justice and to ensure that those charged with war crimes receive a fair trial in accordance with international humanitarian law and in full compliance with international human rights instruments. The committee stresses that this issue should be on the agenda at the next EU-US Summit; reiterates its call for the immediate closure of the Guantánamo detention centre.

For a transatlantic partnership agreement
2006-05-29 - 18:05
The Committee on Foreign Affairs is calling for a Transatlantic Partnership Agreement to strengthen the EU-US relationship. While reiterating the common commitment to combat terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), the report also points out several irritants that have led to recent disagreements between the two sides.
The own initiative report by is drawn up Chair of the Foreign Affair Committee Elmar BROK (EPP-ED, ED). It "underlines the importance of NATO's role…[as] a crucial guarantor of transatlantic stability and security." It also calls for close cooperation on the Iran nuclear issue, China, India, Japan, Latin America and Russia, and "encourages the partners to reinforce their common efforts to promote peace, prosperity and progress in the Middle East."
Nevertheless, the report does not shy away from criticisms of US policy. The committee "urges the US to extend the Visa Waiver Program to cover all EU citizens." It also "strongly regrets […] the combination of mistrust due to suspected violation of human rights and international law involved in the so-called extraordinary renditions in Europe," and "reiterates its call for the immediate closure of the Guantánamo detention centre."
On the institutional front, the committee proposes the adoption of a Transatlantic Partnership Agreement by 2007, "reiterates the need to strengthen the parliamentary dimension of the Transatlantic Partnership by transforming the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue (TLD) into a transatlantic assembly," and suggests that the EP should establish a permanent post in Washington DC to maintain permanent contact between the two bodies.

A barrier-free transatlantic market by 2015
2006-05-29 - 18:05
Transatlantic trade and investment ties have never been stronger: with 57% of world GDP between them, the EU and the USA are the engine-room of the world economy. On top of their economic links, they are united by shared values and standards. The EP Trade Committee is calling for a barrier-free transatlantic market by 2015 and regular dialogue between the EP and the US Congress.
Ten years after the signing of the New Transatlantic Agenda (1995), an own-initiative report by Erika MANN (PES, DE) calls for EU-US relations to move in the direction of a new transatlantic partnership. The economic dimension of this partnership would be based on three key pillars: cooperation on regulatory issues, a set of operational cooperation tools (an early warning system, a bilateral mechanism for settling trade disputes and a third-generation agreement on the application of competition law) and sectoral economic cooperation agreements building on the Joint EU-US Work Programme.
The partnership agreement should provide for the removal of non-tariff barriers in key markets by 2015, through gradual regulatory alignment and mutual recognition of rules and standards. For financial services and capital markets, the target date for a barrier-free market would be 2010.
Although WTO disputes concern less than 2% of all trade, the report urges the European Commission to set up a mechanism for settling trade disputes in advance with the aim of exhausting all diplomatic channels before resorting to the WTO dispute settlement body. The early warning system should enable potential trade disputes to be identified at an early stage.
The European Parliament's role
MEPs in the committee want to strengthen the parliamentary dimension of EU-US summits by involving legislators from both sides. For this purpose, they call for "a meeting prior to every summit between the TLD [Transatlantic Legislative Dialogue] and the Senior-Level Group to exchange views on the progress of the Work Programme".

Trade and poverty
2006-05-29 - 18:05
Helmuth MARKOV (GUE/NGL, DE), for the Committee on International Trade, will be putting forward an own-initiative report on trade and poverty: how to design trade policies to maximise trade's contribution to poverty relief.
The report cautions that the global costs of the failure of poverty eradication are enormous in terms of human suffering, instability, conflict, recurrent emergencies, international crime, the drugs trade, economic stagnation, clandestine migration and premature death. It stresses that trade agreements must comply with the existing international agreements on human rights and women’s rights, ecological sustainability and the right to development and the eradication of poverty, and stresses that the fight to combat poverty is closely linked with the protection of human rights and the establishment of democratic institutions and democratic governance.
MEPs in the committee state that trade, if accompanied by good-quality domestic policies, can lead to the eradication of poverty and to the delivery of development. It states that the enforcement of trade rules and the right to development is the only way to contribute to the eradication of the root causes of poverty and that fair trade can be one of the effective tools for poverty reduction, addressing the structural causes of poverty through fair trade rules.
The committee recalls the EU commitment, under the Cotonou Partnership Agreement, to promote sustainable development and poverty eradication in the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP) and urges the Commission to work towards more transparency in international trade negotiations. The report stresses the necessity to secure access to essential services such as drinking water, health, energy, transport and education through public investment programmes in line with the MDGs.
The report emphasises the necessity to take into account citizens of poor countries' right to development and that poor countries must decide and lead their own development strategies and economic policies. Furthermore, it states that poverty is largely a female phenomenon and stresses the need to review the gender impact of trade policies in order to design policies which stop and reverse marginalising effects, for example land ownership concentration in male hands and concentration of badly paid low-skill female jobs in export processing zones, by introducing incentives and positive discrimination measures addressed to governments and companies with European ownership.

Medicines for children: second-reading deal in the offing?
2006-05-29 - 18:05
Children should soon be able to take medicines designed for their metabolism rather than small doses of drugs intended for adults. This is the upshot of a report on medicinal products for paediatric use which took place at the Environment Committee and could pave the way for a second-reading agreement with the Council.
"The encouraging results of the common position will perhaps enable us to avoid conciliation and reach an agreement with the Council at second reading", said Françoise GROSSETÊTE (EPP-ED, FR) whose report was approved by 39 votes to 2 with 2 abstentions.
In their proposed amendments to the Member States' common position, MEPs in the committee are keen to strengthen the independence of the members of the Paediatric Committee, a scientific committee which will operate within the European Medicines Agency. MEPs in the committee believe that members of this committee should not "have financial or other interests in the pharmaceutical industry which could affect their impartiality, should undertake to act in the public interest and in an independent manner, and should make an annual declaration of their financial interests".
Where the development of medicines for children could hamper the development of medicines for adults, MEPs in the committee wish to allow "justified derogations" from the requirement, proposed by the Commission, for firms to present the results of paediatric studies at the same time as human pharmaco-kinetic studies in adults.
Regarding the need to encourage the pharmaceutical industry to invest in new medicines, MEPs in the committee recommend approving a transitional clause which states that, for five years after the regulation enters into force, "the application for an extension of the duration of a certificate already granted shall be lodged not later than six months before the expiry" of a Supplementary Protection Certificate.
To avoid being dependent on decisions by national authorities concerning the setting of prices for medicines or their inclusion in national health insurance schemes, products for which paediatric data is supposed to be submitted but which have received marketing authorisation in all Member States will be granted a 6-month extension of the Supplementary Protection Certificate.

Improving EU legislation to prevent sex offences against children
2006-05-29 - 18:05
The Committee on Civil Liberties is putting forward a report endorsing a proposal to improve existing legislation protecting children from sex offenders in Europe. The aim is to ensure that any court prohibition on working with children, arising from sex offences against minors or from child pornography, will be enforceable not only by the Member State which issues it, but also by any other EU country to which the person concerned moves.
Combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography became a priority for the EU in 2003 when legislation was adopted establishing a minimum common approach to these criminal offences, covering the type of penalty and the prohibitions imposed. One of the provisions was to impose a temporary or permanent ban on child sex offenders taking a job involving supervision of children. As a result of an initiative from Belgium, the Council is now considering an EU decision to ensure that a prohibition on working with children imposed by the national judicial authorities of one Member State will be enforced by any Member State where the individual might reside. This rule should help to avoid cases such as that of a paedophile convicted in France who later committed a similar crime in Belgium.
An important aspect of the new EU law will be to oblige national authorities to include information on penalties for sex offences against children in criminal records which can be consulted by any other Member State on request. In its report, drawn up by Bogusław SONIK (EPP-ED, PL), the Committee generally supports the proposal, although it recommends amendments to improve the wording and tighten up some definitions in the legislative text. One of the key changes approved by MEPs in the committee would oblige Member States to include also in their criminal records any related prohibition imposed by non-EU countries.

Protecting workers against the risk of infection from contaminated needles
2006-05-29 - 18:05
Every year around a million workers in Europe, mainly in the medical world, suffer injuries from used surgical needles. The consequences can be serious, including infections from HIV or hepatitis B or C. The EP Social Affairs Committee wants to improve existing EU legislation so as to give workers better protection.
MEPs in the committee believe that many of these "needlestick injuries" which occur in the medical world could be prevented if appropriate measures were made compulsory in medical and veterinary services. In a report by Stephen HUGHES (PES, UK), adopted by a large majority by the Social Affairs Committee, MEPs in the committee say studies have shown that the use of safer needles together with regular training and organisational measures can help reduce the number of injuries. They add that safer working practices and medical devices designed to prevent accidental needlestick injuries would also produce financial savings.
The committee says the existing directives, which should in theory cover these risks, have not had the desired effect. It therefore calls on the Commission to add various new provisions to one of the directives intended to improve accident prevention and the protection of workers (Directive 2000/54/EC on the protection of workers from risks related to exposure to biological agents at work). MEPs in the committee want the Commission to put forward a proposal to amend this directive within three months.
These proposals were made under a little-used procedure which enables the European Parliament to request the Commission to draft new legislative proposals (Rule 39 of Parliament's Rules of Procedure - see link below). The draft resolution by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs must still be approved by a majority of MEPs in plenary (at least 367 out of 732). Since the committee adopted the draft resolution with only two votes against, it has every chance of being adopted in plenary.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women at work
2006-05-29 - 18:05
Angelika NIEBLER (EPP-ED, DE), for the Women's Rights and Gender Equality Committee, is recommending that Parliament approve the report on equal opportunities and equal treatment of both men and women in matters of employment and occupation without amendment.
The aim of the directive is to simplify, modernise and improve EU legislation in the field of equal treatment for men and women in employment and occupation in order to give greater clarity and legal certainty.
It should be noted that the common position was agreed on the basis of informal tripartite negotiations, following a series of meetings between the Presidency in office (Luxembourg and UK), the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs and the relevant representatives of the Commission.
As regards several recitals newly introduced by the European Parliament and accepted by the Commission in its amended proposal relating to the need for Member States to address gender-based wage differentials and labour market segregation, to develop and analyse statistics disaggregated by sex and to promote the raising of awareness of wage discrimination, the Council incorporated the notion of the necessity to continue these efforts in order to avoid creating the impression that these activities are not already ongoing.
In its amended proposal, the Commission rejected the insertion of a new paragraph (2)(d) in Article 20, adding the exchange of data and know-how with corresponding European bodies such as the European Institute for Gender Equality to the tasks of the equality bodies to be established under that provision. This position was taken for technical reasons related to proper legislative drafting as no reference should be made to an institution that does not yet exist. These concerns were accommodated in the new text by making mention of corresponding European bodies such as any future European Institute for Gender Equality. This wording can be accepted.
With regard to the Article on social dialogue, the Council accepted the European Parliament's amendment broadening the reference to the term “workplace” as reformulated by the Commission but refused to include new wording on research by the social partners being carried out on the basis of the development and analysis of gender-specific data.
In relation to the provision on social dialogue, information provided by the employer on equal treatment in the undertaking is one of the means of the promotion of equal treatment in a planned and systematic way. The Council endorsed the Commission's suggestion to align the wording with the other paragraphs by stipulating that employers shall (instead of should) be encouraged to undertake such efforts. It did not accept the further proposal in the amended Commission proposal to use the term “should” in the second subparagraph implying a stronger exhortation to make available the specific information mentioned there and reverted to the wording “may” from the original proposal. It did, however, incorporate, subject to a clarifying reformulation, the proposal by the European Parliament, seconded by the Commission, to be more detailed on the issues on which to make information available. In its entirety, this compromise solution is acceptable to the Commission.
The Council agreed to move the obligation for Member States to submit a report containing an assessment of exceptions to the principle of equal treatment on the grounds that a characteristic related to sex constitutes a genuine and determining occupational requirement from Article 13 to Article 31, the general provision dealing with reporting obligations, as a new paragraph 3. It changed the frequency of such reporting from every four years, as suggested by the European Parliament and by the Commission in its amended proposal, to "periodically but at least every eight years". This can be accepted as it still represents some progress compared to the current requirement of periodical assessment without any fixed deadlines.
Concerning the set of interrelated deadlines for transposition of the Directive (Article 33), for the implementation reports by the Member States (Article 31) and for a review of the operation of the Directive by the Commission (Article 32), the Council took the middle ground between the different positions of the institutions. It accepted a short transposition period of two years as called for by the European Parliament and by the Commission in its amended proposal in principle, but included the possibility for Member States facing particular difficulties to extend the transposition period to three years. Uniform deadlines were established for the implementation reports and the review at four and a half years and six and a half years after entry into force of the Directive respectively.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Roma women in the EU
2006-05-29 - 18:05
Roma women are among the most threatened groups and individuals in Europe - particularly in the ten new Member States and in accession and candidate countries, according to the Women's Rights Committee. In a report, the committee calls for measures to combat the extreme levels of multiple discrimination faced by these women on the grounds of both ethnicity and gender.
The report, drafted by Lívia Járóka (EPP-ED, HU), urges EU public authorities to "promptly investigate extreme human rights abuses against Roma women, to swiftly punish perpetrators, and to provide adequate compensation to victims". The committee calls on Member States to give the highest priority to measures to provide better protection for women's reproductive and sexual health, to prevent and outlaw coercive sterilisation, and provide redress for such abuse, and to promote family planning, alternative arrangements to early marriages and sex education. It also calls for proactive measures to eliminate racially segregated maternity wards, to help victims of domestic violence and for particular vigilance regarding the trafficking of Roma women.
A number of other areas of concern are raised in the report. It urges Member States to ensure that all Roma women have access to health care, and not only, as often occurs, in the case of an extreme emergency or childbirth. Surveys show that the life expectancy of Roma women is, in some geographical areas, shorter than that of other women. Many Roma girls fail to complete primary education.
The rapporteur, Lívia Járóka says that since education "is one of the most important tools for escaping poverty, the dual discrimination faced by Roma women in the field of education means that they will have a particularly difficult time escaping poverty". The committee calls for measures at national level to ensure that women and girls have access on equal terms to quality education and for plans to end the separate, substandard education of Roma children. A further burning issue, calling for positive measures, is the very high unemployment rates among Roma women - in several places many times higher than that of the rest of the adult female population. MEPs in the committee also urge the Member States to improve Roma housing by recognising in national law a right to adequate housing.
The situation of Roma women in candidate countries should, according to the committee, be a key criterion for evaluation states of readiness for accession to the EU. MEPs in the committee recommend that the future EU Institute for Gender Equality should have a unit dealing with Roma women in the EU and encourage the gathering and publication of data set out by sex and ethnicity on the situation of the Roma people, so progress can be measured.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Women in conflict and post conflict
2006-05-29 - 18:05
Véronique De Keyser (PES, BE), on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, will be putting forward an own-initiative report on the situation of women in armed conflicts and their role in the reconstruction and democratic process in post-conflict countries
The report stresses the need to mainstream a gender perspective into peace research, conflict prevention and resolution, peacekeeping operations, post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction and to ensure a gender component in field programmes.
Victims
The report recalls the importance of access to reproductive health services in conflict situations and refugee camps and zero tolerance of the sexual exploitation of children, girls and women in armed conflicts and refugee camps including criminal penalties for any guilty party. It also seeks to ensure full respect for sexual and reproductive rights as this will help to minimise acts of sexual violence committed in conflict situations and the immediate necessity of stopping the use of child soldiers in conflicts, including small girls, who are subjected to full-blown sexual slavery. Furthermore, the committee state that women who are victims of ill-treatment and violence during conflicts should be able to lodge complaints with international courts under conditions compatible with their dignity. The report also recommends appropriations to be made available to tackle, by means of interdisciplinary programmes, the drastic increase in domestic violence in the post-conflict phase. Finally, it stressed the special needs of women and girls with respect to mine clearance and underlines the fact that, although 'anti-people mines' may have been used in military situations, it was mostly women, children and ordinary men who were killed or maimed by them, and whose capacity to earn their livelihoods was removed.
Peacemakers
The committee emphasizes the positive role that women can play in post-conflict reconstruction and in particular in disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) programmes and says that in post-conflict situations, women's peace movements and women's organisations should receive pedagogical, political, financial and legal support, so as to bring about a democratic society respectful of women's rights. MEPs in the committee asks the Council not to overlook the need to integrate human rights and gender-equality advisers within the civil peace-keeping forces run by the European Union and recommend that ESDP mission planning should take into account the inclusion of local women's organisations in the peace process. The report also stresses the importance of equal participation by women in diplomatic action and calls on Member States to recruit more women to their diplomatic services.
War
The report condemns the glorification of martyrdom which is now being targeted at young people, including young women in certain societies. It draws attention to the problem of female suicide bombers and stresses that rape used as a weapon of war affects all women, irrespective of ethnic, religious and ideological differences. In addition it notes that women who have been raped are socially stigmatised, excluded and even killed as they have lost their 'right to life and value'. The committee welcomes the denunciation of these actions by some Islamic authorities in the name of the Koran itself, which promotes respect for life.
The committee recommends Parliament to investigate the problem of suicide attacks by women, and launch a study of the issue culminating in a conference bringing together not only specialists but also other people with a knowledge of gender issues from the countries concerned and Islamic religious leaders.
MEPs in the committee propose a drawing-up of a practical action programme and insist that it is essential that the Commission retain the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights as a specific instrument within the 2007-2013 financial perspective.

Culture
European Year of Intercultural Dialogue should focus on religion
2006-05-29 - 18:05
Against the backcloth of globalisation and fears about a clash of civilisations, the Culture Committee has welcomed the European Commission's proposal that 2008 should be declared "European Year of Intercultural Dialogue". MEPs are pressing for dialogue between religions to be the main topic of the year's events.
The Culture Committee's call for dialogue between religions to be explicitly included in the broad aims of Intercultural Dialogue Year follows a proposal to this effect by rapporteur Erna HENNICOT-SCHOEPGES (EPP-ED, LU). MEPs in the committee are keen to bring intercultural dialogue into the mainstream of Community policies. They back the Commission's idea of raising the profile of all EU measures related to intercultural dialogue and making them more consistent. They say the campaign should also highlight the contribution of different cultures to Europe's heritage and lifestyles as well as helping promote intercultural dialogue in schools.
Intercultural dialogue already occupies an important place in many Community policies (e.g. education, youth, anti-racism, asylum policy) as well as in the EU's external relations. Key aims are the promotion of cultural diversity and active citizenship. The Commission's proposal for 2008 to be European Year of Intercultural Dialogue should be seen against this background.
Prize and intercultural forum
Another suggestion by MEPs in the committee is for a prize for intercultural dialogue to be awarded to a youth project carried out as part of Community programmes such as Socrates, Youth and Culture.
Lastly, the Culture Committee would like European Year of Intercultural Dialogue to conclude with an intercultural forum at the European Parliament bringing together representatives of civil society and the political and religious world.

Economic and monetary union
Euro area candidates must fully adhere to Maastricht criteria
2006-05-29 - 18:05
The Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee says accession to the euro zone requires full adherence to the Maastricht criteria on economic convergence, in a report which will now be debated by the full Parliament. MEPs in the committee did not specifically pronounce on any specific country's situation - rather they addressed issues applying to all and any future euro zone enlargements.
Drawn up by Werner LANGEN (EPP-ED, DE), the report warns that premature accession to the euro zone might lead to unexpected developments in the economic convergence process, such as undervalued or overvalued exchange rates, difficulties in achieving balanced payment accounts and therefore render economic adjustment more difficult. MEPs in the committee say that the long term stability of the Euro zone should also be assessed in terms of its capacity to absorb new entrants. This implies that the enlargement of the euro zone must not undermine the strengthening of economic governance within the zone, which is required in any case.
In the light of earlier problems, MEPs stress that the judgments on whether a particular country meets the inflation and interest rate criteria should be based on data provided by the European Central Bank.
On the other hand, the committee says that the inflation criterion, which is based on the inflation rates of the three best performing Member States, needs to be clarified, since it was defined before the creation of the euro zone, with its single currency and unified monetary policy. The report says it is important to take into account the so-called Balassa-Samuelson effect (the view that fast-growing economies catching up with larger economies will inevitably have higher inflation rates during this transition) when considering the inflation criterion for emerging Member States.
MEPs in the committee ask Member States joining the euro to pay particular attention to consumer protection during the changeover phase, with mandatory dual pricing for a sufficiently long period of time and publicity campaigns encouraging citizens to shop around to avoid unjustified price increases.
The report was adopted in committee the day before the Commission announced its view that Slovenia was ready to join the euro in January 2007, but that Lithuania had not met the criteria. The circumstances of these two countries are sure to be discussed by MEPs during the debate. Rapporteur Werner LANGEN EPP-ED DE A6-0191/2006 Eurozone enlargement Procedure :

Energy
Maximising the potential of energy efficiency
2006-05-29 - 18:05
The Industry and Energy Committee says energy efficiency is the greatest, fastest and cheapest reaction to energy security worries, rising and volatile energy prices and environmental concerns. MEPs in the committee are calling for existing legislation in the field to be implemented and for the Commission to develop new measures in its forthcoming Energy Efficiency Action Plan.
In a report drawn up by Alejo VIDAL-QUADRAS ROCA (EPP-ED, ES), the committee highlights research claiming that the EU could save at least 20 per cent of its present energy consumption in a cost-effective manner. To harness this possibility, action is needed at Community, national, regional, local and international levels, by industry and by consumers. MEPs in the committee say that energy efficiency should be integrated into EU transport, agricultural and foreign policies. Their proposals include: the creation of an Energy Efficiency Fund to support energy efficiency products; new fiscal measures; the extension of energy efficiency labelling and other consumer information schemes; a European buildings initiative to coordinate upgrading energy standards for new buildings; the encouragement of investment in energy efficiency measures; the replacement of old household appliances. Both Member States and EU institutions should set an example, with energy efficiency measures in the public sector - including a rethink of the multiple locations of Parliament itself.
The report also stresses the many energy efficiency measures already in force, including directives on buildings, combined heat and power, eco-design, emissions trading and on energy end-use efficiency. If this EU-legislation was fully implemented by the Member States, the EU would already be half way to meeting its target of saving 20 per cent of energy-use by 2020. MEPs are therefore calling for the Commission to speed up the infringement procedures for Member States not yet complying.
MEPs in the committee say consumers must be clearly and adequately informed, and are calling for an EU-wide information and awareness raising campaign on best practice on energy efficiency.

Competitiveness and Innovation Programme: agreement in first reading expected
2006-05-29 - 18:05
Enhancing competitiveness and innovation to increase Europe's productivity, innovation capacity and sustainable growth – that is the main aim of the CIP, a framework programme suggested by the Commission for 2007 to 2013.
Based on an agreement between Parliament's rapporteur Jorgo Chatzimarkakis (ALDE, DE) and the Council, the Industry, Research and Energy Committee adopted a package of 145 compromise agreements which will allow the program to be adopted in first reading and enter into force, as planned, on 1 January 2007..
Following the agreement, the budget for the Competitiveness and Innovation Frameprogramme (CIP) running from 2007 to 2013, will be €3 196 million. This is a reduction vis-à-vis the Commission's original proposal (€4 212,6 Million) but far more than the European Council common position of 16 December 2005 which included a reduction of more than 50 %.
The CIP programme brings together several existing EU programmes and new actions which share the overarching objectives of enhancing competitiveness and innovation. (Measures in the fields of entrepreneurship, SMEs, industrial competitiveness, innovation, information and communication technology (ICT), environmental technologies and intelligent energy). While in current arrangements multiple funding schemes and instruments coexist, the CIP shall simplify the support of an innovative entrepreneurship. It will complement the research-oriented activities promoted by the Community Framework Programme on Research and Technological Development and Demonstration. Its aim is to increase Europe's productivity, innovation capacity and sustainable growth. whilst simultaneously addressing complementary environmental concerns.
Three current programmes will be integrated in the CIP, namely the "Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme" (MAP), the "ICT policy support Programme" and the "Intelligent Energy-Europe Programme". Two more activities complete the CIP: A risk capital instrument to facilitate capital to innovative and high-growth SMEs and a scheme to support cooperation between national and regional programmes for business innovation (BISS).
MEPs in the committee underline that particular attention should be paid to the needs of SMEs. To facilitate their participation in the programme, the compromise states that the Commission will publish a user-friendly User Manual establishing a clear, simple and transparent framework of general principles for the participation of beneficiaries in the Framework Programme.
It is important for MEPs in the committee that the CIP contributes to closing the gap between research and innovation and promotes all forms of innovation.
The compromise also gives eco-innovation more importance and clarifies certain actions. Also the monitoring and evaluation aspects of implementation of the CIP are improved.

Budget
Parliament assesses its own operating budget
2006-05-29 - 18:05
MEPs are to debate the operating expenditure of the European Parliament as they consider the institution’s financial requirements for 2007. This is a routine part of the process for setting the overall EU budget for next year.
The plenary session will consider a report drawn up by Louis GRECH (PES, MT) for the Budgets Committee. Among other points, it notes that additional staff will be required when Romania and Bulgaria join the EU, but that these should be the only new posts created in 2007. The report also considers how to get best value from Parliament’s expenditure on buildings and information technology. It calls for ways to be found to minimise the costs of the EP having to operate on three sites, in Strasbourg, Brussels and Luxembourg.
