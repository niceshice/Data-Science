Our photographer was in and around the plenary chamber to capture images of the political week.
Last week in Strasbourg saw MEPs debate the financial crisis and its effect on people across Europe. They were joined by president Sarkozy as France currently holds the EU's Presidency. The week also saw MEPs back more rights for workers on temporary contracts, support a directive on fairer airport charges and block moves to introduce body scanners in Europe's airports.
The week also saw the award of the annual Sakharov human rights prize to Chinese dissident Hu Jia. MEPs from across the political spectrum voted to award the prize to Jia for his courage in speaking out against human rights abuses in China. During the week Members also passed the EU's 2009 budget at the first reading stage. Funding to combat global warming and dealing with security threats are two areas where money will be available. Another award last week was the LUX film prize which was awarded to a Belgian film "Le Silence de Lorna" for its portrayal of the interaction of people from different parts of Europe.
