The European Parliament has scheduled its hearings of the newly nominated Commissioners to begin on 11 January and end on 19 January. The final vote on the full Commission is planned for 26 January.
European Parliament President Jerzy Buzek said: "I am happy that President Barroso has acted swiftly in allocating the portfolios to the Commissioners-designate. The European Parliament is well prepared and ready to hold in-depth hearings to scrutinise their suitability for these important EU positions."
Parliament's Conference of Presidents (EP President Jerzy Buzek and the political group leaders) decided on Thursday that the hearings should last three hours each and take place on 11-15 January in Brussels and on 18 and 19 January in Strasbourg. To enable a final vote to be taken before the end of January, a special mini-session is scheduled for Tuesday 26 January. The vote will be preceded by a debate, with the vote set for midday.
The precise schedule of the hearings will be decided at a later stage.
