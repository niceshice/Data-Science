Twenty years after the fall of the Iron Curtain: Václav Havel at the EP
Václav Havel will take part in a formal sitting of Parliament to celebrate with MEPs the 20th anniversary of the democratic change in central and eastern Europe. Eighty-nine young people born in November 1989, the month in which the Berlin Wall fell, have also been invited to Brussels to mark the anniversary of a new Europe. On Wednesday 11 November, Václav Havel, former president of the Czech Republic, and Jerzy Buzek, former prime minister of Poland and today President of the European Parliament, who were both key actors in the political transformation of 20 years ago, will take part in a formal sitting of Parliament in Brussels.
Parliament debates EU summit conclusions on climate change, Lisbon Treaty
MEPs will evaluate the results of the EU summit of 29–30 October, which focused on the Copenhagen climate conference, the Czech request for an opt-out to the Lisbon Treaty and the economic situation. The summit also dealt with illegal immigration, the future European diplomatic service and an integrated strategy for the Baltic Sea region. The Swedish presidency and the Commission will take part in the debate.
Upcoming EU-Russia summit in Stockholm under the spotlight
Climate change and energy security are among the main topics to be discussed at the EU-Russia summit taking place in Stockholm on 18 November. MEPs will hold a debate and vote on a resolution on these and other issues on the summit agenda.
Research on Alzheimer's: pooling resources
Research into neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's needs to be better coordinated across Europe to maximise the benefits of funding and scientific knowledge, MEPs will argue in a debate on Wednesday.
European Ombudsman's work in 2008: transparency the main issue
Parliament will give its annual verdict on the work of the European Ombudsman over the previous year when it votes on a resolution on Thursday. The draft resolution calls for more visibility for the Ombudsman's work and points to the high number of complaints about a lack of transparency within the EU institutions.
Political situation in Honduras ahead of elections
The political situation in Honduras, following the ousting of President Zelaya and ahead of elections in late November, will be the focus of a debate on Wednesday. The Commission will brief MEPs about the latest developments in the country. Following international pressure aimed at ending the crisis, an agreement was reached on 30 October with the de facto government which could lead to the reinstatement of President Manuel Zelaya, although at the time of writing this agreement appears to be in jeopardy.
Focus the EU's crisis aid on people most in need, say MEPs
MEPs are concerned about the impact of the financial crisis on the most vulnerable population groups. In an oral question, they call for the EU to ensure that crisis aid provided to its own Member States is used to strengthen social safety nets in those countries.
Lisbon Treaty: EP's new budget powers should be respected from day one
Parliament's beefed-up powers over the EU budget should apply in full from the day the Lisbon Treaty enters into force, without waiting for detailed implementing legislation, say MEPs. They are calling for transitional rules to ensure Parliament can play its new budgetary role straight away. 20091103BRI63609 Final draft agenda - 11-12 November 2009 EuroparlTV - watch live broadcasts from plenary

Upcoming EU-Russia summit in Stockholm under the spotlight

Climate change and energy security are among the main topics to be discussed at the EU-Russia summit taking place in Stockholm on 18 November. MEPs will hold a debate and vote on a resolution on these and other issues on the summit agenda. The human rights situation in Russia (the EP recently awarded its Sakharov Prize to the Russian human rights organisation Memorial) and the continuing negotiations on a cooperation agreement to replace one that expired at the end of 2007, are among the other topics. International issues such as Iran's nuclear program and the Middle East Peace process are also expected to be discussed. Debate : 11.11.09

Research and innovation
Research on Alzheimer's: pooling resources
2009-11-09 - 16:02
Research into neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's needs to be better coordinated across Europe to maximise the benefits of funding and scientific knowledge, MEPs will argue in a debate on Wednesday. Around 7.3 million people suffer from Alzheimer's disease and related disorders in Europe, a figure that is expected to double by 2020. No cures are available at the moment and knowledge about prevention and treatment is limited. The European Commission wants EU governments to pool their resources by developing a joint strategic research agenda, including an implementation plan setting out priorities, timelines, actions, instruments and resources required.
MEPs are keen to put pressure on EU research ministers in the run-up to their meeting on this subject on 3 December. Future initiatives on joint research activities, they say, should be adopted under the EU's legal competence for research. Parliament will have co-decision powers in this area when the Lisbon Treaty enters into force. Debate : 11.11.09
Vote : 12.11.09 Oral question on joint programming of research to combat neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Alzheimer's Pooling Europe's resources to tackle Alzheimer's 29.09.09

Ombudsman
European Ombudsman's work in 2008: transparency the main issue
2009-11-09 - 16:02
Parliament will give its annual verdict on the work of the European Ombudsman over the previous year when it votes on a resolution on Thursday. The draft resolution calls for more visibility for the Ombudsman's work and points to the high number of complaints about a lack of transparency within the EU institutions. The role of the European Ombudsman, set up in 1995, is to investigate cases of alleged maladministration by the EU institutions. Of the 355 inquiries completed in 2008 by the Ombudsman, 36% dealt with a lack of transparency, including a refusal to provide information or documents. MEPs are concerned about this, since a transparent administration is crucial to building public trust in the EU.
The current holder of the office is Nikiforos Diamandouros, who was initially elected in January 2003 for the remainder of the 1999-2004 legislature following the retirement of the first Ombudsman, Jacob Söderman, and then re-elected in January 2005 for a further five years.
2008: facts and figures
The Ombudsman recorded 3406 complaints in 2008, compared to 3211 in 2007. Of these, 802 were found to fall within the Ombudsman's terms of reference, compared to 870 in 2007.
Most of the inquiries launched by the Ombudsman last year concerned the European Commission (66%). Other targets were the administration of the European Parliament (10%), the European Personnel Selection Office EPSO (7%), the Council (3%) and the European Anti-Fraud Office (2%).
The findings of the 355 completed inquiries show that in 110 cases (31% of the complaints investigated) no maladministration was found.
In 129 cases (36% of the total) completed in 2008, the institution concerned agreed to an amicable solution or settled the matter.
Election of the next Ombudsman
The Ombudsman is elected by the European Parliament by secret ballot at the start of each parliamentary term. The next Ombudsman will be elected in January 2010.
The three candidates for the election are the incumbent Mr Diamandouros (Greece), Vittorio Bottoli (Italy) and Pierre-Yves Monette (Belgium). All of them will outline their priorities at a hearing before the EP Petitions Committee on 30 November.
The European Ombudsman's office was set up in 1995. The European Network of Ombudsmen, established in 1996, consists of nearly 90 offices in 31 European countries. Within the European Union, it covers ombudsmen at European, national, and regional levels. At national level it also includes Norway, Iceland and the countries applying for EU membership.

Political situation in Honduras ahead of elections
2009-11-09 - 16:02
The political situation in Honduras, following the ousting of President Zelaya and ahead of elections in late November, will be the focus of a debate on Wednesday. The Commission will brief MEPs about the latest developments in the country. Following international pressure aimed at ending the crisis, an agreement was reached on 30 October with the de facto government which could lead to the reinstatement of President Manuel Zelaya, although at the time of writing this agreement appears to be in jeopardy.
Because of the situation, negotiations for an EU Association Agreement with Central America were suspended in July 2009 but are expected to resume once the political crisis will end.
Background
The country has been in the throes of a political crisis since President Manuel Zelaya was ousted in a military coup on 28 June and an interim government was set up, led by Roberto Micheletti, the former speaker of the Honduran Senate. Presidential elections are scheduled for 29 November.
In September EU budgetary support and development cooperation with the interim government were put on hold, allowing only support for civil society and humanitarian assistance.
On 7 November the Swedish Presidency of the European Union expressed concern over the interruption of the process towards implementation of the Tegucigalpa/San José Agreement and called on both sides to resume dialogue in order to restore the democratic and constitutional order. Debate : 11.11.09

Economic and monetary affairs
Focus the EU's crisis aid on people most in need, say MEPs
2009-11-09 - 16:02
MEPs are concerned about the impact of the financial crisis on the most vulnerable population groups. In an oral question, they call for the EU to ensure that crisis aid provided to its own Member States is used to strengthen social safety nets in those countries. Financial assistance to help Member States cope with the economic crisis has been granted to some states which are not part of the Eurozone (Hungary, Latvia, Romania).
The Greens/EFA, S&D and ALDE groups want to know whether the Commission has introduced any measures to ensure that this assistance supports socially balanced measures that take into account the EU Social Protection and Social Inclusion Process. Through this process the EU coordinates and encourages Member States' action to combat poverty and social exclusion. Debate : 11.11.09 Oral question on medium-term financial assistance for Member States' balances of payments and social conditionality

Budget
Lisbon Treaty: EP's new budget powers should be respected from day one
2009-11-09 - 16:02
Parliament's beefed-up powers over the EU budget should apply in full from the day the Lisbon Treaty enters into force, without waiting for detailed implementing legislation, say MEPs. They are calling for transitional rules to ensure Parliament can play its new budgetary role straightaway. When the Lisbon Treaty enters into force, possibly as soon as next month, Parliament will become jointly responsible for the EU budget together with the EU governments. Until now, Parliament has not had the final say on 'compulsory expenditure’, such as spending on agriculture or relating to international agreements.
However, Parliament's increased powers will have to be implemented by special rules spelling out the details of the rather general Lisbon Treaty guidelines. Parliament fears this process will be slow and that Council and Commission may try to continue with "business as usual" until all the new rules are in place. MEPs are therefore demanding that transitional rules reflecting the changed balance of power be agreed by Council and Parliament at a meeting on 19 November, a date set for talks on the 2010 budget. Debate & Vote: 12.11.2009 Draft resolution on transitional procedural guidelines on budgetary matters (Lisbon Treaty) Profile of rapporteur Alain Lamassoure (EPP, FR) Text adopted (7 May 09) on financial aspects of the Lisbon Treaty Text adopted (25 March 09) on Mid-term Review of the 2007-2013 Financial Framework
