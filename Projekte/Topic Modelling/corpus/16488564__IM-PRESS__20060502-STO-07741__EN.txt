Fair Trade growing by 20% a year
The share of the EU market taken by Fair Trade goods is increasing at a strong pace, but MEPs want more efforts to get the system working better in order to increase consumer confidence and push ahead with this instrument, which is proving so effective in reducing poverty, particularly in the world's poorest countries.
During a meeting of MEPs and Fair Trade experts, Miguel De Clerck, Director of Max Havelaar Belgium said that with an estimated net value of €660 million in 2005, 15 National Fair Trade initiatives around Europe and an average growth of 20% a year, the Fair Trade situation in the Northern hemisphere is “pretty positive”. He noted that the EU has committed itself to supporting and promoting Fair Trade and it "has proved to be an effective way of promoting sustainable development".
However, MEPs agreed that it is important to build on this. They noted particularly the need to keep working to gain consumer confidence. According to German Green Frithjof Schmidt, who drafted a Report on Fair Trade and Development, in order for the EU to advance Fair Trade it must focus on consumer protection, raising awareness, transparency and environmental concerns. He called for clear standards to be set.
Austrian Social Democrat Jörg Leichtfried agreed that a precondition for the development of the system - which he called "an important instrument in poverty reduction" - must be the existence of “long-term reliable and predictable prices (and) consumer confidence in the Fair Trade system”. He added, “Free Trade works, but we should try to get it working better.” Meanwhile, Zbigniew Zaleski, a Polish member of the EPP-ED, said it is necessary to reorient those who trade in conditions “as if still in the 18 th and 19 th Century”.
The Fair Trade movement began in the 1950s in Oxfam in the UK, which began selling crafts made by Chinese refugees. The first importing organisation was set up in 1967 in the Netherlands. Fair Trade is now a global operation with over 1 million small scale producers and workers in 3000 grassroots organisations in 50 countries. Their products are sold in thousands of specialised shops and supermarkets world-wide, including Fair Trade shops. Since information about the living and working conditions of the producers is included with all goods, the movement has been a pioneer in raising awareness about issues in developing countries.
