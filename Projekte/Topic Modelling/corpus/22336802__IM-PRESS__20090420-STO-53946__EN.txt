Parliament also voted to increase the rights of bus, coach and boat passengers, to extend copyright protection for the music industry and to tighten rules for credit rating agencies.
Patients' rights in cross-border healthcare
The report by British Conservative John Bowis focuses on patient's rights to seek healthcare abroad more easily, not the free movement of service providers.
MEPs called for the clarification of a patient's right to be reimbursed after treatment up to the level they would’ve received in their home country. It will be left to individual countries to decide whether to cover other costs like accommodation and travel.
Moldova
There has been turmoil in Moldova following a disputed election and MEPs are concerned about human rights violations after the 5 April general election, in which the Communist Party won 49.8 % of the votes.
During the debate, many MEPs said it is in everyone's interest to strengthen democracy in Moldova and overcome crisis and some MEPs want to bring Moldova closer to the EU.
Nuclear non-proliferation
MEPs debated an own initiative report by German Green Angelika Beer on the future of the Treaty on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. It recommends the Council in view of NPT Review Conference, which is to put the production, use and reprocessing of nuclear fuel under the inspection of the International Atomic Energy Agency. A vote will take place on this report on Friday.
Western Balkans
A report by Swedish Conservative Anna Ibrisagic on the Western Balkans ( Croatia , Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro, Albania and Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) says the prospect of future EU membership guarantees stability and reform. If these countries meet the EU's accession rules, membership should not be delayed or denied, the report says. It calls for full cooperation to bring indicted war criminals to justice.
G20 Summit
Some MEPs welcomed the decision by the G20 summit in London on 2 April to provide $1.1 trillion to encourage economic stability and a recovery in international finance, credit and trade, as well as to strengthen regulation of financial markets. However, o thers criticised the lack of investment in green technologies and called for actions to help the estimated 27 million who will be unemployed by 2010.
Also on the agenda
copyright protection for music will be extended from 50 to 70 years
bus, coach and boat passengers will get similar rights to those in air transport
credit rating agencies will work under stricter rules
the 2007 budget 2007 discharge was approved except for Council, which will be voted on later.
