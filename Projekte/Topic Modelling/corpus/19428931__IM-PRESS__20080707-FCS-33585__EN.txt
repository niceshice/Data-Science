Rapporteur Cappato and the Health Commissioner Vassiliou Why not take a break and take a look back at some of the stories that attracted the most attention from readers in the first part of the year. Among the issues are the number of women in the European Parliament and the US political systems, the emerging technology of carbon capture and storage as a way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and an interview with Marco Cappato, the EP's rapporteur on the European Union's annual human rights report and the abuses it identifies around the world.
We also look back to when Europe's prospective Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou faced questions from MEPs about her priorities if approved by the parliament. Catch up on all these articles in our "Most wanted" feature.

Women in Parliament - how does the European Parliament compare?
Women currently account for 31% of MEPs Ahead of international women's day this Saturday 8 March, we had a look at the balance between the sexes in the European Parliament and at other legislatures around Europe. At present 31% of the 785 MEPs are female - up from 19% in 1979 when the first direct elections were held.
Top of the list in terms of parity are the Netherlands and Estonia who both have 50%, while Malta and Cyprus have only male representatives.
In terms of women in senior positions, this is how the Parliament looks:
6 women chair one of the 23 committees.
13 of parliament's 37 delegations for relations with other countries have female chairs.
5 of the 14 Parliament vice-presidents are women.
2 of the 6 quaestors (who look after MEPs' interests) are women.
2 of the 12 Presidents since direct elections in 1979 have been women - Simone Veil (1979-1982) and Nicole Fontaine (1999-2002).
In the European Union the number of women standing for Parliament and being elected has risen by over a half in the last decade. In 1997 just 16% of MPs were women while they now account for 24%.
According to a report by the European Commission in 2006, 20 countries around the world had 30% or more female MPs. Of those, eight are in the EU - Sweden (47%), Finland (42%), the Netherlands (39%), Denmark, Spain, Belgium, Germany and Austria..
EU states with a less enviable record (less than 15% of national MPs being women) include: Czech Republic, Cyprus, Ireland, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Malta.
To celebrate international women's day this Saturday, Parliament's women's rights committee is organising conferences on gender mainstreaming in Parliamentary work and women's role in intercultural dialogue.

Prospective new Health Commissioner Vassiliou fields MEPs' questions
A smiling Ms Vassiliou with MEPs MEPs held a question and answer session with prospective health Commissioner Androula Vassiliou Tuesday to assess her suitability and qualifications. It was also an opportunity for MEPs on the Environment, Agriculture, Internal Market and Employment Committees to gauge her political views and sentiments. Ms Vassiliou stressed her legal and Parliamentary qualifications for the position.
A new Commissioner is needed following the resignation of fellow Cypriot Markos Kyprianou, who left to take up the post of foreign minister in the new Cypriot government. Ms Vassiliou was nominated by the Cypriot government and the Council of the European Union has already given its support to her nomination.
Ms Vassiliou told MEPs that she intends to put to good use the experience she acquired in her 20 years of law practice which she thinks "will be valuable in treating the complex and plentiful legal issues of the health portfolio". She also noted that 10 years of parliamentary experience has taught her "how to be a responsible and accountable politician".
Ms Vassiliou was asked questions indirectly and directly related to her portfolio. When one MEP declared himself disappointed by her answer (on tobacco), her answer "it would be an impossible task for me to please everybody" was applauded by some MEPs. After three rounds of questions, Ms Vassiliou held a press conference.
The EP will vote on whether to endorse the Commissioner designate during the 9-10 April Brussels plenary session. If all goes well , Ms Vassiliou will be in office until the appointment of a new Commission after the June 2009 European Parliament elections.

Super Tuesday in America: can Europe learn lessons?
The 44th US President…but who? The US, indeed the whole world, seems transfixed by the early stages of the Presidential elections, culminating today, with Super Tuesday when 24 US states hold primaries and caucuses to select delegates who will elect their parties' candidate at the national convention. Elections US-style combine primaries and caucuses, town hall meetings, TV advertising, razzmatazz and big money. We asked some MEPs whether European politics have anything to learn or to envy from American-style politics?
Super Tuesday is the biggest day of the US election calendar so far. Among the 24 places voting are key states including California, New York and New Jersey. These states will account for a large number of the delegates who will choose the democratic and republican candidates for November's presidential election.
American Presidential and Congressional elections differ from European Parliament elections in that they are bi-partisan (usually only Republicans or Democrats run) and because of the vast amounts of money involved.
People rather than parties
We asked a few MEPs if they favoured adopting the US system for Europe:
British Conservative Jonathan Evans, chair of Parliament's US Delegation said, the "positives are the strong impact of the personality and the reputation of candidates rather than the power of the political parties themselves".
"This encourages US politicians to actively engage with their constituents much more effectively than the vast majority of members of the European Parliament do," he said. "On the negative side, wealthy candidates have a massive and unfair advantage."
Support for US-style primary system
One of the best aspects of the US system is the contact that US presidential candidates have with people, according to Italian Green Monica Frassoni. "Candidates are continuously looking for contact with people and they are exposing themselves to very difficult direct debates on TV."
Ms Frassoni sees the primary system as a good method of choosing candidates at an early stage: "the primaries system could be usefully introduced here and it would be wonderful to see the European parties organise primaries to choose their candidate for President of the Commission".
The downsides of the US system for her are the amount of money involved and the fickleness of the media: "it is very obvious that big money counts and a very moody press can be problematic; I would not like to see those elements so prominent in our campaigns here."
Home-grown democracy "always healthiest"
Spanish Socialist Enrique Barón Crespo, himself a former EP president elected by fellow MEPs, said "the big challenge for the EU is to be organised as a vibrant and attractive democracy, therefore the American example is full of lessons".
"The primaries stand for functioning participative and competitive democracy based on the involvement of the citizens...as for the elections themselves they are an obstacle and endurance race not controlled by the parties," he said.
Mr Crespo also raised concerns about the amount of money involved. "The excessive weight of the money in the campaigns means a mortgage for later governing."
"European democracy is home-grown, just as US democracy is grown in the US. And home-grown is always healthiest," according to British Liberal Graham Watson , leader of the EP's ALDE group.
"We worry about low voter turnout, but voter turnout across the Atlantic is often even lower," he noted.
He warned against adopting aspects of US politics, which he characterised as negative: "if we allow our political strategists to carry on copying US partners - reading the opinions poll, conducting focus groups and then repeating back to the voters the prejudices they already hold, in the belief it will get us elected - public faith in politicians will fall even lower".
Due to time differences Super Tuesday in the US will run through the European night. The results should come in early Wednesday.
Let's hope the enthusiasm generated in the United States is matched in the European elections of June 2009!

Parliament and climate change: Carbon Capture and Storage
The International Energy Agency predict a 70% increase in coal burning by 2030 You may have heard about "Carbon Capture and Storage" - it's a way of keeping CO2 from entering the atmosphere and contributing to global warming. This January a proposed Europe-wide directive was proposed, which would regulate the emerging practice. British Liberal Chris Davies is preparing a report calling for it to be mandatory. He wants all new coal burning power stations to be required to capture 90% of their CO2 by 2015 and all stations to be fitted out within a decade of that target.
At present 24% of the European Union's CO2 emissions come from the burning of coal. This is why Chris Davies sees it as a crucial area to cut emissions using CO2 capture and storage. He also points to the fact that the International Energy Agency predicts a 70% increase in coal burning between now and 2030. Mr Davies warns that "as long as we are building traditional coal-fired power stations we are never going to get to grips with global warming".
The UN's Climate Change panel is optimistic about the benefits the process can bring. They estimate that in the next century it could conceivably account for 15-55% of the CO2 cuts required to avert the worst causes of global warming.
Is it scientifically possible and where will the carbon be stored?
Although the process is at an early stage it is scientifically possible with Canada, Algeria and Norway already carrying out trials. Essentially there are three methods of carbon capture and storage (CCS). With pre-combustion the fuel is gasified before use and separated into CO2 and hydrogen. With post-combustion, the CO2 is filtered out of the smoke. Finally, there is the Oxyfuel technique where fossil fuels are burned in pure oxygen rather than normal air - with the resulting emissions having a high concentration of C02 which can be captured.
After the CO2 is captured it will have to be transported by ship or pipeline to its final destination. It can be stored in depleted oil and gas fields or in underground salt water streams. Another possibility is the world's oceans although this is little understood at present. Some of the dangers of storage are either seepage or that they could be a health threat to humans and animals if C02 escaped.
A problem acknowledged by Mr Davies is that power plants with CCS technology require between 10% and 40% more energy. Also, the cost of fitting the systems (he wants them in existing power plants by 2025), transport and preparing storage sites is likely to be substantial.
The proposals as they stand
The proposal presented in January by the European Commission doesn't envisage making CCS compulsory. It aims to provide a framework to manage environmental risks and remove barriers in existing legislation. It sets out how appropriate storage sites should be assessed, designated and subsequently monitored as well as who would be responsible for what.
Ms Davies wants to kick-start CCS by giving captured and stored CO2 a "double credit" under the European Emissions Trading Scheme. This would mean that companies would be released from having to buy emission allowances and get extra credit that they could sell on emission markets.
The 54 year old MEP is due to present his report to the Environment Committee on 28 May. MEPs will have until the end of the year to reach agreement with EU Ministers on any legislation. Before then the parliament is planning to organise a workshop with experts in the field. Striking a realistic tone, Mr Davies said what he envisages "isn't a magic bullet, but it can help the world buy time to develop zero carbon technology for the long term".

Rapporteur Cappato on EU's human rights report
Marco Cappato favours the example of Gandhi Tuesday saw MEPs debate Parliament's annual human rights report, which is partly a response to the Council of Ministers and the Commission's report on the subject published in October. The report aims to identify good and bad practices around the world. It highlights issues which the global community needs to focus upon. This year Italian Liberal MEP Marco Cappato was made human rights rapporteur. We spoke to him Tuesday prior to the adoption of the EP report Wednesday by Foreign Affairs MEPs.
Q. As we approach the Olympics, this report from the Parliament, like much of the media - devotes much attention to China's human rights. Similar problems occur in Burma but the result is not the same. Can you elaborate?
Marco Cappato: Burma has lesser strategic weight than China which has greater influence on all Asia. When we address problems in China and in Tibet, when we talk about freedom for the Tibetans, we also talk about all the Chinese. Democratisation in China would have a massive effect on the whole region - in particular Burma, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
Q. Despite the global moratorium launched by the UN last December on the use of the death penalty, this practice is still widespread around the world. Some countries even impose it for homosexual activities. What is your view?
MC: Last year was a very important one with the approval of the global moratorium on use of the death penalty and this has had a symbolic and political value because from now on these violations are part of the competences of the UN. Unfortunately, as the death penalty is an internal matter for each country, we can not work miracles. We have had some good indicators, for example in the USA, that public opinion is less and less favourable to the death penalty and also in China the crimes where the death penalty is applied are diminishing. Of course we want the abolition but we welcome all positive steps.
Q. You have proposed "Gandhian non-violence" to promote human rights. How effective could this be for ensuring that fundamental human rights are promoted and respected?
MC: This concept does not only mean non violence but it's something active like not collaborating with an authoritarian regime, a hunger strike or the sabotage of violence acts against the population. There are some successful stories like Gandhi, Martin Luther King and the Orange Revolution. I propose to declare 2010 the year of the non-violence in order to help all who fight for democracy and human rights to have the appropriate tools and capacity to allow the most efficient fight in favour of non-violence.
Report adopted
The EP human rights report was adopted by Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday 2 April by an overwhelming majority (60 in favour, 0 against and 3 abstentions). The full Parliament will vote on it on 8 May.
