Parliaments from all over Europe were represented
The first known meeting between Serb and Kosovar MPs at an international forum took place Monday and Tuesday this week in the European Parliament. They were attending a Joint Parliamentary meeting on the Western Balkans with MEPs and MPs from around Europe. The state of the economy, the role of parliaments and visa issues were on the agenda. We spoke to members of the Serb and Kosovo delegation and asked whether they had any issues with the others being present.
Kosovo declared independence from Serbia on 17 February this year in the face of strong opposition from Belgrade which has refused to recognise the state.
The Speaker of the Serb Parliament Oliver Dulić told us he had no problems talking to his "Albanian colleagues" (from Kosovo). He said he already had contacts with them and stressed the need to "be open and launch negotiations about a common future". Mr Dulić said that for people of his generation - he is just 33 and Serbia's youngest speaker - the "historical reconciliation process between Serbs and Albanians is probably the most important regional thing".
"Common future in EU"
This upbeat message about the need for negotiations was echoed by Jakup Krasniqi - the Speaker of Kosovo's parliament. "We have a common future in the EU and therefore we can sit together and talk and discuss." He welcomed the role that Europe could play in fostering more contacts; "we agreed on this initiative (the JPM) from European Parliament and we feel good that the European Parliament and EU in general have opened the new perspective for the countries of our region."
Dutch Green MEP Joost Lagendijk acted as Parliament's rapporteur on the future of Kosovo. He stressed the distance both sides have come. He remarked that "after many years of not wanting to sit together or not wanting to listen to each other they are now prepared at least to sit together and disagree but at least to sit together".
Mr Lagendijk said, "both of them realise that it does not make sense to only shout at each other and not communicate". He hoped the contacts initiated in the EP would continue.
