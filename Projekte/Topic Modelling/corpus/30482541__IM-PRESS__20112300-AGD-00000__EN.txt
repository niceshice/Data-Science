Committee meetings and political groups week

Preventing child abuse. Talks between MEPs and Council representatives take place on a proposed EU law to combat sexual abuse and exploitation of children. A key issue is whether websites hosting child pornography should be deleted rather than blocked as a priority (Tuesday).

Preparing for the plenary session. Parliament’s political groups will devote most of the week to preparations for the 6-9 June Strasbourg plenary session. The agenda includes a debate and vote on the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the border-free Schengen area, legislation to ensure users of heavy goods vehicles pay for the damage they cause, proposals to change the system for European elections and a resolution setting out Parliament’s views on the financial framework of the EU over the years ahead. The final draft agenda will be adopted by the Conference of Presidents on Wednesday.
Ascension holiday. Parliament’s offices are closed on Thursday and Friday for the Ascension holiday. This means the pre-session briefing with the political group spokespeople will take place in Strasbourg on Monday 6 June.

Role models for young Europeans
The prize is awarded to projects undertaken by people aged between 16 and 30. The aim is for the winning projects to serve as role models for young people living in Europe and offer practical examples of Europeans living together as one community. Youth exchange programmes, youth conferences and internet projects with a European dimension are among those selected.
The prize, which is jointly organised by the European Parliament and the Charlemagne Prize Foundation, is awarded annually. This is its fourth edition. Last year the German project 'European CNC Network - Train for Europe' was awarded first prize, with the second prize going to the book project 'You are here' (Ireland) and the third to 'BEST Engineering Competition BEC' (Bulgaria).
Total prize money of 10,000 Euros
The three winning projects will be awarded funding of €5,000, €3,000, and €2,000 for first, second and third prize respectively. They will also be invited to visit the European Parliament in the coming months.
Selection procedure
National juries consisting of at least two MEPs and one representative of a youth organisation have selected a national winner from each of the 27 Member States. In April, the European jury, consisting of three MEPs, the President of the European Parliament, Jerzy Buzek, and four representatives of the Foundation of the International Charlemagne Prize, selected the three winners from the 27 projects.
Representatives of the 27 projects have been invited to the award ceremony in Aachen.
