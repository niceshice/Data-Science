The names of five nominees for this year's European Parliament Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought were unveiled on Tuesday at a joint meeting of the EP's Foreign Affairs Committee, Development Committee and Human Rights Subcommittee. These five names will be narrowed down to a shortlist of three by the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Development Committee at a vote on 24 September. The Conference of Presidents (Parliament's political group leaders) will then pick the winner on 25 October.
The European Parliament's Sakharov Prize - named after Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov - has been awarded each year since 1988 to individuals or organisations who have made an important contribution to the fight for human rights or democracy. The prize will be awarded at a ceremony at Parliament's Strasbourg plenary sitting on 11 December, the day after the 59th anniversary of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The winner also receives a sum of €50,000.
Under the Sakharov Prize rules, nominees must be supported by at least 40 Members of the European Parliament or by a political group, each of whom must provide a justification for their choice. The names of this year's candidates are as follows:
