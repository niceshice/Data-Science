The European Parliament is deeply disturbed at the situation in Côte d'Ivoire. In a resolution adopted on Thursday it strongly condemns the violence against civilians and says no efforts should be spared to identify and bring to justice, including at international level, all those responsible for crimes against the civilian population. It urges the EU to support any inquiries.
The escalation of violence in Côte d’Ivoire, including abductions and the use of heavy weapons against civilians, is forcefully condemned in the resolution.
MEPs stress the need to abide by the results of the November 2010 elections, which were won by Alassane Ouattara. They condemn attempts by former President Gbagbo to seize victory by violent means and urge him to stand down. They are also disappointed at the failure of diplomatic efforts to find a solution following the presidential elections of last November.
The targeted sanctions imposed by the United Nations, the African Union and the Council of the European Union are welcomed, as are the decisions taken by the World Bank and the IMF. The international community is urged to address the humanitarian situation and prevent a new migration crisis in the region. Parliament welcomes the commitment of the EU, as expressed by Commissioner Georgieva, to help resolve the humanitarian crisis.
Lastly, MEPs express support for mediation efforts conducted under the auspices of the African Union and ECOWAS and call on President Ouattara to facilitate peace and national reconciliation.
