Crisis in Gaza - not exactly child's play
Javier Solana, the EU's foreign affairs chief was in Parliament on Wednesday to report to MEPs on relations with Iran and events in the Gaza strip. He stressed the need to ensure that Tehran's nuclear ambitions were peaceful - a call echoed by MEPs. Plans by Washington to station anti-missile batteries in the Czech Republic and Poland and the effect this would have on European security policy were discussed. MEPs also debated proposed legislation liberalising postal services in Europe.
Iran "our objective is to remove suspicions"
The High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy told the House that Iran is a key country in the Middle East that it is "an imperfect democracy" but better than nothing and that "we should engage with its parliamentarians."
"None of us have a problem with an Iranian civil programme, in fact, we are offering to help (but) we need to ensure that their intentions are purely peaceful". Mr Solana added, "our objective is to remove suspicions".
He also raised concerns over the high number of executions, reports of torture and uranium enrichment. On a positive note he pointed out the international community's good cooperation with Iran in Afghanistan.
EU Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner criticised the state of human rights: "Without systematic improvement on human rights...our relations with Iran cannot develop properly."
In the debate that followed, MEPs criticised the fact that more that 30% of candidates were excluded form the March parliamentary elections in Iran. Some speakers suggested that the EU support the Iranian opposition or set up an EU Representation in Iran.
Gaza Strip
On January 19 Israel closed the border with the Gaza strip and stopped fuel supplies as a response to continuing rocket attacks from this area controlled by Hamas.
Mr Solana said, the "humanitarian situation has worsened and, security deteriorated. A possible solution could be an EU border mission that would attempt to police the situation."
MEPs were sympathetic to the position of the Palestinian population of Gaza, with recent events prompting calls for the EU to move away from a policy of isolating Hamas and accepting the need for talks.
Others however reminded the House that Hamas is on the EU list of designated terrorist organisations and emphasised the right of Israel to defend its own population.
Parliament will adopt a resolution on the subject in February. Read the detailed report of the debate on this website.
US anti-missile system
Following Council and Commission statements, MEPs debated the controversial US anti-missile defence system designed to counter threats from potential emerging nuclear powers.
Some MEPs stressed that the matter is a European one and that whatever steps Warsaw and Prague take will impact on any emerging EU foreign policy. Other speakers said it is up to Poland and the Czech Republic to take measures they consider necessary for their security.
Postal services
MEPs debated the accomplishment of the internal market in postal services, including the expiry of remaining postal service monopolies by 2011, - or 2013 for some Member States.
Other issues
British Liberal Fiona Hall presented her own-initiative report on an action plan for energy efficiency.
MEPs also supported the outcome of the recent Bali climate change conference (3-14 December 2007).
