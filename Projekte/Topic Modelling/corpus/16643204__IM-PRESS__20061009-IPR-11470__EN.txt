Improving EU communication - and coverage of the EU
Institutions
2006-10-10 - 16:05
The Culture Committee says the Commission should support the creation of a European public sphere dedicating sufficient coverage to European affairs. In its reaction to Commissioner Wallstr√∂m's proposals for changes in EU communication policy, it also calls for more information on EU affairs on public television throughout Europe, but rejects the idea of a code of conduct for all EU institutions on communication with citizens.
In adopting an own-initiative report on the Commission's White Paper on a European communication policy, the committee rejected the Commission's proposal to submit all EU institutions to a code of conduct regulating their communication with EU citizens. Rapporteur Luis Herrero Tejedor (EPP-ED, ES) said that laying down rules of conduct for the elected European Parliament could lead to adverse consequences, reducing the scope for independent opinion.
The White Paper was one of the Commission's initiatives aimed at improving the EU's interaction with its citizens following the 'no' votes in referendums on the proposed EU constitution in France and the Netherlands. The committee said that to reach citizens it was important to communicate better and to show the relevance of EU decisions on their daily life. Through cooperation with regional and local institutions, emphasis should be placed on communicating regularly with citizens about the relevant regional and local projects in which the EU had participated. National public television channels should be encouraged to properly to inform citizens of what is happening at EU level, added the committee.
Finally, the Commission was asked to use pristine and concise language when communicating with the media and citizens and to avoid the use of the EU jargon, which increased rather than closed the gap between institutions and citizens.
