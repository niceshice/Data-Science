Berlin - from walls to welcomes

Berlin - scene of some of the most memorable historical images of the 20th century: from the burning of the Reichstag at the start of Third Reich in 1933 to the building and then the fall of the Berlin Wall - the city has witnessed the changing currents of 20th century history. Last year it hosted the World Cup final and last weekend hosted celebrations to mark 50 years of European integration. With Berlin undergoing a renaissance we have a look at some key moments in its past.
From the ashes of the Third Reich Berlin emerged as a post war symbol of Cold War divisions. Lying deep in Communist East Germany the Western sector of the city was isolated. In 1948 it needed the "Berlin airlift" to save it from starvation after Stalin ordered it to be blockaded. Later, in 1961 a wall was constructed to prevent East Germans fleeing to the Western sector. It survived until 1989 and would become the most tangible symbol of a divided city and continent. Visiting in 1963 US President John F Kennedy called West Berlin an "island of freedom".
At the time of Kennedy's speech, Willy Brandt was Mayor of West Berlin. Later as Chancellor of West German he would win the Nobel Prize for his "Ostpolitik" efforts to work with East Germany and the USSR. He sat as a member of the European Parliament from 1979 to 1983.
9 November 1989: dawn of a new Europe
As demonstrators in November 1989 climbed on top of the Berlin Wall and headed across the frontier in their thousands - it was clear that Communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe was finished. That year saw popular revolutions sweep away Communist regimes from Prague to Budapest. Germany was officially reunited in October 1990 and the eastern part became part of the EU.
In the 1990's the decision was also taken to move the capital of Germany back to Berlin away from sleepy Bonn. Since 1999 most of the German government has been based in the nation's capital. That year also saw the capital host an EU summit which established the financial framework for the enlargement of the European Union - ultimately taking place in 2004.
Last weekend another Summit was held in Berlin in which EU leaders adopted a declaration reaffirming EU values and laying out the challenges ahead. These include measures to fight climate change and poverty. The declaration also called for a "renewed common basis" for the EU before elections to the European Parliament in 2009. This was taken to mean that the debates over the Constitutional Treaty should be resolved before then.
Berlin today
Today Berlin is a cosmopolitan city of 3.4 million people marked by a vibrant cultural scene (it boasts over 170 museums). However, it continues to suffer from 40 years of division with unemployment at 17.5%. One of the supposed characteristics of Berliners is that they are outspoken: "Berliner Schnauze" describes their frank and cheeky way of speaking.
Visitors today are drawn by its history and people but also to see some of its famous landmarks, in particular the 200 year old Brandenburg Gate, "Checkpoint Charlie" where East met West in the Cold War and the recently opened Holocaust memorial museum.
