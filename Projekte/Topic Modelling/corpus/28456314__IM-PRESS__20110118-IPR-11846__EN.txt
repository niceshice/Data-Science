The deadline for the submission of applications for the Charlemagne Youth Prize has been postponed to 14 February. This will give more candidates the opportunity to participate in the fourth edition of the Prize. The procedure for the submission of applications is simple and straightforward.
Role models for young Europeans
The Charlemagne Youth Prize, which is jointly organised by the European Parliament and the Foundation of the International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen, is awarded to projects undertaken by people between 16 and 30 years old that help to promote understanding between citizens of different European countries. The winning projects should serve as role models for young people living in Europe and offer practical examples of Europeans living together as one community. Youth exchange programmes, artistic and Internet projects with a European dimension are amongst the projects selected.
Total prize money of 10,000 euros
The three winning projects will be awarded funding of €5,000, €3,000, and €2,000 respectively. They will also be invited to visit the European Parliament. Representatives of the best projects from each of the 27 EU Member States will be invited to Aachen, in Germany, on 31 May 2011 to participate in the award ceremony.
2010 winners
In 2010, the German project "European CNC Network - Train for Europe" was awarded the first prize in the European Charlemagne Youth Prize competition. The project brought together 24 vocational schools to build a small-gauge locomotive and wagons. Second and third prizes went to "You are here", an Irish book project and "Best Engineering Competition BEC" from Bulgaria, respectively.
Application forms are available in 22 languages on the European Parliament's Charlemagne Youth Prize website (see below).
