There are 7 political formations in the European Parliament Members of the European Parliament do not sit and act according to national groupings, but organise themselves into political groups. Political groups draw together political parties from across the EU which share ideological principles and political views. Parliament's rules currently specify that a political group must be composed of at least 20 members from at least one fifth of EU countries. In the outgoing Parliament there are seven political groups, (in order of size):
EPP-ED: The European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
PES: The Socialist Group in the European Parliament.
ALDE: Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
UEN: Union for Europe of the Nations.
Greens-EFA: Greens / European Free Alliance.
GUE/NGL: European United Left/Nordic Green Party.
IND/DEM: Independence and Democracy group.
Additionally, a number of members, not belonging to any political group, sit as independents or "non-attached"
In the following sections, watch interviews with each of the political group leaders conducted recently by europarltv
