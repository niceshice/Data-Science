Visit from 13-16 July ©BELGA/BELPRESS Migration was in the spotlight 13-16 July when a delegation of six MEPs visited Tunisia to assess the problems caused by the exodus of immigrants from Tunisia to the EU. This situation has been exacerbated by the influx of asylum seekers to Tunisia fleeing the war in Libya and the delegation visited refugee camps close to the border.
"Europe must address the challenges posed by this situation, particularly the treatment of refugees, humanitarian aid as well as the impact on the migratory flow towards Europe," said Maltese EPP member Simon Busuttil, who led the delegation."Our delegation will help us understand better how we can help alleviate the situation. We will do this by talking directly to the refugees, to the international organisations running their camps and to the Tunisian authorities".
Programme
On Wednesday afternoon the delegation met with UNHCR , the UN refugee agency, and with the European Commission Humanitarian Aid Agency, ECHO .
On Thursday, the MEPs visited the Choucha UNHCR refugee camp and the camp run by the United Arab Emirates, near the border with Libya.
On Friday the group was in Tunis for meetings with Prime Minister Beji Caid El Sebsi , Foreign Minister Mohamed Mouldi Kefi, Interior Minister Habib Essid, Social Affairs Minister Mohamed Ennaceur and the EU Head of Mission and US Ambassador.

Focus on refugees, aid, migration
Want "to see the situation of fleeing refugees for ourselves" - MEP ©BELGA/AFP/DOMINIQUE FAGET The Arab spring has put the EU's asylum system and immigration policies to the test. As one of the countries trying to re-build its political system and close to the EU, Tunisia is central to the issue. Italy and Malta are having to deal with the influx of refugees from Tunisia, while Tunisia itself is trying to deal with refugees fleeing the conflict in Libya.
"We are going to the Libyan border to see the situation of fleeing refugees for ourselves. The fight for democracy in Libya is leaving certain temporary side effects such as the considerable numbers of people fleeing the country," Mr Busuttil said. "The people escaping Libya also raise issues for Tunisia, which is already under severe pressure for other reasons".
Among the challenges facing Tunisia are the election of a Constituent Assembly to come up with a new constitution, which has been delayed because of administrative difficulties. The interim government is unstable with several ministers having resigned over the past months, while the situation in the country remains unstable, there are concerns about security and there have been protests against the interim government.
Refugees, humanitarian aid, migration
The delegation focused on humanitarian aid, treatment of refugees and migration. The EU allocated €3 million in emergency aid to Egyptian and Tunisian authorities in March to meet the immediate humanitarian needs of refugees fleeing Libya.
The EU wants to strengthen the EU's border agency Frontex, a proposal that will come to the plenary in September and has already set up the Hermès mission in Lampedusa to help manage the massive flows of migrants.
In addition, the EU has set up a new agency, the European Asylum Support Office , in Malta, which began work in June.

#eptunisia day 1: first contacts with humanitarian actors in the field
Simon Busuttil during meeting with UNHCR The six-strong delegation arrived in the town of Djerba, in the South of Tunisia, on Wednesday afternoon. With its Mediterranean coastline, blue skies and temperatures of 36°C, it looks like a picture postcard paradise but the reality is much grimmer. Close to the Libyan border it hosts five refugee camps housing the hundreds of thousands of people who have crossed the border over recent months fleeing the violence.
The MEPs had a first meeting with representatives of the UNHCR and humanitarian organisations in the field to prepare for a visit to the camps on Thursday, during which delegation leader Simon Busuttil thanked them for their work.
"I am ready for a difficult and moving visit to the camps," French Liberal Nathalie Griesbeck said after the meeting with the UNHCR. "Flight is a right and providing a welcome a duty."
Impact on Djerba
Tunisia, and especially Djerba, is very much associated with tourism but since the fall of the Ben Ali regime in January, the situation has changed; growth has decreased as tourism numbers have fallen up to 50%.
Despite its economic difficulties and political instability, Tunisia kept its borders open to immigrants fleeing the violence in Libya.
Of the five camps, the biggest is Choucha, which housed up to 20,000 refugees at its height. It now has 3,768 refugees from 22 countries. There have been problems and tensions within the camp and with Tunisian people living nearby led to an explosion of violence at the end of May, resulting in four deaths and a fire that destroyed three quarters of the camp.

#eptunisia day 2: impressive and emotional visit to refugee camps
Views from the camp Amidst soaring temperatures and sandstorms, the MEPs visited the checkpoint at Ras Ajdir on the Libyan border and two refugee camps in the middle of the desert on Thursday. NGOs estimate that over 500,000 people, fleeing the conflict in Libya, have crossed the border since February and more than 5,000 people are still waiting for resettlement, living in tents provided by humanitarian organisations
MEPs were deeply moved by the visits. "This has really plunged us into the reality of the situation...we came face to face with the people on the ground who spoke about their hopes and needs," said French Socialist Sylvie Guillaume "Strategies must be developed so that asylum can be granted. Asylum must be a right," she said. "The visit was both moving and shocking."
Heard complaints about living conditions
MEPs heard complaints from migrants about living conditions in the camp, like this one: "There is no good food, no good water, no good medication. I am three months pregnant and I can't stand that any longer."
"The problem is hope. There is no hope here. Therefore people leave illegally, for example to Italy," another migrant added. "We are all human beings."
In addition to migrants, MEPs met Tunisian soldiers responsible for security in the camps and humanitarian workers from the UNHCR, the International Organisation for Migration, Save the children, UNICEF, Red Cross and Islamic relief among others.
"The key request we got from all the actors in the field was to open up new places for resettlement. Three to four thousand people is not that many," Dutch Green Judith Sargentini said. "The most important role for us now is to share this experience and urge member states to be more generous. We will have to take these refugees anyway, either in Lampedusa or directly via resettlement. And I'd rather have them alive." Video from Zarzis, 13 July
Busuttil: EU should show solidarity by resettling remaining refugees
"The only way is to go towards solidarity such as resettlement" - Busuttil After visiting the refugee camps in Tunisia, the MEPs called on EU member states to show solidarity with the Tunisian people and authorities that have been dealing with a massive influx of immigrants from Libya by helping to resettle the few thousand migrants that can't be repatriated. Delegation leader Simon Busuttil told us more in an interview.
What impressions have you taken away from the visit to the camps?
It has been a remarkable experience. We had seen a lot on television, when following the news about Libya, about people going to Tunisia. We decided, as an EP delegation, to come here and see it first-hand. It has been remarkable to see what these people are going through.
You told people on the ground that "you're here to listen to them". What did you hear and learn?
We listened to the stakeholders - the refugees, the organisations, the Tunisian authorities. And thanks to that we moved from the listening stage to the stage of understanding.
I think understanding the situation is crucial for the EP, which is involved in policy- and decision-making. The key thing with this kind of mission is getting first-hand experience of the situation and the difficulties so that when we go back we can take better decisions based on the experience.
Can the EU react quickly enough to emergency situations?
The EU acts extremely quickly when it comes to financial solidarity. It is the best donor in the world, and the quickest to send humanitarian support through money.
We will encourage the Commission to go on doing this and we are satisfied with what has been done - €100 million has already been committed to the humanitarian process here, €70 million of which is already being used.
But when it comes to action that goes beyond, unfortunately the European mechanism stalls a bit. And when it comes to sensitive issues like moving or resettling people, the process is completely blocked.
The time has come when we need to go beyond financial solidarity. If 3000 or 4000 people are blocked in the camp in Choucha, facing temperatures of 43°C and sandstorms every afternoon, the only way is to go towards solidarity such as resettlement.
Over half a million people have moved from Libya to Tunisia. Of these, only a few thousand remain who have no place to go. All the others have been sent home. It's up to us now as Europeans to carry the responsibility for these people. It's a goodwill gesture to resettle these people amongst the 27 states in the EU, to show the Tunisian people that we appreciate all what they've done.

"The EU cannot turn a blind eye to these dramatic realities," home affairs ministers should discuss the issue at their meeting on 18-19 July in Poland, they said.
"We are disappointed with the weak response given by member states compared to the efforts undertaken by countries like Norway, the US and Canada," they said, calling on EU countries to help in the resettlement of refugees from war-torn countries who cannot return to their homes.
Applause for Tunisia's "solidarity"
The MEPs said they were struck by the conditions in the camps they visited, particularly the "extreme heat, sandstorms and limited access to clean water and adequate sanitation and hygiene facilities (that) present particular hardships for children and pregnant women".
But they lauded the "overwhelming hospitality and solidarity of the Tunisian people in keeping an open door policy to third country nationals who fled Libya". The statement said, "Tunisia has just undergone its own revolution and faces sizable economic and social difficulties. The migration flows represent a further burden that ought to be shared."
