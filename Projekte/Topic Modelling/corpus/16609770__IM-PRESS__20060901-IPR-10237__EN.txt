In adopting a resolution on the counterfeiting of medicinal products, MEPs consider that the European Community should equip itself as a matter of urgency with the means to combat effectively illicit practices in the area of piracy and the counterfeiting of medicines.
The House calls on the EU to take steps to strengthen the regulatory and quality-control capacity for medicinal products and medical equipment put on the market in countries with inadequate resources and to improve access to affordable medicines.
The House calls on the Commission to go beyond its communication 'Strategy to enforce intellectual property rights in third countries .' MEPs in particular, urge the European Union to take adequate measures to combat the scourge of counterfeiting of medicines in its territory. Parliament urges the European Union to play a key role in promoting an international convention to create a specific criminal offence of counterfeiting or the receiving and distribution of counterfeit medicines in the legislation of every country.
MEPs also call for greater cooperation at both national and international level between the various authorities involved in anti-counterfeiting measures. Finally, the House emphasises the importance of preventive measures in action programmes, more specifically, the establishment of structures, cooperation, awareness campaigns, preferably carried out by the public authorities, and finally the political will to carry through such measures successfully.
