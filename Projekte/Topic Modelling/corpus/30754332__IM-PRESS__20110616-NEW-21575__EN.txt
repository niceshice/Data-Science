Parliament sticks to its guns on economic governance six-pack
2011-06-20 - 12:32
MEPs are determined to make EU governments act more responsibly with regard to their budget deficits and debts. They insist that it should not be left to the Member States to impose budgetary discipline but that the Commission should play a bigger role here. As it has yet to agree with the Council on this point, Parliament will vote only on its amendments, but will not yet close the procedure in order to leave room for further talks. The six legislative texts aim to revamp the EU's flagging economic coordination rules. Throughout the discussions, political groups and Member States have clashed both between and among themselves on how best to design the new laws.
Among the EP political groups, the difficult balance to strike was between tougher, more automatic sanctions and rules that will not hamper growth. On a more consensual level, MEPs together pushed for increased overall transparency, integration of the European economic semester of economic policy coordination into the texts to give it a legal basis, a sense of "national ownership" of the package, stronger powers for the Commission and greater independence of national statistical bodies. Together, they also pushed through the need for a commitment to Eurobonds.

New European consumer rights law enters the final lap
2011-06-20 - 12:32
An EU-wide right for consumers to change their minds within two weeks about distance purchases of goods as well as clearer pricing rules for internet sales are among the main benefits of new rules on consumer protection, under a deal struck between Parliament and Council on an update to the EU consumer rights directive. The new rules aim to create clarity and lay down standard rules for both consumers and businesses. This should improve consumer protection and the functioning of the internal market and thereby boost cross-border trade within the EU. The rules will significantly strengthen consumer rights, especially as regards information, delivery and withdrawal from contracts, whilst also clarifying rules on digital downloads and cutting red tape for small and medium-sized firms.
Current EU rules on consumer protection are the result of four EU directives that set out certain minimum requirements. However, Member States have added rules in a haphazard manner over the years, making EU consumer contract law a patchwork of 27 differing sets of rules and creating uncertainty in cross-border trade for both buyers and sellers. Also, as the original directives predated the digital revolution, consumers today are poorly protected when shopping online.
After two and a half years of work, Parliament's negotiating team, led by MEP Andreas Schwab (EPP, DE), has now brokered a well-balanced agreement with the Council. After Parliament's plenary vote, the Council of Ministers will still need to adopt the new legislation formally, after which Member States will have two years to implement it.
Procedure: Co-decision (1st reading)

2012 budget: keep up investment to help Europe emerge from crisis
2011-06-20 - 12:32
Key investments in education, social inclusion, poverty reduction and a knowledge-based society must go ahead without delay, says a draft resolution by the Budgets Committee on the 2012 EU budget proposed by the Commission. If backed by the full Parliament, the resolution will constitute the mandate for MEPs in their first round of budget negotiations with the Council and Commission on 11 July. The draft text warns the Council against making "horizontal cuts" in budgets without assessing the EU's actual needs. It urges Member States, if they do suggest such cuts, to "explain publicly and identify clearly which of the EU's political priorities or projects they would delay or drop altogether as a consequence" .
The committee report, drafted by Italian S&D member Francesca Balzani, also supports the proposed increase in payments (4.9% compared to the 2011 budget), saying this is the minimum required to honour legal commitments made by the EU in previous years .
The Commission's draft budget, unveiled on 20 April, proposed €147.435 billion in commitment appropriations and €132.738 billion in payments (1.12% and 1.01% respectively of the EU’s forecast gross national income for 2012).
MEPs are also expected to instruct Parliament's negotiating team to push for more resources for the EU 2020 strategy during the "trilogue" (negotiation meeting) on 11 July. The Commission estimates that 43.5% of the draft budget contributes to EU 2020, the EU's strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. After the trilogue, the Council will adopt its position (late July) on the 2012 budget. The EP vote in October is expected to be followed by a conciliation committee (1-22 November), preparing for final adoption of the budget in early December.

How the future CAP might look
2011-06-20 - 12:32
A revamped EU agriculture policy providing secure food supplies, environmental protection, new jobs and renewable energy is the goal sketched out in a draft resolution by the Agriculture Committee. The committee also urges that EU budget spending on the farming sector be maintained at current levels. In addition, MEPs suggest creating a new and fairer system for allocating financial aid between different EU states and various types of farmer as well as new measures to fight speculation, manage crises and improve farmers' bargaining power in the food supply chain.
The resolution, drafted for the Agriculture Committee by Albert Dess (EPP, DE), comes before the full Parliament for a vote on Thursday.
The resolution's aim is to send an advance message about Parliament's wishes for the upcoming reform and modernisation of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), a process running in parallel with discussions on the EU's multiannual budget. The Commission has already released a consultation paper on CAP reform and will present its detailed draft legislation in the autumn. Parliament and the Council will then decide jointly on the final shape of the legislation.

MEPs stand up for regional aid
2011-06-20 - 12:32
Economic, social and territorial cohesion in the EU must be adequately funded in future, insists the Regional Development Committee in five draft resolutions to be debated and put to the vote on Thursday. Simpler access to EU aid, more effective controls, better cross-border cooperation and a possible expansion in the number of regions to benefit from EU funding are among ideas highlighted by MEPs. Parliament is using these non-legislative resolutions to signal its wishes regarding the legislative package on cohesion policy for 2014-2020 as well as the new EU multiannual financial framework, both due to be unveiled by the Commission in the autumn. While seeking improvements in cohesion policy, the committee defends the current foundations and principles of a strong policy, saying its budget should not be cut and its resources not dispersed on a sectoral basis.
"Intermediate" beneficiary regions
The overall architecture of future cohesion policy is the subject of a resolution by Markus Pieper (EPP, DE). This resolution also contains - against Mr Pieper's wishes - a suggestion to create an "intermediate category" of 51 regions (of which 48 would be in the EU-15) with a GDP of 75-90% of the EU's average GNP. These regions would be eligible for EU cohesion aid.
Neighbouring regions and towns working together
To boost cross-border cooperation between regions, the share of the EU budget allocated to Objective 3 (territorial cohesion) should be nearly trebled (from 2.5% to 7%), suggests a resolution by Marie-Thérèse Sanchez-Schmid (EPP, FR). The development of urban areas will also require greater involvement by decision-makers and urban actors in territorial planning, according to a resolution by Oldřich Vlasák (ECR, CZ).
A policy of results
A call to slash red tape that slows down the take-up of EU funds and a stronger focus on results are the key demands of a resolution by Miroslav Mikolášik (EPP, SK). The final resolution, by Georgios Stavrakakis (S&D, EL), highlights the value of a set of common rules for the various structural funds (ERDF, ESF, Cohesion Fund, EAFRD and EFF) as well as the potential for cross-financing and multi-funds.
A press conference with Markus Pieper is scheduled for 23 June, straight after the vote, in the Anna Politkovskaya press conference room.
Marie-Thérèse Sanchez-Schmid will hold a press conference on 23 June at 2pm.

Should nuclear waste exports be allowed?
2011-06-20 - 12:32
Exports of nuclear and radioactive waste to countries outside the EU should be permitted, provided these countries can handle the waste safely, believes the EP Energy Committee. At the same time, add MEPs, EU governments need to improve worker safety and encourage research into alternatives to burying the waste deep underground. All these proposals are made by the Energy Committee in its response to a proposed EU law designed to ensure that nuclear waste is handled and disposed of safely.
Exports to non-EU countries
Under the Commission's draft directive, each Member State would be responsible for disposing of the waste it produces. Exporting it to another Member State would be permitted only in cases governed by bilateral agreements.
After a tense debate, the Energy Committee recommended that Parliament as a whole vote to allow exports to non-EU countries provided the exporting state ensures that the waste is "disposed of in compliance with the provisions of this directive".
National records compulsory but each country to choose its own energy mix
MEPs also say EU Member States should be required to draw up national inventories and plans for managing nuclear facilities, even post-closure. Not all Member States produce nuclear waste but all have to deal with radioactive waste generated by medicine, industry, agriculture and research. Each national government will retain the power to decide its own overall energy mix.
The full Parliament will vote on the committee's proposals on Thursday. EU Member States must await Parliament's opinion before taking their final decision.

Parliament eyes CO2 cuts beyond 20%
2011-06-20 - 12:32
MEPs are considering a new call for a more ambitious EU climate policy, with a 30% reduction of CO2 by 2020 instead of the current 20% target. Making 25% cuts alone within the EU (instead of through investments in the developing world) could help modernise and benefit the EU economy, according to a draft resolution to be put to the vote on Thursday.
