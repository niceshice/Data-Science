Dairy quotas: Agriculture Committee favours 2% voluntary increase

Dairy quotas in the Member States should rise by 2% on a voluntary basis from 1 April 2008, with the possibility of balancing them out between states that exceed their quotas and those that under-use them, to avoid penalising any state that has a surplus. This is a compromise, proposed by the EP Agriculture Committee on Tuesday, to take account of rising demand on world markets and the differing situations of EU producers.
To meet growing demand in the EU and on world markets, the Commission recently proposed increasing dairy production quotas by 2% in all Member States from 1 April 2008, which would represent a potential of 2.84 million additional tonnes for the year 2008/2009 over the current total of 145.7 million tonnes.
Although most MEPs back the principle of an increase to enable the dairy sector to take advantage of new opportunities on world markets, others, including rapporteur Elisabeth Jeggle (EPP-ED, DE), fear that a uniform increase of 2% would result in lower prices paid to producers who are already in difficulty, in an environment where quotas are under-used in many regions.
Compromise suggested by MEPs
The compromise proposed by the Agriculture Committee, in its consultative report adopted unanimously on Tuesday, would allow the Member States to increase their production quotas by 2% on 1 April if they so wished. Moreover, for the year 2008/2009, levies on surpluses would only have to be paid if there were still a surplus at European level after a process of balancing out between states that had exceeded their quotas and those that had under-used them.
Background: A broader debate is taking place with a view to a "soft landing" for the quota system, which expires in 2015, as part of the discussions on the CAP health check (another press release on this topic will be published today).
Procedure: consultation -- Plenary vote: March (Strasbourg)
