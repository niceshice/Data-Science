Six months after the EU External Action Service was launched, on 1 December 2010, Parliament's political groups pushed for a stronger and more united EU stance on Arab revolts, in a debate with foreign policy High Representative Catherine Ashton. ALDE, ECR and the Greens also said EU sanctions should target Syria's President Bassar Al Assad, as well as Syrian officials.
On Libya, Parliament applauded Ms Ashton's announcement that an EU office will be opened in Benghazi "to assist the people and the Interim Transitional National Council".
Other messages, backed by many MEPs, stressed the need to investigate the killing of Iranian dissidents in camp Ashraf in Iraq and to make progress in resolving the Middle East conflict. The ECR and EFD groups spoke against the EU maintaning relations with Hamas, despite its recent reconciliation with Fatah. "Our position on Hamas has not changed", replied Ms Ashton, "but I don't consider the flotilla to be the right response to the humanitarian situation in Gaza". This was a response to the GUE group's initiative to include two MEPs in a new flotilla scheduled for 13 June.
Three non-legislative resolutions setting out a new road map for the EU's foreign, security and defense policies will be put to vote on Wednesday 11 May at noon.
