Education without borders; in the footsteps of Erasmus

It is not every day that an EU programme inspires a popular film, but in Cédric Klapisch's famous film "L’auberge espagnole" (the Spanish youth hostel) the Erasmus student exchange programme proved the inspiration. In the 2002 film, a group of young students from different nationalities find themselves sharing an apartment in Barcelona when they do an "Erasmus year" at a foreign university.
Klapisch's film won a considerable cult following among the over one million European film goers who had themselves completed the Erasmus course. The film covers the issues of living abroad for the first time, adjusting to different cultures, languages and forming a common bond with people of your age group from totally diverse cultural backgrounds. Needless to say the film is spiced up considerably by the inevitable physical relationships that develop between some of the characters - and the temptations they face when being away from home.

From Russia with love
This is a theme that Klapisch returns to in the sequel to the film that went on general European release in June. Entitled "les Poupées Russes" (the Russian dolls) we now find the characters reunited in St. Petersburg five years later - and already embarked on their careers. As the director says "they are still learning about life, but this time it's the next step, earning money, having a career and finding an ideal partner for the rest of their life. It's above all though a film about love". Don't let the last sentence put you off though; the reviews thus far have generally been positive.
Erasmus of Rotterdam
It is not entirely clear what the great philosopher, theologian and humanist Erasmus of Rotterdam (1466-1536) would have made of the films. However, given his lifelong contribution to learning we can reasonably assume that he would have supported the programme named in his honour. Erasmus spent his life working and living in different parts of Europe, writing, studying and educating audiences from several countries. He has been described as "intellectual father of the Reformation".
Erasmus today
The present Erasmus programme was launched in 1987 by the EU and since then over 1.2 million students have completed exchange courses at universities outside their own countries. In the 2003/2004 academic year over 135,000 students took part in 2,199 participating universities. The European Union has allocated €950 million for the project for the period 2000 to 2006 to fund the exchanges while national governments, universities themselves and other organisations make up the shortfalls in funding.
The programme has always enjoyed considerable cross party support in the European Parliament. Helga Truepel, a German Green member who is Vice-Chairwoman of the parliament's education committee recently described Erasmus as "one of the most successful programmes the EU has ever launched". She called for it to be extended saying "every student (should have) the opportunity to participate".
In 1995 the programme was merged into the EU's "Socrates" programme that covers education from school to university and beyond. In addition to the Erasmus course, mainly aimed at undergraduates, there are also smaller "Erasmus Mundus" scholarships for students who want to complete a Masters course. For those considering taking advantage of these opportunities and the dedication they require, it may be worth bearing in mind another Erasmus quote "when I get a little money, I buy books; and if any is left I buy food and clothes".
