PM Ahern calls on the EU to look forward
MEPs debated the future of Europe Wednesday with the Taoiseach of Ireland Bertie Ahern. This was the second in a series of debates Parliament is organising with EU national leaders as part of the period of reflection following the "no" votes on the proposed EU constitution in France and the Netherlands. EU-Russia relations were also discussed, following last week’s EU-Russia summit.
Of the 25 EU countries, 18 have ratified the Constitution, but it has been stalled by the no votes in France and the Netherlands. The debate focused on the reasons for the rejection and the way forward. Mr Ahern said, "It’s important to remember that the Constitutional Treaty was agreed because it was necessary...We need its more coherent external policy to meet our growing international responsibilities."
Constitution: dead text or realistic project?
Many MEPs agreed with the Irish prime minister on the need to move forward without changing the overall balance of the treaty on the Constitution, however some said it was time to leave the constitution project behind and concentrate on more practical issues. Some MEPs said the constitutional crisis represented a failure by EU leaders to respond to citizens' concerns and many called for better communication. See the link below for full details of all the main speeches in the debate.
On 4 and 5 December, in the European Parliament, MEPs and national parliamentarians will hold a joint conference on the future of Europe.
The EU-Russia Summit
Commenting on the 24 November EU-Russia summit in Helsinki, MEPs said that while cooperation is important for the security and prosperity of both sides, there must be balance and no trade off on fundamental rights. They also said there should be EU solidarity in dealing with Russia. There will be a vote on the results of the summit in the December plenary session.
