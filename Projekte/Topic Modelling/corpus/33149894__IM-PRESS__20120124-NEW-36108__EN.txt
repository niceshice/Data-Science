Parliament to react to EU summit decisions
2012-01-30 - 12:16
MEPs will state their views on key issues at the 30 January informal European Council, including any decision on fiscal union, in a debate on Wednesday. They will also set out a way forward to boost growth and employment, in a resolution to be voted on Thursday. In a debate in Parliament last week, fiscal union drafting group members Elmar Brok (EPP, DE), Roberto Gualtieri (S&D, IT) and Guy Verhofstadt (ALDE, BE), said that what the draft agreement lacked most is "a clear reference to growth".

Repressive regimes: no EU stash for ill-gotten cash
2012-01-30 - 12:16
EU Member States should consolidate and harmonise their measures to prevent repressive regimes from stashing cash, owning property, doing business or travelling in the EU, Parliament will say in a resolution to be voted on Thursday. For many authoritarian leaders, not least in the Middle East, the EU has been an attractive place to stash "often dubiously acquired wealth", notes the draft, prepared by Graham Watson (ALDE, UK).

MEPs set to criticize EU humanitarian aid management
2012-01-30 - 12:16
Parliament is set to ask some tough questions about how the EU manages its humanitarian aid budget and how EU aid is channelled through the UN. The critical draft resolution to be put to a vote on Thursday was unanimously approved by the Budgetary Control Committee. Members would like to see more efficiency and less bureaucracy in aid management, but also a high level of accountability and transparency. They want the Commission to assess the reliability of potential partner organisations more thoroughly, too.
The draft also highlights weaknesses in the transparency, accountability, efficiency and effectiveness with which EU funds are managed by the UN.

Daphne: funding to fight violence against women and children
2012-01-30 - 12:16
Funding for the next Daphne programme must be kept at a level comparable to that of the previous ones, says a resolution to be voted Thursday. From 2014, Daphne will be incorporated in the new Rights and Citizenship programme, notes the draft, prepared by the Women's Rights and Gender Equality Committee.
Daphne is the only EU programme supporting organisations in all EU Member States, candidate countries, EFTA states and the Western Balkan countries that develop measures to prevent or combat all kinds of violence against women and children.
The first Daphne programme (2000-2003) was renewed twice, in 2004 and 2007. During this time its budget was increased from €20 million to almost €117 million for Daphne III.

Proper waste treatment costs less
2012-01-30 - 12:16
Managing waste badly is expensive, but exporting it costs even more, says a resolution to be voted on Thursday. Environmental, health and economic factors all militate in favour of good waste treatment practices, say MEPs, stressing that Europe's recycling industry has the potential to generate up to half a million jobs. Substantial investments are needed to set up proper waste management facilities, but processing waste efficiently "provides opportunities for both employment and revenue enhancement" whilst ensuring respect for the environment through reuse, recycling and recovery of energy from waste, says the draft resolution.
The draft, prepared by the Petitions Committee, proposes a common EU standard for colour-coding categories of waste for sorting and recycling. This would make it easier for citizens to understand waste processing and would help increase recycling rates, it says.
The Petitions Committee received 114 complaints in 2004-2010 alleging breaches of EU law on waste management. Many of these petitions came from Italy, Greece, France, Spain and Ireland.

Sport: zero tolerance of hooliganism and cheating
2012-01-30 - 12:16
For the first time, Parliament will debate ideas for EU-wide measures to tackle violence in sports stadiums, doping, match-fixing and illegal betting. It is expected to call, in a resolution to be voted on Thursday, for tough penalties on sports-related tax fraud and new rules to govern sports agents. MEPs are set to call for violent fans to be banned from sports stadiums in the EU. An EU data base listing those banned should make it possible to stop them attending international matches in other Member States, says the draft resolution.
Parliament is also likely to call for zero tolerance of all forms of corruption and fraud in sport. Specifically, doping, attempted match-fixing and sports-related tax fraud should be made criminal offences and punished accordingly, adds the text.
The draft advocates creating a non-public EU register of professional agents, which lists the players for whom they work, so as to improve protection for athletes.
Professional agents should be able to prove that they have appropriate qualifications, have their fiscal residence within EU territory and also be subject to an EU licensing system and an EU code of conduct, it says.
