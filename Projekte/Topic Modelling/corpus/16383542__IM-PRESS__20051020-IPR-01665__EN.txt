Boosting EU support for cultural exchange and heritage

The European Parliament is demanding a massive increase in EU funding for cultural exchanges and preserving heritage of European significance. Whereas the Commission had suggested €408 million for the period 2007-13, Parliament asks for €600 million. This call is in line with the demands of the EP's Committee on Culture and Education. For 2000-2006, the EU funding in this field amounts to €236.5 million.
In adopting a co-decision report by Vasco GRAÇA MOURA (EPP-ED, PT) on the Culture 2007 programme in first reading with an overwhelming majority (553 votes in favour, 61 against with 29 abstentions), MEPs emphasise the importance of support for "cultural heritage of European significance - alongside the objectives set out by the Commission (trans-national mobility of cultural players, trans-national circulation of art and intercultural dialogue).
Parliament also wants the programme to:
• strengthen a sense of European citizenship and awareness of a shared cultural heritage;
• promote mutual understanding and tolerance within the EU;
• encourage the cultural awareness and strengthen the synergy between education and culture;
• promote cultural and linguistic diversity.
However, Parliament wants to move the funding for "sites of memory" (Holocaust memorials, former Stalinist camps etc.) from Culture 2007 to the forthcoming Citizens for Europe programme.
Other amendments focus on simplifying the selection criteria and rules governing grants so as to foster participation by smaller and medium-sized projects. For instance, each multi-annual cooperation network eligible for funding should consist of at least six operators from four countries (instead of six as the Commission proposed) participating in the programme. And for shorter projects three operators from three countries are enough, say MEPs.
According to Parliament, Community support may not exceed 70% of any project budget - the Commission proposed a maximum share of 50%. Whereas the Commission's figure assumes 8% would be used for administration, Parliament wants this cut down to 6%. Lastly, MEPs proposed that the name of the programme be changed from Culture 2007 to Culture.
The proposed increase stays in line with the Parliament's position on EU's next long-term budget for 2007-13 which was enshrined in the report by Reimer BÖGE (EPP-ED, DE). Parliament points out that the appropriations indicated in the Commission proposal beyond the year 2006 are subject to the decisions to be taken on the next multi-annual financial framework.
MEP also want to include the countries covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy in accordance with the action plans to be drawn up.
