EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering will announce the adoption of a written declaration on the subtitling of all public-service television programmes in the EU given that over half of all MEPs have signed the written declaration. The declaration Calls on the Commission to put forward a legislative proposal requiring public-service television broadcasters in the EU to subtitle all of their programmes.
The House will then debate the situation in Lebanon . The vote on the resolution will take place during the April Strasbourg plenary (21-24 April).
MEPs will then debate progress made by Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (F YROM) towards EU accession . The Foreign Affairs Committee stresses the need for Croatia to resolve outstanding bilateral border issues, and reiterates that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's bilateral name dispute with Greece should not obstruct FYROM's EU accession process, in two reports, that are generally positive about on the two countries' progress towards EU accession.
Parliament will tackle the issue of combating cancer in the enlarged EU with an oral question to the Commission. The House will vote on a resolution on Thursday (10 April) which calls on the Commission to set up an interinstitutional EU Cancer Task Force to collect and exchange best practice for prevention, screening and treatment and to provide leadership for improved cancer control in Europe.
Elspeth Attwooll (ALDE, UK, Liberal Democrat, Scotland) will be presenting her report on rights-based management tools in fisheries . The rapporteur looks upon both the advantages and disadvantages involved in rights-based management. These vary according both to the nature of the system currently in operation and the ways in which fishing rights are allocated and made transferable/tradable.
The 2009 budget guidelines will also be addressed by MEPs on Wednesday evening. This report refers to the issue of the ceiling of 20% of total EU administrative expenditure (under heading 5 - Administration) voluntarily imposed on itself by the European Parliament, given that the EP's powers and legislative activity will expand if the Lisbon Treaty enters into force.
Thursday 10 April 2008
Thursday session opens at 9am with an oral question to the Commission on the Green Paper on Adapting to climate change in Europe - options for EU action . The House will also vote on a resolution on this topic. The committee regrets that the Commission's Green Paper "does not sufficiently address the need for co-operation on adaptation between the EU and developing countries and highlights in particular the need for technology transfer and capacity building"
MEPs also debate the statute of the European Ombudsman . Proposed changes in the rules governing the European Ombudsman's access to information held by EU bodies and evidence given to him by EU civil servants, are set out in a report, proposed by the Constitutional Affairs Committee, on the Ombudsman's Statute. The key aim of these changes is to boost citizens' confidence in the Ombudsman's work.
Parliament will vote on a resolution on the situation in Tibet following the debate that was held on 26 March in Brussels. EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering has said: "The Dalai Lama has accepted our invitation to address the European Parliament during the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. He is scheduled to do so in December. I hope you will agree that, in view of the events in Tibet, the Dalai Lama is welcome at the European Parliament at any time."
The House will also vote on an extension of a derogation from the rules for the UK and Ireland on animal health requirements applicable to non-commercial movements of pet animals. The committee states that the proposed extension of the transitional period may not be sufficiently long to obtain agreement on a successor regime and a longer one is more appropriate given there is still no proposal on the table and the European Parliament will be dissolved for elections in 2009.
Parliament will also vote on the mobilisation of the European Global Adjustment Fund for Portugal and Malta . The EP Budgets Committee recommends approving the release of aid from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGAF) for Portugal and Malta. The aim is to help 1,549 Portuguese car industry workers and 675 Maltese textile industry workers to retrain. 20080401BRI25389

Combating cancer in the enlarged European Union
2008-04-07 - 09:46
Miroslav OUZKÝ (EPP-ED, CZ) on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to the Commission will be putting questions to the Commission on combating cancer in the enlarged European Union. Cancer is a very complex set of diseases and a major health burden which is set to increase as the European population ages and more and more people survive other diseases. It is accounting for over 1 million deaths in the EU each year.
- When does the Commission plan to follow up on the actions from the Europe against Cancer Programme by adopting a recommendation for a comprehensive cancer control strategy addressing the four basic cancer control factors: prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment and care, including palliative care?
- What are the Commission's plans to propose the setting up of reference networks for rare and difficult-to-treat cancers, supported by Structural Funds and the Community Framework Research Programmes under the patient mobility proposals?
- Given that cancer screening saves lives, what plans does the Commission have to update and strengthen existing screening recommendations?
The draft resolution calls on the Commission to set up an interinstitutional EU Cancer Task Force to collect and exchange best practice for prevention, screening and treatment and to provide leadership for improved cancer control in Europe. The EU Cancer Task Force should in particular promote new measures as well as existing screening projects to help to increase the part of the population taking part in screening measures by at least 50 % in each of the MS by 2018. Furthermore, Initiatives aiming to prevent cancer through the promotion of healthy lifestyles shall be promoted, putting a strong emphasis on children and adolescents.
Better information on screening and cancer treatment are needed
MEPs underline the importance to promote information campaigns on cancer screening and the exchange of best practice on the use of preventive measures. The Council recommendation on cancer screening has to be promoted and implemented effectively. The Commission should increase the information available to patients with cancer by encouraging initiatives which inform patients of their treatment and the ways to access such treatment.
Support for more research and innovation
The Commission shall ensure that community legislation contains incentives for industries and researchers to secure ongoing research and guarantee new evidence-based medicines and treatments to combat and control cancer. Funds within FP7 shall be allocated to encourage research and innovation in the area of primary prevention screening and early detection and of new anti-cancer treatments and medicines.
Charter of Patients rights / Charter for protection of cancer patients in the work place
MEPs encourage Member States to adopt national Charters of Patients rights according to European guidelines. Furthermore they call on the Commission to draw up a charter for the protection of cancer patients and chronically sick people in the workplace. Oral question to the Commission

Animal health requirements: UK and Ireland to get extension for pet passport rules
2008-04-07 - 09:46
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is proposing a report drawn up by Miroslav OUZKY (EPP-ED, CZ) and propose three amendments to the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movements of pet animals as regards the extension of the transitional period: The Regulation introduced, inter alia, the pet passport for cats, dogs and ferrets when being moved from one Member State to another, which provides proof that the animal has been vaccinated against rabies. This is the sole requirement for pets to travel to all Member States.
It extended the transitional period to 30 June 2010 (rather than 31 August 2009) for the entry of the pet animals listed in Part A of Annex I into the territory of Ireland , Malta, Sweden and the United Kingdom , which will thereafter be subject to certain requirements;
Until 30 June 2010, Finland, Ireland, Malta, Sweden and the United Kingdom, as regards echinococcosis, and Ireland Malta and the United Kingdom, as regards ticks, may make the entry of pet animals into their territory subject to compliance with the special rules in place on the date on which this Regulation comes into force. This amendment aims at completing the list of countries applying already special requirements concerning ticks with Malta. By mistake in the Commission proposal the name of Malta had not been mentioned amongst those Member States having already a special regime in place regarding anti-tick treatment.
The committee states that the proposed extension of the transitional period may not be sufficiently long to obtain agreement on a successor regime and a longer one is more appropriate given there is still no proposal on the table and the European Parliament will be dissolved for elections in 2009.
The third amendment replaces the date 1 January 2008 by the date 1 July 2010 for the same reason. Rapporteur Miroslav OUZKÝ EPP-ED CZ A6-0051/2008 Animal-health requirements: non commercial movement of pet animals, extension of the transitional period (amend. Regulation (EC) No 998/2003) Procedure : Codecision (1st reading)

Green Paper on 'Adapting to climate change in Europe - options for EU action'
2008-04-07 - 09:46
Guido SACCONI (PES, IT) on behalf of the Temporary Committee on Climate Change will be asking the Commission what actions and initiatives aiming at adapting to climate change does the Commission intend to adopt at EU level and in its external relations policy to respond to the conclusions of Working Group II of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report anticipating negative effects by current and future impacts of climate change? The House will also vote on a resolution on this topic. The draft resolution calls on the Commission to carry out "a study on the economics of adaptation", including a balance sheet of costs and benefits. It also asks the Commission "to consider including financial measures for adaptation in the next long term financial perspectives for regional policies and structural funds."
Development aid and technology transfer
The committee regrets that the Commission's Green Paper "does not sufficiently address the need for co-operation on adaptation between the EU and developing countries; highlights in particular the need for technology transfer and capacity building"
The EU, MEPs in the committee argue, "has to undertake substantial efforts to increase technological development in adaptation" and to ensure the transfer of such technologies to the developing world. The Conference of the Parties in Poznan (COP 14) in December 2008, MEPs demand, should focus on this issue.
The draft resolution recognises "a conditional link" between development goals and mitigation and adaptation. "Climate change", it says, "must be mainstreamed into all EU development co-operation".
Water
The committee says "gradual adaptation of the farming sector to the new needs raised by climate change" should also be examined. MEPs say that the farming sector can adapt to climate change through legislation that "reinforces sustainability and promotes new ways to use and manage water"
The draft resolution stresses the importance of an increased need for rational use of water by means of a ‘water demand management'. It calls on the Commission and Member States to promote "pilot projects which will help to reduce drought damage and flooding risks" Guido SACCONI PES IT Oral Question The Green Paper on 'Adapting to climate change in Europe - options for EU action' (COM(2007)0354) Oral question to the Commission

Mid-term review of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme
2008-04-07 - 09:46
Riitta MYLLER (PES, FI) for the Environment Committee will be tabling an own-initiative report on Mid-term review of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme. The Environment Committee considers it regrettable that the mid-term review of the Sixth Environment Action Programme has been delayed by almost a year and deplores the fact that, on the whole, the European Union is not on schedule with the implementation of the measures planned in the Action Programme, contrary to what the Commission claims in its own mid-term review.
Targets
The committee calls on the Commission to intensify its efforts to achieve the 20% target for renewables and the 10% target for biofuel consumption. The report stresses that the sustainability mechanism, which is at the development stage, should apply the most stringent sustainability criteria to biofuels imported from third countries.
Climate diplomacy
The committee stresses that ‘climate diplomacy’ should be promoted with greater intensity and consistency in the EU’s trade relations with states which are not bound by multilateral environmental protection agreements, such as the United States, China and India, which, for various reasons, are not implementing the Kyoto Protocol.
Emissions trading system not working
The committee is of the opinion that the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) has so far not led to reductions in CO2 emissions because of the overly generous allocation of emission allowances; points out that the EU has committed itself to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by at least 20% by 2020.

Situation in Tibet - MEPs to vote on a resolution
2008-04-07 - 09:46
The European Parliament will vote (10 April) on a resolution on the situation in Tibet following the debate held in Brussels on 26 March. European Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering said: "The European Parliament has for many years resolutely maintained that human rights must be respected in Tibet". "In numerous resolutions we have called for a constructive dialogue between the Chinese leadership and the Dalai Lama and for the human rights of the Tibetan people to be respected.
In this we are guided by our principles and our values, which include fundamental human rights: the dignity of the individual and people's right to assert their cultural and religious identity for themselves and for their ethnic community.
The events which have occurred in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and in other Chinese cities since 10 March this year are extremely worrying. We condemn all forms of violence and the disproportionate use of military and police resources. We condemn the death of peaceful people.
We express our solidarity with the Dalai Lama, a man devoted to peace, negotiation and conciliation. We cannot accept attempts to tar the Dalai Lama with any association with terrorism. We must not allow the Dalai Lama to be demonised. Speaking personally, whenever I have met the Dalai Lama I have always had the impression that he is deeply committed to peace, reconciliation and human rights. I trust the Dalai Lama and I should like to express my esteem and respect for him. I therefore call upon decision-makers in Beijing to negotiate with the Dalai Lama and, without prejudice to the territorial unity of China, seek a consensus which respects and guarantees the cultural and religious identity of the Tibetan people.
The Dalai Lama has accepted our invitation to address the European Parliament during the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. He is scheduled to do so in December. I hope you will agree that, in view of the events in Tibet, the Dalai Lama is welcome at the European Parliament at any time.
Dialogue and cooperation between the European Union and China are in our mutual interest. China is a great nation, with which we wish to cooperate in partnership.
In a few months' time, China will be hosting the Olympic Games. We hope that the Games will be a success. However, there are preconditions for this: respect for the cultural and religious identity of the Tibetan people and free and fair reporting before and during the Games. The fact that journalists and correspondents have been expelled from Tibet must therefore be condemned.
Every responsible politician must ask himself whether he can participate in the opening ceremony if the Chinese leadership does not seek dialogue and conciliation.
We wish to contribute to an outcome whereby the world's athletes can meet in fair and free competitions in Beijing. But our values and our self-respect will not allow us to surrender our principles. We in the European Parliament have a special responsibility in this regard." Vote : 10.04.08 MEPs debate the situation in Tibet - 26 March 2008

Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: progress towards EU
2008-04-07 - 09:46
The Foreign Affairs Committee stresses the need for Croatia to resolve outstanding bilateral border issues, and reiterates that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's bilateral name dispute with Greece should not obstruct FYROM's EU accession process, in two reports, that are generally positive about on the two countries' progress towards EU accession. The report by Hannes Swoboda (PES, AT) on Croatia “congratulates the Croatian authorities on the positive results achieved so far, particularly with regard to the number of negotiation chapters which have been opened.” It urges the government to “redouble its efforts to meet the benchmarks for the remaining chapters,” while also reminding the authorities that “it is now crucial to speed up the development of administrative capacity required in order to implement the new legislation.” MEPs in the committee commend Croatia for its “exemplary Constitutional Law on National Minorities.”
MEPs in the committee also address the Commission, calling on it to “step up its efforts and increase the resources allocated for preparing, processing and finalising negotiating material so that the EU can respond rapidly and efficiently to progress made by Croatia in meeting the relevant opening and closing benchmarks.” The committee expressed its hopes that “increased efforts on the part of Croatia and enhanced support by the EU institutions can still lead to the finalization of an accession treaty in time for the European Parliament to take its final decision on the EU-membership of Croatia before the next European elections in June 2009, so as to start the ratification process as early as possible.”
Remaining concerns for Croatia
Members in the committee express their concerns about the further need to improve the judiciary in the country, as well as efforts to eradicate the “in some cases unacceptably high level of corruption, which undermines the economic development of the country.” While welcoming the fact that “Croatia continues to fully cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY),”, they called on Croatia to involve media and civil society in maintaining popular support for the court after the negative impact on public opinion of some of its rulings.
Another concern remains the country’s outstanding border issues with its neighbours, especially Slovenia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. In a similar vein, the committee “regrets the fact that the Croatian Parliament decided to introduce unilaterally the Ecological and Fishing Protection Zone (ZERP) in the Adriatic, despite the agreement reached with Italy, Slovenia and the European Commission.” At the same time, MEPs state that the accession negotiations “should not be used as a leverage to settle bilateral political disputes falling outside the scope of the acquis.”
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
The report by Erik Meijer (GUE/NGL, NL) on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia welcomes the government's achievements “in the implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement”, which deals with the political aspects of inter-ethnic relations in the country, while noting the “continuing discrimination against the Roma community.” The committee also welcomes the fact that the government has pledged to rebuild the mosque that was damaged in the otherwise “professional and effective” police operation in Brodec on 7 November, 2007. MEPs in the committee also commend the government’s economic performance, and the adoption of several crucial laws on prosecutors.
While welcoming the entry into force of the visa facilitation and readmission agreement between the country and the EU, MEPs in the committee underline the difficulties citizens still face when trying to enter the EU. At the same time, Members regret the signing of a bilateral immunity agreement between the US and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, granting exemption from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court in the Hague, which “contradicts EU standards and policies.”
Name dispute
On the consistently contentious issue of the country’s bilateral name-dispute with Greece, the report welcomes the bilateral talks held between the two sides, assisted by UN Special Envoy Matthew Nimitz. It “calls on both sides to increase efforts to overcome the issue, that in no circumstances should become an obstacle to the membership of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in international organisations.” Rapporteur Hannes SWOBODA PES AT Rapporteur Erik MEIJER GUE/NGL NL A6-0048/2008 Croatia's 2007 progress report A6-0059/2008 2007 Progress Report on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Procedure : own-initiative

MEPs to debate the situation in Lebanon
2008-04-07 - 09:46
The House will debate the situation in Lebanon following statements from the Commission and the Council. The vote on the resolution will take place during the April Strasbourg plenary (21-24 April). On 14 March, the Slovenian Presidency made the following statement on Lebanon:
"The EU continues to stand by its strong support for the Government and institutions of Lebanon in carrying out their missions in order to preserve Lebanon’s stability, sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. The EU expresses concern about the ongoing political deadlock in Lebanon and deterioration of the security situation.
The EU reiterates its strong support for the plan unanimously adopted by the Arab foreign ministers in seeking to broker a resolution to the political crisis and commends the continued efforts by the Arab League Secretary General, Amr Moussa. It urges the parties in Lebanon to proceed, as a first step to the immediate holding of the Presidential election prior to the Arab Summit. The success of the plan requires all actors to play a constructive role. The EU recalls that EU High Representative has been designated to spearhead the EU efforts with Arab countries in this respect."

Support for research and development performing SMEs
2008-04-07 - 09:46
Research and development performing SMEs shall receive transparent and non-bureaucratic support for their research activities, say MEPs in the committee. The Industry Committee proposes a report on an amended proposal to co-finance the EUROSTARS research funding programme for R&amp;D-driven SMEs to the tune of €100 million from Community funds. There is now a first-reading deal with the Council. EUROSTARS will primarily fund research and development activities driven by one or more SMEs. The programme was set up by the EUREKA intergovernmental network for industrial research last year. The EU's Seventh Research Framework Programme (FP7) is to co-finance it to the tune of €100 million, and the 22 participating EU Member States and five Associated Countries will jointly provide another €300 million. MEPs laid down that financial support shall be paid as a lump sum or, if such a payment is not compatible with the rules of the national programme, as a flat rate payment - that is as a fixed percentage of the project's direct costs.
All participating countries together have to contribute at least € 300 million.
Transparent and non-bureaucratic payments
The Industry Committee recommends that within each project the selected R&D performing SMEs should collectively execute at least 50 % of the overall R&D activities. The Commission, in contrast, wanted to make it obligatory for SMEs to contribute at least 50 % of the costs related to R&D within a project. However, MEPs reason that too many R&D performing SMEs would be excluded with a fixed limit of 50 % contribution.
MEPs in the committee stress that granting financial support and its payment should be transparent and non-bureaucratic. The monitoring of the programme's implementation "must not impose an unnecessary burden on small and medium-sized enterprises" either, says the amended proposal.
Use of Community logo and database with results
Committee members also say that measures should be taken "to give recognition to the Community contribution... both in the programme generally and in individual projects". Thus the Community logo shall, for example, be used in all published material relating to EUROSTARS.
Finally, MEPs in the committee ask the Commission to set up a database containing the results of the projects. This information should be made available for a period of at least two years.

Research Fund for Coal and Steel
2008-04-07 - 09:46
Adam GIEREK (PES, PL) for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy will be tabling a non-binding report on the Research Fund for Coal and Steel. The Report amends the research objectives for steel and gives preference for projects promoting more efficient, economic and reliable technologies. The Research Fund for Coal and Steel provides funding for research in areas related to the coal and steel industry, including production processes, the utilisation and conservation of resources, environmental improvements and work safety. The budget for the Research Fund comes from the interest generated by the capital remaining after the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty expired in 2002.
Five years after its establishment, the Research Fund was reviewed by the European Commission with the aim of maintaining the established procedures which have proved to be effective, while making a limited number of necessary adjustments and administrative simplifications.
With this aim in mind, Mr Gierek proposes that the European Commission's definition of 'coal' be amended and that the research objectives for steel be broadened.
He also proposes that the projects should promote more efficient coal conversion techniques which could benefit the environment and should make coal more competitive on local energy markets.
Concerning the composition of the independent Coal and Steel Advisory Groups, Mr Gierek proposes that a balanced range of expertise and the broadest possible geographical and geo-economic representation be ensured by the European Commission, with special reference to the Member States which joined the EU in 2004.

MEPs call for sharper focus on jobs and growth potential of cultural industries
2008-04-07 - 09:46
A new task force on culture and the creative economy, a programme to support the culture industries, less VAT and a sharper focus on training and mobility are proposed in an own-initiative report by Guy Bono (PES, FR) for the Committee on the cultural industries' potential to contribute to the Lisbon growth and jobs strategy . Cultural industries account for 2.6 % of the EU GDP (2003) and over five million Europeans work in the sector (2004). The cultural sector is growing faster than others, and thus has an important role in attaining the Lisbon strategy growth and jobs targets, says the report.
In the report MEPs in the committee welcome the readiness of the Commission and Council to acknowledge the central role of culture and creativity in promoting European citizenship and bringing the arts closer to the European public, as well as achieving the Lisbon strategy aims.
More support needed
MEPs in the committee make concrete proposals to the Commission and Member States, including setting up a task force on culture and the creative economy to look more closely into the relationship between culture, creativity and innovation in the EU policies.
They stress that adequate funding for the creative industries and communities is essential, and recommend mixed methods of funding and promoting a regulatory and fiscal framework that favours the cultural industries, specifically tax credits and reduced rates of VAT for all cultural products, including on-line works.
MEPs in the committee also ask the Commission to consider setting up a MEDIA- like programme that could support digital libraries, music, theatre and publishing, as well as the transnational distribution of works.
Intellectual property: consumers should not be criminalised
MEPs in the committee urge the Commission to rethink the issue of intellectual property in order to assure solutions that are equitable for both big and small actors and strike a balance between the respect of intellectual property and the access to cultural events and content. The committee underlines that on the battle against digital piracy, the solution should not be to criminalise consumers who do not intend to make profit out of their actions. Furthermore, MEPs in the committee suggest campaigns to educate consumers and raise awareness of their responsibilities.
Mobility and qualifications
The committee also highlights the importance of cross-border mobility, especially for artists, and the need for better statistics to enable countries to learn from each other and formulate policies. MEPs in the committee stress the need to improve qualifications, apprenticeship and training systems, and provide students in the arts with training that will better prepare them better for professional life and encourage synergies between businesses and schools.
Finally, the committee suggests that culture should be better integrated in the Union's external policies.
Figures on cultural industry
- The sector turned over more than 654 billions Euros in 2003.
- The sector contributed to 2.6% of EU GDP in 2003. In the UK, 3% and Ireland 1.7%
- The overall growth of the sector's value added was 19.7% in 1999-2003.
- In 2004, at least 5.8 million people worked in the sector, equivalent to 3.1% of total employed population in Europe. Rapporteur Guy BONO PES FR A6-0063/2008 Cultural industries in Europe Procedure : own-initiative

Culture
Sharper focus needed on European cultural heritage
2008-04-07 - 09:46
The cultural sector in Europe plays an important role in attaining the objectives of the renewed Lisbon strategy, but more should be done to ensure that EU programmes reflect Europe's common cultural heritage, says the Culture Committee in a report. If Europe is placed in the vanguard of all the continents it is because of its cultural heritage, says the report, drafted by Vasco GRAÇA MOURA (EPP-ED, PT). Europe's cultural richness adds genuine value and has an identity-giving role that is vital for Europe and the EU, the MEPs in the committee point out, welcoming the Commission communication on a European agenda for culture in a globalising world from 2007.
"European Heritage" label
Although EU programmes in the cultural sector will contribute to cohesion, real convergence, economic growth, sustainable development, innovation employment and competitiveness, MEPs in the committee believe that the existing programmes do not fully reflect the implications of the European's common cultural heritage. The committee therefore calls on the Commission to propose specific programmes to preserve Europe's cultural heritage, as well as a "European Heritage" label, to emphasise the European dimension of cultural goods, monuments, memorial sites and places of remembrance.
Identify threatened sectors
MEPs in the committee also want the Commission to identify threatened sectors such as the publishing sector, where they say high-quality writing is threatened by best-sellers, and the music sector which they say is threatened by digitisation and piracy. Members therefore call on the Commission to do what is necessary to enforce and protect literary and artistic property rights, especially in the digital environment.
Finally, the committee recommends that to promote European cultural values, the Commission and Member States should start organising a European Year to commemorate significant European personalities and suggests that 2010 should be made a European Year to celebrate the composer Chopin, and that 2011 should be made a European Year of Greek and Latin Classics.

Written declaration on subtitling all public-service TV programmes to be adopted
2008-04-07 - 09:46
EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering will announce the adoption of a written declaration on the subtitling of all public-service television programmes in the EU given that over half of all MEPs have signed the written declaration. The declaration Calls on the Commission to put forward a legislative proposal requiring public-service television broadcasters in the EU to subtitle all of their programmes. MEPs consider subtitling of all public-service television programmes in the EU to be essential with a view to ensuring that all viewers, including deaf and hard-of-hearing persons, have full access to them; takes the view that this would also help with foreign-language learning.
The written declaration was put forward by Lidia Joanna GERINGER DE OEDENBERG (PES, PL)and currently 427 (out of 785) have signed it.
MEPs point out that partial or complete loss of hearing is a condition that affects more than 83 million people in the European Union and given the ageing of the European population, this problem will continue to grow.
The declaration points out that universal access to television in Europe and to the fact that public-service television has a public-service mission consisting of, among other things, informing and educating viewers,
Finally, MEP recall that today's technology enables television programmes (including live programmes) to be subtitled as they go out, one example of this being the BBC, which has undertaken to subtitle all of its programmes from April 2008.

Fisheries
Simplification of the authorisation of fishing activities
2008-04-07 - 09:46
The Fisheries Committee is putting forward a report with several amendments, under consultation, to a proposal for a regulation concerning authorisations for fishing activities of Community fishing vessels outside Community waters and the access of third country vessels to Community waters. The amendments aim to clarify the scope of the regulation, the definitions of serious infringements and the IUU list, and that the regulation does not apply to overseas territories of EU Member States. The rapporteur, Catherine STIHLER (PES, UK), voted against the content of the report as adopted in committee and decided to withdraw her name from the report.
Existing provisions relating to the authorisation of fishing activities of Community fishing vessels outside Community waters are currently laid down in several different legal texts. The purpose of this proposal is to simplify and improve the procedures related to the management of fishing authorisations. It intends to do so by setting up general rules and conditions that can be applied to all requests for authorisation. It proposes a single procedure for the management of all fishing authorisations and fixes the general division of responsibility between the Commission and the Member States.
New eligibility criteria, sanctions and reporting provisions are also being proposed. For example, vessels failing to comply with EU provisions in the previous year will not receive any authorisations. Compliance with international obligations under the various Agreements is strengthened by introducing measures that oblige the Member States to prohibit a vessel from fishing if it has been involved in a serious infringement or in cases where it has been placed on an IUU list. Rapporteur Philippe MORILLON ALDE FR A6-0072/2008 Fisheries: authorisations for fishing activities of Community fishing vessels outside Community waters and access of third country vessels to Community waters (amend.

Fisheries
Rights-based management tools in fisheries
2008-04-07 - 09:46
The report on rights-based management tools in fisheries, by Elspeth ATTWOOLL (ALDE, UK). The rapporteur looks upon both the advantages and disadvantages involved in rights-based management. These vary according both to the nature of the system currently in operation and the ways in which fishing rights are allocated and made transferable/tradable. MEPs welcome the fact that the Commission has opened a debate on Rights-Based Management (RBM) in fisheries in anticipation of the necessary modification of the existing management policy and that it has put out a call for tender to allow for a full study of the various management systems.
The Fisheries Committee recognises, however, even in advance of such a study, that "it is evident that there is a wide variety of such systems in place and that most, if not all, employ some form of RBM, if this is taken in its widest sense". It recognises, likewise, that "experiments with management through fishing rights in Member States which have applied such systems have had very positive consequences in many respects", for example in terms of capacity reduction.
At Community level and within at least some of the Member States, the forms of RBM employed are hybrid ones, in terms both of the allocation and transferability/tradability of the rights and of the way in which their extent is defined. The report notes the "degree of complexity involved and the difficulties this poses for movement toward a single system", whether achieved through harmonising the practices of Member States or by its administration at Community level.
Concerns that must be addressed prior to any move toward a single system
MEPs share the concerns of many stakeholders and consider it necessary to ascertain the effects which changes, particularly the introduction of Community-wide Individual Transferable Quotas and other rights-based access, might have in relation to the degree of concentration of ownership of such rights and the resulting socioeconomic consequences; advantages that could accrue to large companies at the expense of small-scale operators or community-based fisheries; the fear that additional costs may be involved, providing disincentives towards investment in vessels, gear, safety and working conditions; the likelihood of quotas being held at one remove from those actively engaged in fishing; the problems inherent in achieving an initial allocation and in conferring a windfall benefit on those to whom the allocation is made; the risk of an excessive concentration of rights.
"These concerns must be addressed prior to any move toward a single system, for example, the possibility, as shown by existing precedents, of setting a limit on the accumulation of fishing rights", concludes the Fisheries Committee.

Ombudsman
Clearer rules on European Ombudsman's access to information
2008-04-07 - 09:46
Proposed changes in the rules governing the European Ombudsman's access to information held by EU bodies and evidence given to him by EU civil servants, are set out in a report, proposed by the Constitutional Affairs Committee, on the Ombudsman's Statute. The key aim of these changes is to boost citizens' confidence in the Ombudsman's work. Changes in the Ombudsman's statute were requested by the Ombudsman himself, Mr Diamandouros , in a letter sent to EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering in July 2006.
Clearer rules on access to confidential documents
Committee members propose an amendment to a provision that obliges all EU institutions and bodies to provide the Ombudsman with the information he requests. This amendment deletes the current caveat that information may be refused on grounds of secrecy, which Members felt that citizens could interpret as restricting the Ombudsman's right to acquire information.
The new text spells out the rules on the handling of classified information obtained by the Ombudsman and his staff in the course of their inquiries. The report says that they would be required not to divulge any sensitive information or any document falling under the scope of the Community legislation regarding the protection of personal data.
Officials bound to testify
Committee members also agreed to change the rule on the testimony of EU officials. The approved text deletes a requirement that Community civil servants must testify "in accordance with the instructions from their administrations". Again, the committee felt that this wording might mislead citizens into thinking that officials are not always required to tell the truth.
The report setting out amendments to the statute of the European Ombudsman and his staff is drafted by Anneli JÄÄTTEENMÄKI (ALDE, FI).
After the plenary vote in Parliament, the agreement of the Council is also needed for the changes to enter into force. Rapporteur Anneli JÄÄTTEENMÄKI ALDE FI A6-0076/2008 Statute of the European Ombudsman Debate : 10.04.08 The European Ombudsman - homepage

Written declaration on the murder of the human rights activist Munir Said Thalib to be adopted
2008-04-07 - 09:46
EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering will announce the adoption of a written declaration on the murder of the human rights activist Munir Said Thalib given over half of all MEPs have signed it. The declaration calls on the Indonesian authorities to take all necessary action to ensure that those responsible for the murder at all levels are brought to trial and justice is delivered as quickly as possible. In September 2004 leading Indonesian human rights activist Munir Said Thalib, founder of human rights organisations, died from arsenic poisoning on Garuda flight GA974 from Singapore to Amsterdam. The report by an independent fact-finding team into the Munir case, ordered by the Indonesian President, has never been made public. The only person to have been prosecuted in connection with the case, former Garuda co-pilot Pollycarpus Budihari Priyanto, had his conviction overturned by the Indonesian Supreme Court in October 2006.
The written declaration calls on the Commission and the Council to monitor the investigation into the murder of Munir, including the ongoing trials of former Garuda executives Indra Setiawan and Rohainil Aini, as well as the case review of the Supreme Court’s decision in the Pollycarpus case.
The written declaration was put forward by Raül Romeva i Rueda, Eija-Riitta Korhola, Jules Maaten and Glyn Ford and so far 412 out of 785 MEPs have signed it.

Budget
Expenditure of the Institutions
2008-04-07 - 09:46
A report by Janusz Lewandowski (EPP-ED, PL) deals with the guidelines that MEPs would like to establish for the expenditure of the EU institutions other than the Commission in 2009, including the EP. This report refers to the issue of the ceiling of 20% of total EU administrative expenditure (under heading 5 - Administration) voluntarily imposed on itself by the European Parliament, given that the EP's powers and legislative activity will expand if the Lisbon Treaty enters into force. The new Members' statute (which will require Parliament to pay most of MEPs' pay and allowances) and the 2009 elections will also have an impact on the EP's budget. But MEPs believe it will be possible to meet these needs without going over the 20% limit.
Among the priorities for Parliament’s budget, as for the previous year, are the EP’s communication and information policies, notable three major projects which should be operational in 2009: a visitors’ centre, an audiovisual media centre and the web TV project. MEPs in the committee also want to see the rapid adoption of a statute for MEPs’ assistants .
On assistants , the committee calls on the working group set up within the Bureau to put forward, together with the competent Commission services, proposals relating to a statute for Members' assistants to be forwarded as a matter of urgency to the Council for adoption under the French presidency so that it can become applicable on the same day as the new Members' Statute. The committee believes that this proposed statute would ensure equal treatment of Members' assistants that is also transparent, and help ensure that tax and social obligations, such as salaries and social security rights, are fulfilled. The report welcomes the decision of the Bureau of 10 March 2008 on Members' parliamentary assistance, as a first step towards complying with the request expressed in its resolution of 25 October 2007 on the draft general budget for 2008. The report calls on the Bureau and its Secretary General to report on the progress on the matter in due time before the first reading.
MEPs also stress environmental matters as a key element of managing Parliament as an organisation, notably when it comes to buildings. They want to see the use of environmentally friendly vehicles and solar panels on roofs of EP buildings, among other points.
This report constitutes the first outline from the Budgets Committee, the estimates of Parliament's Bureau and the other institutions not being known as yet. Rapporteur Janusz LEWANDOWSKI EPP-ED PL A6-0082/2008 2009 budget: guidelines, other sections Debate : 09.04.08

Budget
Funding from globalisation fund for Portugal and Malta
2008-04-07 - 09:46
The EP Budgets Committee recommends approving the release of aid from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGAF) for Portugal and Malta. The aim is to help 1,549 Portuguese car industry workers and 675 Maltese textile industry workers to retrain. Portugal and Malta applied last year for aid from the EGAF, which was set up in 2006 to counter the adverse effects of globalisation. In December the European Commission approved these two applications on the technical level but the budgetary authority (Parliament and Council) still had to decide whether the use of the fund was justified and whether the total requested sum of €3 106 882 should be released.
Now the Budgets Committee - after consulting the Employment Committee - has adopted its position on the basis of two reports. The first, by Reimer Böge (EPP-ED,DE) deals with mobilisation of the fund as such, while the second, by Kyösti Virrankoski (ALDE, FI) deals with the adjustment needed to the 2008 budget in order to fund the aid to these countries.
Retraining of Maltese textile workers
MEPs in the committee welcome the application by Malta for €681 207 to fund an assistance plan for textile workers who had lost their jobs following the unexpected closure of two companies, VF Ltd. and Bortex Clothing. The total cost of the plan to reintegrate the redundant workers on the labour market is put at €1.3 million by the Maltese authorities.
This is the first time EGAF money has been used for one of the countries that joined the EU since 2004. It is also the first time that a special clause in the regulation governing the fund, relating to smaller markets, has been used. The 675 redundancies account for 0.4% of the working population of this country of 402 000 inhabitants.
Over €2.4 million for Portuguese automobile workers
The Budgets Committee also recommends giving the go-ahead to the transfer of €2 425 675 to retrain 1549 Portuguese workers laid off by three automobile companies (Alcoa Fujikura, Johnson Controls and a factory belonging to Opel Portugal). The plan of the Portuguese authorities, expected to cost a total of €4.8 million, provides for vocational retraining, aid for entrepreneurship and certification of the employees' qualifications.
MEPs ask for more detail
During a debate in the budgets and employment committees on 10 March, some MEPs expressed reservations about the scale of the administrative costs, which represent 10% of the total sum requested by the Maltese authorities. Some MEPs in the committee, notably from the Greens/EFA group, also voiced concern about the structure of the Portuguese plan, arguing that to grant a subsidy that which was largely equivalent to salary compensation was in breach of the regulation and could set a dangerous precedent.
In the end, however, the Budgets Committee decided that the use of the EGAF was justified in both cases. MEPs in the committee nevertheless propose an amendment expressing concern about the measures used to reduce the number of people left without a job and needing support from the fund. They ask the Commission and the Portuguese authorities to ensure that the principle of not using the Fund for salary compensation is respected.
The EGAF, which was designed to help workers who lose their jobs following shifts in world trade patterns, came into operation in 2007. Three Member States have received funding from it so far: France, Germany and Finland. Further applications made by Italy, Portugal and Spain are in the pipeline.
