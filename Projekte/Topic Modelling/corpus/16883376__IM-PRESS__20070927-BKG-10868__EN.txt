2007-10-01 - 21:37
Constructing Europe is also about supporting cultural diversity and the creative arts. At the moment when the European Union is celebrating its founding texts and is in the process of drafting an new treaty, the European Parliament has decided to create the LUX Prize (light).
The objective of the LUX Prize is to illuminate the public debate on European integration and to facilitate the diffusion of European films in the European Union. The LUX Prize will finance the subtitling and the kinescope recording of the winning film in the 23 official EU languages. The original language recording will be adapted for sub-titling for hard of hearing and deaf people. Here are the three films in competition, selected by a 17 member jury composed mainly of people working in the cinematic professions: - Auf der anderen Seite (The Edge of Heaven), by Fatih Akin - 4 luni, 3 saptamini si 2 zile (4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days), by Cristian Mungiu - Belle toujours , by Manoel de Oliveira Each film will be shown 9 times, from 1 October to 18 October 2007, within the European Parliament in Brussels. A 90 seat cinema room has been especially conceived and built for this purpose The screenings are free, and priority goes to MEPs, if there is room available, it is open to all other people who enjoy cinema and have access to the European Parliament. Only MEPs who have seen all three films during the screenings or extra muros, will be able to exercise their right to vote. The film which gains the highest number of votes will be the winner. The LUX Prize will be awarded by the European Parliament President, Hans-Gert Pöttering in Strasbourg (France), during its plenary session on 24 October. A trophy, inspired by a representation of the Tower of Babel which forms the LUX Prize's visual identity, will be given to the laureate.

The LUX Prize – an expression of the European Parliament’s commitment to culture
The European Parliament and cultural diversity
The European Parliament is a champion – and a symbol – of cultural diversity. Its very make-up reflects Europe’s multiplicity of cultures and languages. With 785 seats, the European Parliament is the world’s largest international parliamentary body. It is also the most diverse: its Members represent the people of the European Union’s 27 Member States; 23 languages are spoken in the Parliament, not to mention the regional and minority languages of the Union. The Parliament, whose legislative powers are steadily increasing, shares the Union’s motto, ‘Unity in Diversity’ . Intercultural dialogue and freedom of thought, which have inspired and underpinned the history of European cinema, are two of its most cherished causes.
Cinema at the heart of cultural exception
Cinema lies at the heart of the European cultural model. It is emblematic of the cultural exception dispute between the European Union and the United States. Cinema is also a medium that is accessible to a very large number of people of all ages. Marrying sound and image, it has always been a medium that appeals to the individual at an emotional rather than a cognitive level. At a time when text as a medium is at a crossroads, cinema is the ideal vehicle for communication – or reflection – on Europe and its future. Audio, 30:03
The aims of the LUX Prize
Shedding a different light on the future of Europe
One of the main criteria in selecting the films short-listed for the LUX Prize has been their success in showing the process of building Europe in a different light. As the European Union works on a new treaty, the artistic and narrative quality of the winning film will give the audience a glimpse of a submerged dimension of the European venture – the individual, perhaps the intimate, dimension.
Facilitating circulation of European films
Breaking through the language barrier that prevents films from moving around the European Union is the other major objective of the LUX Prize. It will give a powerful circulation boost to a cinematic work within the common market and will ultimately add to Europe’s cinematographic and cultural wealth.

Synopsis
Despite the misgivings of his son Nejat, Ali, a widower, decides to move in with Yeter, a prostitute who shares his Turkish origin. Nejat, a young German teacher, soon warms to Yeter when he realises that she sends most of what she earns to her daughter in Turkey to pay for her university education.
Yeter’s accidental death drives a wedge between father and son. Nejat goes to Istanbul to search for Ayten, Yeter’s daughter. He is unaware that Ayten, a 20-year-old political activist, has fled to Germany to escape the Turkish police.
In Hamburg Ayten becomes friendly with Lotte, a German student, who is quickly won over by the young Turkish woman’s charm and political commitment. Lotte even invites Ayten to stay in her home, despite the qualms of her mother Susanne. Ayten is arrested and put in detention, and ultimately deported to Turkey, where she is sent to prison.
Lotte decides on the spur of the moment to drop everything and go to Turkey, where she runs into a brick wall of bureaucracy, with all her efforts to secure Ayten’s release seemingly doomed to failure. She happens to meet Nejat and they become flat-mates. A tragic event prompts Susanne to travel to Istanbul to continue her daughter’s quest. As he grows closer to Susanne, Nejat feels the need to be reconciled with his father, who now lives in Turkey, by the Black Sea. He decides to go and look for him.

Synopsis
1987, a small town in Romania. Ceausescu is in power.
The scene is set in a girls’ dormitory, with exams in progress. Otilia, a blond, and Gabita, a brunette, are room mates. While one anxiously packs her suitcase, the other is combing the black market for soap and American cigarettes, precious commodities that will be needed to buy favours.
There is a tacit bond of complicity between the two girls. Together they prepare to face a daunting journey through a dehumanising world built on lies, denunciations and moral compromise. It is Otilia who will commit the ultimate act of selflessness, when she sacrifices herself to help her friend. This great story of friendship, told in thriller form, plunges us into the darkest years of a dying regime. The two girls’ will to survive embodies that of an entire nation.

Synopsis
After an interval of 38 years, two extraordinary characters from Luis Buñuel’s film Belle de jour revisit the mystery of a secret known only to the male character and desperately needed by the female protagonist.
Their paths cross again. She does everything to avoid him. But he is insistent and persuades her to see him again by promising to reveal the secret that only he knows. They agree to meet for dinner at a smart hotel.
Throughout the dinner she, now a widow, is expecting him to divulge what he really said to her husband, paralysed by a bullet fired by one of her lovers.
The atmosphere is tense... Auf der anderen Seite 4 luni, 3 saptamini si 2 zile Belle toujours
The jury for the LUX Prize: the 785 Members of the European Parliament
The jury will be made up of the 785 Members of the European Parliament. All Members will be invited to view the competing films, and only those who have seen all three will be allowed to exercise their voting right.
There will be an attendance register at the door of the projection room. If a Member has already seen one of the films, s/he will be able to tick the relevant option and sign the register, and will then be exempted from watching the film again.
Voting will be electronic, via Inside, the European Parliament’s intranet site.
Voting will close at midnight on 18 October. The outcome will remain undisclosed until the LUX Prize is awarded in plenary sitting on 24 October in Strasbourg (France).
The Prize and the award ceremony in plenary
The LUX Prize will be awarded to the film that receives the most votes.
A trophy will be presented to the winner by the President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering, in the presence of the 784 other members of the Assembly and representatives of the three finalists.
The LUX Prize will consist of assistance in kind in the form of subtitling and video-to-film transfer (kinescopage) of the winning film in the 23 official EU languages. There will also be an original language adaptation for the deaf and hard of hearing.
If the winning film has already been sold for projection in cinemas in some countries and subtitled for the purpose, the nature of the prize (e.g. assistance with production of the DVD) will be determined by agreement between the European Parliament and the film’s appointed representatives.
