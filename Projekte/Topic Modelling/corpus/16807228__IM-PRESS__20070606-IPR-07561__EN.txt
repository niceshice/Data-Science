Members of the national parliaments and of the European Parliament will meet at the European Parliament in Brussels on 11 and 12 June 2007, for the third time, to discuss the future of Europe . This conference will give citizens' national and European representatives an opportunity to discuss key issues of concern to them.
The first two meetings, held on 8 and 9 May and on 4 and 5 December 2006, helped to the re-launch national debate on the future of Europe.
The issues to be addressed during the meeting, in working parties and in plenary, will include: "the new challenges for the EU, especially climate change and energy security", "architecture and substance of a future Treaty" and "the role of national parliaments in the reform process".
This event, jointly organised by the European Parliament and the German Bundestag, will contribute to the discussions of the European Council meeting, to be held on 21 and 22 June, dedicated to the institutional reforms.
