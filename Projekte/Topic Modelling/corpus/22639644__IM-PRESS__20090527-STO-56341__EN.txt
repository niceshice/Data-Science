Follow us on Twitter! Ahead of elections on 4-7 June the European Parliament has now set up an election twitter in the European Union's 22 official languages to keep people up to speed on preparations for the Europe-wide poll. These special election "tweets" will feature news and behind the scenes info about the run up to voting between 4-7 June and on what many are calling "results Sunday" - 7 June.
Started just three years ago, the micro-blogging service twitter allows you write down and share thoughts, opinions and experiences with your friends and those who choose to follow you. Fancy being a twitter follower? Come and find us in English at "EU_Elections_en"!
