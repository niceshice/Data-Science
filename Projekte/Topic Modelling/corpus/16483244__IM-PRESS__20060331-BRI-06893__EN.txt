Opening of the session and agenda changes
2006-04-10 - 09:54
Opening the session, EP President Josep BORRELL informed MEPs of the arrest of the former President of Liberia, Charles TAYLOR, who has now been transferred to the custody of the special court in Sierra Leone. He is accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including responsibility for murder, rape and the use of child soldiers.
Parliament, recalled President Borrell, had called for Mr Taylor to be transferred to the court: “ We should therefore applaud this victory against impunity for war criminals. The new Liberian President has been invited to address the House, and I hope this will happen soon .”
Changes to the agenda
The Plenary approved a number of changes to the agenda:
The vote on the package of reports concerning better lawmaking will now take place at the Brussels plenary session on 26-27 April 2006.
The Council statement on Wednesday was given a new title: “Road safety measures and security measures in the transport sector including their financing”. The President noted that this debate was intended to include discussion of security measures in the fight against terrorism as well as road safety as such.
Thursday afternoon featured a Commission statement on the situation in South East Turkey followed by a debate. This was requested by the GUE/NGL group whose leader Francis WURTZ (FR) spoke of “a violent crackdown” and “serious violations of commitments entered into” by Turkey. There was no resolution on this subject at this stage.
Finally, the human rights debate on Thursday concerning Iraq was renamed to cover “the Assyrian community in Iraq and the situation of prisons in Iraq”, as requested by the EPP-ED group.

Improving transparency of the EU institutions
2006-04-10 - 09:54
The European Parliament takes action to ensure transparency and democratic scrutiny of the EU institutions. In two reports adopted on Tuesday, 5 April, in Strasbourg Plenary, MEPs call for the Council to meet in public when it is acting as a legislator, and requests the Commission to revise existing rules and to table new legislation by the end of this year on "the right of access" to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents. How can the European Union talk about transparency and the need to close the gap with its citizens if it fails to apply the most basic rules on public access to the EU institutions' documents? The European Parliament came out in favour of revising existing legislation to ensure that debates in Council and all preparatory documents on legislative procedures are available to the public and easily accessible.
Transparency and democratic scrutiny of the institutions are crucial to ensuring public trust in the Union itself. Responding to this concern, Parliament, in a non-binding report by Michael Cashman (PES, UK), adopted a package of recommendations calling on the Commission to revise the existing rules and to table new legislation by the end of this year on "the right of access" to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents.
Firstly, the amended regulation should require access to be granted to all preparatory documents linked to a legislative procedure --including the opinions of legal services-- and also to the records of the Council debates where these institutions are "acting in their role as legislators" and to the identity of the author of each initiative. Secondly, the existing legislation should be modified as to define more clearly on what basis specific documents may be classified as confidential, "in order to protect the essential interests of the EU. MEPs want to prevent documents being classified as confidential "as a matter of routine, simply because they refer to an issue which is or might be relevant from a security point of view".
Finally, the European Union should limit the right of Member States to restrict access to their contributions and amendments in co-decision and other legislative procedures, say MEPs.
The existing EU legislation on public access to the institutions' texts was the fruit of lengthy negotiations between Parliament and Council before its adoption at second reading in 2001. MEPs feel today that the final formulation has proven too vague as far as access to EU documents and Council activities is concerned. Text adopted

President of Malta: The European Union: A Voice of Reason in Europe and the World
2006-04-10 - 09:54
President Borrell welcomed the President of the Republic of Malta, H.E. Dr. Edward Fenech-Adami by recollecting his "long-term commitment to European integration" during his time as Malta's Prime Minister.
President BORRELL commended the Maltese President's signing of the Accession Treaty some three years ago, describing it as representing "an important sign of consensus that now prevails in Malta about European integration." He noted that President Fenech-Adami's presence was a reminder of Europe's need to "strengthen dialogue with the countries of the Mediterranean basin" and the need to build "better relations with our neighbours of the South". President Borrell warmly welcomed President Fenech-Adami's visit as a "timely" one.
Malta in the Union
President Edward Fenech-Adami commenced by saying that the Maltese are "proud to be part of the family of nations that is the European Union with its spiritual, cultural and humanistic heritage". Despite the path to membership being difficult, he said that "the Maltese people took a clear and sovereign decision in favour of membership through a referendum and subsequent general election". He praised the Union for its success in achieving the largest enlargement to date less than two years ago and spoke against the pessimism that often prevails within the Union. The President expressed his desire "to pay tribute to the European Union itself for its extraordinary catalyst effect in stimulating countries to embrace reform", considering it " wrong to blame Europe for unpopular reforms which, in reality, are decisions that every responsible government needs to take".
EU Constitutional Treaty
When discussing the EU Constitutional Treaty, he said that although "timing does not matter…in hindsight it may have been wiser to give this important project more time" and asserted that "the question remains, however, as to how to proceed from the current impasse". He expressed a need to respect the wishes of the people both in the countries who rejected the treaty and in those who approved it, suggesting various possible future scenarios to deal with the situation: "this is what this period of reflection is for. Let us not waste it".
Reconnecting with the people through a voice of reason
The President spoke of a need to address "the incipient lack of trust…in the individual Community institutions" and to ask ourselves "what can we do to regain trust in the European Union and its institutions" He suggested this trust could be realised through a reconnection with the people, accordingly he welcomed "the work of the Commission in undertaking the daunting task of bridging the gap with citizens through its Plan D." Nevertheless, President Fenech-Adami advised that the most important way to strengthen trust within the Union is to show that "in adopting policies, in taking decisions, in interacting both internally as well as externally, the European Union is able to give a voice to reason". He supported the notion of the Union as a voice of reason by praising it in view of rational policies on small states, on the Services directive, on energy and maritime issues, on the Euro-Mediterranean Region, on the challenge of globalisation and on irregular immigration. He asserted that "being a voice of reason necessarily calls upon us to transcend the confines of our selfish national interests and to work together selflessly for our common good".
President Fenech-Adami closed his speech by mentioning Europe's "unequivocal attachment to the values of peace, tolerance, human rights and solidarity" and spoke of the fundamental notion that in order to strengthen the Union's connection with its citizens, it must be seen to be "responding effectively to the concerns of the people", he said: "it is Europe that citizens want from us and it is this Europe that they are ready to trust".

European Council
MEPs see Europe's economy getting back on track
2006-04-10 - 09:54
Parliament debated the outcome of the Spring European Council meeting held in Brussels on 23 and 24 March. Many MEPs welcomed important progress in the areas of a common energy policy. On the services directive, there was a welcome for the backing of the European Parliament position.
Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang SCHÜSSEL, President-in-Office of the Council, began by quoting Robert Schuman, who said that Europe would be built by deeds, not by rhetoric. He spoke of the very specific goals for economic policy, including the creation of 10 million new jobs and a package of measures to ensure all young people would be offered an apprenticeship, a job or further education within six months of leaving school. The Council had also agreed to the Commission's proposal of a European globalisation fund. He stressed the importance of focussing on SMEs by cutting red tape and bureaucracy – by, for example, making it possible to set up a company within a week with only one government office to deal with all the process.
He pointed out that each Member State had now put forward individual plans to reach a goal of investing 3 per cent of GDP in research and development – success would mean an extra €100 billion from national budgets and the private sector. He noted that the Council had also supported the idea of a European Institute for Technology, as proposed by Mr Barroso. This would not be a duplication of existing institutions, but would aim to be “a perfect network working with Member States' institutions” to improve the link between universities and business. He welcomed moves to create better national ownership of the Lisbon reform plans.
Turning to energy policy, he thanked Angela Merkel and Tony Blair for their impetus for an EU initiative. “Almost all EU countries face an energy crisis: there are risks of blackouts and the risk of climate change. There is rising energy demand in the world.” He welcomed the Commission's green paper with its focus on security of supply and increasing environmental quality. Noting the commitment to 20 per cent energy savings, he said the aim was to decouple economic growth from increasing energy use. There were goals of increasing renewables to 15 per cent and biofuels to 8 per cent. He also stressed the importance of improving capacity for inter-Member State energy trading.
“There must be no protectionism in a relatively small market like Europe. The time has passed for everyone to have a national champion and to ignore European rules. We have agreed to open our electricity and gas markets... the Commission has instruments to enforce this and should use them,” he said.
On the services directive, he said it had not been easy to reach a consensus, but the Council had agreed that Parliament's text was the basis to go forward, and he hoped there could be an accelerated procedure in second reading. He also wanted a solution to on the working time directive which respected national sensitivities and subsidiarity: “A reasonable compromise is better than no deal at all – which also applies to the budget talks.” On the Financial Perspective, he stressed that despite its difficult birth there was now a compromise he could recommend to the other Member States.
He mentioned one foreign policy matter: “The situation in Belarus is dramatic. I had the pleasure of meeting Mr Milinkievich – he is a calm sensible man who requires all our political and economic support... we should raise our voices together to call for the immediate release of all the detainees in Belarus, including the presidential candidate Aleksander Kozulin. We do not want to isolate Belarus and its population. We want to strengthen civil society there.” He said the regime in Belarus would face restrictive measures for as long as it used repression.
President José Manuel BARROSO said that it was somewhat fashionable in Europe now to be a little sceptical or cynical. However, the EU had countered this through the achievements of the Spring Summit. The summit had shown that, in an enlarged EU, progress was possible and that European responses were needed to achieve economic growth. The objectives set by the Commission had been achieved. Progress had been made in the field of energy as well as on the new European Institute of Technology.
The 25 national programmes on achieving the Lisbon goals had been received and the EU was now working on a logic of results and deeds. President Barroso stressed the importance of political ownership of the Lisbon strategy.
The summit, he said, had a practical side. On the services directive, the Member States eventually had agreed to take up the position agreed by the European Parliament in February and President Barroso expected a "rapid agreement." The President welcomed the decision of Spain, Portugal, Finland and most recently the Netherlands following on from Sweden, Ireland and the UK to open their labour markets to the new Member States. On business, the European Council had agreed to cut red tape and support the Commission's reform on state-aid rules for SMEs. The summit also recognised the importance of the new European Institute of Technology. On energy, the Heads of State and Government had backed the Commission's Green paper and its goals of secure, competitive and sustainable energy. More would be done at the June European Council and there was also agreement that energy would form part of each forthcoming Spring Summit.
On Belarus, President Barroso outlined that the Commission was strongly supporting civil society and boosting a free and independent media in Belarus.
Europe was now moving forward in partnership and turning words into action.
Political group speakers
Responding for the EPP-ED group, Hans-Gert POETTERING (DE) welcomed the increased feeling of community and common responsibility which he perceived between the institutions. “This is a good opportunity to strengthen the European psychology to create an EU for the people of Europe.” On Lisbon, he called for less red tape and bureaucracy, especially for small businesses: “The services directive is important for that end. We need less legislation and more competition with freedom for companies to create jobs.” He noted that the Polish government was calling for European solidarity on energy policy – this, he said was welcome, but “solidarity is not a one way street – we also expect solidarity on the future of the constitutional treaty.”
Socialist group leader Martin SCHULZ (DE) said that weighing up the Spring Council meeting there were some positive points to breathe life into European projects and this could be greeted with satisfaction. He said there was much in common with the proposals made by the PES on growth and employment. He agreed the EU needed a common energy strategy, though ultimately the Member States would decide. On the economic reform programme, he said: “Too often we see nice declarations then individual Member States forget what they have said and play to the national gallery.” He said it was thanks to Parliament that there would be a decent services directive.
For the ALDE group, Graham WATSON (UK) said things could have been worse, but the result of the Council was, as Mark Twain said of Wagner's music “not as bad as it sounds.” He was pleased that even socialist Prime Ministers had accepted the market was needed to increase prosperity and that all had agreed on the important contribution helping the environment could have in creating growth and jobs. He welcomed the Commission's plans to challenge Member States not respecting the rules on liberalisation. “We think future Spring summits should drop the economic focus and cover other vital issues such as, this year, Belarus and Guantanamo Bay... We want more European spirit.”
Pierre JONCKHEER (BE) spoke on behalf of the Greens saying that "citizens are awaiting results" and that "legislation of the EU will be predicated on these results". He made three suggestions for the European Union to take on board. He said that the EU budget was not big enough - that it did not provide enough money to "help achieve the Lisbon objectives". He mentioned the need to consider the role of the EIB and the need for a debate on a common EU-tax to finance proper transport links across Europe. Mr. Jonckheer's last suggestion was that the Council needs to talk about the changes in the tax system of Member states, and that the EU needs to "ensure a growth of the tax base of Europe" in order to avoid "an ever-growing poorer population".
Ilda FIGUEIREDO (GUE/NGL, PT) talked of the "gaping chasm" that is growing between the policies and the citizens of Europe, noting that the conclusions of the Spring Summit do not correspond with the reality of the situation within the EU. She asked "where are the responses and solutions to unemployment?", and asked what was being done about "the burgeoning and precarious work in poor conditions". Ms. Figueiredo spoke of "very vague and woolly commitments to employment", the need to have poverty mentioned as a violation of human rights and that "social inclusion should be at the forefront of the Council's concerns". She closed by asserting that "we need a change: we need economic policies that are social too".
Brian CROWLEY (UEN, IE) said he "absolutely deplored the way this House has been used to fight national elections". He instead wished to draw attention to the achievements of the Parliament on employment and the expansion of research, development and education. He commended the Parliament's efforts to create new policies on energy systems, noting that the Parliament has the capacity to respond to Europe's needs so long as it "is willing to act as a political organ". He spoke of his desire for the EU to allow money to be utilised so that "we can ensure that we can deliver on future promises for future generations".
Georgios KARATZAFERIS (IND/DEM, EL) spoke of a need to break any Communist attempts at jeopardising the goals of the Union, describing "globalisation as the other face of nationalism". He talked of the need to ensure better relations with the oil-countries through the maintenance of state autonomy and the "need to work with the state, the need to work with the peoples."
Non-attached Member Leopold Józef RUTOWICZ (PL) said that the EU needs to mobilise its institutions and any of its available funds, and that "procedures must be tailored to its needs". He spoke of the importance of solving the Union's problems "amongst ourselves" and that a "change in urgency is required…not least in the Financial Perspectives". Mr. Rutowicz also said that issues regarding agriculture "need to be solved" and that policies on energy "need to be attacked".
British speaker
Timothy KIRKHOPE (EPP-ED, UK), the leader of the British Conservatives in the European Parliament, welcomed the sanctions taken against the Belarus authorities. However, on the Lisbon agenda, he said there was an underlying malaise. On the services directive, he was unhappy with the "Council compromise" and said that the EU should go further. He said that Mr Blair was deluding himself on the services directive. Mr Kirkhope said that Europe needed to reform now and not later. The European Council had failed to say anything on protectionism but Mr Kirkhope welcomed President Barroso's legal action to ensure open energy markets and the fight against national protectionism.
Response to the debate
Responding to the debate, Chancellor SCHÜSSEL said the Austrian presidency would not be resting on its laurels. He defended the idea of setting ambitious economic targets, even if there was a risk they would be missed. Creating 10 million new jobs by 2010 was a realistic ambition, he said. He also argued that it was wrong to compare the Financial Perspective agreement with the draft proposed by the Prodi Commission, which he said had never been realistic. There were no cuts compared with the current Financial Perspective, but a series of substantial increases. “I urge you to support us on this without bickering between the institutions. The question is whether we can get down to work in the interests of the European population.” Finally, he added that the presidency hoped to have a road map for progress on the constitutional issue in place by June.
In his response to the debate, President BARROSO said that there had been general support for the conclusions of the European Council. On energy, President Barroso said the work had not been completed and more would be done at the June European Council. He welcomed the specific targets on research set for each Member State and the general support for the European Institute of Technology. President Barroso stressed the importance of presidencies of the Council working together to ensure long-term consistency. The Commission President also welcomed the agreement on the EU budget for 2007-2013 as "good news". Europe was solving issues one by one and was moving forward.

Budget
EU budget 2007-2013: a deal is done - €4 billion more but some dissatisfaction
2006-04-10 - 09:54
MEPs reacted to the recent deal struck between the Parliament, Council and Commission on the financial perspective 2007-2013. Although, many MEPs expressed their satisfaction with the figures, it was felt that reaching a deal was essential. MEPs had secured a further €4 billion on the deal the Council had struck in December under the UK Presidency.
President Josep BORRELL announced to MEPs that Parliament's negotiating team on the Financial Perspective had reached an agreement with representatives of the Commission and the Council. Parliament, he said, had had both quantitative and qualitative goals: “We wanted both more resources and better structuring.” The ceiling, he said, was now €4 billion more than in the Council's December agreement. “This is fresh money for those programmes which had been very considerably cut: Erasmus, Life Long Learning, innovation and assistance for small and medium sized enterprises.” There was also €2.5 billion more for the European Investment Bank to fund SMEs and Trans-European Transport Networks. It would also, he said, be possible to carry forward some unspent funds to two subsequent financial years.
Parliament's rapporteur Reimer BÖGE (EPP-ED, DE) said he was not satisfied with this result. The Financial Perspective for the enlarged Europe and what was needed in terms of added value had vanished, he said. However, he said, “in current circumstances we have reached the very limits for an acceptable solution. We did our utmost. Parliament was not just obsessed with figures – we wanted reform of policy, new instruments, the cutting of red tape and guarantees for Parliament's role on foreign policy instruments – and a proper role in the 2008-9 review. We have managed to get these qualitative aspects on board in a satisfactory way. As far as the figures are concerned, all sides have reached the pain threshold.” There was, he said, more funding for Life Long Learning and competitiveness and an additional 40,000 students would be able to take part in European exchanges. He thanked all of Parliament's team for working together to “deliver this commitment to European added value.”
For the Commission, José Manuel BARROSO expressed his satisfaction at the agreement reached by the negotiators. He congratulated all involved. “This is clearly better than the European Council's December agreement. It is good news that we now have the funds to match our ambitions for the next seven years.” He also mentioned the extra funding for TENs, Life Long learning and research. He hoped the agreement would be endorsed by the full Parliament and Council without delay. “This is not just about the figures, it is also about sound financial management principles, transparency, accountability and the quality of the way we work together.” He pointed to the increased role for Parliament in the planned review of EU spending. “No-one is completely happy, but this is a good demonstration on the spirit of partnership, I hope we can move swiftly to build on this momentum to get all our programmes up and running in time for next year.”
Political group speakers
EPP-ED group leader Hans-Gert POETTERING (DE) said that a lot of progress had been made which would not have been possible without the European Parliament, and without looking beyond the national interest to the common European interest. “We are not entirely happy, but we know that more could not be achieved.” He too praised the EP negotiating team. He called for national authorities to shoulder their responsibility for proper handling of EU funds, not just blaming the EU for any deficiencies.
For the Socialist group, Martin SCHULZ (DE) said that while the agreement was “less that what we wanted, it was more than many expected. It was a victory for common sense.” He said the review clause was especially valuable. He noted the Commission had undertaken to present proposal for the review. He looked forward to improved financial management, saying the EU must spend money properly – and that there was a general agreement to make progress. Thanking all involved, he said, “Today is a good day.”
ALDE group leader Graham WATSON (UK) also thanked the negotiating team and the Austrian Presidency. “I hope this agreement will commend itself for approval... even though we are not satisfied. There is not enough for research, for Gallileo, TENs and Life Long Learning. I know it is fashionable in some national capitals to pour cold water on our common endeavour... if the central force for developing our Union is no longer visionary leadership from within, then perhaps developments beyond our borders will persuade us to provide the Union with the resources we need.”
On behalf of the Greens, Monica FRASSONI (IT) declared that they were "not terribly pleased" with the agreement and not particularly convinced that the Parliament could not have got more. She noted how the "basic problem is the same: the unwillingness by MEPs to pay for what's necessary in the EU". She thanked the negotiating team, whilst noting that it was entirely composed of men. Ms. Frassoni spoke of her concerns that the revision clause was not included in the agreement, she asked what the fate of this clause will be and what the EU decision making process will be in terms of its external progress. She lamented the 20 Billion Euro cut for rural development and also asserted that the topics of EU taxes and EU-own resources have to be kept on the agenda. She closed by describing the agreement as an "unsatisfactory" one.
Francis WURTZ (GUE/NGL, FR) said that the EU budget is "not the only instrument to foster plans for development and growth", suggesting the Central Bank as an example of another instrument. He described the budget as "an expression of political will" and in correlation, mentioned the lack of Members' States willingness to pay for the political decisions they take, suggesting enlargement, the structural funds and the cohesion funds as examples of this. Mr. Wurtz noted the "dreadful effects on research and cooperation" that the rejection of the December compromise - "a negative compromise" - had. He considered the Parliaments' budgetary demands to be "very modest indeed" and accordingly advised: "we have to reject this farce, we have to be responsible".
Wojciech ROSZKOWSKI (UEN, PL) spoke of his mixed feelings. He was relieved that a decision has been made after 15 months, and that the pressure on EU finances is behind us. However he also spoke of his disappointment in the compromise, saying that there was a "limited distribution of EU funds" and the fact that the "Council was too tough in the face of modest demands" was "not very pleasant". Consequently he said that he could almost understand the Euro-scepticism and Europhobia, mentioning the stinginess of Member States. He declared that his group "will support this proposal", warning however that "if we are below the threshold in the annual budgets, the future of the Union is black".
Nigel FARAGE (UK) for the Independence and Democracy group, opened by saying that the EU was "indulging in its favourite sport and past-time, that of navel-gazing". He wondered when Members would start "addressing the real issues of the EU budget", declaring it to be "totally flawed" and asking "do we need a budget at all?". He criticised the British Prime Minister Tony Blair for being "outwitted, outclassed, and outplayed by President Chirac" and getting a bad deal for British taxpayers. He asked why the UK should be paying for the underground systems of other countries, accusing the UK of pursuing "economics of a madhouse" by "subsidising its economic competitors". He closed by saying that the UK would not be doing so for much longer: "no British cheque will be coming to you in a few years, but we have enjoyed ourselves while being here".
Jean-Claude MARTINEZ (NI, FR) said that with the financial perspectives envisaged, the European Union would find it impossible to catch up with the US market. He spoke of a need of funds for hospitals, laboratories and high-speed trains, and accordingly lamented the lack of enthusiasm in European economic policy-making.

Environment
Less fluorinated-gases in Europe's atmosphere
2006-04-10 - 09:54
Fluorinated gases are not the solution! Used since the 1990s to replace ozone-depleting CFCs they are found mostly in refrigeration and air-conditioning systems, but also in windows, fire extinguishers, insulating foam or even sport shoes. But they have now also been incriminated in global warming. The European Parliament adopted today two new laws to reduce, or prohibit, their use. This should help Member States to meet their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.
The European Parliament passed to the final hurdle of the codecision procedure, i.e. the conciliation negotiation, in order to influence the content of the new legislation. This negotiation was successfully concluded on 31 January 2006 and the results were endorsed by two votes in Strasbourg Plenary:
(1) 476 votes in favour, 46 against and 25 abstentions for the regulation to restrict the use of fluorinated gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol; and
(2) MEPs approved the second report on the directive on air conditioning systems in motor vehicles (also called "MAC" directive for "mobile air conditioners") by a large majority..
Fluorinated gases are less well known than CO² but they play a significant role in the greenhouse effect. They are widely used in air conditioners, refrigerators and insulating foam. If they are transmitted into the atmosphere, their damaging effects can last for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. Their potentially harmful nature or "global warming potential" (GWP) is measured on a scale from 1 (equal to CO²) to more than 20 000 for sulphur hexafluoride (SF6).
These two legislations are the first step in regulating emissions of F-gases in the EU and they should be a contributing factor to meeting the European objectives in the frame of the Kyoto protocol: the Community is committed to achieving an 8 per cent reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases in the period from 2008 to 2012 compared to 1990 levels. In the longer-term, global emissions should even be reduced by approximately 70 per cent.
The rapporteur for these two legislations, Avril DOYLE (EPP-ED, IE), declared: ...
" I believe the legislation now agreed strikes an equitable balance between environmental protection and single market concerns. It reaffirms the European Community's commitment to reducing climate change and will provide a considerable stimulus to the development of new environmental technologies, thus contributing to our Lisbon Agenda "knowledge economy" goals. It will do so in a measured and proportionate way. These two reports are a positive step towards stopping global warming through the greenhouse effect by cutting down or cutting out the use of fluorinated gases where they are not necessary ."
Commissioner Kyprianou said before the final vote in plenary: "The Commission undertakes to re-evaluate the pending infringement procedures with regard to the use of f-gases in Denmark and Austria taking into account the final agreement which was reached during conciliation."
Air conditioning systems in vehicles
The directive on air conditioning systems in motor vehicles aims to regulate the use of these gases and to harmonise type-approval of vehicles as regards air conditioning systems in order to avoid discrepancies between the Member States. Parliament and Council opted for a ban on fluorinated gases with a GWP of more than 150 in new models planned from 2011 onwards and in all vehicles from 2017. This threshold would eliminate some gases currently used by manufacturers, notably HFC-134a (GWP of 1300), but would allow continued use of HFC-152a, which has a lower GWP (120) and should encourage technical innovation.
This Directive will enter into force twenty days after the date of publication in the Official Journal. Member States will then have 18 months to transpose it into national laws.
25 gases under stricter control
The regulation seeks to reduce emissions of 25 fluorinated gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol: 17 hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), 7 perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and the most dangerous of all, sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). It addresses the containment, use, recovery and destruction of these gases, the labelling and disposal of products containing these gases and the training of personnel involved in related activities. This regulation was the subject of a lively debate, in particular when discussing the dual legal base. Finally, article 175 of the EC Treaty (environment policy), which allows Members States to adopt more stringent national rules, will apply to containment, recovery, certification and reporting. Article 95 (single market) will apply to provisions concerning use bans, prohibitions and labelling.
The regulation lists a small number of prohibitions with a compulsory deadline for each of them. For example, every F-gases should be prohibited from footwear (date of entry into force), tyres and windows for domestic use (1 year after), PFCs should be prohibited from fire extinguishers after 1 year, etc. A Member State having stricter national provisions as at 31 December 2005 may keep these measures until the end of 2012.
The containment provisions will apply to industrial stationary applications. It includes the obligation to minimise leakages and to repair such leakages as quickly as possible. It details the inspections to be made by certified personnel. The regulation also defines the obligations for recovery of F-gases for various equipments like cooling circuits of refrigeration, air-conditioning and heat pump equipment, fire protection systems and fire-extinguishers. Labelling of equipments containing F-gases will also become compulsory. By the end of 2008, the Commission is invited to present, if appropriate, new legislative proposals relating to other air conditioning and refrigeration systems, including domestic applications.
This regulation shall enter into force twenty days after its publication in the Official Journal and it shall apply from one year after, unless for the prohibitions with immediate effect. For this regulation as well as for the directive Member States may promote innovative systems in order to further reduce the climate impact. Text adopted

Free movement of services
It's back to the future on the Services Directive - MEPs react to new proposal
2006-04-10 - 09:54
MEPs had a first opportunity to react to the Commission's revised proposals on the services directive, when Commissioners Charlie McCreevy and Vladimir Spidla outlined their new draft to the House. There was widespread agreement that the Commission had closely followed the position adopted by Parliament at its first reading vote in February – the next stage of the process is for the Member States to come to a common position in the Council.
Internal Market Commissioner Charlie McCREEVY told MEPs the Commission had honoured its commitment to respect the consensus reached in Parliament on the services directive. Article 16 on freedom to provide services and Article 17 on derogations to that freedom were taken on board. All healthcare services had been excluded, and the Commission would be taking a separate initiative on the health sector. Temporary work agencies, security services and the audiovisual sector had also been excluded. He said legal services had not been excluded, on the grounds that Article 3 already indicated that specific directives would prevail in cases of conflict. The Commission had modified the wording on official authorities in line with the treaty and was aiming for legal certainty in specifying the exclusions of social housing services, services to children, families and people in need provided by the state or by providers mandated by the state. A new communication on social services of general interest would be issued within a few weeks.
" The decision to remove all interaction with labour law has been a major help in improving the atmosphere of this debate. It removes the perception – which was in any case mistaken – that there is a threat to labour standards. Articles 24 and 25 have been removed, and the Commission has prepared a communication on the posting of workers to address the issues covered by these articles .”
" There is a growing realisation that the consensus you achieved is the basis to take proposal forward. There is now a window of opportunity to build on that consensus want to get the benefits of more growth and jobs as soon as possible. I will present the revised draft to the Council at Graz and I believe we have a real chance of making progress during the Austrian presidency .”
Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, Vladimir SPIDLA set out the contents of a Commission communication on the posting of workers. He said the aim was to help Member States in practical terms to deal with administrative and structural arrangements: " The removal of Articles 24 and 25 should not be taken to mean that Member States are entitled to retain major administrative obstacles in the way of employers posting workers across borders to provide services. The aim is to have freedom to provide services and to prevent social dumping .” The communication, he said, set out what control measures Member States can use to check on working standards. It set out various measures including the documents required and the need for a representative in the host country. Only the absolute minimum of documentation was to be required, he said, noting that social insurance papers, for example were already covered by other legislation. “ There is much room for improvement in all areas, in websites and other information tools, in monitoring bodies and in the exchange of documents .”
Political Group speakers
For the EPP-ED group, Marianne THYSSEN (BE) said she was not at all displeased with progress of events: “ We have set the tone in the plenary debate and called for a balanced text, and we supported radical changes to the original Commission proposal. Parliament has had hearty congratulations from the Council for finding a way to keep the market functioning and to preserve our social achievements .” Economic interests were being protected and social concerns dealt with, she said, adding that consumers would be sufficiently protected. “ We know a balance is possible – the issue will be further addressed and we are sure the Austrian presidency will achieve a directive which is good for employers, consumers and workers – and for growth and jobs ."
For the Socialist group, Evelyne GEBHARDT (DE) said the Commission had “ leapt beyond the shadow from which it suffered last week .” She was very pleased that the Commission had kept its word and gone along with the majority view of Parliament. This was a decisive step, she said, towards a social Europe: “ The country of origin principle has been swept aside. This is most important for social Europe .” She was pleased that sensitive sectors were being excluded, though she said the social services issue would need further discussion. “ We have been able to prove that we have exercised our rights to the benefit of citizens. It is now up to the Council to deal with this and determine how rapidly we will have this legislation .”
Speaking for the ALDE group, Toine MANDERS (NL) thanked the Commission for providing the text so rapidly. He said this directive was a major step forward for employment in Europe. “ Creating jobs is the best thing for social security – it is far better than protecting at all costs our so called social achievements .” He was disappointed at the length of the list of excluded areas, which he said were areas where protectionism could continue. He also had concerns that excluding the audiovisual sector left a lack of clarity. “ It is up to politicians to take decisions for the long term even if it means temporary unpopularity. You can see what happens in France when you try to introduce reforms to preserve our prosperity for our children... The mobility of services is very important to help Europe compete with other markets .”
Pierre J ONCKHEER (BE), for the Greens / European Free Alliance Group said he was pleased that the Commission had taken into account the suggestions of the Parliament and the Council. However, he said that his Group still had problems with the scope of the Directive and the Inclusion of Services of General Interest. On the latter point they believe there should be a specific Directive in itself. Mr Jonckheer also said that agreement on Article 16 does not in their view present a sound legal basis.
Francis WURTZ (FR), speaking for the GUE/NGL Group, said that his Group would " neither underestimate or overestimate their achievements " (since the original proposal). He added that his Group would "examine the Commission proposals under a microscope". He did however say that the changes showed the growing importance of the Parliament in the EU's institutional triangle and the weight of the people who had demonstrated against the Directive. He noted that under the proposals the rules of integration were still led by freedom of the market and not a wider solidarity.
Adam Jerzy BIELAN (PL), on behalf of the UEN Group, said that he " could not hide his disappointment " and that the amended version was full of " ambiguous statements " which will be tested by opponents of the liberal market. He criticised the "short-sighted and selfish attitude" of some leaders of the " old " EU-15 in their opposition to open markets and labour mobility. He also criticised the "passive and apathetic" Commission for not acting in the Union's interest. Finally, on Article 24/25 he said that the better solutions promised by the Commission were merely the " status quo ".
Fernand LE RACHINEL (NI, FR) welcomed the fact that the Commission took note of the Parliament's vote and is trying to deal with controversial issues such as the " Country-of-origin principle ". However, he criticised the Commission for reprimanding France for taking measures against companies pursuing hostile takeover bids. Mr. Le Rachinel accused the Commission of " going against its own camp " and said that it was "essential for this institutional and political anomaly to be corrected".
British speaker
Malcolm HARBOUR (EPP-ED, UK) shadow rapporteur on the proposal, thanked Commissioner McCreevy for " fully living up to the pledge he gave to us " and supported the Commissioner's amended text. Although Mr Harbour declared he would have liked a more liberal directive, he called it " a major step forward in the internal ma rket" and that Mr McCreevy should act as "the strongest advocate of the directive". Mr Harbour asserted that the proposed text has more than one hundred measures that " remove barriers, reduce bureaucracy, simplify legislation and give more information " and that the Commissioner needs to " go up there and advocate it...to win heart and minds ". The proposed text, he said, " certainly isn't a diluted and weak legislation ".
Responses to the debate
Commissioner McCreevy stated that on the sectors outside the scope of the directive (sectors excluded) the Treaty provisions remained. On health, he said that the Commission would debate the issue in the next couple of weeks and that the proposal would at least cover worker mobility. The Commissioner said that Mr Harbour was overly pessimistic as to the perception of the revised proposal and that some initial negative reports in the media had been revised over time. Commissioner McCreevy said that he had sold the revised proposal to the Council of Ministers, and he also welcomed the European Council's recent endorsement of the revised proposal.
Mr McCreevy said that the Commission had recognised that the original proposal would never have become a political reality and it was more pragmatic to back the Parliament's position as a major step forward and one that would considerably benefit the European economy. He said he hoped that the Parliament and Council could work together to reach an early final agreement.
Commissioner Spidla said that the current posting of workers directive did not cause many problems but rather the implementation by the Member States needed to be improved. Any reform of the directive should always take into account the protection of workers and not create artificial barriers, he said.
The Commission would be coming forward with a communication, at the end of April, on services of public interest, preparation for which, he said, was well underway. Text adopted

EP calls for economic reform league table
2006-04-10 - 09:54
In its annual report on the EU's Broad Economic Policy Guidelines for the Member States, Parliament is making a wide ranging set of recommendations to the Commission and the Member States. In the report, drawn up by José Manuel Garcia Margallo (EPP-ED, ES), MEPs call, among other points, for:
- the Commission to publish a yearly ranking of the best and worst performers on economic reform among the Member States;
- speedy implementation of the national reform programmes;
- a strict interpretation of the renewed Stability and Growth Pact and additional efforts to reduce public debt burdens;
- the Member States to refrain from harmful, exaggerated cross-border tax competition;
- the promotion of the entrepreneurial spirit in secondary schools; an evaluation by Member States of the distributive and regional effects of their tax schemes and subsidies;
- ambitious birth rates policies, improvements in child care facilities, promotion of work-life balance, integration of immigrants into the labour market and action against illegal immigration, and incentives to delay retirement - all with the aim of improving the ratio of working age population over total population;
- efforts better to include young people, women, older people and disabled people in the workforce;
- measures to reduce non-wage labour costs and thereby discourage the black economy;
- improvements for the mobility of researchers and more investment in universities and the encouragement of private investment, to enhance economic efficiency and productivity;
- the development of a new coherent EU energy policy; the allocation of more resources to research and innovation and for a coordinated EU innovation policy;
- the achievement of a single European services market in accordance with the EC treaty with a balance between market opening, public services and social and consumer rights
- a forward looking financial services agenda focusing on achieving a Single Euro Payments Area by 2010, a review of insurance solvency, a proposal for revision of the provisions in the financial services directives concerning the discretionary powers of regulators in the case of cross border mergers AM19 to facilitate consolidation and avoid home/host supervisor conflicts, a proposal on mortgage credit and the adoption of a consumer credit directive - as well as efficient supervision and close cooperation among regulatory and supervisory bodies of the Member States.
Parliament also wants to see the period of reflection on the constitution to assess the current framework for macroeconomic governance. Text adopted

MEPs back Commission's competition policy
2006-04-10 - 09:54
Parliament supports the Commission's competition policy in an own initiative report in response to the Commission's 2004 annual competition report. The report makes a number of specific recommendations.
MEPs urge the Commission to promote the correct application of the competition rules in all Member States and to intervene in good time where the competition rules are being applied unsatisfactorily or in a discriminatory manner. They call for clarity on the "sometimes obscure relationships" among national competition authorities and 'national champions' to remove any suspicion of complicity.
The report notes MEPs' concern at the continued failure to achieve full liberalisation in the EU gas and electric markets and welcomes the Commission's inquiry into the sector, as it does the inquiry into bank payment systems and the business insurance market, though in these two cases it urges adequate time for full and thorough responses to the Commission. It suggests that in the case of major networked services, competition must be guided by strong public service obligations.
MEPs call for the Commission to issue a "clear and precise interpretative communication on the fourth criterion set out in the Altmark judgement" on state aid for public services. They ask for a detailed analysis of the problems associated with collective bargaining sensitive economic sectors, such as agriculture, particularly the relationship between small producers and major processors and marketing firms.
Highlighting the importance of consumer information in ensuring a genuine competition culture, MEPs say there is a need to consider at Community level private compensation in cases of anti-competitive conduct.
The report also reaffirms the call for Parliament to gain a more active role in the development of competition policy by enhancement of its codecision powers in this field.
The rapporteur, Alain Lipietz (Greens/EFA, FR), did not agree with the changes made to his original text at committee stage and confirmed by the plenary, so he withdraw his name from the report before the final vote. Text adopted

EP denies urgency procedure requested by Council on Morocco fisheries agreement
2006-04-10 - 09:54
MEPs voted to deny the Council's request for an urgency procedure on the fisheries agreement with the Kingdom of Morocco. The vote followed an extraordinary committee meeting, during which the rapporteur suggested adopting an accelerated procedure instead.
The House voted 53-127-2 to deny the Council request for an urgency procedure. Committee Chairman Philippe Morillon (ALDE, FR) said that debates were still not finished in the fisheries committee, and that the development committee had also expressed interest in giving an opinion on this sensitive topic. He therefore explained that a 14-9 majority of the committee opposed the urgency procedure. Heinz Kindermann (PES, DE) argued that the Parliament will in any case be unable to change the content of the fishing protocol, and that his group therefore supported the urgency.
The Council had requested an urgency procedure for the ratification process of the fisheries agreement with Morocco, with a plenary vote this Thursday in Strasbourg. This would have allowed the protocol to enter into force on 1 May 2006 (after adoption on 25 April in the Council). MEPs rejected this proposal.
The fisheries committee's alternate timeframe -- proposed by the rapporteur Daniel Varela Suanzes-Carpegna (EPP-ED, ES) -- would include a discussion of the report in committee on 18-19 April, (with a prior deadline for amendments on April 6th), a vote in committee on 3 May, and another extraordinary committee meeting on 15 May to allow the report to be voted on during the May plenary in Strasbourg. This schedule would allow the protocol to enter into force on 1 June, adding one month to the waiting period before fishermen could commence activities in the area. It would still allow the EU to ratify the accord before the first payments are due on 30 June. Text adopted

Trans-European energy networks: guidelines for the 2004 enlargement
2006-04-10 - 09:54
MEPs adopted a second reading report on Trans European Energy Networks. The amendments adopted are agreeable to Council and the procedure is completed at this second reading stage.
The aim of the directive is to adapt the guidelines (TEN energy) to the new shape of a European Union of 25 Member States, allow funding to be earmarked for projects of common interest, enable the internal market in gas and electricity to be completed and, to guarantee security of supply by means of interconnections between Member States and with neighbouring countries (south-east Europe, Mediterranean countries, Ukraine, Belarus). This approach to trans-European energy networks mirrors the approach followed for trans-European land transport networks.
The directive seeks to replace two older Decisions and to include the projects necessary to link the new Member States to be a part of the internal market of electricity and gas. It identifies projects of common interest and those which will be given priority in the coming years. It introduces new elements intended to facilitate the preparation of projects and the national procedures.
The compromise includes two important elements of the original Commission proposal supported by the EP but previously opposed by the Council: the declaration of projects of European interest and the European coordinator.
Background:
The European Union finances electricity and gas transmission infrastructure projects of European interest. A yearly budget of about €25m is spent mainly for supporting feasibility studies. Most of the projects cross national borders or have an influence on several EU Member States. The guidelines on Trans European Energy Networks specify which projects are eligible for funding. The financial rules specify the financial procedures involved. The present proposal seeks to replace the two existing directives with a new one.
The estimated amount of investment required in the period 2007-2013 for the construction of the priority projects for electricity and gas networks is around €28bn (20bn in the EU; 8bn in third countries). An additional amount will be required in order to complete the other projects of common interest. These investment amounts will be mainly provided by the energy networks operators and other private funds supplemented, where appropriate, by the European Community aid and loan mechanisms .

External/international trade
Call for progress in WTO talks
2006-04-10 - 09:54
Parliament adopted a non-binding report on the Doha round of world trade talks ahead of the World Trade Organisation meeting of 30 April in Geneva. The report on the outcome of the WTO’s Hong Kong ministerial conference in December was adopted by 493 votes in favour to 103 against, with 25 abstentions.
While deploring the slow progress in the negotiations so far and the predetermined low level of ambition for the outcome of the Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong, MEPs note that this low level of ambition threatens the ability to deliver meaningful results for the Doha Round. MEPs call on the Commission to prepare an alternative action plan in case the Doha negotiations fail. The House hopes, however, that the Ministerial Declaration will pave the way for a successful conclusion of the Round in all key areas.
Parliament says industrialised countries and advanced developing countries should engage constructively in real negotiations to reach a successful conclusion.
On agriculture, says the committee, the commitments made by the Commission during the negotiations at the WTO must not go beyond the bounds of the current Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) arrangements or the negotiating mandate. It recalls the scope of the Luxembourg agreement on CAP reform and insists on the need to define ‘green box’ measures including decoupled support. MEPs in the committee also deplore the absence of progress on the establishment of a register for wines and spirits as well as on the extension of geographical indications to other products.
The report asks the Commission to consider the possibility of introducing a ‘development box’ for the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) into the agricultural negotiations so that they can tackle food safety and rural employment – major issues when it comes to eradicating poverty.
Negotiations on non agricultural market access should, says the committee, lead to ambitious and balanced results, guaranteeing new real market access opportunities. Given the lack of progress in the services area, the report calls for the intensification of negotiations at both bilateral and multilateral levels, with due regard for the interests of weak and vulnerable economies, while insisting that the EU continue emphasising the liberalisation of services and the opening of markets, especially in finance, tourist and distribution sectors, which are important for the European economy.
MEPs call for strengthened discipline with regard to anti-dumping and other rules issues in order to prevent abusive recourse to trade defence instruments while preserving the legitimate use and effectiveness of these instruments.
Among other points, the report also calls for institutional reform to improve the functioning of the WTO. It reiterates the importance of a parliamentary dimension for the WTO to enhance its democratic legitimacy and transparency, with Members of Parliament constituting an important link with citizens.
The House calls on the EU and the LDCs to jointly strive to achieve 100 % duty and quota-free market access for LDCs in developed and advanced developing countries. MEPs call on the Commission to give due consideration to non-trade concerns (animal welfare and the environment) in the field of agriculture in the forthcoming negotiations. MEPs stress the heavy distortion of competition suffered by European farmers as long as imported products are not subject to the same standards as home products.
MEPs participation
MEPs also stress the importance of the European Parliament being represented at all WTO meetings where major steps in the negotiations are taken and where ministers are involved and not only on the occasion of official Ministerial Conferences. The House requests, therefore, that a small delegation of members of the European Parliament be meaningfully involved in the meetings to be convened in Geneva with a view to meeting the 30 April and 31 July deadlines set in the Hong Kong Declaration. Finally, MEPs invite the Council to extend an invitation to such a delegation of members of the European Parliament to participate, as observers, in at least one of the meetings of the 133 Committee to be organised in Geneva at the end of April.

Culture
European Capitals of Culture 2007-2019
2006-04-10 - 09:54
Parliament adopted a legislative report by 584 votes in favour, 22 against and 19 abstentions on the system for choosing 'European Capitals of Culture' and monitoring their progress . The report makes a number of changes to the Commission's proposed reforms of the system.
The major innovation is the introduction of a monitoring phase after a city has been designated as a 'Capital of Culture' to ensure respect of the criteria established for the cultural programme and also to give advice and support to the city concerned.
The text also specifies details of the role of the selection panel and says that the prize, in the form of a financial allocation from the Commission, should be awarded at least seven months before the beginning of the event. It also makes appropriate changes to deal with the forthcoming accession of Romania and Bulgaria, adding them to the list for 2007 and 2019 respectively.
The amendments adopted have already been agreed with Council and Commission in informal negotiations so this report should signify the end of the procedure . Text adopted

MEPs call for free access to EU15 labour markets for new Member States
2006-04-10 - 09:54
The European Parliament is calling for an end to the transitional measures restricting access to workers from eight 'new' Member States to labour markets in several 'old' Member States. Countries with restrictions in place have until 1 May 2006 to decide on whether to lift them or to extend them until 2009.
In an own-initiative report by Csaba ŐRY (EPP-ED, HU), adopted by the European Parliament, MEPs "call on the Member States to abolish the transitional measures in force, given that there are no signs of strain on the labour markets of the Member States which have opted for openness without restrictions and that the fears of massive migration have proved groundless"
MEPs suggest that those Member States that opt to extend the transitional measures, should do so on the basis of an in-depth analysis of the threat to their labour market from each individual new Member State and ask them to create, during the next stage (2006-2009), the conditions to ensure that the transitional arrangements are not continued beyond 2009.
Parliament stresses that the free movement of workers is one of the four fundamental freedoms of the EC Treaty, as well as an expression of solidarity between old and new Member States. They say that there are no signs of strain on the labour markets of those Member States which have opened their doors: fears of massive migration have proved groundless and there are beneficial effects for the economies concerned. The Parliament says the denial of opportunities for new Member State workers to work legally in most of the EU-15 has fuelled illegal work, the black economy and worker exploitation.
Third-country nationals and "status quo clause "
MEPs note that some long-term residents from non-EU countries are in a more favourable position than citizens of the Member States which joined the EU in 2004 (as a result of Directive 2003/109/EC concerning the status of third-country nationals who are long-term residents)
Parliament calls on the Member States to enforce the status quo clause and preference rule in the Accession Treaty whereby, when a post is vacant, nationals of the new Member States have priority over third-country nationals. The 'status quo clause' also states that workers from the new Member States should not face greater restrictions than applied before the accession treaties were signed. MEPs say labour law should be strictly enforced to guarantee all EU workers are treated equally.
MEPs call on the Commission to institute proceedings under Article 226 of the EC Treaty without delay should any Member State fail to fulfil its obligations under Articles 12, 39, and 42 of the Treaty or the status quo clause of the Accession Treaty.
Call for Information campaign and better statistics
MEPs call for standardised statistics on intra-EU migration and for an information campaign to informing citizens more fully about the principles underlying, and the consequences of, the freedom of movement of workers within the EU.
Background: In May 2004, labour market restrictions were imposed, as allowed by the accession treaties, on workers from the eight new Member States in Central and Eastern Europe by all the old (EU 15) Member States except Ireland, Sweden and the UK. These arrangements can continue for up to seven years, broken down into three periods (2+3+2 years). Several Member States (Finland, Spain, Portugal) have already announced that they will open up their labour markets to citizens of the new Member States. Others have announced that they will renew the restrictions (Germany, Austria). Text adopted

European citizenship
Programme to bring Europe closer to its citizens
2006-04-10 - 09:54
Parliament in a report by Hannu TAKKULA (ALDE, FI), adopted by a large majority, MEPs give broad backing to a new Community programme designed to strengthen ties and foster a sense of cohesion between the EU's citizens following the low turnout in the last European elections and the No votes in two referenda on the Constitution for Europe.
In this first-reading report, MEPs say that the terms in the programme's title be reversed by calling it Europe for Citizens instead of Citizens for Europe.
The Commission had proposed three "actions": Active Citizens for Europe, Active Civil Society in Europe and Together for Europe. MEPs wish to add a fourth - Active European Remembrance - consisting of support for projects to commemorate the victims of Nazi and Stalinist mass deportation and mass extermination.
The programme will also cover:
- town twinning, including - at the wish of MEPs - twinning of sports clubs, for which purpose several references to amateur sports clubs are added to the legislation;
- transnational and cross-sectoral citizens' projects;
- support for think-tanks and civil society bodies at European level, such as the Jean Monnet Association, the Robert Schuman European Centre and, following an amendment by MEPs, the Maisons de l'Europe;
- high-profile events organised by or with the European Commission.
The cost of the programme for the period 2007-2013 will be €235 million, which according to MEPs, should be regarded as a minimum. The maximum period for granting funding at any one time should be three years, to prevent the beneficiaries becoming dependent on it, says the Parliament.
MEPs also stress that encouraging active citizenship is crucial in the fight against racism, xenophobia and intolerance, and in promoting integration, cohesion and democracy. In line with this, the programme should also be open to citizens of non-EU countries who have permanent residence rights in the EU. Text adopted

"Corruption hurts the poor": MEPs back report on development aid and the fight against corruption
2006-04-10 - 09:54
MEPs have called for tougher measures in the fight against corruption and more effective EU aid. Noting that 25% of Africa's GDP is lost annually to corruption, - the report calls on all EU members to implement the OECD and UN Conventions on corruption and for greater accountability and openness in EU aid programmes. Good governance, media freedom, developing budget capacity in developing countries and boosting civil society "watchdogs" are just some measures proposed
MEPs are calling for a blacklist of regimes and representatives of corrupt governments in order to improve the effectiveness of the EU's development policy. The EU is the world's largest aid donor. The African Union estimates that corruption accounts for 25% of Africa's annual GDP - around $148 bn - and is stifling the continent's chances of taking off economically.
The report, drafted by Max van den BERG (PES, NL), stresses that all actors have a role to play in the fight against corruption: politicians, government officials, civil society, media and multinationals. The international community can also play a part. Parliament urges EU Member States to ratify the OECD Convention on the Bribery of Public Officials (1997) and the UN Convention against Corruption (2003).
MEPs would like to go further and they ask the Commission and the Member States to establish an "international system of blacklisting to prevent banks from lending large sums of money to corrupt regimes or individuals representing a government".
What the developing countries can do
MEPs want national parliaments which, like those in the EU, have budgetary powers to have greater influence in the supervision of public finances. They underline the need for civil society in developing countries to establish watchdogs, with a system of checks and balances on governments. The Commission, they say, should support this process by reserving part of budget aid for such watchdogs.
What Europe can do
The report calls for more transparency in the European Union's aid budget programmes, with the publication of information on the aid spent in each recipient country. It also recommends that "budget aid should always be earmarked for a specific sector, reducing the risk of corruption or mismanagement of funds". Increasingly at present, EU development aid goes directly into the national coffers of recipient countries in the form of budget support, and the proportion has grown from 14% in 2001 to around 30% in 2004.
Finally, MEPs call on Member States, with major financial centres on their territory, to take legal and administrative measures to ensure that funds acquired illegally are repatriated to their country of origin. Africa is still a net exporter of capital to European countries. Text adopted

Work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2005 - aid levels to developing countries too low
2006-04-10 - 09:54
MEPs adopted an own-initiative report by Thierry CORNILLET (ALDE, FR) on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) in 2005.
Parliament welcomes the conclusion of the negotiations on amending the Cotonou Agreement, but regrets that the agreement reached at the Brussels Summit of 15 and 16 December 2005, bringing the amount allocated to the 10th European Development Fund (EDF) (2008-2013) to €22 682 million remains short of the initial proposals aimed at maintaining the same level of aid as under the 9th EDF.
MEPs support the request of the ACP-EU JPA, expressed at its 9th session in April 2005 in Bamako (Mali), that a suitable proportion of EDF appropriations should be used for the political education and training of parliamentarians and of political, economic and social leaders, in the interests of a lasting strengthening of good governance, the rule of law, democratic structures, and the interaction between government and opposition in pluralistic democracies based on free elections.
Parliament calls for greater transparency with regard to the progress and the substance of the negotiations on the economic partnership agreements as well as delivery of substantial assistance in line with President Barroso’s commitment, in Gleneagles, to provide EUR 1 billion in ‘aid for trade’
On sugar, the House notes that the EU package of compensation and restructuring measures for the EU sugar industry exceeds €7 billion and urges that the 18 ACP signatories to the Sugar Protocol, many of whose economies depend almost entirely on sugar, receive timely and substantial financial support, which must be additional to existing commitments.
MEPs call the JPA members and the European Co-secretariat to do everything they can to strengthen the role and the position of the JPA within the European Parliament.
The House congratulates the UK Presidency and the Scottish authorities on their excellent contribution to the 10th JPA in Edinburgh, particularly to the workshops on the following subjects:
- meeting the MDGs on health through research and development,
- protecting the environment: ecotourism and sustainable energy,
- fishing and fish processing: EU policies and standards
Finally, MEPs call on the Austrian Presidency and the Bureau of the European Parliament to make the necessary arrangements for the organisation of the 11th session in Vienna (Austria), from 17 to 22 June 2006, and of the 12th session in Bridgetown (Barbados), from 18 to 24 November 2006.

Belarus : "The last dictatorship in Europe"
2006-04-10 - 09:54
Parliament adopted a joint resolution on the situation in Belarus after the presidential elections. The resolution "strongly condemns the failed Presidential elections" and criticises the Russian reaction to them, was put forward by the PES, UEN, EPP-ED, ALDE and Greens/EFA groups. It describes the Lukashenko regime as "the last dictatorship in Europe".
The House denounced the elections of 19 March 2006 as "not having fulfilled the required international standards of free, fair, equal, accountable and transparent elections". Consequently, it will not recognise any legitimacy in President Lukashenko's leadership, and therefore calls on a repeat of the Presidential elections "in compliance with international democratic standards". MEPs were "appalled by the positive reactions of the Russian State Duma and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, to the conduct of the presidential elections in Belarus and their outcome", and correspondingly urge the Council and Commission to "raise the issue of Belarus with the Russian authorities so as to define a common responsibility for bringing about concrete democratic changes in that country and stop the political repression and human rights violations".
While the MEPs welcome the Council's decision to add President Lukashenko to the visa ban list, they call for an expansion of the list "to include representatives of the Belarus local, regional and national authorities who were involved in breaching the human rights and political freedoms of Belarusian citizens during and after the electoral campaign". Furthermore they call for further pressure on the Lukashenko regime through the use of "smart sanctions - severely affecting the perpetrators of oppression without adding any further suffering to the citizens of Belarus" as well as "an international freezing of the assets of Belarusian authorities abroad, restrictive measures against companies directly and personally linked to senior officials of the regime and the freezing of the personal assets of President Lukashenko and his close advisors". MEPs therefore advise all financial assistance to be directed towards citizens, organisations and enterprises not associated with the government.
The resolution recommends more support for the Belarusian citizens through the creation of "visa facilitation regime" and to "fund additional educational exchange programmes for Belarusian young people who have been expelled from their universities for political reasons". It also recommends a strengthening of the independent media "in order to help Belarusian citizens obtain impartial and accurate information about their country and the world".
The House "calls on the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the EU Member States to set up an international commission to investigate the disappearance of Yuri Zakharenko, Victor Gonchar, Anatoly Krasovsky and Dmitry Zavadski." Text adopted

Ukraine, MEPs say, on firm path towards democracy
2006-04-10 - 09:54
"The Ukraine is firmly on the path towards becoming a mature democracy". This is the view expressed in a joint resolution adopted by the European Parliament in Strasbourg Plenary. The resolution on the Parliamentary elections in the Ukraine was put forward by l the PES, EPP-ED, ALDE, GUE/NGL, UEN and the Greens/EFA groups. It welcomed the fact that the Ukrainian elections were held in a "satisfactory manner fully in accordance with international electoral standards".
Despite noting the "shortcomings of the elections", the House congratulates the people of Ukraine on "their commitment to the democratic process in their country". In response to this commitment, it urges the newly elected Government to "fully commit themselves to the irreversibility of this democratic process and to unreservedly continue and strengthen the political, social and economic reforms".
Concerning the EU's role, the resolution calls for the Commission and Council to advance its support for the "further democratic development of Ukraine" and to begin "to negotiate an Association Agreement between the European Communities and Ukraine" in view of the expiration of the current Agreement in 2008. It also calls on the Member States to "undertake similar initiatives and projects to provide concrete support, contributing to a continuation of the democratisation and reform process" and for neighbouring States to "refrain from any economic or other pressure to change the democratically decided further political, social and economic development of the country".
MEPs look forward to "increased cooperation with the newly elected Verkhovna Rada and to a sustained transition process in Ukraine that will bring the country closer to the objective of ever more intensive cooperation with the European Union" as well as to a " visa-facilitation agreement between the EU and Ukraine with the final goal of a non-visa regime". The resolution expresses a hope that the Ukraine can make progress in its attempt to become a full member of the WTO, and that the Commission will "respect all actions geared to realising Ukraine's European aspirations."

Refugees in Malta - MEPs deplore unacceptable living conditions
2006-04-10 - 09:54
In adopting a joint resolution on the situation of refugees in Malta, MEPs firmly believe that Malta and other EU Member States must respect their obligations under international law as regards asylum seekers. Parliament deplores the unacceptable living conditions of the migrants and asylum seekers in Malta’s administrative detention centres. Moreover, the House recognises the difficulties encountered by Malta in managing the migration emergency of the last few years.
MEPs express their solidarity with the Maltese population, the asylum seekers and immigrants held, the Maltese authorities and the police forces, who are confronted with a considerable problem, in view of the size of Malta and its population and the fact that Malta is not the final destination of migrants and asylum seekers. The House commends the transparency of the Maltese authorities, who allowed the delegation from the Civil Liberties Committee and the press free access to Malta’s administrative detention centres.
The House calls on the Maltese authorities to reduce substantially the length of time migrants are held. MEPs call for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and NGOs to be given total access to the closed holding centres. The House calls on the competent NGOs to ensure a permanent presence in these centres in order to ensure access to medical and legal assistance. The House urges that the Member States should establish access to the asylum application procedure and apply the provisions of the Directive on minimum standards for granting and withdrawing refugee status in a consistent and rigorous manner and that they should ensure that asylum applications are processed swiftly and efficiently. MEPs call on the Maltese authorities to apply Directive 2003/9/EC laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers, especially as regards life in the holding centres. Parliament calls for a larger role for the European Union in the management of humanitarian emergencies linked to migratory flows and asylum seekers.
The House calls on the Council to hold an extraordinary meeting of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in Malta as soon as possible to take account of the need to take urgent and immediate measures to address the anticipated upsurge in numbers of irregular migrants arriving in Malta over the summer months, whilst at the same time finding a suitable solution to the current difficulties.
MEPs call on the Council and the Member States to supply practical aid for Malta:
– by sending groups of experts, including independent experts, to provide assistance in granting asylum-seeker status, and
– by sending groups of experts, including independent experts, to provide advice on compliance with Directive 2003/9/EC on the reception of asylum seekers;
Parliament calls on the Commission to propose, as soon as possible, the creation of an emergency fund to tackle humanitarian crises in the Member States and to incorporate in the new funds for the period 2007-2013 an emergency mechanism allowing financial assistance to be provided in emergency situations.
Finally, MEPs urge the Commission to take the initiative as soon as possible with a view to revising Regulation 343/2003, ‘Dublin II’, by calling into question its very principle, namely that the Member State responsible for dealing with an asylum application is the first country that applicants reach, which puts an intolerable burden on the countries situated in the south and east of the EU, and by introducing a fair mechanism for sharing responsibilities among the Member States.

Agriculture
MEPs throw a lifeline to poultry farmers
2006-04-10 - 09:54
The European Parliament plans to help EU chicken farmers facing a sharp drop in consumption due to the outbreak of avian flu. MEPs support Commission efforts to extend compensation not just for those directly affected by the virus, but also for farmers suffering due to the "serious disturbances" on EU markets.
Parliament approved a Commission proposal in Strasbourg Plenary that would create a legal base for compensating farmers who have been hurt by the sudden decrease in consumer demand for eggs and poultry meat.
MEPs adopted a few amendments to the proposal. These included explicit mention of emergency vaccination as an alternate method of stamping out the disease, a wish to restrict the emergency measures to "circumstances that pose a threat to livelihoods," and a call to avoid "inflicting unnecessary suffering on animals." MEPs also call for an "information campaign designed to re-establish consumer confidence," and took the opportunity presented by this proposal to express their view that "export refunds are not a valid means of remedying market disturbances."
With the recent spread of avian influenza throughout the European Union, consumer demand for eggs and poultry meat has declined sharply. In some countries, (such as Italy), this decrease has reached up to 70 per cent, drastically lowering poultry farmers' incomes. Currently, the Commission can only offer EU aid to those farmers directly affected by bird flu, such as through compensation for culling stocks, or by paying for losses incurred due to restrictions on the circulation of products because of measures to combat the disease.
The Commission proposal would change the relevant regulation by allowing compensation for "serious market disturbances directly attributed to a loss in consumer confidence due to public health, or animal health risks". The support would benefit from 50% community co-financing. The proposal as approved by Parliament will now be discussed at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council, to be held on April 25th. European ministers are expected to quickly reach a decision, so the new regulation is likely to come into force in the first half of May. Text adopted

Human rights
Human rights in Darfur, Iraq and Egypt
2006-04-10 - 09:54
As usual, the final debates of the plenary session were devoted to three current issues of human rights around the world. On this occasion, Parliament adopted resolutions on the situation in Darfur, on the Assyrian community in Iraq and the situation in prisons there, and on the case of gaoled Egyptian opposition politician Ayman Nour.
Darfur - Parliament calls for UN action
In a resolution on Darfur, adopted by 76 votes in favour, none against and no abstentions, Parliament deplores the continuation of violence and rape by all sides, and condemns the Government of Sudan's continued support for the Janjaweed militia. It urges the United Nations Security Council to meet to address the violence in Darfur, which is tantamount to genocide, and to act on its responsibility to protect civilians by drafting a clear mandate under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, on or before 1 October 2006 (following the expiry of the mandate of the African Union mission in Darfur on 30 September 2006). It calls on the UN Security Council to extend the arms embargo in Darfur throughout Sudan and support the African Union's efforts in Darfur to reach full operational capacity and to robustly interpret its mandate to protect civilians until the transition to a UN mission.
MEPs underline that the mandate of the AMIS force has primarily been to observe violations of the humanitarian ceasefire agreement. They criticise the international community for not having acted to protect civilians sooner and call upon EU Member States to honour the commitments they have already made to provide military observers, staff officers and civilian police to increase security in Darfur and to ensure that the current AMIS mission is adequately funded and equipped to enable it to interpret its limited mandate as broadly as possible.
Parliament welcomes the decisions taken by the UN Security Council in March on a ban on offensive flights in Darfur. It calls for an effectively enforced no-fly zone across Darfur. It further calls on the EU, the US and other international actors to take all necessary action to help end impunity by enforcing the Security Council sanctions regime and seeking for this regime to include targeted sanctions against individuals who obstruct the deployment of the UN force and otherwise contribute to abuses of civilians.
MEPs call for the international community to support the International Criminal Court's investigation into violations of international humanitarian and human rights law in Darfur. They join the UNHCR in calling for an end to forced conscription of Sudanese refugees in Chad and also call for the implementation of a Chad-Sudan border monitoring force, as foreseen in the accord signed by the Presidents of the two countries on 10 February 2006. They strongly criticise the Government of Sudan for preventing Jan Egeland, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, from visiting Darfur.
Parliament asks the African Union to continue to play a leading role in the Abuja peace talks, and for all those involved in the talks to work to achieve these ends. It calls on the Government of Sudan to work alongside the NGO community for the benefit of its people and urges the Government to revise the Organisation of Voluntary and Humanitarian Work Act 2006 to bring it into line with international human rights standards. MEPs insist that Sudan's Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC) facilitate the issuing of visas and travel permits to humanitarian workers and stop the harassment of international NGOs; they criticise the lack of independence of the HAC from the Government of Sudan;
Parliament calls on the Government of Sudan to release Ms Amouna Mohamed Ahmed, Ms Fayza Ismail Abaker, Ms Houda Ismail Abdel Rahman and Ms Zahra Adam Abdela while their case is investigated and considers that these girls should be given appropriate care as victims of attempted rape.
Finally, MEPs criticise Russian and Chinese efforts to block UN Security Council actions over Darfur. They urge the international community to exert more pressure on these countries in order to prevent their economic interests in oil and arms sales from undermining efforts to bring peace to Darfur.
Iraq: Situation in prisons and the Assyrian community
Parliament's resolution on Iraq was adopted by 86 votes in favour to 1 against and 1 abstention. It covers two issues: the situation of the Assyrian community and Iraqi prisons.
Regarding the Assyrian community (Chaldeans, Syriacs and other Christian minorities) MEPs strongly condemn all acts of violence against them. They urge the Iraqi authorities and the Multi-National Force (MNF-I) to find the perpetrators of these serious crimes and bring them to justice as soon as possible. MEPs urge Iraq’s authorities to protect the Assyrians from discrimination, in accordance with their international obligations.
Parliament urges Iraq’s authorities to improve the security situation of the Assyrians and to facilitate the return and resettlement of Assyrian refugees in a secure environment where their customs and way of life are respected. It calls for the involvement of the Christians in Iraq in the reconstruction and administration of their land and villages in Northern Iraq and elsewhere in the region in order to preserve their cultural, religious and ethnic identity within one undivided country.
MEPs strongly support calls by most Iraqi political and religious leaders for restraint and urges the communities in Iraq to come together in a spirit of dialogue and mutual respect; expresses its full support for the efforts of the UN in promoting intercommunal dialogue within the framework of a national dialogue; welcomes the initiative by the League of Arab States to hold a second conference on national reconciliation with the participation of all Iraqi communities. They urge the Constitutional Committee of the Iraqi Council of Representatives to preserve the cultural and religious rights of all Iraqi communities in its proposals for a constitutional amendment.
MEPs call on the Commission and the Council to take all necessary measures to assist and protect the Assyrians.
Regarding prisons is Iraq Parliament expresses its concern at the conditions of detention in prisons and other places of detention in Iraq. It reaffirms its condemnation of the use of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of prisoners and calls on the Iraqi authorities and the MNF-I to ensure that conditions of detention conform to international standards for the treatment of prisoners. It further calls on them to release immediately the identities of all remaining detainees and to ensure that they have access to legal counsel and prompt access to their families, and are informed of the reasons for their detention, as well as to put in place adequate safeguards to protect detainees from torture and ill-treatment: by ensuring that all allegations of such abuse are subject to prompt, thorough and independent investigation and that any military, security or other officials found to have used, ordered or authorised torture are brought to justice; by ensuring that detainees are able effectively to challenge their detention before a court and are subject to due process; by prosecuting all those currently held without charge for internationally recognisable criminal offences or else releasing them.
MEPs welcome the ongoing investigations carried out by the MNF-I into allegations of abuse of prisoners and the inspection of places of detention throughout the country carried out by the Iraqi authorities. They also welcome the fact that more inspections are underway and that UNAMI encourages this process. Parliament calls on the MNF-I and the Iraqi authorities to grant the International Committee of the Red Cross unfettered access to all British and US detention facilities.
Parliament supports the continuing efforts of the Iraqi Ministry of Human Rights to uphold high standards, including for people under detention and the EU’s Integrated Rule of Law Mission for Iraq (EUJUST LEX). It notes that the Iraqi authorities have requested that the mission be extended beyond the end of its current mandate and the scope of the training provided expanded. MEPs urge the Commission and the Council to extend the mission beyond the end of its current mandate and to expand the scope of the training provided to include forensic policing.
Parliament calls on the Iraqi Council of Representatives to ratify the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and calls on the Commission, the Council and the Member States to make further contributions to the strengthening of human rights and the rule of law in Iraq.
Egypt - call to free Ayman Nour
MEPs adopted a resolution by 87 votes in favour, none against and no abstentions on the case of the leader of Egypt's El Ghad Party and former member of parliament Ayman Nour and other defendants were arrested after Dr Nour had stood in the last presidential elections and also in the parliamentary elections of November and December 2005, during which intimidation of Dr Nour's supporters was witnessed. Ayman Nour, who came second in the last presidential elections, has been sentenced to 5 years' imprisonment for allegedly falsifying some of the 50 signatures needed to register his party. Parliament is disturbed by reports that Dr Nour's health has seriously declined due to the hunger strike on which he has embarked in protest at the conditions of his trial and detention.
Parliament stresses the importance of Egypt and EU-Egypt relations for the stability and development of the Euro-Mediterranean area, and welcomes the process of political reform which the Egyptian authorities have undertaken to pursue. It says that respect for human rights is a fundamental value of the EU-Egypt Association Agreement and reaffirms the importance of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership for promoting the rule of law and fundamental freedoms.
MEPs call on the Egyptian authorities to act in accordance with the laws of Egypt in the spirit of its professed desire for increased political openness and dialogue, while recalling nevertheless the political context in which this trial is taking place. They urge the Egyptian Government to reform the legal framework, regulating elections in accordance with international standards providing for freedom and transparency, as well as enabling political groups to be founded and civil society organisations to be represented.
Parliament calls on the Council and the Commission to devise practical arrangements in cooperation with the European Parliament for regular assessments of compliance with Article 2 by all contracting parties to the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement, with a view to bringing about verifiable progress, in particular with regard to regular and impartial monitoring of developments in the field of human rights and the extent to which human rights activists and opposition leaders, such as Dr Ayman Nour, are free to act and speak out. It therefore calls for Dr Nour to be released.
MEPs stress the positive and moderate role that Egypt plays in the Middle East peace process; calls on the Commission and the Council to strengthen this role. It calls on the Egyptian Government to establish precise timetables and benchmarks in order to effectively monitor the progress of the implementation of the Action Plan and thereby involve and consult organisations working within the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network. MEPs urge the Commission and the Egyptian Government to include in the Action Plan the creation of a specific Sub-Committee on Human Rights in the framework of the EU-Egypt Association Agreement and to establish an efficient monitoring mechanism for the Action Plan once it is adopted.
Parliament says the lifting of the Emergency Laws is an absolute necessity if democracy is to be respected. It strongly supports measures to guarantee academic freedom, freedom of the media and private religious belief, putting an end to discrimination between citizens on grounds of sex, religion, race or any other grounds, to be included in the Action Plan. MEPs are worried, however, about the growing role of fundamentalism in this area.
They say the Action Plan should include concrete, measurable and time-bound commitments even if this means prolonging the negotiations beyond the proposed date for the meeting of the EU-Egypt Association Council, scheduled to take place on 12 June. They call in particular, on the Commission and the Egyptian Government to tackle in the Action Plan sensitive issues such as the lifting of the state of emergency, the prevention of and the fight against torture, the abolition of arbitrary detention and the reinforcement of the judiciary's independence.
MEPs call on the Egyptian Parliament to engage in a process of democratisation, and of enforcement of the rule of law and human rights with a view to it playing a leading role in the region as a future model of parliamentary democracy. Finally, they recall their request in a resolution in January to have a follow-up on the conditions and the situation of Sudanese refugees who were subjected to violence in Cairo on 30 December 2005.
