Italian President Giorgio Napolitano and EP President Poettering
The long awaited report into CIA activities in Europe was a key event on Wednesday. The report adopted by MEPs noted that the CIA operated more than 1,245 flights in European airspace over a four year period and that secret detention centres may have been located in US military bases. Later, MEPs adopted resolutions on the Lisbon strategy and climate change. The Italian President also addressed the House.
The CIA report says that some of these flights were used for the "illegal transportation of detainees" - the practice known as "extraordinary renditions". As well as the detention centres the report notes that renditions "in the majority of cases involved incommunicado detention and torture” during interrogations. This was confirmed to the Committee of MEPs by the victims and their lawyers.
In the report the Parliament rejects extraordinary renditions “as an illegal instrument used by the USA in the fight against terrorism” and condemns the “acceptance and concealing of the practice, on several occasions, by the secret services and governmental authorities of certain European countries”.
The report calls for EU members to consider an "independent inquiry" into what occurred.
Italian President backs Constitution
Italian President and former MEP Giorgio Napolitano used an address to MEPs to urge them to support the existing EU Constitution and not be tempted into renegotiation. He said the need for stronger institutions and united Europe was contained in the Treaty and renegotiation would be like opening a "Pandora's box".
Mr Napolitano noted that challenges Europe faced were energy issues and the environment although he said that with the "present institutional framework I don't think....we can go much further".
Lisbon agenda
Every spring EU leaders meeting to discuss the Lisbon strategy which aims at generating economic growth and job creation in the EU. Ahead of this meeting on March 8-9 MEPs passed a resolution highlighting some areas they believe deserve consideration.
These include balancing the flexibility demanded by employers with the security workers would like. MEPs also want more focus on education and training. They also noted that protection of intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Finally they state that an EU common energy policy is vital if the goals of Lisbon are to be achieved.
Also on the agenda at the Summit is climate change: MEPs adopted a resolution yesterday in response to the European Commission's "energy and climate package" announced in January 2007.
The resolution calls for a limit in the global temperature rise to 2°C above pre-industrialisation levels and for industrialised countries to reduce emissions by 30% my 2020 in comparison with 1990 levels.
Wine reform
The Commission proposals to reduce vineyard capacity across Europe by cutting the amount of vines and storage of surplus wines was the subject of a report discussed by MEPs yesterday.
Drafted by Socialist Greek Katerina Batzeli it criticises the Commission plans as too radical and likely to lead to standardisation of wine by large producers.
Her report recommends reform in two phases 2008-2011 and 2012-2015. The key words in the report are prudence and gradual. These include rebalancing the market, gradual elimination of the modes of distillation, a careful approach as regards the digging up of vines and a progressive liberalization of the rights of plantation. MEPs vote on the report today.
