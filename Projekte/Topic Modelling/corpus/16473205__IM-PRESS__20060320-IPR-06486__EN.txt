Financial perspective: agreement on the figures postponed
Budget
2006-03-22 - 16:41
Important progress was made at the third trialogue on the financial perspective on Tuesday but two key issues remain: the total figure for the budget for 2007-2013 and the level of funding for the flexibility instrument. A fourth meeting, which should be decisive, is scheduled for 4 April in Strasbourg.
Parliament and the Council still differ over the total amount for the next financial perspective: the EP negotiating team wants an extra €12 billion on top of the €862.4 billion proposed by the Council at the summit in December 2005. This figure is regarded as "necessary" by MEPs to fund a range of policies with a high "Community added value" such as education, research, transeuropean networks and crossborder cooperation.
Parliament also wants an increase in the flexibility instrument, which is used for unforeseen eventualities. MEPs believe the current annual figure of €200 million is insufficient in the light of the experience of the budget framework for 2000-2006, a period during which "flexibility" has been needed on many occasions.
Among the points on which progress was made, Parliament and the Council agreed on a package of declarations which meet the demands of MEPs on subjects such as the 2008-2009 review of the budget, the revision of the Financial Regulation and "certification" (paving the way for better scrutiny of Community expenditure in the Member States).
The negotiating teams will meet again on 4 April in Strasbourg, at a meeting which is expected to be decisive. In the meantime Parliament will not vote at its plenary session of 22 and 23 March on the resolution abrogating the current Interinstitutional Agreement, a step which would force a reversion to the budgetary provisions of the Treaty, thereby giving Parliament more scope to allocate funding to the policies on which it has the final say (non-compulsory expenditure).
