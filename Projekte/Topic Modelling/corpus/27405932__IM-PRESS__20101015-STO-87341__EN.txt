Strikes in Belgium and France : Despite strikes in France and Belgium, MEPs arrived on time for the plenary on Monday. Trains and flights were cancelled and some fuel stations were blocked. Public transport was also disturbed in Strasbourg during the week due to demonstrations. In the end, everything ran smoothly and the plenary was able to stick to the agenda.
Blue ribbon against poverty : Many events around poverty issues took place this week in and around the plenary. The link between all them was a small blue ribbon that President Buzek, MEPs and civil servants wore on their jackets. A giant ribbon was also installed in the Parliament's courtyard to remind visitors about this issue.
The EP also adopted a resolution on the minimum incomes to fight poverty , proposing minimum income schemes to be pitched at 60% of the median income of the country concerned.
Ban Ki-moon: Addressing the plenary on Tuesday (19 October) the UN Secretary-General outlined three key goals: tackle poverty, climate change and nuclear disarmament.
Maternity leave: After long negotiations the EP voted at its first reading for an extension of the minimum of paid maternity leave to 20 weeks (going beyond the EC's proposal of 18 weeks). MEPs also approved paid paternity leave of at least two weeks. During the debate the rapporteur, Portuguese Socialist Edite Estrela, said: "Maternity can no longer be regarded as an illness or a burden on society" - "This is an investment in our future". The proposal now goes to Member States in Council.
Decisions on External Action: MEPs changed the EU's financial and staff rules needed for the European External Action Service to be launched. A bouquet of flowers from Jerzy Buzek to Foreign Policy Chief Catherine Ashton symbolised the end of the long negotiations on the Service. Also in the spotlight were preparations for G20 summit and European Council meeting.
Spotlight on human rights: EP's President welcomed decision to award this year's Nobel Peace Prize to imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo, urging China to release him and other human rights campaigners. The Parliament's own Sakharov prize was awarded to Cuban dissident Guillermo Fariñas.

The report proposes to establish a European monetary fund and European bonds.
Late payments: invoices to be paid within 30 months: The standard deadline for paying bills will be 30 days, following an agreement with the Council endorsed by Parliament in plenary session on Wednesday. The new rules should ensure that small firms no longer face financial problems due to the late payment of bills by public authorities or companies, helping bolster solvency, innovation and jobs.
Tight draft budget for 2011: The EP is calling for more EU investment in research, innovation, education and energy to help pull Europe out of the crisis. In spite of the many more jobs the EU has to do since the Lisbon Treaty came into force, the EP voted a restrictive overall spending level for next year's EU budget, with a less than 1% increase over 2010.
Buzek: Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek marked the mid term of his mandate by reviewing progress in priority areas. They include the European energy community, external action, human rights and the budget. He also talked about the EP's role in tackling the economic crisis, solidarity among EU countries and institutional changes. On human rights he said: "I know that behind me stand 735 defenders of human rights, and behind you stand 500 million more!"
ACTA - Intellectual Property: Parliament debated the controversial new multilateral Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). Planned as a new multilateral agreement between the EU and other countries such as the US, Canada, Japan, Australia and Mexico, it aims at combating infringements of intellectual property rights, for example the piracy of music, films and clothing. MEPs demanded then that no personal searches should be conducted at EU borders and opposed any kind of internet disconnection penalty for three online copyright infringements.
