Parliament calls on the Commission to promote non-food crops in Europe, to increase the Union's production of energy crops, biofuels, biomass, pharmaceutical crops and speciality chemicals. It also asked for more research into alternative technologies, and a public information campaign to promote ecological awareness.
The own-initiative report by Neil PARISH (EPP-ED, UK) on the promotion of crops for non-food purposes was approved by 471 votes in favour 12 against and 12 abstentions. The report stresses " the importance of making the targets in Directive 2003/30/EC on biofuels obligatory ," in order to increase demand for energy crops. MEPs also urged the Commission to " increase substantially the maximum area eligible for additional aid and the level of payment ," and pointed to its recent demand that " aid granted in respect of land used to grow energy crops to be increased to â‚¬ 80 per year, on the basis of a maximum guaranteed area of 2 200 000 hectares ."
The Parliament also asks the Commission to " consider putting in place qualified market access arrangements from biofuel imports from third countries, such as Brazil ," to allow a European industry to emerge. It also called on Member States to organise " publicity campaigns targeted at the younger generation, in particular, in whom an ecological awareness must be cultivated ."
Besides energy crops for biofuel production, the House also wished to encourage the production of speciality chemicals (to replace non-biodegradable products), pharmaceutical crops (for instance to produce vaccines), and raw materials for the textile and cosmetics industries. Finally, the report underlines the potential in using organic waste to grow energy crops which could then, in turn, be used for heating, cooling and electricity.
