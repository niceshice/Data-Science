Speaking on the indications of a positive result of the Irish referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon on Saturday 3 October, European Parliament President Jerzy Buzek declared his satisfaction that Europe is back on track.
President Buzek made the following statement:
"I strongly welcome the result of the Irish referendum. The Irish people have demonstrated true commitment to the European project. They reconfirmed their desire to be in the heart of Europe. This is good news for Ireland and good news for Europe.
The EU will become more effective and our cooperation more fruitful.
But it is not the end of the story. Now we must start to work to overcome the difficulties. Our citizens are concerned about energy issues, raising unemployment, migration and demographic problems. We can do it together in the future, as we did in the past. All based on the principle of solidarity.
We should not forget about those who chose to vote no. It is our habit and it is our custom to think about all Europeans. I can assure that I will work very hard to make you feel that this is our common Europe.
Let us write our common European history together. "
The President was in Ireland on 8 September, where he called for fair and informed debate on the Lisbon Treaty.
