Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection
The single market in financial services (share dealing, banking, insurance, mortgages, personal loans and other products) is of great benefit to the EU economy. Barriers to access to cross-border financial services are gradually being lifted. However, any new measures, such as the new legislation on consumer credit recently adopted by the European Parliament, must ensure that consumers receive information about their rights and that effective redress procedures are in place for settling disputes. Education is also needed to discourage consumers from taking on too much debt. Before debating an own-initiative on this subject, members of the EP Internal Market Committee will hear from experts invited by rapporteur Iliana Iotova (PES, Bulgaria). They will discuss topics including education programmes aimed at consumers. 15:00 18:30 Brussels, ASP 1G3 overspill room ASP 1A2 2008-06-03 The President's diary . 18:30 - Meeting with the winners of the Youth Charlemagne Prize 18:30 19:30 Brussels Press conferences . 11:00 - Language status in the EU - right of citizens to access EU institutions in their own languages - Mikel IRUJO AMEZAGA (Greens/EFA, ES), Jill EVANS (Greens/EFA, UK) and Lorena LOPEZ de la CALLE, Deputy Minister for Languages, Culture and Sport of the Basque Country

Committee on Budgetary Control
This hearing looks at the on-the-spot situation and the implementation of structural programmes and projects.
The €308-billion structural funds programmes (total amount for 2007-2013) are implemented under shared management between the Member States and the Commission. Most of the management and monitoring is carried out by the Member States.
For several years the Court of Auditors has drawn attention to serious weaknesses in the Member States' management and control systems.
This hearing will give the chance to Member States representatives and other key stakeholders from the Commission to voice views on the current functioning of the structural funds. 09:00 12:30 Brussels, PHS 1A2 Programme of the event Future of social security systems and pensions: Their financing and the trend towards individualisation
Committee on Employment and Social Affairs
The Employment Committee will debate with academics and OECD experts how the financing of pensions, health care and other social schames can be secured in the future. Experts will present different financing options (e.g. social insurance vs. tax-based financing) and MEPs will discuss their impact on social security systems. The hearing will also address the question of how reforms of pension systems affect women and how poverty among older people can be prevented. The committee is currently drafting an own-initiative report on the future financing of social security systems and pensions. 09:30 12:00 Brussels, ASP 3E2 Programme of the event Lamfalussy Follow-up: Future Structure of Supervision
Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs
MEPs will hear from a range of experts on options for improving the EU's supervisory structure for financial services. The current arrangements, still largely decentralised, with national supervisory authorities cooperating in an effort to ensure consistent application of EU directives across the 27 Member States, may not be enough to prevent obstacles to cross-border activity via different national approaches to supervision - or when it comes to dealing with large multinational financial groups operating in a number of markets at the same time. The evidence given at the hearing will feed into the drafting of a report on the issue by Daniel Dăianu (ALDE, RO) and Ieke van den Burg (PES, NL). Those giving evidence are:
Tommaso Padoa - Schioppa - former Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance of Italy, President of Notre Europe;
Peter Praet - Executive Director, National Bank of Belgium; Chair of the Banking Supervision Committee of the ECB (BSC)
Michel Prada - Chairman of the Autorité des Marchés Financiers

Committee on Constitutional Affairs
The new Treaty provides the EU Institutions with new tools for communication with citizens.
Ahead of Genowefa GRABOWSKA's (PES, PL) report on "developing a civil dialogue under the Treaty of Lisbon", the Constitutional Affairs committee is organising a public hearing to discuss the topic with civil society representatives and academics. 15:00 19:30 Brussels, ASP 3E2 Programme of the event 2008-06-04 Plenary session Plenary agenda

On 14 January 2008, the Bureau of the European Parliament decided to honour the memory of Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya by naming after her Parliament’s press conference room in Brussels.
Anna Politkovskaya was widely acclaimed for her reporting from Chechnya and won a number of prestigious awards for her work. She was murdered at her apartment building in Moscow in October 2006, and so far no-one has been convicted of the crime.
Anna Politkovskaya was posthumously shortlisted for Parliament’s Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in 2007. At the same time as it chose to name Parliament’s new buildings in Brussels after József Antall (Hungarian Prime Minister 1990-93) and Willy Brandt (Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany 1969-74), the Bureau decided an appropriate way of acknowledging the work of Ms Politkovskaya would be to give her name to Parliament’s press conference room.
The President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering, will put the decision into practice by unveiling the new name plate of the room (PHS 0A050) at 16.30 on 4 June 2008. 16:30 17:30 Brussels, PHS 0A50 2008-06-05 Plenary session Plenary agenda
