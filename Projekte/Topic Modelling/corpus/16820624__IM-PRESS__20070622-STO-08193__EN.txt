European Youth Media Days in the European Parliament
Youth
2007-06-27 - 12:06
Over the next three days 270 young people from all across the Europe will assemble in the European Parliament in Brussels to take part in 'European Youth Media Days'. Those present will include young journalists, radio and TV producers, podcasters and bloggers. Through discussions and practical workshops their job is to rethink European media and work out ways that new forms of media can cooperate across Europe. On Friday some groups will have the opportunity to contribute to this website.
Hosted by the European Parliament and the European Youth Press those attending were selected from over 2000 applicants who submitted short films, articles or photos on the future of European media.
Wednesday: Reception and a chance to meet
The event formally begins at 1800 on Wednesday with Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering hosting an official reception for the 270 young media professionals. They will then have the chance to speak to some of the Parliament's senior staff involved in European communication and information policy. Journalists from prominent international news organisations will also be there to add their expertise. The opening can be seen live on this website from 1800 to 2000.
Thursday: political debate with MEPs
The core of a Parliament is the debate that is generated within it. On Thursday the media professionals will meet leaders of the Parliament's main political groups and MEPs from all 27 countries in the EU. Some of the issues that will dominate panel discussions include the Union's future constitutional shape, further expansion of the EU as well as foreign and security policy.
In the evening discussions continue, but in a different atmosphere as the young people are encouraged to explore other more "social" aspects of Brussels life with some of their hosts!
Friday: Production in media workshops
Creativity is a core goal of the Youth Media Days. A total of 22 workshops will set about creating new media products.
Each workshop will be based on a particular subject and a particular media area - for example radio, TV, websites, magazines and newspapers. To help this the Parliament is making available its "Voxbox" Multimedia‑studio to help the groups. All of the workshops will produce something tangible - something you can watch, read or look at.
To what extent the media can be used to "spy" on us will be the subject of a TV programme "Big Brother Europe is watching you" which will look at security and data protection. MEP Richard Corbitt who sits on Parliament's Civil Liberties Committee and Peter Hustinx the European Data Protection Supervisor will take part.
Website workshop: One of the workshops will represent a chance for some groups to write their own material for the Parliament's "Europarl" website. For a day and a half 22 groups will take over as Editors and produce some of thier own material in the Parliament's 22 languages. On Friday you will be able to read their what they produced here on the Parliament's site.
The event closes at Brussels City Hall at 1900 on Friday where much of what has been produced over the last two days will be on public display.
