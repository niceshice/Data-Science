The 70th anniversary of the invasions of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia by the USSR, the first anniversary of the Iranian presidential elections and last week's killing of Archbishop Padovese in Turkey were among subjects mentioned by European Parliament President Jerzy Buzek at the opening of this week's plenary session of the EP in Strasbourg.
Reminding the House that this weekend had seen the 70th anniversary of the invasions of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, Mr Buzek added that in 1983 the EP had condemned the annexation of these countries, which had never been recognised by the majority of states in the world.
Regarding the anniversary of the Iranian elections, Mr Buzek pointed out that 488 executions had taken place in the last 12 months and that thousands were still in jail, some facing the death penalty. The EP condemned the lack of freedom in Iran and was utterly opposed to the death penalty.
The murder in Turkey of Archbishop Luigi Padovese, whose funeral was taking place today in Milan, was a new link in a chain of murders in that part of the world, said Mr Buzek.
Turning to other matters, the President hailed the accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Union 25 years ago as a great success, and mentioned his own visit to Schengen last weekend to mark the anniversary of the Schengen agreement. He had also made official visits to Greece and Romania, where he had expressed support for these countries in the situation they faced.
Mr Buzek also voiced the hope that, following elections in Belgium, Slovakia and the Netherlands, these countries would be able to form governments swiftly.
Lastly, he welcomed to the European Parliament the new British Green MEP, Keith Taylor, who replaces Caroline Lucas.
