As the elections draw nearer many people are writing in to find out more In the run up to the June European elections, the Parliament's Citizens' Correspondence Unit has been deluged with mail asking questions about the elections. A bewildering array of enquiries have come from all 27 EU states, many of them about the date of the election. Take a look at the four most frequently asked questions this year:
Q. Who decides the election date in each country?
This is a European election, but each country gets to choose the date it will hold the election. There are two provisos - the election must be held between 4 and 7 June and the results are released only after the final polling station has been closed i.e. on Sunday 7 June.
Q. Will the polling date coincide with a national holiday?
Voting is always an enjoyable activity but the election does not fall on any bank holiday or national holiday.
Q. Will the date of the European election coincide with "D-Day" - the liberation of Western Europe on 6 June?
The famous events in Normandy in 1944 are of course a vital part of Europe's history but the European election date is not connected to these events. In France, where the allies landed - the election date is 7 June.
Q. Will the ballot take place everywhere on the same date?
No. Most countries vote on Sunday 7 June, but some vote on other days, for example, the UK and the Netherlands vote on Thursday 4 June, the Irish vote on Friday 5 June, Malta goes to the polls on Saturday 6 June and Italy votes on 6-7 June. The results however will all be available on the same day - 7 June.
This year the majority of enquiries about the election have come from the French.
