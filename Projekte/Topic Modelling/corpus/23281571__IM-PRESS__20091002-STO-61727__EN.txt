Making the choice easier? Eco label for tyres coming. ©Belga Last Thursday (1 October) saw an agreement that will lead to the introduction of more efficient tyres for cars and lorries that will cut fuel bills and CO2 emissions. The deal between Members of Parliament's Industry Committee and the Swedish EU presidency paves the way for the A-G labelling system from 2012. The increase in fuel efficiency could lead to a CO2 cut equivalent to 1.3 million cars off the road a year. We caught up with Belgian MEP Ivo Belet who led the negotiations.
What impact will the new rules on fuel efficient tyres have on the EU´s ambitions to reduce climate change?
Choosing better-quality tyres will contribute a lot to reaching our CO2 targets. Road transport is responsible for 25% of all CO2 emissions in Europe. Tyres can play an important role in reducing CO2 emissions because they are responsible for 20-30% of the total energy use of vehicles. For passenger cars, more energy efficient tires can save up to 10% on fuel costs.
The European car industry has been struggling to survive the financial crisis. Is it really the time to impose additional obligations on the car parts industry?
The new system is simple and clear. It provides the industry with no significant additional costs. We believe that the label will be picked up early by quality manufacturers; it works in their case as a recommendation.
How will the new rules affect the everyday lives of ordinary European citizens in practical terms?
The replacement of used tyres is good for 78% of tyres sold in Europe. Each of us thus has the possibility and responsibility to choose economical tyres. These are good for the environment and for your wallet.
Next steps
The compromise text agreed on Thursday still has to be formally approved by the Council before the full House gives its final endorsement. It is proposed that the labelling scheme will enter into effect by the end of 2012.
The move is part of the "Energy Efficiency Package" aimed at mobilising EU policy makers and market actors to make buildings, appliances, means of transport and energy systems more energy efficient in order to achieve the EU´s 2020 energy targets.
