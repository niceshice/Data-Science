Post-Briefing - 2-5 February 2009 - Strasbourg plenary session
2009-02-06 - 12:41
Opening of the session
At the opening, MEPs voted in favour of a UEN proposal to replace the debate on the Philippines with a debate on Brazil's refusal to deport Cesare Battisti to Italy, where he has been convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. Brazil has given Battisti political asylum, whereas the Italian foreign minister has said it is not acceptable to Brazil to treat Italy as a country which does not respect human rights. A debate and vote on the resolution on the refusal to extradite Cesare Battisti from Brazil took place on Thursday, 5 February and a summary of this is available in this publication.
Mahmoud Abbas at the European Parliament
The destruction wrought by the Israeli attacks on the people and infrastructure of Gaza was described by the President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas , in an impassioned speech to MEPs on Wednesday. He called on the international community to press Israel to take a new approach, saying the potential rewards were great for all sides. Mr Abbas, who was addressing a formal sitting of the House, began his speech by saying "I have come to you from Palestine, whose people are suffering from one of the longest military occupations in modern history". In his introductory remarks, EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering emphasised to the Palestinian president that, regarding "the tragedy in the Gaza strip", "the European Parliament did not remain silent. We demanded an immediate ceasefire. We condemned the disproportionate reaction" which had hit not only the armed forces of Hamas but also the civilian population. At the same time "we firmly condemned the provocations and firing of rockets by Hamas".
Guantánamo: European Parliament calls on EU Member States to accept inmates
In adopting a joint resolution, the European Parliament welcomed President Obama's decision to close Guantánamo Bay but recalled that the main responsibility for the closing and for the future of the prisoners rests with the United States. MEPs, nevertheless, called on the Member States to be prepared to accept Guantánamo inmates in the EU in case the US asks so. The resolution was adopted by 542 votes in favour, 55 against and 51 abstentions. In the joint debate which took plate on Tuesday (3 February),many MEPs called on Member States to facilitate the closure of the facility within one year (as announced by the new Obama administration) by accepting detainees while, at the same time, ensuring that detainees are not sent to countries where they could be persecuted. During this legislative period, MEPs repeatedly called on the US to close the Guantanamo camp.
MEPs support Kosovo's European perspective one year after independence
One year after Kosovo's independence, the European Parliament recalls the EU's willingness to assist the economic and political development of Kosovo through a clear European perspective, according to a resolution adopted by MEPs in Strasbourg. The resolution also recommends that the EU Member States which have not recognised the independence of Kosovo should do so. The resolution was adopted with 424 votes in favour, 133 against and 24 abstentions.
Legislation to crack down on employers of illegal immigrants
MEPs voted a package of amendments to the directive against the employment of illegal immigrants, but postponed formalising their position until the next plenary session. The sanctions directive sets out that employers of illegal immigrants would be penalised while the immigrants themselves would be granted legal conditions of employment. MEPs are calling for criminal law sanctions in the most serious cases and want to make companies responsible for the actions of their subcontractors. The final vote on the legislative resolution was postponed at the request of the rapporteur Claudio FAVA (PES, IT) to allow the addition of a declaration providing reassurance that this directive will not prevent further legislation on subcontractors.
Climate Change: 2050 - the future begins today: MEPs adopt key report
The European Parliament recommends detailed measures to be taken in key economic sectors to achieve a future EU integrated policy on climate change. MEPs take as basis the EU objective to keep the global average temperature increase below 2°C and call for a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 25 - 40 % to be achieved by 2020 and a reduction of at least 80 % to be achieved by 2050. The resolution was adopted with 570 votes in favour 78 against and 24 abstentions.
Sexual abuse of children: MEPs want to criminalise "grooming" on the Internet
"Grooming" and paedophile chat rooms on the Internet should be criminalised, sex crimes should be subject to an extraterritorial legislation, the EP says in a report adopted in Strasbourg. MEPs call on the EU to fund prevention programmes from its general budget. By adopting the report by 591 votes in favour, 2 against and 6 abstentions, MEPs call for the criminalisation of "all types of sexual abuse of children" including "grooming." (the action of soliciting children for sexual purposes).
MEPs debate support to the ailing automobile sector
Debating the effects of the financial crisis on the automobile industry after hearing statements from the Council and Commission, many MEPs called for support to the industry and on manufacturers to concentrate on green technology. Ministers have expressed deep concern about the serious situation that the sector is facing at present, putting at risk a very significant number of jobs. In 2008 there were about 8% fewer cars sold in the EU than in 2007. Thanks to the European industry's resilience and adaptability, "European cars today are among the best, safest, most innovative, competitive, fuel-efficient and environmentally sustainable in the world", said Czech Deputy Prime Minister for European Affairs Alexandr VONDRA for the Council Presidency.
MEPs adopt written declaration on the fight against Alzheimer's disease
The European Parliament has adopted a written declaration on priorities in the fight against Alzheimer’s disease. MEPs underlined that Alzheimer’s disease currently affects 6.1 million Europeans and that figure will double or triple between now and 2050 with the ageing of the population.
Energy security: EP adopts blueprint for the EU's future energy strategy
The European Parliament adopted a report by a large majority (406 votes in favour to 168 against and 87 abstentions) drawn up by Anne Laperrouze (ALDE, FR) on the "Second Strategic Energy Review", which will be on the agenda for the 19-20 March European Council debate on the EU's future energy strategy. MEPs call on the Commission and the Czech Presidency to present "a new ambitious and far-sighted diversification plan" to this meeting of the EU's Heads of State.
European Parliament urges Member States to fulfil their goals on childcare
The concept of intergenerational solidarity relates to childcare and the responsibility for the elderly and dependent. In the EU, the employment rate for women with dependent children is only 62.4% as compared with 91.4% for men. To maintain the principle of intergenerational solidarity, MEPs urge the Member States to achieve their commitments to introduce by 2010 childcare for 90% of children under the mandatory school age and call for a review of the work-life balance policies in the EU. The report adopted was an alternative motion for a resolution put forward by the Greens/EFA group and adopted with 358 votes in favour, 271 against and 28 abstentions replacing the original report from the Women's Committee.
Pre-commercial procurement an under-exploited driver of innovation
Pre-commercial procurement has significant potential to achieve high-quality and readily accessible public services, says the European Parliament in adopting a report by Malcolm HARBOUR (EPP-ED, UK). The House says that pre-commercial procurement constitutes an under-exploited driver of innovation-led growth for the EU. The report was adopted with 587 votes in favour, 12 against and 6 abstentions.
Parliament calls for proportionate regulation in general and business aviation
In adopting a report by Luís Queiró (EPP-ED, PT), the European Parliament "broadly welcomes" the Commission's communication of 11 January 2007 entitled "Agenda for Sustainable Future in General and Business Aviation", but stresses that the Commission must ensure that proportionality and subsidiarity principles are applied "in the design and implementation of both existing and futures aviation legislation".
Economic Partnership Agreements: making an impact on development
The report, drafted by Jürgen Schröder (EPP-ED, DE), urges the Council, the Commission and the governments of the EU Member States and ACP countries to "re-establish an atmosphere of confidence and constructive dialogue in so far as it has been damaged in the course of negotiations" and to "recognise the ACP states as equal partners in the negotiation and implementation process".
Security and safety of Internet transactions need to be strengthened, says European Parliament
More than half of EU citizens and nearly 1.5 billion people worldwide have access to the Internet. Yet, despite the fact that one out of three EU citizens conducts online purchases, only 30 million carry out cross-border shopping in the EU. In view of this, MEPs are demanding increased Internet security, simplified rules and specific measures for SMEs in a report adopted in Strasbourg with 562 votes in favour, 9 against and 10 abstentions. MEPs call on the Commission to investigate the causes and to redouble its efforts to "create mechanisms for strengthening businesses' and individuals' trust in international electronic payment systems, as well as establishing suitable means for resolving disputes related to illegal commercial practices".
Internationalisation of small and medium-sized businesses a priority of the European Parliament
SMEs account for 99% of the total number of businesses in the European Union, and create 75 million jobs, yet their international performance is "structurally weak". So says the European Parliament in a report which urges the Commission and Member States to enable EU SMEs to develop in a harmonious manner, gain access to new markets and to expand their export activities and internationalisation. The report was adopted with 437 votes in favour, 77 against and 69 abstentions.
EU and China: more co-operation, not protectionism say MEPs
In recent years, China has emerged as Europe's second largest trading partner. In 2007, Chinese exports to the EU - worth some €231bn - grew by 18.7%. The EU's trade deficit with China currently stands at €160bn and is continuing to rise. The report was adopted with 491 votes in favour, to 76 against and 12 abstentions. EU-China relations require greater co-ordination among the Member States and with the Commission. Noting an imbalance in bilateral trade between the two partners - notably through China's inobservance of sustainable development, environmental limits and WTO rules - MEPs call on China to meet its obligations and on the EU to provide assistance and promote co-operation.
Animal feed: MEPs approve deal with Council
Parliament approved a first-reading compromise reached with Council on plans to redraft existing EU rules on the authorising and labelling of animal feed. The aims are to preserve the customer's right to information while safeguarding the industry's intellectual property rights. The legislative resolution was adopted with 543 votes in favour, 8 against and 26 abstentions.
Detention centres for asylum seekers are "intolerable"
The report by Martine ROURE (PES, FR), adopted by a large majority, which draws on findings by the Civil Liberties Committee during visits to detention centres for asylum seekers and refugees, deplores the number of deficiencies within Member States, particularly with regard to legal aid and reception conditions. MEPs of the Civil Liberties Committee visited 12 Member States to ascertain whether minimum standards for asylum seekers were being applied.
Human rights: Conflict in Sri Lanka, persecution of Burmese refugees and the extradition of Cesare Battisti
Civilians caught in deadly crossfire between the Sri Lankan Government and rebel group Tamil Tigers, the persecution of the Rohingya people of Burma, and the refusal to extradite convicted murderer Cesare Battisti by the Brazilian authorities, were the subjects of three resolutions on democracy and human rights adopted at the end of this week's Strasbourg plenary session. 20090203BRI48111 Text adopted - 2-5 February 2009 Verbatim debates in plenary 2-5 February 2009 Draft Agenda for 18-19 February (Brussels plenary session)

Mahmoud Abbas at the European Parliament
2009-02-06 - 12:41
The destruction wrought by the Israeli attacks on the people and infrastructure of Gaza was described by the President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, in an impassioned speech to MEPs on Wednesday. He called on the international community to press Israel to take a new approach, saying the potential rewards were great for all sides. Mr Abbas, who was addressing a formal sitting of the House, began his speech by saying "I have come to you from Palestine, whose people are suffering from one of the longest military occupations in modern history".
He described the recent Israeli attacks on the infrastructure of Gaza, saying "the Israeli war has targeted first and foremost the livelihoods of my people, its infrastructure and its future, as well as the future of its Palestinian state for which we have long worked together and for the establishment of which we are still working".
He went on "You have heard the calls of men, the appeals of children and women who lost most of their family members" and added "along with those innocent victims fell the values of the human conscience".
In addition to the destruction of infrastructure, "this Israeli war has claimed the fruit of the blood and sweat of our Palestinian people, hundreds of thousands of Palestinian people who worked all their lives and lost the fruit of this work. It has also destroyed what the Palestinian National Authority has established over 15 years".
Settlements continue
The Palestinian president also complained that "The Israeli settlement has not stopped at all. The policies of settlement led to the continuation in building the wall of separation, as well as to an increase in roadblocks, checkpoints and barriers".
Above all, these Israeli incursions showed that there was "an aggression against the entire Palestinian people". The latest attacks were aimed at "separating Gaza from the rest of the Occupied Palestinian lands, and also at marginalising Gaza" and "preventing our people from attaining their ultimate goal: an end to occupation, gaining freedom and the right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state on the lands that were occupied in 1967, with Eastern Jerusalem as its capital".
It was essential to show that Israel is not "a state above accountability, above international and law", argued Mr Abbas. He called for all border crossings, not just Rafah, to be re-opened to allow the free flow of aid, goods and people.
Reconciliation among Palestinians, peace proposals
Turning to the subjects of national reconciliation among Palestinians and proposals for peace, the president said the Palestinian side had accepted the Egyptian working paper, but warned of the "regional forces and tendencies which support separation" and obstruct the Egyptian solution".
A key goal was to hold legislative elections and he hoped "you will help us in organising such elections", as well as supporting efforts to obtain the release of members of the Palestinian Legislative Council arrested by Israel.
However, while commending international efforts to reconstruct Gaza, Mr Abbas asked "how long Israel will be given a free hand to destroy the assets and infrastructure of Arab people?" The international community, he said, must prevail upon Israel to desist.
57 Islamic countries ready to normalise ties with Israel
He also pointed out that the Arab peace initiative, to which the Palestinians were committed, had become "an Islamic peace initiative", meaning that, in exchange for land for peace, 57 Islamic countries were "willing to normalise their relationships with Israel".
"This land is worth living for"
Concluding, Mr Abbas told MEPs that the Palestinian people "look forward to your support in their struggle to achieve their right to freedom and independence, to be able to build their future and to be able to give to their children their right to a safe life."
Lastly, he quoted the words of Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish, who died on 9 August 2008 and will be commemorated this evening at the European Parliament. The poet had said time and again "This land is worth living for".
EU can work with Palestinian government committed to peace, says President Pöttering
In his introductory remarks, EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering had emphasised to the Palestinian president that, regarding "the tragedy in the Gaza strip", "the European Parliament did not remain silent. We demanded an immediate ceasefire. We condemned the disproportionate reaction" which had hit not only the armed forces of Hamas but also the civilian population. At the same time "we firmly condemned the provocations and firing of rockets by Hamas".
Mr Pöttering said the EP wanted "a swift resumption of the peace negotiations" and he stressed that "internal Palestinian reconciliation is a pre-condition for peace between Israel and Palestine". Only a "government of national consensus" could ensure the unity of the Palestinian people. The European Union would be willing to work with such a government, prepared "to respect the basic principles of the peace process, to renounce violence and commit itself to peace negotiations with Israel". audio, 26:12- Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas audio, 26:12 original language Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas audio, 28:32 - Press Conference - President Pöttering and Palestinian President Abbas

Guantánamo: European Parliament calls on EU Member States to accept inmates
2009-02-06 - 12:41
In adopting a joint resolution, the European Parliament welcomes President Obama's decision to close Guantánamo Bay but recalls that the main responsibility for the closing and for the future of the prisoners rests with the United States. MEPs, nevertheless, call on the Member States to be prepared to accept Guantánamo inmates in the EU in case the US asks so, in a resolution adopted in Strasbourg and adopted with 542 votes in favour, 55 against and 51 abstentions. MEPs affirm that the responsibility for respect for international law and fundamental rights rests with all democratic countries, particularly the EU and its Member States, which together represent a community of values. MEPs call on the United States to ensure that Guantánamo detainees are granted their human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Option for detainees
On the situation of detainees, MEPs say that detainees against whom the United States has sufficient evidence should properly be tried without delay and, if convicted, imprisoned in the United States.
Those who are not to be charged and cannot be repatriated - real risk of torture or persecution in his home country - should be given the opportunity to be admitted to the United States and afforded redress. Those not charged and willing to go back voluntarily to their home country should be able to do so as quickly as possible, says the resolution.
MEPs also call on the Member States, should the United States administration so request, to cooperate in finding solutions, to be prepared to accept Guantánamo inmates in the EU. Member States have a duty of loyal cooperation to consult each other on possible repercussions on public security throughout the EU, says the resolution.
In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, in January 2002 the United States established a high-security detention facility at Guantánamo Bay (Cuba), where terrorist suspects have been detained .
Waterboarding
The inmates have been denied their fundamental human rights, notably the right of fair trial, and have been subjected to harsh interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding, which amounts to torture and cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment .
Number of prisoners
There are 242 prisoners left in Guantánamo and 62 of them will need to be resettled. Among these 62, 17 are Chinese-Muslim prisoners from the Uighur ethnic minority. Others come from Afghanistan (1), Algeria (10), Azerbaijan (1), Egypt (1), Ethiopia (1), Libya (6), Palestine (3), Russia (1), Syria (9), Tajikistan (1), Tunisia (10) and Uzbekistan (4).
Debate in plenary - 3 February 2009
MEPs debate the closure of Guantánamo Bay prisoner camp and CIA rendition flights
In the joint debate, many MEPs called on Member States to facilitate the closure of the facility within one year (as announced by the new Obama administration) by accepting detainees while, at the same time, ensuring that detainees are not sent to countries where they could be persecuted. During this legislative period, MEPs repeatedly called on the US to close the Guantánamo camp.
Czech Presidency of the Council
You, like the Council, will welcome President Obama's decision to close Guantánamo within a year", said Czech Deputy Prime Minister for European Affairs Alexander VONDRA for the Council Presidency. This decision had been "unequivocally welcomed" by EU ministers in the General Affairs Council, as had President Obama's decision to end special military commission trials, secret detention, and "enhanced interrogations" - and this should facilitate transatlantic co-operation in combating terrorism, he added.
"Guantanamo is primarily a US responsibility", but Member States could perhaps "help in practice", he said. This might include accepting detainees cleared for release, he added, but this possibility raises "political, legal and security issues" that must first be discussed with justice and home affairs ministers. "The Council will return to this issue once these are clarified", promised Mr Vondra.
European Commission
Justice and Home Affairs Commissioner Jacques BARROT , who was also speaking on behalf of External Relations Commissioner Bettina Ferrero-Waldner, said the Commission welcomed the "clear changes in American policy" including "the greater attention being devoted to human rights, notably as regards suspected terrorists".
The EU had asked the USA several times to close Guantánamo. What is at stake, he said, "is not just the principle that international law must be respected". Detention without trial "plays into the hands of terrorist groups trying to recruit new members".
On 26 January EU foreign ministers discussed Guantánamo with a view to agreeing on concerted EU action. Mr Barrot said the question of finding "safe places" for detainees would be examined but it was a "delicate matter". So far, there had been no formal request by the USA for European states to take detainees in. On 26 February the JHA Council would try to work out a concerted EU approach but - and he stressed this several times - it would be up to the Member States to take the decisions on each case.
Turning to the issue of CIA rendition flights, Mr Barrot said the Commission's line had been based on three things: the need to tackle terrorism while respecting human rights, to establish the truth and to prevent any repetition of such a situation. The Commission had requested information from some Member States, including Poland and Romania. but ultimately the responsibility for conduction investigations lay with the national authorities, not the EC.
Political group speakers
Speaking for the EPP-ED group, Hartmut NASSAUER (DE) said the question was whether former Guantánamo detainees should be settled in the EU. It depends, he said, on what considerations inspire our decision making. Some, apparently, have been tortured, and torture was a terrible thing.
"Should we therefore take them in for humanitarian reasons, irrespective of the charges laid at their door?" he asked. "What other considerations should we take account of? Many past and present detainees were trained in terror camps in Afghanistan after 9-11 - they did not go there to admire the scenery. They are potential terrorists, and we have a duty to protect our citizens. Torture, regrettably, happens around the world, but we have never said all those who have been tortured have a right to come to Europe. We must ensure potential terrorists do not step onto European territory."
Martin SCHULZ (DE) leader of the Socialist group, said that the security of people living in Europe was naturally a vital consideration, which needed to be part of our decisions and negotiations - but was it a potential security risk or the very existence of a prison infringing international law which was the greatest threat? The previous US President's responded to 9-11 by infringing human rights, which had only led to more problems in the world.
"There is now a US President who wants to go back to the best values of his country," said Mr Schulz. "Are we to refuse to help in these circumstances? We say rule of law is valid here, when an illegal situation is being stopped, do we say we invoke security reasons for not taking anyone?" He argued that President Obama was facing opposition to his decision, but was publicly backing human rights on principle. It was by respecting human rights, even those of terrorists who would deny them to others, that we showed ourselves to be superior to terrorists. We would do more to tackle terrorism by taking the hand proffered by the US than by following the approach outlined by Mr Nassauer, he said. Those who posed a threat should be monitored, he added, but human rights must be paramount.
Graham WATSON (ALDE) expressed delight and a sigh of relief at the election of President Obama. The new US administration is right to condemn waterboarding, right to call a halt to flawed military trials, right to signal closure of Guantánamo within a year. Mr Watson welcomed assurances that US has disowned squalid practices such as extraordinary rendition: 'the Axis of Illegality' but we in Europe cannot stand back. Too many of our Member States were complicit, he said. The US go-it-alone mentality of the 43rd President ended in a cul de sac of failure. The resulting situation is a conundrum we must solve together. Should Europe not offer rights and freedoms to released prisoners from Guantanamo where no other country will? We need a co-ordinated European position on this issue not piecemeal Member State action. Our help will be sought, we would be wrong to say no.
Konrad SZYMANSKI (UEN) said that normal interpretation of International Law would require immediate closure of Guantanamo but "we have not been living in normal times since 9/11". One in nine of the released prisoners has gone straight back to terrorist activity. Caution is urged. Three things are clear: we should be willing to take in our own citizens and residents; we should isolate serious threats and seek reform of the current Geneva Convention.
Kathalijne BUITENWEG (NL) spoke for the Greens-EFA group, which she said, was pleased with the Czech Presidency's aim of finding a joint EU response. Parliament had asked Member States to be pro-active on this: "Will you now ask the US which prisoners are concerned and what their background is so we can gradually make preparations?" she asked Mr Vondra.
On the issue of CIA flights and prisons, she said we should not forget that terrible things had happened and that EU governments had helped the previous US government in these actions - they were wrong to have done so, she added.
Gabriele ZIMMER (GUE/NGL) said that now that a new government in America is changing its policies on Guantánamo, the "EU is beginning to cower". This is not a time to cast doubt or to "preach one thing and do another", she said, Member States have to overtly state what is required, and the first step is to close Guantánamo.
According to Nils LUNDGREN (IND/DEM, SE) "we're all relieved following the change of circumstances in the USA". Terrorist suspects must "always be treated as innocent until proven guilty". He believed the released detainees should not have to remain in America but at the same time "we in the EU are not obliged to take them in".
Koenraad DILLEN (NI, BE) welcomed the closure of Guantánamo Bay and stressed that "democracy must always respect the rule of law". But "democracy also needs resolute means to fight terrorism". In passing he also criticised Cuba and China for their human rights abuses.
British and Irish speakers
Sarah LUDFORD (ALDE, UK) cited the humanitarian argument, "to rescue these men from the hellhole in which some of them have suffered for seven years." Secondly, Europe’s credibility: we have called on the US to close Guantánamo, now we have to help to make that true. Thirdly, our own self interest in ending a potent symbol that acts as a pretext for terrorist recruitment and radicalisation and, lastly, moral responsibility.
Colm BURKE (EPP-ED, IE) said given that many EU Member States were complicit in the process of extraordinary rendition, he believed that EU countries, including Ireland, have a collective responsibility to accept a certain number of low-risk Guantánamo detainees from the US for resettlement within the EU. Cohesive leadership, he said, is now needed from the Irish Government in this regard. In a spirit of transatlantic cooperation and to participate in the fight against international terrorism, Ireland should play its part to assist the new US Administration in closing Guantánamo.
Charles TANNOCK (EPP-ED, UK) opposed EU Member States entangling themselves in the inevitable legal complications and the burden imposed on security services of taking non-EU national prisoners previously designated as enemy combatants. Mr Tannock did not regret the detention of the most dangerous terrorists intent on "destroying our way of life when they were proven to be so". However, one of Guantánamo’s major drawbacks was that it forestalled any regular criminal proceedings against those held there. Ultimately regular criminal trials are, he said, the only way to resolve the status of Guantánamo prisoners who are non-EU nationals.. Since the inmates of Guantánamo were captured by the United States, it is America’s responsibility to prosecute them in its own courts, or return them to their countries of origin if innocent. Should Europe take in Guantanamo prisoners? Join the debate European Parliament calls on the US Administration to close Guantánamo Bay detention facility -13 June 2006

MEPs support Kosovo's European perspective one year after independence
2009-02-06 - 12:41
One year after Kosovo's independence, the European Parliament recalls the EU's willingness to assist the economic and political development of Kosovo through a clear European perspective, according to a resolution adopted by MEPs in Strasbourg. The resolution also recommends that the EU Member States which have not recognised the independence of Kosovo should do so. The resolution was adopted with 424 votes in favour, 133 against and 24 abstentions. EULEX, the EU law mission, is expected to promote the stable development of Kosovo and guarantee the rule of law for all the communities throughout Kosovo, including the Serb minority.
The resolution welcomes the Serbian government's agreement to the deployment throughout the territory of Kosovo of the EULEX European Union Rule of Law (EULEX) mission in Kosovo, the largest civilian mission ever launched under the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP). MEPs encourage Serbia to continue to show this constructive attitude, which is consistent with its aspirations to join the EU.
MEPs urge EULEX to address the backlog of court cases under international supervision, giving priority to cases of interethnic violence, war crimes and high - level corruption. A witness protection programme should also be established.
The resolution calls on the Head of the EULEX mission and the EU Special Representative to work hand-in-hand on a day-to-day basis. MEPs ask the EU Special Representative to ensure that the Kosovo government promotes the participation of Kosovo Serbs in the political, economic and social life of Kosovo, including by means of specific economic development measures for the Mitrovica region, once the rule of law is restored in the area.
A multiethnic European University College, in addition to existing university centres in Pristina and Mitrovica, should be set up, says the resolution. Academic exchanges must be supported and promoted through programmes such as Erasmus Mundus, in order to encourage citizens of Kosovo to obtain qualifications and experience within the EU.
The resolution considers that projects aimed at restoring vandalised graveyards with the direct involvement of local actors would have considerable symbolic value for the communities in Kosovo. MEPs call on the Commission and on the EU Special Representative to ensure that such initiatives rank high on the Kosovo government's agenda.
Kosovo governance
MEPs underline the need for a multi-ethnic police force in all areas of Kosovo and welcome the return of some Serbian officers to the Kosovo Police. The Kosovo authorities are urged to support the reintegration of those police officers who have yet to return.
The resolution urges the international and local authorities to settle the legal status of the stateless Roma, Ashkali and Egyptians living in Kosovo, including their right to ownership. These communities should be guaranteed equal access to education and, when possible, to education in their mother tongue, and granted access to the labour market and to health care.
Roma facilities
Relocating the Roma families of the Osterode and Cesmin Lug refugee camps is asked by MEPs as they believe their ill health is directly linked to the improper positioning of these camps located on the highly toxic tailing stands of the Trepça lead mines.
They call on the government to use both public and international donors' money in a transparent and accountable manner. The Commission should help Kosovo move closer to European standards in the fields of public sector accountability and economic transparency.
MEPs urge the Commission and the Member States to assist the Kosovo government in resolving the acute staff shortage in key sectors of the public administration, to support the training of civil servants and to assist with the improvement of communications infrastructure, in order to secure the smooth running of the administration and to strengthen the link between the administrative level and civil society.

Immigration
Legislation to crack down on employers of illegal immigrants
2009-02-06 - 12:41
MEPs voted a package of amendments to the directive against the employment of illegal immigrants, but postponed formalising their position until the next plenary session. The sanctions directive sets out that employers of illegal immigrants would be penalised while the immigrants themselves would be granted legal conditions of employment. MEPs are calling for criminal law sanctions in the most serious cases and want to make companies responsible for the actions of their subcontractors. Vote on legislative resolution postponed The final vote on the legislative resolution was postponed at the request of the rapporteur Claudio FAVA (PES, IT) to allow the addition of a declaration providing reassurance that this directive will not prevent further legislation on subcontractors. In response to Mr Fava, the Czech Presidency of the Council said it would first have to consult the Member States before making such a declaration. Mr Fava requested that this declaration be added: "T he European Parliament and the Council state that the rules on subcontracting agreed upon in Article 9 of this Directive shall be without prejudice to other provisions on this issue to be adopted in future legislative instruments." The House will vote on the legislative resolution during the Brussels February plenary session (18 and 19 February 2009) Criminalising the employer, not the migrant Between 4.5 and 8 million illegal immigrants work in the construction, farming, hotel and other sectors in the EU. One of the factors encouraging illegal immigration into the EU is the possibility of finding work. This legislation aims to reduce that pull factor by targeting the employment of third-country nationals who are illegally staying in the EU. The Commission’s draft legislation is supposed to complement other measures, such as the “return directive” and the “blue card” directive, the overall aim being to combat illegal immigration more firmly while encouraging legal immigration. The “sanctions directive" would introduce minimum penalties at European level against employers of illegal immigrants. Employers could be fined, forced to pay wages in arrears at legal levels or even banned for up to five years from bidding for public sector contracts or from receiving state aid – whether national or European. Criminal law penalties in the most serious cases The directive would also lay down criminal law penalties against employers for repeat offences, where a large number of people in an irregular situation are employed, where the working conditions are exploitative, where the employee is a victim of human trafficking and this is known to the employer, or if the employee is a minor. Automatic recovery of unpaid wages An employer who is found guilty must also refund any state aid received the previous year and pay a graduated fine according to the number of illegal immigrants employed. In addition, he must pay a sum equal to the amount of taxes and other levies he would have paid if the worker had been employed legally and, where applicable, the cost of returning the migrant. The employment relationship will be assumed to have lasted at least three months unless the employer or worker supplies proof to the contrary. MEPs demanded that the procedures necessary for the employee to recover the unpaid wages must be automatic, without any need for the employee to take action. MEPs successfully argued that Member States should establish lower financial penalties for people using clandestine immigrants as domestic staff, provided the working conditions are not exploitative. Grievance procedure Parliament also wants Member States to set up mechanisms to enable illegal immigrants to lodge complaints. Third parties designated by Member States, such as voluntary bodies or trade unions, should be allowed to report a guilty employer without running the risk of being subsequently taken to court for assisting someone to stay in the country illegally. Irregular immigrants will, if they cooperate with the legal action against their employer, be able to get a temporary residence permit. Firms that use subcontractors to be liable If the guilty employer is a subcontractor, the contracting firm must also be held liable, and even fully liable if it turns out that the contracting employer knew the subcontractor was acting illegally. A list of employers who have infringed the directive may be made public – another successful demand by MEPs. Effective and sufficient inspections The Member States are asked to conduct effective inspections sufficiently frequently to check on the employment of non-EU nationals in an irregular situation. They must also require employers to check that their non-EU employees have a valid residence permit and inform a national authority of any new recruitment of non-EU nationals. UK not opting-in The UK government supports the general purpose of the draft directive as part of the wider fight against illegal immigration. Nevertheless, it has a number of concerns and has not opted-in to this directive. The UK government believes there is no legal basis or Community competence for criminal sanctions in this directive, nor would we support measures which could create a pull factor for illegal immigrants (e.g: back payments, facilitation of complaints procedures and any associated delays in returning illegal migrants).

Climate Change: 2050 - the future begins today: MEPs adopt key report
2009-02-06 - 12:41
The European Parliament recommends detailed measures to be taken in key economic sectors to achieve a future EU integrated policy on climate change. MEPs take as basis the EU objective to keep the global average temperature increase below 2°C and call for a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 25 - 40 % to be achieved by 2020 and a reduction of at least 80 % to be achieved by 2050. The resolution was adopted with 570 votes in favour 78 against and 24 abstentions. MEPs are concerned that "climate change is both more rapid and more serious in terms of its adverse effects than was previously thought". Therefore the Commission should monitor, "whether the EU 2°C target would still achieve the aim of avoiding dangerous climate change". Furthermore, the EU and the other industrialised countries should set as a group, a medium-term target of a 25-40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, as well as a long-term reduction target of at least 80% by 2050, compared to 1990. A visionary desire to make a difference According to MEPs we are at a turning point in energy and climate policy, reflected in a growing scarcity of raw materials but MEPs stress it is important "not to capitulate in face of the complexity of the problem but to show a visionary desire to make a difference". MEPs call for global warming and ensuing climate change issues be incorporated in all spheres and policies. Political and educational measures on the basis of a long term perspective are necessary and the citizens need to be engaged in the process of tackling climate change. Detailed recommendations for tackling climate change The report sets out in detail a broad range of measures, which, according to MEPs, should be taken in the following fields: energy, biofuels, energy efficiency, mobility, logistics, tourism, carbon capture and storage, agriculture, livestock rearing, forests, soil protection, water management, fisheries, waste and resource management, adaptation measures, health, promotion of technologies of the future, intelligent computer systems, education, training and awareness raising. Measures proposed in the report include : • a binding goal of 20% improvement in energy efficiency by 2020 should be proposed by the Commission as well as specific interim reduction targets; • the creation, as building blocks of a European external energy policy, of solar energy partnerships with third countries in the Mediterranean region • long term target in the building sector should be net zero-energy performance in new residential buildings by 2015 and in new commercial and public buildings by 2020 • EU should create a European renewable energy community • Member States and EU institutions (the EU and the Member States) shall give support to research and development in respect of technologies as hydrogen, electric, fuel cells, hybrids or advanced biofuels. • the Commission should consider setting reduction targets for GHG emissions from the agricultural sector; • a European Climate Fund and/or corresponding funds in the Member States should be established; • an EU-wide "supergrid" accessible to all forms of electricity providers should be developed; • incentives should be made available for citizens to reduce emissions in an affordable way, e.g. by developing information on the carbon content of products and services. • Member States should provide free energy audits to enable citizens to reduce their energy consumption and their emissions • Commission and Member States shall support the UN's call for a "Green New Deal" Highest priority in EU spending should be climate change MEPs think that in the next EU financial framework, the highest priority must be given to climate change and measures to combat it. They also see the need to increase funding to combat climate change in developing countries and want to incorporate emission reduction requirements and adaptation to climate change in development aid programmes. Nuclear power MEPs acknowledge the different approaches of the Member States with regard to nuclear energy and therefore urge the Commission to pay special attention to radioactive waste and its full cycle, with a view of improving safety.

Sexual abuse of children: MEPs want to criminalise "grooming" on the Internet
2009-02-06 - 12:41
"Grooming" and paedophile chat rooms on the Internet should be criminalised and sex crimes should be subject to an extraterritorial legislation, the EP says in a report adopted in Strasbourg. MEPs call on the EU to fund prevention programmes from its general budget. By adopting the report with 591 votes in favour, 2 against and 6 abstentions, MEPs call for the criminalisation of "all types of sexual abuse of children" including "grooming" (the action of soliciting children for sexual purposes). Providers of Internet chat rooms and forums where paedophile activities take place should be criminalised. Those whose work involves regular contact with children should also have the obligation to report situations where abuse is suspected, MEPs say. Applicants to certain posts working with children should also undergo criminal records checks.
The EU should fund prevention programmes
The European Parliament called on the European Commission to revise the framework decision as to create national management systems for sex offenders including risk assessment and intervention programmes and therapies to minimise the risk of repeated offenses. Such programmes could be funded from the EU's general budget, members say.
They also call on the Member states to encourage the victims of sexual exploitation to file criminal and civil claims in the national courts against sex offenders.
Advertisements encouraging sexual abuse towards children should be prohibited, and child sex tourism should be considered a crime in all Member States. Moreover, EU citizens who commit a sex crime outside the EU should be subject to uniform extraterritorial criminal legislation.
MEPs also underline that seven member states have still not signed the Council of Europe convention on this issue, and eight have not ratified the optional protocol on the UN convention on the Rights of the Child, on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.

Industry
MEPs debate support to the ailing automobile sector
2009-02-06 - 12:41
MEPs debated the effects of the financial crisis on the automobile industry after hearing statements from the Council and Commission. Many MEPs called for support to the industry and on manufacturers to concentrate on green technology. Ministers have expressed deep concern about the serious situation that the sector is facing at present, putting at risk a very significant number of jobs. In 2008 there were about 8% fewer cars sold in the EU than in 2007. Czech Presidency of the Council Thanks to the European industry's resilience and adaptability, "European cars today are among the best, safest, most innovative, competitive, fuel-efficient and environmentally sustainable in the world", said Czech Deputy Prime Minister for European Affairs Alexandr VONDRA for the Council Presidency. Yet, despite this resilience, and due largely to factors outside its control, the industry had been "particularly badly hit by the global economic crisis", he noted, adding that this had already been clear in November 2008 when the Council had agreed its approach to promoting more fuel-efficient cars, realistic targets for manufacturers and effective demand incentives. Since November, the situation had grown worse, he said, citing industry reports that 8% fewer cars had been sold in the EU in 2008 than in 2007. Mr Vondra predicted that 2009 would be as bad, or worse, with difficulties affecting not just manufacturers, but the industry's whole supply chain. These difficulties "could put at risk significant numbers of jobs", he added. Public support "The primary responsibility for responding to these challenges rests with the industry itself", said Mr Vondra, stressing that it must be encouraged to tackle "structural problems such as overcapacity and lack of investment in new technologies". However, "this industry's importance for the European economy, and the fact that it is particularly hard hit by the current crisis, mean that some sort of public support is required", he added. The need for public support "is reflected in the European Economic Recovery Plan agreed by the European Council last December, as well as in Member States' national programmes". But "we cannot allow short-term support for the industry to undermine its long-term competitiveness. This means focussing clearly on innovation", said Mr Vondra. This support needs to be targeted and co-ordinated. It must respect key principles such as fair competition and open markets. It should not be about "a race for subsidies", and should not result in market distortions, he explained, adding that to this end, Member States had confirmed their willingness to co-operate closely with the Commission on supply-side and demand-side measures. The Commission had also been invited to explore how the use of loans for this sector can be improved as regards rapid availability, project financing and frontloading, without discriminating among manufacturers or Member States, said Mr Vondra. Community instruments Community instruments can help, e.g. to develop clean cars, said Mr Vondra, stressing that "the full potential of innovative and environmentally sustainable propulsion technologies - fuel cells, hybrid, electrical, solar power - needs to be fully explored and put into operation". At the same time, existing instruments, such as scrapping schemes for old cars, combined with demand for new ones, could generate additional benefits such as improved transport safety and reduced emissions. The Czech Presidency would press the Commission to propose how to encourage co-ordinating car fleet renewal schemes in the area of vehicle recovery and recycling, based on the analysis of the impacts of existing schemes in several Member States, he said. Mr Vondra hoped that the European Commission would table this proposal well before the Spring European Council, and that the issue would be debated again at the March Competitiveness Council. "This is not just about supporting a key sector of our economy, but is an approach from which we all stand to benefit in the longer-term", concluded Mr Vondra. European Commission Enterprise and Industry Commissioner Günter Verheugen told MEPs that car sales "give an early warning of economic trends" and the present sales figures are symptomatic of "a lack of confidence in the economy". The car industry, he said, employed 12 million people, or 6% of all jobs in Europe, and was the EU's sixth biggest exporter. Not just the passenger car companies but the entire automobile industry was in trouble. Apart from the financial crisis, key factors affecting the auto industry were "excess capacity in the EU" and "our legislation, which has made European cars expensive". These factors would put pressure on the industry to boost productivity but this would clearly not have a positive effect on employment. The Commission's goals were "to guide the industry through the crisis" and "to improve competitiveness" so as to make Europe the centre of the world's car industry. EU measures past, present and future Describing measures taken so far, the Commissioner said that credit of up to €9 billion had been promised from the European Investment Bank. In addition, Member States would be allowed to use state aid to support car companies provided they did so to safeguard jobs in Europe and there was no distortion of competition. Referring to his idea for premiums to be offered to encourage car owners to scrap their old model and buy a new "greener" vehicle, he said the premiums were to be used for the purchase of more environmentally-friendly vehicles but could not be tied to those made in a particular country. Regarding long-term measures, he mentioned the CARS 21 recommendations, calling for more R&D so that in future Europe's cars would be the best in the world, "not just as regards technical and engineering standards but also environmental - including emissions - standards". The most important outcome of the Commission's discussions with Member States had been an agreement that there must be no protectionism in Europe. At international level, it remained to be seen what the USA decided. It was not in Europe's interests to see US manufacturers go bankrupt but it was equally not in our interests that they should protect their industry at the expense of others. Concluding, the Commissioner was confident that "the European car industry is strong enough to cope with the situation". Political group speakers Jean-Paul GAUZÈS (EPP-ED, FR) began by pointing out that the message just outlined by the Council and the Commission is not going to restore confidence and stated that "I don't think that your proposals are commensurate with the challenges." He spoke about his concern that some Member States are going to 'go it alone' in their response to the current crisis, about the problems facing the automobile industry - the cyclical decline in demand, the structural problems it faces and the fact that it "can't compete on the world markets." Mr Gauzes argued that the pressure put on people not to use their vehicles is contributing to these problems. He concluded by pointing out that "we need a coordinated response." He spoke of the need for the banking system to be able to fund the automobile industry at normal interest rates, the need to give a future to the car industry, the need for a true industrial policy and the need to consider sustainable development too. His final statement was that innovation should not suffer in these desperate times. Guido SACCONI (PES, IT) said that he "entirely endorse[d]" the concerns and the realism shown by the Council and the Commission in their statements. He mentioned a figure he had seen that two million jobs could be lost in the car industry, mostly in the spare parts sector. He spoke of the extraordinary contradiction in this case, where, on the one hand, we have a fleet of available cars and, on the other hand, we have demand which has slowed considerably. Mr Sacconi stated that he "very much appreciate[d]" this recovery plan drafted by the Commission. He went on to say that "we need to take anti-cyclical action on the demand side and on the environmental side. What will happen is that countries will act on their own."' Mr Sacconi concluded by stating that he agreed that "we have to make an effort to try to see to it that there is the greatest amount of coordination at least on the criteria", for example, that of linking demand and purchases with emissions targets. Patrizia TOIA (ALDE, IT) pointed out that "the crisis in the automobile industry has become a crisis in the whole sector." She listed areas such as sales, suppliers, etc., which have also been hit. She referred to the current situation as "a tragedy for employment." Mrs Toia called on the European institutions "to take decisive and rapid action" and "to look at the possibilities for innovation." She went on to say that "European countries need to send out a signal" and that "we need Europe to be more involved in the plan to jump-start this industry." Mrs Toia concluded by stating that "the fate of Europe's great car makers is a fate we all share in" and by reminding her colleagues that "we have to worry about competition within the EU in the form of state aid." She spoke of the need for a coordinated response, providing support, aid and more incentives. Guntars KRASTS (UEN, LV) said that the motor industry, like the construction sector, concentrates its resources in future development, but this is dependent on credit, so the sector is particularly badly hit by the credit crisis. "So we need to overcome the financial crisis first," he said. "Our challenge is not to preserve jobs, but to save the competitiveness of the sector by looking to reduce dependency on oil and improving ecological performance in general." Rebecca HARMS (Greens/EFA, DE) was critical of the motor industry lobbying on the recent CO2 vehicle emissions legislation. "The same companies that wanted us to be less ambitious in our targets are now parking their gas-guzzlers in some siding, because the future is for small, efficient cars." She insisted that a discussion of the car industry cannot be separated from energy policy and transport policy: "If all you do is talk about cars, and not about transport in general - and especially public transport - you are selling yourself short," she said. According to Roberto MUSACCHIO (GUE/NGL, IT), "the financial crisis is now an economic and social crisis", with 2 million jobs expected to be lost. The elderly and other vulnerable categories were the chief victims and he called for the European Social Fund to be used to help them. He also believed there should be coordination on state aid at European level. Patrick LOUIS (IND/DEM, FR) said "this industry is suffering from relocation, social dumping, environmental dumping and tax dumping". He was especially concerned about cars from the American and Asian markets and called for a return to the common external tariff. UK Members Stephen HUGHES (PES, UK) reported that Nissan has announced the loss of 1,200 jobs at its Sunderland plant in his North-East England constituency. If such a plant, widely acknowledged as the most productive in Europe with the highest productivity in Europe needs to lay off a quarter of its workforce then heaven help us when this crunch fully hits the less productive. A recovery task force has, he said, been set up involving all major regional actors. The measures being planned - assisting job search, training and retraining, starting small companies, assisting self-employment - are all ideally suited for support from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and he welcomed the Commission proposal to simplify this fund. "It needs to be urgently simplified and mobilised on a massive scale as part of a coordinated European response to the crisis in the car industry. Only a tiny fraction of that fund was used last year. Let us not hoard it. Let us put it to work to put our people to work." John WHITTAKER (IND/DEM, UK) said that there is a possible case for some financial support to the car industry and other sectors to keep capital intact and to keep skills intact. But this can only be decided at the national level because the support – apart from the European Investment Bank mentioned by Mr Verheugen – can only be provided by national taxpayers. But there is one thing that the European Union could constructively do here, at least until the recession is over, and that is to give car manufacturers a break from environmental restrictions. The industry is already in serious trouble. These environmental and other standard restrictions make cars more expensive. You are helping to kill off an industry which is already in serious bother, he warned. Malcolm HARBOUR (EPP-ED, UK) said that there has never been a situation where sales have collapsed so quickly. This is not a failure of business models: it is a failure of the whole economic system. He agreed that action has to be taken at national and European level to help the industry through this restructuring. It is much better to help the industry keep those core people on the payroll and retrain them than to let them go and then to hire them back again later. The problem is actually getting buyers and demand back into the economy. We need to tackle credit and help public buyers back into the market. We do not want a competitive race between businesses. But above all, he said, we need to face up to the fact that the car dealers have to be out there selling and looking after cars. On a final point, on the proposal to change the structure of dealer contracts, he asked that this unwanted and destabilising proposal be taken off the table. Automotive Sector - European Commission

MEPs adopt written declaration on the fight against Alzheimer's disease
2009-02-06 - 12:41
The European Parliament has adopted a written declaration put forward by Françoise Grossetête, John Bowis, Katalin Lévai, Jan Tadeusz Masiel and Antonios Trakatellis on priorities in the fight against Alzheimer’s disease since more than half of all MEPs have signed it. MEPs underline that Alzheimer’s disease currently affects 6.1 million Europeans and that figure will double or triple between now and 2050 with the ageing of the population. The written declaration (signed by 424 MEPs out of 785 as of 4.2.2009) calls on the Commission, the Council and the governments of the Member States to recognise Alzheimer’s disease as a European public health priority and to develop a European action plan with a view to: - promoting pan-European research on the causes, prevention and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, - improving early diagnosis, - simplifying procedures for patients and carers and improving their quality of life, - promoting the role of Alzheimer’s associations and giving them regular support. MEPs point out that the disease is the most common cause of dependency and it is vital that political commitment be made in the areas of research, prevention and social protection.

Energy security: EP adopts blueprint for the EU's future energy strategy
2009-02-06 - 12:41
The European Parliament set out wide-ranging recommendations for the EU's future energy policy. MEPs call for mandatory emergency action plans in case of gas supply shortages, more grid interconnections among Member States, a specific road map for investments in nuclear energy, and new climate targets to be achieved by 2050, including cutting greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80%. The report was adopted by 406 votes in favour, with 168 votes against and 87 abstentions. The European Parliament adopted by a large majority a report drawn up by Anne Laperrouze (ALDE, FR) on the "Second Strategic Energy Review", which will be on the agenda for the 19-20 March European Council debate on the EU's future energy strategy. MEPs call on the Commission and the Czech Presidency to present "a new ambitious and far-sighted diversification plan" to this meeting of the EU's Heads of State. Lessons learned: national and EU emergency action plans In the aftermath of the recent gas supply crisis between Ukraine and Russia, which left many EU citizens without heating this winter, MEPs call on the Commission to propose revising the 2004 Security of gas supply directive before the end of this year. Parliament wants this revision to include "mandatory and effective national and EU emergency action plans" providing for: a common declaration of an emergency situation, the allocation of available supplies and infrastructure capacity among the affected countries, co-ordinated dispatching, and the activation of emergency measures in unaffected or less affected states in order to increase the amount of gas available to the affected markets. MEPs also stress that the EU should develop gas storage with fast-release capacity and that a single European gas grid should be established linking up all EU Member States. "Gas and electricity interconnections through Central and South-eastern Europe along a north-south axis" should be developed and especially the Baltic Sea region needed to be integrated into the Western European network, says the report. Trilateral agreement between EU, Russia and Ukraine to secure gas transit Even with the help of ambitious energy saving plans, the EU is likely to still be dependent on third countries for supplies of fossil energy in the medium term, say MEPs. The EU currently imports 50% of the energy it consumes - a proportion which could rise to 70% by 2030. The EU, Russia and Ukraine should conclude a trilateral agreement to secure gas supply from Russia via Ukraine to the EU in the coming years, say MEPs. They also advocate including an "energy security clause" in future trade, association, partnership and cooperation agreements with producer and transit countries which would prohibit any supply disruption due to commercial disputes. Besides, Parliament supports negotiations for a wide-ranging new agreement replacing the 1997 Partnership and Co-operation Agreement with Russia, More pipelines and liquefied natural gas terminals Parliament supports projects to diversify supply routes and sources, such as the Nabucco, Turkey-Greece-Italy (TGI), and South Stream pipelines. "In the longer term, when political conditions permit, supplies from other countries in the Caspian region, such as Uzbekistan and Iran, should represent a further significant supply source for the EU", say MEPs. MEPs stress that sufficient liquefied natural gas (LNG) capacity is needed - meaning that liquefaction facilities in the producing countries and LNG terminals and ship-based re-gasification in the EU should be available to all Member States. 2050 climate targets: 80% less greenhouse gases, 60% renewables, 35% energy efficiency MEPs call on the EU's heads of states to adopt new climate targets to be achieved by 2050: a cut of at least 80% in greenhouse gas emissions, a 35% improvement in energy efficiency, and a 60% share of renewable energy in the EU's total energy consumption. Saving energy is "the most effective and cost-efficient way of improving energy security", say MEPs, calling on the Commission and Member States immediately to adopt a legally binding energy efficiency improvement target of at least 20% by 2020. The two other "2020" targets - reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20% and increasing the share of renewable energy to 20% - are already fixed by the EU's climate change legislation, adopted in December 2008. Offshore wind installations in the North Sea The House welcomes the proposal to submit a plan for an offshore network in the North Sea in order to exploit the enormous wind energy potential and also welcome in this connection the creation of a European supergrid by linking the network infrastructures of the North Sea, Mediterranean and Baltic regions. MEPs call on the Commission and Member States to ensure appropriate regulation and to allow for non-discriminatory access to new infrastructure, for example. to the North Sea offshore grid. Nuclear power "at the highest technologically possible level of safety" Parliament considers it important to maintain nuclear energy in the EU's energy mix and calls on the Commission to draw up a "specific road map for nuclear investments". MEPs rejected by a broad majority an amendment which called on Member States to set up a phase-out plan. MEPs stress that nuclear energy is to be used "at the highest technologically possible level of safety"; adding that the EU's neighbouring countries, too, should adopt European nuclear safety standards every time a new nuclear plant is planned or an old one is upgraded. Furthermore, MEPs say the Commission and Council should develop joint models and procedures together with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to prevent the peaceful use of nuclear energy from leading to the proliferation of nuclear weapons.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
European Parliament urges Member States to fulfil their goals on childcare
2009-02-06 - 12:41
To maintain the principle of intergenerational solidarity, MEPs urge the Member States to achieve their commitments to introduce by 2010 childcare for 90% of children under the mandatory school age and call for a review of the work-life balance policies in the EU. The report adopted was an alternative motion for a resolution put forward by the Greens/EFA group and adopted with 358 votes in favour, 271 against and 28 abstentions, replacing the original report from the Women's Committee. The concept of intergenerational solidarity relates to childcare and the responsibility for the elderly and dependent. In the EU, the employment rate for women with dependent children is only 62.4% as compared with 91.4% for men. MEPs urge the Council and the Member States to achieve their commitments, agreed in the Barcelona European Council of 2002 to introduce by 2010 childcare for 90% of children between 3 years old and the mandatory school age and for at least 33% of children under 3 years old. The EP calls on the Commission to bring forward a proposal for a new directive regarding specific rights and safeguards in relation to the reconciliation of working and family life where there are dependent children. In the resolution, MEPs fear that the Czech Presidency's proposal for childcare as a "fully fledged alternative to a professional career" is geared towards the traditional division of labour between men and women, that is to say the traditional concept of a worker being male, available on a full time basis, whose personal needs are taken care of by 'invisible hands' (women) organising the home and the family. Value of informal and invisible work should be recognised According to the resolution, the persons who devote their time and skills in the field of intergenerational solidarity should receive social recognition, by giving them individual rights, particularly regarding social security and pensions. The European Parliament urges the Commission to introduce initiatives which validate skills acquired in carrying out educational tasks, caring for dependent persons and household management so that "these skills are taken into consideration upon re-entry into the labour market". A point highlighted in the initial own-initiative of Anna Záborská (EPP-ED, SK), adopted in the Women's rights committee. Improving conditions for maternity and paternity leave To promote a balance between family plans and professional ambitions, MEPs insist that steps need to be taken to improve the treatment not just of maternity leave but also paternity and parental leave. The report calls on the Commission, in collaboration with the Member States and the social partners, to launch a review of work-life balance policies, particularly by "guaranteeing that the cost of maternity is not borne by the employer, but by the public purse", and by improving accessibility to care and assistance services for children, people with disabilities and the elderly. New directive on work-life balance MEPs call on the Commission to bring forward a proposal for a new directive regarding specific rights and safeguards in relation to the reconciliation of working and family life where there are dependent family members (children, elderly and disabled people). The House calls also on the Member States to take into account flexible working hours for parents (as a result of free choice) and flexible times for childcare institutions to help both women and men to combine work and family life more successfully.

Pre-commercial procurement an under-exploited driver of innovation
2009-02-06 - 12:41
Pre-commercial procurement has significant potential to achieve high-quality and readily accessible public services, says the European Parliament in adopting a report by Malcolm HARBOUR (EPP-ED, UK). The House says that pre-commercial procurement constitutes an under-exploited driver of innovation-led growth for the EU. The report was adopted with 587 votes in favour, 12 against and 6 abstentions. Pre-commercial procurement would benefit the healthcare and transport industries and would address "the social challenges of climate change, sustainable energy and an ageing population". Yet many public authorities are not aware of the potential of pre-commercial procurement and do not yet act as “intelligent customers”, the report says. "In spite of the numerous European research programmes, the results thereof have not yet been exploited by public authorities through public procurement," the report adds. Gaps in the Commission communication The European Parliament welcomes the Commission communication, which gives guidance on how EU rules can be used to stimulate public procurement innovation in Europe with the research and development (R&D) sector, but considers that there are some gaps regarding the manner of giving effect to the procedure proposed, especially at local and regional level. It urges the Commission and Member States to work together to ensure that contracting authorities in local, regional, and other authorities removed from central administration develop the required expertise to implement innovative procurement. It also urges Member States to screen national legislation to ensure that public authorities are not limited in pre-commercial procurement through inexistent, incorrect, or unnecessarily complex transposition of the relevant exemptions and unnecessarily elaborate national tendering requirements and procurement models. Good practices and training to be funded Contracting authorities should be supplied with training guidelines and tools showing how pre-commercial procurement might be used in research and development, says the report. MEPs therefore welcome the Commission initiative to fund exchange of good practices and training on pre-commercial procurement in the 2009 work programme of the Seventh Framework Programme. Financial incentives Financial incentives are extremely important in the uptake of pre-commercial procurement. MEPs note that such incentives already exist in certain Member States, where a substantial proportion of the costs of the first pre-commercial procurement can be matched by a central authority. Therefore, financial incentives for public authorities across the EU to jointly undertake pre-commercial procurement of innovative technology in lead markets and other areas of common European interest should be considered, the report concludes.

Parliament calls for proportionate regulation in general and business aviation
2009-02-06 - 12:41
In answer to the Commission Communication on General and Business Aviation, the European Parliament calls for proportionate regulation, increased airport and airspace capacity, and measures to further environmental sustainability for all civil aircraft operations which do not fall under the commercial air transport sector. The report was adopted with 524 votes in favour, 74 against and 6 abstentions. The fastest growing sector in civil aviation in Europe, general and business aviation comprises high value activities, ranging from specialised aerial works (aerial cartography, agricultural flights, firefighting, air traffic surveillance) to aerial training and recreational flying. Proportionate regulation The European Parliament report by Luís Queiró (EPP-ED, PT) "broadly welcomes" the Commission's communication of 11 January 2007 entitled "Agenda for Sustainable Future in General and Business Aviation", but stresses that the Commission must ensure that proportionality and subsidiarity principles are applied "in the design and implementation of both existing and futures aviation legislation". "General and Business Aviation in Europe comprises mainly privately owned aircraft and small and medium-sized enterprises having limited resources to keep up with the ongoing regulatory changes," the report argues. Simplified security procedures for business aviation passengers MEPs ask the Commission to examine the possibility of "laying down simplified security procedures and screening processes for business aviation passengers without in any way compromising their security and safety", and suggests that the Commission facilitate the exchange of best practice on security measures at small and medium-sized airports. Increase and optimise airport capacity Pointing out that it is "increasingly difficult" for General and Business Aviation to access major and regional airports, due to the growing demand from commercial air transport , MEPs urge the Commission and Member States to optimise the use of existing capacity through "better planning" and "the deployment of modern technologies", and to use helicopters as a "short-haul connecting tool". They also encourage Member States and regional and local authorities to modernise and establish small and medium-sized airports and to invest in "specific infrastructure necessary for the operation and stationing of aircraft in the field of General and Business Aviation". Environmental sustainability The House believes that the environmental performance of smaller aircraft can be "enhanced" by "using cleaner fuels and by promoting research, technological development and innovation". It stresses the importance of initiatives such as "Clean Sky" and the Cost Effective Small Aircraft (CESAR) project. In terms of noise pollution, MEPs consider that "noise mapping is one of several tools providing for a balanced methodology to ensure airport development without causing significant noise pollution to local citizens". Recreational and sport aviation essential Finally, MEPs call on the Commission to take appropriate measures to facilitate access of the EU's General and Business Aviation manufacturing industry to world markets. They also consider the promotion of recreational and sport aviation, including of European aeroclubs, as "essential", because this sector constitutes "an important source of professional skills for the entire aviation sector".

Economic Partnership Agreements: making an impact on development
2009-02-06 - 12:41
Whether countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific sign Economic Partnership Agreements with the EU or not, they should not be worse off than under the current system of preferences, says a report adopted by MEPs. Flanking measures in the form of aid for trade should be used to help the ACP countries, for example, to offset any loss of customs revenue, so says the adopted report put forward by the EPP-ED and UEN groups and replaces the original report from the Development Committee. The report, drafted by Jürgen Schröder (EPP-ED, DE), urges the Council, the Commission and the governments of the EU Member States and ACP countries to "re-establish an atmosphere of confidence and constructive dialogue in so far as it has been damaged in the course of negotiations" and to "recognise the ACP states as equal partners in the negotiation and implementation process". The Lomé Agreements between the European Community and the ACP countries included trade preferences for the ACP countries which were more favourable than those granted by the EU to other developing countries under the General System of Preferences (GSP). The Lomé preferences, which have been challenged by non-ACP developing countries, were temporarily extended by a derogation from the World Trade Organisation (WTO), which expired on 31 December 2007. MEPs remind the Council and the Commission that neither the conclusion nor the renunciation of an EPA should lead to a situation where an ACP country may find itself in a less favourable position than it was under the trade provisions of the Cotonou Agreement. Aid for trade Only strong accompanying measures will enable the ACP countries to benefit from the opportunities available under EPAs. Such measures must offset any net loss in customs revenue and be invested in order to diversify export production and produce more higher added-value export goods, says the Development Committee’s report. Review clause and regional integration EPAs should incorporate a clause for a revision 5 years after their signature, to which national parliaments, the European Parliament and civil society must be formally associated, says the report. This 5-year period will enable a detailed evaluation of the impact of EPAs on the economies and regional integration of the ACP countries. Appropriate reorientations can also be carried out. To avoid undermining regional integration through EPAs concluded with individual ACP countries, or with a group of countries (not including all countries within one region), the Commission is called on to recalibrate its approach and to ensure that concluding EPAs does not endanger regional integration. Of the 15 countries of the Pacific region (including East Timor), where the 16th session of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly was held from 24 to 28 November 2008 (in Port Moresby, Papua-New Guinea), only Papua and Fiji have signed provisional agreements. The erosion of trade preferences - sugar for Fiji and tuna for Papua-New Guinea - prompted these countries to sign a provisional accord in November 2007. Parliament's assent The European Parliament will have to give its formal approval (known as its “assent”), probably in spring 2009, to enable these agreements to enter into force. Since the agreements have a significant trade component, this procedure will be the responsibility of the EP’s International Trade Committee. Negotiations with the ACP Group of States started in 2002, following the adoption of negotiating directives by the Council on 12 June 2002. The negotiations are being conducted with six EPA regions (the Caribbean, West Africa, Central Africa, Eastern and Southern Africa, SADC minus, Pacific).

Security and safety of Internet transactions need to be strengthened, says European Parliament
2009-02-06 - 12:41
More than half of EU citizens and nearly 1.5 billion people worldwide have access to the Internet. Yet, despite the fact that one out of three EU citizens conducts online purchases, only 30 million carry out cross-border shopping in the EU. In view of this, MEPs are demanding increased Internet security, simplified rules and specific measures for SMEs in a report adopted in Strasbourg with 562 votes in favour, 9 against and 10 abstentions. The European Parliament, in a report drafted by Giorgos Papastamkos (EPP-ED, EL), believes that lack of trust in the security and safety of transactions and payments "constitutes the most important danger for the future of e-commerce". MEPs call on the Commission to investigate the causes and to redouble its efforts to "create mechanisms for strengthening businesses' and individuals' trust in international electronic payment systems, as well as establishing suitable means for resolving disputes related to illegal commercial practices". Combating counterfeiting, piracy and fraud Illegal behaviour such as counterfeiting, piracy, fraud, breach of transaction security and violation of citizens' private space pre-existed in the "physical world", say MEPs, but these activities have been both "facilitated and exacerbated" by the abundant technological possibilities provided. They stress the need to adopt and strengthen necessary and appropriate enforcement measures and for more effective and concerted coordination. This will permit the combating and elimination of existing illegal online commercial behaviour, without affecting the development of international e-commerce, MEPs say, especially with regard to cases liable to involve major public health risks, such as bogus medicines. MEPs also believe that the regulatory deficiencies in the EU online market are hindering the development of a stable and strong European online industrial and commercial environment. This, they say, results in unsatisfactory levels of participation by European consumers in EU and international trade transactions and hinders creativity and innovation in commercial activity. Improve regulatory provisions MEPs deplore the regulatory provisions permitting or requiring geographic market partitioning, high Internet access charges, and any limits on the availability of delivery options in the EU. The report calls on the Commission to improve the legal interoperability of Internet services through the development of model licences and other legal solutions compatible with jurisdictions. It also asks that existing European deliverables for legal interoperability be propagated in order to reduce both transaction costs and legal uncertainty for online providers. The report points out that the inherently international character of electronic commerce calls for universal understanding and cooperation, and proposes that bilateral and regional trade agreements signed by the EU should contain explicit provisions covering broad and open use of the Internet for trade in goods and services. The fact that the Doha Development Agenda "does not mandate specific negotiations on e-commerce', is regrettable, it says. Measures for SMEs MEPs call on the Commission to develop a comprehensive strategy for removing the barriers to using e-commerce still affecting SMEs (access to ICT, costs of developing and maintaining e-business systems, lack of trust, lack of information, legal uncertainty over transnational disputes, etc.). They ask the Commission to include policy recommendations, which offer incentives to SMEs to further participate in online trading products and services. The report recommends the establishment of a database, designed to provide information support and management guidance to the new and inexperienced participants in online trading, and the conduct of a comparative economic analysis of the benefits of e-commerce and online advertising for SMEs, as well as case studies of successful EU SMEs trading online. There is also a call for a detailed analysis of the influence of online trade upon conventional trading patterns and activities, in order to be aware of and consequently avoid potential adverse effects. Increase investment for third-country Internet trade Finally, MEPs believe that the participation of the least developed and other developing countries in international trade through the Internet has to be supported through increased investment primarily in basic infrastructure such as telecommunication networks and access devices. The report underlines the need for low cost and better quality provision of Internet services. Adopted text will be available here (click on 5 February)

Internationalisation of small and medium-sized businesses a priority of the European Parliament
2009-02-06 - 12:41
SMEs account for 99% of the total number of businesses in the European Union, and create 75 million jobs, yet their international performance is "structurally weak". So says the European Parliament in a report which urges the Commission and Member States to enable EU SMEs to develop in a harmonious manner, gain access to new markets and to expand their export activities and internationalisation. The report was adopted with 437 votes in favour, 77 against and 69 abstentions. SMEs are defined as enterprises with fewer than 250 employees and a have a turnover of less than €50 million. According to the report drafted by Cristiana Muscardini (UEN, IT), there are 23 million SMEs in the European Union, but only 8% export goods outside their national borders. The House, therefore, stresses that the role of SMEs and their interests need to be taken into greater account in the WTO system. MEPs call on the Commission and Member States to review their priorities at multilateral level by promoting the removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers and to foster international trade through appropriate measures to simplify and harmonise standards. The international trade system should also be made less onerous for SMEs, they say. Reform of trade defence instruments would have failed MEPs welcome the Commission's decision to withdraw the proposals for reform of the trade defence instruments. These reforms would not only have failed to enhance the external competitiveness of European industry but would have caused further serious damage to those Community industrial sectors jeopardised by foreign products illegally subsidised or unduly favoured by dumping practices. The Trade Defence Instrument (TDI) system must continue to be a quasi-judicial procedure, based on objective and factual assessments, in order to provide for predictability and legal certainty, says the report. MEPs consider that the internationalisation of SMEs is a primary objective of trade policy and should constitute a cornerstone of the European Small Business Act, and stress the need to improve access to finance, for SMEs, especially to micro-credit. Preventing and combating counterfeiting MEPs call on the Commission and Member States to commit themselves with renewed vigour to preventing and combating counterfeiting. SMEs should be encouraged to make use of instruments, such as patents, in order to secure their know-how and protect themselves against copying and counterfeiting. The report points out that facilitating access to international markets for SMEs can contribute to creating new jobs, protecting and adding value to existing jobs, safeguarding and exchanging know how and specific features of EU and giving Member States a guarantee of solid and lasting economic growth. Therefore, MEPs believe that the Commission should aim to conclude free-trade agreements or other trade agreements that are favourable to the European economy as a whole and to SMEs in particular. With regard to public tenders, EU SMEs should have the same level of advantages and possibilities as those offered to SMEs in the main industrialised countries (including the United States, Canada and Japan), says the report, adding that "public procurement should be a key chapter in all bilateral and regional trade negotiations undertaken by the European Union, with a view to opening up public procurement markets on a balanced basis". International register of geographical indications to be established Finally, the House supports the establishment of an international multilateral register of geographical indications enabling SMEs to protect their own geographical indications in a simple and economical manner. MEPs consider that the list of protected geographical indications should be supplemented and extended to all EU products which, by their nature or place or method of production, provide EU SMEs with a ‘comparative advantage’ over similar products from third countries.

EU and China: more co-operation, not protectionism say MEPs
2009-02-06 - 12:41
The EU and China are becoming more interdependent, says European Parliament in a report adopted by MEPs, which means that EU-China relations require greater co-ordination among the Member States and with the Commission. Noting an imbalance in bilateral trade between the two partners - notably through China's inobservance of sustainable development, environmental limits and WTO rules - MEPs call on China to meet its obligations and on the EU to provide assistance and promote co-operation. In recent years, China has emerged as Europe's second largest trading partner. In 2007, Chinese exports to the EU - worth some €231bn - grew by 18.7%. The EU's trade deficit with China currently stands at €160bn and is continuing to rise. The report was adopted with 491 votes in favour, to 76 against and 12 abstentions. Taiwan MEPs w elcome the rapprochement between China and Taiwan; considers Taiwan as an economic and commercial entity, which is the EU’s 4th largest trade partner in Asia and support Taiwan’s participation as observer in relevant international organisations where this does not require statehood, i.e. in ILO. Undervalued currency, counterfeiting and excessive bureaucracy China's protectionist practices, excessive bureaucracy, the undervaluing of the Renminbi, subsidies in various forms, and the lack of a proper and agreed level of enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPRs) is hindering full market access for many EU companies, says the European Parliament in an own-initiative report drafted by Corien Wortmann-Kool (EPP-ED, NL). It is estimated that China’s non-tariff barriers towards the EU are annually worth more than €21bn in terms of lost business opportunities to EU companies. MEPs call on the Commission to insist on the removal of all existing export restrictions in all bilateral negotiations with China. They also urge China to join the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) as committed in 2001 and to engage constructively in negotiations on opening its public procurement markets. While MEPs welcome a certain rise in the value of the Renminbi that has taken place this year, they urge that the Renminbi continues to rise in value, so that its worth on international financial markets reflects China's true economic position. They also ask that the Chinese hold more of its foreign exchange reserves in Euros. A policy of engagement and dialogue Given the current economic climate, the House emphasises that Europe should not resort to protectionism in response to the growth in EU-China trade relations. Rather, the development of trade relations with China must go hand in hand with the development of a genuine, fruitful and effective political dialogue, it says. Welcoming the trade-related technical assistance provided to China by the Commission, which MEPs say supports China in implementing its obligations and commitments in the WTO, the report calls on the Commission to continue the policy of engagement and dialogue with China. MEPs therefore regret China's postponement of the EU-China summit which was to be held on 1 December in Lyon. Up to the West to help tackle pollution and ensure workers' rights in China The high levels of pollution caused by China's industry and its growing consumption of natural resources is of "serious concern". Noting that a high share of Chinese industrial production is owned by European firms or ordered by European firms and retailers for consumption in Europe, the report calls for enhanced cooperation between the EU and China to promote the transfer of low-carbon technology. "China cannot be expected to ask its population to carry the burden of limiting greenhouse gas emissions without action by the West", it says. MEPs also call on European businesses operating in China to apply the highest international standards and best practices in corporate social responsibility with regard to workers and the environment, and to agree to mandatory monitoring by independent agencies. Co-operation on all fronts Another concern is the scale of production of counterfeit and pirated goods inside China, "which remains at an alarmingly high level", despite considerable progress made in China in terms of legislation on IPR. The Commission is called on to co-operate with the Chinese authorities at national and regional level in this regard and to continue the fight against counterfeiting. Co-operation between the two partners is also needed on the regulation, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals (REACH), and on climate-friendly standards for cars, trucks, heavy vehicles, aviation and shipping. Welcoming the continued development of EU-China cooperation on space science, applications and technology, MEPs believe increased cooperation between European and Chinese universities and increased mobility for scientists, researchers and students between the EU and China, would also be beneficial.

Animal feed: MEPs approve deal with Council
2009-02-06 - 12:41
Parliament approved a first-reading compromise reached with Council on plans to redraft existing EU rules on the authorising and labelling of animal feed. The aims are to preserve the customer's right to information while safeguarding the industry's intellectual property rights. The legislative resolution was adopted with 543 votes in favour, 8 against and 26 abstentions. "Animal feed has been the source of many food scandals, such as BSE and dioxin. We don't want to see that any more and have built up systems of prevention and control. The regulation for feed labelling is an important piece in the system to prevent feed and food scandals", according to Friedrich Wilhelm GRAEFE ZU BARINGDORF (Greens/EFA, DE), who drafted report on the matter. Following the BSE and dioxin crises, a rule was laid down in 2002 that all raw materials used in the manufacture of animal feed must be stated as a percentage of total weight. This "open declaration" system was one Parliament's key demands at the time. However, it allowed a tolerance figure of +/-15% on the label, with a right for users to be told the exact amount of each ingredient on request. In a judgment on a complaint that this system infringes intellectual property rights, the EU Court of Justice has ruled that the principle of “open declaration” is valid but that providing "exact information on request" is disproportionate in relation to the stated objective of health protection. Labelling and other information requirements clarified In response, the Commission has proposed replacing the requirement to state all raw materials used as a percentage of total weight with a simple list of ingredients in decreasing order by weight, in line with rules for food for human consumption. Producers would also have to provide, at a consumers' request, quantitative data in a range within +/- 15% of the exact quantity, but have a right to refuse the request with reference to their intellectual property rights. Key points of the compromise between MEPs and Council include the following: - the right to refuse data to customers is replaced by a general clause stating that information should be provided "without prejudice to the provisions of the 2004 directive on intellectual property rights"; - the right of customers to demand additional information from the competent authorities (albeit only in the event of health and environmental emergencies); - in addition to the new voluntary EU catalogue of feed materials, manufacturers must notify immediately, in an on-line register, the use of new feed materials not listed in the catalogue; - if purchasers raise doubts as to the truthfulness of nutritional claims used in marketing, the national authorities must verify the "scientific substantiation" of the claim or ask the Commission to clarify matters (including, if necessary, by requesting an opinion from the European Food Safety Authority – EFSA); - at MEPs' request, the new legislation will include a list of materials banned in animal feed (this list, compiled in 2004, includes household waste, waste water and packaging). Under co-decision rules, a first reading agreement will be reached if this text is adopted unchanged by the full Parliament in Strasbourg this coming week and afterwards by the Council, meaning that it could enter into force in 2010.

Asylum policy
Detention centres for asylum seekers are "intolerable"
2009-02-06 - 12:41
Asylum seekers and refugees have the right to live in dignity, access to health care and the right to effective recourse against detention. So says the European Parliament in an own initiative report adopted by 483 to 39 with 45 abstentions, which highlights "intolerable conditions" in detention centres throughout the EU. The report by Martine ROURE (PES, FR), which draws on findings by the Civil Liberties Committee during visits to detention centres for asylum seekers and refugees, deplores the number of deficiencies within Member States, particularly with regard to legal aid and reception conditions. MEPs of the Civil Liberties Committee visited 12 Member States to ascertain whether minimum standards for asylum seekers were being applied. MEPs note on several occasions that the detention conditions in some centres were "intolerable from the point of view of hygiene, overcrowding and the equipment available". They also found that the people detained were "not systematically informed of the reasons for their detention, of their rights and of the progress in their case". Legal aid amounts to no more than a list of lawyers' names Asylum seekers and migrants complained systematically about insufficient and inadequate medical care, in particular for pregnant women and victims of torture. Access to health care is often made difficult in detention centres which are located in prison establishments, say MEPs. The report also points to the lack of quality interpretation services or legal aid in certain Member States, which can amount to "no more than a list of lawyers' names". Access to legal assistance is made more difficult when people in detention are moved between different reception or administrative detention centres, the report states. Existing directives poorly applied by Member States The report regrets that a number of Member States are making increasing use of detention and stresses that a person should not in any event be held in detention for the sole reason that he/she is seeking international protection. Furthermore, the visits revealed that, in some Member States, existing directives were being poorly applied, or were not being applied at all. MEPs call on the Commission to establish, in cooperation with the European Parliament, a permanent system of visits and inspections. They also hope that the Committee on Civil Liberties can continue its visits so as to ensure full compliance with Community law on reception conditions. The report calls for asylum seekers and immigrants to be lodged in open reception centres, rather than in closed units, similar to those already in existence in certain Member States. Moreover, basic reception conditions, such as food, housing and emergency heath care should never be withheld. A show of solidarity MEPs welcome the recent Commission proposal which seeks to reduce obstacles to the labour market and which allows access to employment after a period of six months after an application for international protection has been lodged. Noting that some Member States are more affected by the challenges of immigration than others, the report calls on the EU to "show more solidarity", and not just technical and/or financial solidarity. It proposes establishing a European solidarity instrument aimed at relieving the burden posed by the high number of refugees received by Member States with external borders. Delegations of the Civil Liberties Committee visited detention centres in the United Kingdom (November 2007), Italy (Lampedusa), Spain (Ceuta and Melilla, Canary Islands), France (Paris), Malta, Greece, Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland, Denmark and Cyprus.

Human rights
Human rights: conflict in Sri Lanka, persecution of Burmese refugees, extradition of Cesare Battisti
2009-02-06 - 12:41
Civilians caught in deadly crossfire between the Sri Lankan Government and rebel group Tamil Tigers, the persecution of the Rohingya people of Burma, and the refusal to extradite convicted murderer Cesare Battisti by the Brazilian authorities, were the subjects of three resolutions on democracy and human rights adopted at the end of this week's Strasbourg plenary session. Trapped civilians killed in conflict zone in Sri Lanka
The capture of rebel strongholds by the Sri Lankan army "may constitute a turning point in the crisis" and could pave the way for peace and stability, says Parliament, but warns that a political solution needs to be found and the humanitarian crisis addressed in order for there to be lasting peace.
Over a period of 25 years, fighting between the armed insurgency of the LTTE (Tamil Tigers) and the Sri Lankan Government has caused the deaths of over 70 000 people. Since the beginning of the government’s military offensive in October 2008, the LTTE has retreated into the northern area. However, civilians have been forced deeper into territory controlled by the separatist group, leaving hundreds dead and some 250 000 civilians caught in deadly crossfire.
MEPs call on the government and the LTTE to "abide by the rules of war, to minimise harm to civilians during military operations and to immediately allow the thousands of civilians trapped in the conflict zone safe passage and access to humanitarian aid".
They also underline the need for international monitors to "assess the humanitarian needs of a quarter of a million people trapped in the Wanni region and to ensure proper distribution of food and other humanitarian assistance, particularly as the fighting comes closer to the trapped civilian population".
Violations of media freedom, abuse of children and landmines
According to the International Press Freedom Mission to Sri Lanka, press access in the conflict zone has been denied, journalists covering the conflict have been assaulted or intimidated, and there has been self-censorship by the media. The EP welcomes the Sri Lankan Government’s pledge to ensure full, open and transparent investigations into all alleged violations of media freedom in order also to "address the culture of impunity and indifference over killings and attacks on journalists in Sri Lanka".
Turning to other areas of concern, Parliament reiterates its condemnation of the "appalling abuse of children constituted by the recruitment of child soldiers" by rebel groups, and urges the government to give urgent attention to the clearance of landmines, "the presence of which may present a serious obstacle to rehabilitation and economic regeneration".
Tokyo Co-Chairs call for lasting political solution
The EP endorses the statement by the Tokyo Co-Chairs (Norway, Japan, the US and the EU), which calls on the LTTE to discuss with the Government of Sri Lanka the "modalities for ending hostilities, including the laying down of arms, renunciation of violence, acceptance of the Government of Sri Lanka’s offer of amnesty, and participation as a political party in a process to achieve a just and lasting political solution".
The resolution concludes by calling on the Council, the Commission and the Governments of the Member States to "redouble their efforts to help bring a stable and just peace to Sri Lanka and to restore security and prosperity".

Persecution of Rohingya refugees
In a resolution on the situation of Burmese refugees in Thailand, Parliament deplores reports of inhumane treatment inflicted on the Rohingya refugees by the Burmese Government and urges the Government of Thailand to "take all necessary measures to ensure that the lives of the Rohingya are not at risk and that they are treated in accordance with humanitarian standards".
MEPs strongly condemn the "continuous persecution of the Rohingya by the Burmese Government, which holds prime responsibility for the plight of the refugees". The indigenous people of the mainly Muslim community in western Burma are subjected to systematic, persistent and widespread human rights violations by the ruling military regime, including denial of citizenship rights, severe restrictions of freedom of movement and arbitrary arrests.
The EP demands the "restoration of the Burmese citizenship of the Rohingya, the immediate lifting of all restrictions to their right to education, right to get married and freedom of movement, a stop to religious persecution and destruction of mosques and other places of worship, and an end to all human rights violations across the country as well as deliberate impoverishment, arbitrary taxation and land confiscation".
Rohingya refugees face persecution if pushed back
It has been reported that around 1000 Rohingya boat people were intercepted by the navy in Thai territorial waters between 18 and 30 December 2008 and were subsequently towed into international waters without navigational equipment or sufficient food and water.
MEPs appeal to the Government of Thailand, as "a respected member of the international community well-known for its hospitality towards refugees" , not to push back the Rohingya refugees and asylum seekers, including the boat people, to Burma, where "their lives will be in danger or where they may be subject to torture".
Mistreatment of Rohingya by Thai authorities to be investigated
The United Nations Refugee Agency has voiced its concern about the reports of mistreatment of the Burmese refugees and gained access to some of the 26 Rohingya still kept in custody by the Thai authorities. The Thai authorities claim that the migrants caught in Thai waters were illegal economic migrants. Parliament therefore welcomes the statement by Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva that the allegations of mistreatment of Rohingya asylum seekers by the military will be investigated, and requests that a "thorough and impartial inquiry be carried out".
It also welcomes the Thai Government's co-operation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and calls for "immediate and full access to all the detained Rohingya boat people in order to define their protection needs".
Boat people a regional issue
The resolution stresses that the boat people issue which affects Thailand and other countries is "essentially a regional one". Noting the positive efforts the Thai Government has made to increase co-operation among regional neighbours, the EP appeals to the members of ASEAN, and in particular the Thai Chair and relevant international organisations, to work on a permanent solution to this longstanding problem.

Refusal to extradite Cesare Battisti from Brazil
The Brazilian Government's decision to grant political refugee status to Italian felon Cesare Battisti may be "interpreted as a sign of mistrust towards the European Union", says Parliament. It hopes that the Brazilian authorities, on re-examining his political asylum status, will found their decision on the common principles of respect and rule of law shared by Brazil and the European Union.
Cesare Battisti was convicted in absentia by the Italian judicial authorities of four murders, involvement in an armed group, robbery, possession of fire-arms and armed acts of violence. He went into hiding until he was arrested in Brazil in March 2007.
On 17 January, 2009, Mr Battisti was declared a political refugee by the Brazilian Government, and his extradition has been denied on the grounds that the Italian justice system fails to provide sufficient guarantees in respect of detainees' rights.
However, judicial proceedings are pending and the final decision of the Brazilian authorities should be known in the coming weeks.
EU-Brazil partnership based on mutual understanding
MEPs point out that the partnership between the EU and Brazil is based on "the mutual understanding that both parties will uphold the rule of law and fundamental rights, including the right of defence and the right to a fair and equitable trial".
Parliament therefore trusts that the re-examination of the decision on the extradition of Mr Battisti will "take into account the judgment delivered by an EU Member State in full compliance with the principle of the rule of law in the European Union".
MEPs observed a minute of silence in tribute to those killed at the hands of Cesare Battisti.
The resolution was adopted by 46 votes to 8. Full text of resolutions will appear here (click on 5 February 2009)
