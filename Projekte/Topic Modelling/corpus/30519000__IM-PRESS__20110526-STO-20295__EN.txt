"Balkans Beyond Borders" gets 2nd prize UK youth lifestyle magazine "Europe & Me" scooped the main prize in the 2011 European Charlemagne Youth Prize competition 31 May. The prize is awarded annually to projects that promote a shared sense of European identity and integration among young people.
"The project we chose is extremely original. I think the main message of this project is that Europe is, can and should be cool," said Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek, when awarding the first prize in Aachen, Germany.
Europe & Me is an online youth lifestyle magazine created in 2007. Its motto is to "make Europe personal", allowing people to take the initiative and find like-minded individuals.
Second prize went to a Greek short-film project called "Balkans Beyond Borders" and the third prize to the Spanish cultural exchange programme "Escena Erasmus Project".
The winning projects will receive funding of €5,000, €3,000 and €2,000 respectively, and will be invited to visit the European Parliament.
