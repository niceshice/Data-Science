The extra money will be used to help the EU Member States most directly affected by migration and refugee flows, and to step up maritime surveillance by EU border agency Frontex.
"I am glad that major political parties agreed to vote in favour of my report. This shows that the European Parliament is united, when it comes to the political developments in Southern Mediterranean countries" said Sidonia Jędrzejewska, general rapporteur for the EU's 2011 budget.
Frontex will receive an additional €24 million. The remainder goes to the EU Refugee Fund (€12.2 million), the External Border Fund (€4.9 million) and the EU Return Fund (2.8 million).
The extra money comes from unspent funds for energy projects under the European Economic Recovery Plan.
The proposal was approved with 513 votes in favour, 79 against and 25 abstentions.
The Council of Ministers had already approved the budget amendment on 12 September.
