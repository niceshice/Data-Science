Guy Bono, Jürgen Schröder, Jan Andersson, Cem Özdemir, Doris Pack. In this focus we look back at some of the stories published over the last few months. We have interviews with MEPs who talk about how we define "fair and decent work" for people as well the threat that comes from intellectual and copyright piracy on the internet. We also take a look back at articles we have published on the status of Kosovo and its relationship with Belgrade and Brussels.
Finally, in one of the most moving pieces we have ever published, we recount the experiences of a delegation of visiting MEPs who saw for themselves the effects of rape as a weapon of war in DR Congo. Analysing and debating these kinds of issues is often all in a day's work for MEPs.

Bono and the internet pirates
Guy Bono MEP doesn't want non-profit pirates criminalised The music and film industry is reeling from the impact of online piracy. The film industry alone believes it loses up to 40% of revenue a year. In the UK, France and Germany, governments are pushing for tougher EU treatment of internet pirates. But is this too tough for people who download music for pleasure? On 10 April MEPs backed a report by French Socialist Guy Bono against criminalising people who are not committing piracy for profit. We spoke to him about his report.
Your report calls on EU states to avoid measures such as the "interruption of internet access" to fight digital piracy. Why are you against blocking access to the internet for software pirates?
It goes against people's freedoms and human rights: to cut internet access for those who illegally download material we would need to access their computers and to filter their data, which is an attack on privacy .
Around 80% of people who download materials are youngsters who do not feel they are doing something really illegal. A couple of warnings will not stop them from doing that. It is natural that people exploit the possibilities of the internet! In my youth there was a similar problem with cassettes: we would get a CD from friends and copy it to a tape. This did not kill the disc.
Some measures which have been suggested are disproportionate to the act of downloading. Depriving young people of the internet is a disaster: who can find a job without the internet these days? Of course, if a person profits, sanctions have to be applied. But in that case there is no need to access sensitive data to know who did it. Illegal downloading is done by only 13% of population – it is not as catastrophic as they say. The CD/DVD industry is in crisis, there's no doubt about it, and downloading contributes to it. However, it is not the only cause. Criminalising internet users won't solve the industry crisis.
What is the most efficient way to combat digital piracy?
I think that we need to gather consumers, artists and telecom operators around the table. The EU could set up a program equivalent to MEDIA (which supports cinema) for the disc industry. VAT rates for cultural products could be decreased. Telecom operators also have their share to pay: the internet is a source of major revenue for them while creating losses for artists.
Let's be harsh with those making money from piracy, but let's not have imprisonment - it is not murder! Downloading must be accompanied by financial compensation. Illegal downloading resembles leaving a TV within a reach of a child saying that he has no right to touch. It's human nature – we end up doing it. After explaining that this should not be done the kid will do it once or twice, but finally he will understand it is not allowed. Here we have a similar situation. With the right education we can reduce the extent of illegal downloading.
Is illegal downloading stealing from the artist?
As long as this is not done for profit, young artists are actually favourable to downloading, as this is a way to make themselves known. Those who are already well established are mostly unhappy about it. We have to ge up-to-date, our time is about using the internet: why block access? What’s the use of cutting the internet subscription of a youngster? Prohibition never solved anything.

Swedish MEP Jan Andersson on a decent day's work
What exactly constitutes "decent work" and how can we ensure that more people have access to it? The term is one used by the International Labour Organisation and the European Trade Union Confederation to mean a productive task with a fair income. Swedish Social Democrat Jan Andersson chairs the Parliament's Employment Committee and has just returned from a session of the UN Commission for Social Development in New York. In an exclusive interview he gave us his thoughts on "decent work".
What is your definition of "decent work"?
My definition is work with a decent salary: a salary you at least can live on. But it is not only a salary, it is also good health and safety in the work place, it is influence on your working situation, the possibility of changing it so it suits you, and also today the possibility of life long learning so that you can develop as a person in the work life. The salary is important for life outside work, but other elements are important for work, like health and safety.
Is a minimum wage a way to favour decent work?
Yes and no. You should not focus on a minimum wage. There is always a risk that the minimum wage becomes the maximum wage. You need a minimum wage policy as a last resort, but then you must be very aware that the minimum wage is not the goal: the goal is the normal wage and a better wage than the minimum wage.
Were you satisfied with the outcome of the UN session? Did it live up to your expectations ?
I do not know if I had any expectations as it was my first visit to the UN. We did it for different reasons. I think the EU and the European Parliament should be more active at the global level, not only security policy, but also about environmental policy, trade policies and also decent work and decent working conditions all over the world.
Our aim was to have contacts so that we as a Parliament can play an important role in the global debate. If we do not have dialogue, and improve conditions for workers around the world, there is a risk that protectionist forces in Europe, who want to close our borders, will grow stronger. It is in our interest and it is also in the interest of people outside the EU that we have this kind of dialogue on decent work.
How does the EU work to promote decent work?
We can't decide what happens in other countries. We can be a good example ourselves. We could also raise this issue when we discuss trade, we should discuss issues about environmental standards but also social standards. Should we then say to countries in Africa "you should have the same rules that we have"? No! There are core rules like the ILO convention including the right to be part of an organisation and to fight against child labour. We should promote these conventions all over the world.
How is the situation in the EU?
In a global perspective it is good. But we should not be too proud. The situation around the EU is not perfect and we have big differences within the EU.
The main long-term challenges are workers' ability to influence the workplace and lifelong learning. In today's society, it is important to have a good salary but the main problem is to have the right education. The more you learn the better salary you get, usually.
What about the informal economy?
The black economy is a problem because it is gigantic. In many countries the informal economy is bigger than the formal economy. In the EU it is a big problem because it affects the formal economy. It is a challenge for us to limit the black economy as much as possible. But you also have many differences around the Union.
What are the next steps?
Decent work will be an issue in the coming years. Work is linked to trade and also to the environment, and we will have a bigger debate on how climate change and the need to change the way we live affects employment. We also have to link decent work and sustainable work.

Back from Kosovo, Pack calls for reconciliation on ground
Doris Pack MEP - a call for reconciliation in Kosovo From 17- 19 April a delegation of MEPs from the Foreign Affairs Committee visited Kosovo to talk to ordinary people living in the countryside, as well as politicians, about the situation two months after the declaration of independence. Perhaps the most pressing issue is how its Kosovar and Serb peoples can be reconciled and will they learn to trust one another? German Christian Democrat Doris Pack led the delegation and we asked her about some of the issues.
You met with Kosovo's President, Prime minister and the Speaker of its Parliament. What did you talk about?
We discussed the situation after the declaration of independence and the results of the political work over the last weeks. In particular, we discussed the constitution passed by Kosovo's parliament, which includes basically all the proposals from the Ahtisaari plan which was itself endorsed by the European Parliament last year. The "supervised independence" is based on this plan and focuses particularly on minority rights and decentralisation concerning the places where the Serbian inhabitants of Kosovo mostly live.
After the declaration of independence, there were riots in some parts of in the country. What is the current situation on the ground?
The violence was above all in the northern part in Mitrovica. There is evidence that it was really perpetrated not only by people living there, but also by people coming from outside. I think it was a special situation after the declaration of independence but at this moment we don't see any major problem. The majority of the population is cautious. Serbs in the north at this very moment are not violent - they have free peaceful demonstrations all the time.
What do you think it will take to reconcile the Serbian population to Kosovo's independence?
Reconciliation is something which has to be done on the ground. We met Serbian ministers, we met Serbian MPs who are in the parliament and the problem is that we had impression that in the last year a lot of time has been lost in not bringing people on the ground to trust each other. We were in a little village not so far from Priština where we met the people living there. There was a 60 year old woman who told me she has never been to the cemetery where her mother, father and brother were buried in 1999. So I said: "And why not"? She said "because I fear to go there". The problem is that they fear their neighbours and their neighbours fear them.
So I think more should be done on the ground. It means bringing neighbouring villages and normal people to live together, speak together and find a way to make a common life. They need to trust their neighbours.
Kosovo is under the administration of a UN mission (UNMIK). The EU has sent its mission to Kosovo (EULEX). However, the Serbs do not recognize the EU mission. Can the EU mission operate despite this lack of recognition from the Serbs.?
First of all we are not taking all the obligations from the UN Mission, UNMIK is giving its responsibilities to the government of independent Kosovo. The EULEX mission is there to improve the democratic infrastructure, to help the judges, to train the police. Regarding Resolution 1244 from the Security Council, some people say this mission is in accordance with the resolution and others say it isn't. So it depends on the willingness to accept it. I think we should wait for the elections in Serbia on 11 May, and then we should pick up this question once again. We are there because we feel that our help is needed. If there is interest, a legal basis should be found, can be found and will be found.

MEPs see devastating effect of rape in DR Congo
Jürgen Schröder: "the consequences are disastrous" A recent peace agreement may have given the long suffering people of the Democratic Republic of Congo some cause for hope. Since 1998 the country has been devastated by war, invasion and disease. Over 5 million people have died. One of the most brutal weapons of war has been the rape of women. In January a parliamentary resolution condemned the use of rape and on Tuesday a group of MEPs returned from a fact finding mission to DRC. We asked its head Jürgen Schröder (EPP-ED) what they had seen.
According to the "DRC Humanitarian Action Plan 2008" more than 30,000 rape cases were reported in DR Congo last year. It is probably only a fraction of the total number. Why has rape become so widespread?
Jürgen Schröder: Rape was obviously a weapon during warfare but since the conclusion of the peace agreements (in January 2008), the situation has changed. It is no longer a weapon of warfare; it has become a weapon of ordinary criminality done unfortunately by rebels, by members of the regular Congolese army and even civilians.
One of the factors is the general role of females in the society. Unfortunately the role of females is subordinated to the role of males. The whole country is not well-governed. And in those parts where we were in North Kivu and South Kivu, there is bad governance or absence of governance, chaos dominates. Males of this society have lost their dignity and now use their "male weapons" to also destroy the dignity of those who are weaker - namely the females and children. It is an expression of the chaotic and desolate situation of the whole society.
What consequences does rape have for victims and their families?
JS: The consequences are disastrous. On the one hand women and girls, even small children down to three years are rejected in general by their husbands, by their families, by their villages, because according to the standard of morality or ethics the reputation of the family is affected. On the other hand they suffer physical pain. The perpetrators know that they do not affect only the dignity of the woman but that they also destroy the structure of the society.
In its Resolution Parliament called for the allocation of funds to help the victims. What else can Parliament and the wider European Union do?
JS: I am convinced that this issue of human rights violations in the form of rape must be seen in the context of violation of human rights. There is an absence of a judiciary - which means chaos and impunity. People who do these things rarely see trial. We should go on working to find means whereby a judicial system can be established.
The other thing is that we help women of that country, not only to be free from those human rights violations but to be able to play the leading role of the society. This is what we have drawn as one of the major conclusions. That we should make up projects that are meant to help women in DRC to play a leading role in the society.
The human beings who are the most active in renewing the society are women. I have visited Indonesia and Afghanistan. If you look into the eyes of the female members of the Parliament, you have a feeling that you can talk to them and they understand you. If you look into the eyes of men, you see nothing - I am sorry that I am being so frank. Males in such societies are taught in childhood what to do to be a boy, that the boys are superior to the girls. They are victims of their education whereas women are always being told that they are the lowest level of the society - they have nothing to lose.
We support the peace process and the pacification in this part of the world. Also we can help improve the situation by improving relations with Rwanda and China who are both key players.

Human rights, gas, democracy: Cem Özdemir MEP on Central Asia
Özdemir wants "virus of democracy" in Central Asia MEPs want the European Union to beef up measures to promote human rights, democracy, education and good governance in countries in Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan). In a report adopted during the February plenary, MEPs called for human rights to carry equal weight to energy security and trade. We asked rapporteur and German Green MEP Cem Özdemir about his proposed strategy for this vast and often overlooked region.
Mr Özdemir, why should people in the EU care about Central Asia – a relatively distant and unknown region?
I believe that we should care about where our energy comes from, under what conditions it is produced, the leadership of these countries and what happens to the citizens of these countries. In the long-term we can only have energy security if those countries are stable countries. Dictatorship does not guarantee stability. The best guarantee for stability is participation of all the citizens, and that's what we call democracy. Like global warming, Central Asian issues are universal: caring about Central Asia is good for the people there and good for our people in Europe.
What are the factors that will determine future relations between the countries of Central Asia and the EU? Can the EU speak with one voice?
Twenty seven countries (of the EU) can do a lot - but we can do a lot more if we join forces. Is it really necessary that 27 states open 27 embassies in the 5 Central Asian countries? Do we have the means for that? Probably not. But an EU diplomatic service - such as the one foreseen in the Lisbon treaty - could be much more efficient.
A lot of these countries have a leadership that is post-Soviet and not very experienced in democracy to say the least. So, our business is to train the next generation. I want the next generation of leaders to study in European universities and to know us, and I want us to know them. If they study in Europe, they will come back with "the virus of democracy" and they will know that losing power does not mean the end of the world, that you can always come back at the next election. We have to encourage all those who have more democracy - like Kyrgyzstan - and who want reforms.
What would you say to those claiming that democracy only brought instability into Kyrgyzstan and that Central Asia is not ready for democracy?
For the past 15 years we have said "this is a post-Soviet era". But now we are in the "post-post Soviet era". How many more years are they going to tell us that they have a specific situation? If they want to continue using that argument, these countries have to develop a strategy towards democracy.
They can't for example put opposition politicians or independent journalists into prison, because these are not steps towards democracy but in the other direction. In a country like Kazakhstan, had the elections been fair, the President would have still won - maybe with 70%. So, the leaders of these countries can afford to be more generous towards the opposition and the independent media.
Is there a risk that the immense energy potential of the region could push concerns over torture and other violations of human rights into second place?
We always speak about 5 Central Asian countries and energy but in reality it is 2: Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan. In a country like Tajikistan there are big energy problems: people are freezing. We had to postpone a delegation to Tajikistan recently, because the government could not guarantee acceptable working conditions for us. If this is true for MEPs, what about average people, the ill, the old and the young? The situation is unbelievable. Uzbekistan is selling gas to Russia at the expense of its own people, who are freezing. That's the reality.
Russia and China are also helping Central Asia. But their help is "we give you money, we want your energy". Our help goes beyond that: we also want an end to child labour, healthy and secure conditions for people, who can express their opinions without being threatened with jail or prosecution.
What we offer to Central Asia is technological exchange, environmental knowledge, the best universities in the world, pure friendship which goes beyond just having energy resources. I believe in the long-term that will pay off. We have to tell the leaders of Central Asia "if you want to move your country forward then jump into the 21st century. We know how to do it. So, why don't you copy a successful model which has worked? That's our offer."

The future of Serbia and Kosovo lies in the EU - Saryusz-Wolski
Saryusz-Wolski: "EU is ready to absorb Serbia" With the pro-European Boris Tadić just elected Serbia's President, all eyes are now on Serbia's relations with the EU and the future status of Kosovo. We spoke to Jacek Saryusz-Wolski, the Polish centre-right MEP who Chairs Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, about the possible future relationship of Serbia and Kosovo with the EU. He believes that both could one day be members of the Union - providing their people want it and they fulfil the rules for membership.
Boris Tadić has been re-elected as President of Serbia. What is your interpretation of this result?
First of all the elections have been executed according to all international standards and have expressed the free democratic will of the people. From the EU point of view it is good news: a newly re-elected president that shares European values and sees the future of Serbia within the European family. This gives the perspective of (European Union) membership to Serbia, hopefully in the not too distant future. So we are optimistic at this stage and looking forward to cooperating with the new president and his administration.
EU ministers recently decided to postpone the signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), considered as the first step towards EU membership. How do you see the future of the relationship between Serbia and the EU?
The SAA is ready for signature, there are only minor reservations linked to the cooperation of Serbia with International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). So, as soon as these reservations disappear, the whole process of signing and then implementing the SAA can proceed. I certainly see Serbia's future in the EU. The election of a president with the will to join the EU means that the Serbian people want this option. So now it is a question of technicalities, of finalising the SAA, implementing it and then achieving full membership.
Do you think that the EU is ready to "absorb" Serbia?
Yes, the EU is ready to absorb Serbia as all other states of Western Balkans, provided that the difficult and demanding conditions are met (the EU's "Copenhagen criteria" membership requirements - democratic government, respect for human rights and a functioning market economy) - as for everybody who has joined so far. But first we need peace and stability in the Western Balkans and then we can negotiate membership.
The election seems to show Serbs deeply divided over a possible EU future for their country (Mr Tadić won slightly more than half of all votes). How can the EU win them over?
Once the SAA is signed and put into practice, the Commission and Parliament will monitor that process. Given time, once relations between Serbia and the EU have intensified and the association process has moved forward - then it is likely the attitudes of Serb citizens will be more and more in favour of EU integration.
Kosovo is expected to declare independence soon, a prospect that was opposed by both Serbian presidential candidates. How will this affect relations between the EU and Serbia?
We know that the Kosovo problem is very difficult and painful for Serbia but we are looking towards integrating into the EU the whole of the Western Balkans. So once all those countries are in all those borders will disappear. We are looking forward to establishing good relations throughout the Western Balkans, but especially between Serbia and Kosovo.
What is important now is that if there is a unilateral declaration of independence, as many Member States as possible recognise Kosovo.
Will Kosovo join the EU?
I think that this is the future for Kosovo provided obviously that this is the will of its citizens - their future lies also in the Union.
