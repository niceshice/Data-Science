2007-06-20 - 13:46
MEPs gave a first reading to the EU’s new programme to facilitate cooperation between national tax authorities over the next six years, Fiscalis 2013. They are proposing a number of changes aimed at enhancing transparency of the scheme, and also want to limit it to EU Member States, where the Commission was proposing to include countries participating in the EU’s Neighbourhood Policy too.
Following on from a previous programme in the same field, Fiscalis 2013 aims to provide a forum for increasing knowledge and exchange of best practice between national tax authorities, to enhance the fights against fraud and illegitimate trade by strengthening cooperation and mutual assistance, including via computer information exchange systems and to help cut red tape for taxpayers by looking at the optimal balance between controls and the administrative burden they cause.
The proposed budget for Fiscalis 2013 is around €157m.
The rapporteur on the programme is Hans-Peter MARTIN (NA, AT).
