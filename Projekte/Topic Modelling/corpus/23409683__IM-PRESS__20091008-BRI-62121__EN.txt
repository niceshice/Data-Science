2010 budget: more funding for energy and dairy sectors
MEPs are set to demand an extra €1.5 billion for energy measures and an additional €300 million for a new dairy fund when they vote on the EU's 2010 budget on Thursday. They will also seek to broadly restore figures proposed in the Commission's preliminary draft budget rather than accepting cuts made by Council.
Resolution on freedom of information in Italy and other EU countries
MEPs will vote on a resolution on freedom of information in Italy and other countries in the EU to follow up a recent debate during which some of Parliament's political groups called on the Commission to draft EU legislation on media ownership.
This year's winner of Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought
The winner of the 2009 Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought will be announced by President Jerzy Buzek on Thursday at noon. The winner will be selected from among three finalists chosen on 6 October by the Foreign Affairs and Development committees.
First Question Hour with Commission President Barroso
For the first time Parliament will hold a 'Question Hour' with Commission President José Manuel Barroso, who will reply to a round of questions lasting 30 minutes from political group leaders - or their representatives - on any subject they wish to raise. The floor will then be opened to other MEPs to put questions on a topic of current interest set in advance: on this occasion the impact of the financial crisis on employment and social cohesion.
Parliament votes on arrangements for EU diplomatic service
MEPS are due to vote on a report which suggests that the planned European External Action Service be a part of the Commission set-up and fall within the EU budget. It would thus be subject to democratic scrutiny by Parliament. MEPs will vote on the structure of the service after hearing about the state of negotiations with the Member States.
MEPs to debate top EU jobs ahead of the European Council
Possible candidates for top EU jobs to be created by the Lisbon Treaty's entry into force, including a President of the European Council and a High Representative for foreign affairs, will be the focus of Wednesday's debate on the upcoming European Council summit in Brussels 29-30 October. The Council and Commission will take part in the debate.
Milk prices: new measures to tackle the crisis
New measures to deal with the crisis in the dairy sector will be discussed at a special meeting of the Agriculture Committee on Monday. MEPs will discuss and are then expected to vote on the Commission's proposals. Assuming the committee vote goes ahead, the full Parliament will be able to vote on the issue on Thursday.
MEPs expected to defend the immunity of MEP Marek Siwiec
Parliament is expected to vote to preserve the parliamentary immunity of Polish MEP Marek Siwiec through a draft resolution which argues that "the charges against Mr Siwiec have been brought by a political opponent, with the principal aim of undermining his activity as MEP".
Aid for German workers hit by Nokia closure
Parliament will vote on a proposal to release €5.6 million from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to Germany's North Rhine-Westphalia region, where 1,337 workers lost their jobs when Nokia closed its factory. 20091008BRI62121 Draft Agenda - 19-22 October 2009 EuroparlTV (watch live broadcasts from plenary via Parliament Live)

Budget
2010 budget: more funding for energy and dairy sectors
2009-10-15 - 17:37
MEPs are set to demand an extra €1.5 billion for energy measures and an additional €300 million for a new dairy fund when they vote on the EU's 2010 budget on Thursday. They will also seek to broadly restore figures proposed in the Commission's preliminary draft budget rather than accepting cuts made by Council.
Energy funding under economic recovery plan
A new plan needs new money, said the Budgets Committee when it voted on funding for the EU economic recovery plan two weeks before the coming plenary vote. In particular, the committee called for an extra €1.5 billion in payments to fund investments in gas and electricity infrastructure, offshore wind energy and carbon capture and storage (CCS) as part of the recovery plan.
Aid for dairy farmers
Parliament will also vote on a new fund to help dairy farmers. The Budgets Committee proposed €300 million, rather than the €600 million suggested by MEPs in the September plenary, as a more realistic basis for the forthcoming negotiations with the Council. Besides the dairy fund, the committee voted for other support measures, totalling €631 million, to tackle the milk price crisis.
General budget spending
If the plenary goes along with the Budgets Committee, it will increase the overall draft EU budget to €127.5 billion in payments, compared to Council's €120.5 billion and Commission's €122.3 billion. For commitments, the figures are €141.7 billion (Budgets Committee), €137.9 billion (Council) and €138.6 billion (Commission).
Note to editors : For each budget line, there are two different types of budget appropriations: commitments and payments . The commitments refer to how much the EU may commit itself to (e.g. sign a contract or start a tender procedure) in a certain year. The payment level regulates the actual payments made that year.

Resolution on freedom of information in Italy and other EU countries
2009-10-15 - 17:37
MEPs will vote on a resolution on freedom of information in Italy and other countries in the EU to follow up a recent debate during which some of Parliament's political groups called on the Commission to draft EU legislation on media ownership. In the debate which took place on 8 October, MEPs speaking for the EPP, ECR and EFD groups warned against using the European Union as a forum for settling national political issues. For their part, the S&D, ALDE, Greens/EFA and GUE groups called on the European Commission to draw up Europe-wide legislation on media pluralism.

This year's winner of Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought
2009-10-15 - 17:37
The winner of the 2009 Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought will be announced by President Jerzy Buzek on Thursday at noon. The winner will be selected from among three finalists chosen on 6 October by the Foreign Affairs and Development committees:
- Palestinian gynaecologist Dr Izzeldin Abuelaish
- Swedish-Eritrean journalist and political prisoner Dawit Isaak
- Lyudmila Alexeyeva, Oleg Orlov and Sergei Kovalev on behalf of MEMORIAL and all other human rights defenders in Russia.
Andrei Sakharov, the man behind the prize
By the time of his death in the Moscow winter 20 years ago, Andrei Sakharov had built an international reputation as a nuclear physicist, human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner. His fears over the implications of his work led him to call for peaceful coexistence and later for human rights in the USSR. This led the European Parliament to found a human rights prize in his honour.
Announcement: Thursday 22 October, 12 noon More about the Sakharov Prize, with list of previous winners

Parliament votes on arrangements for EU diplomatic service
2009-10-15 - 17:37
MEPs are due to vote on a report which suggests that the planned European External Action Service be a part of the Commission set-up and fall within the EU budget. It would thus be subject to democratic scrutiny by Parliament. MEPs will vote on the structure of the service after hearing about the state of negotiations with the Member States. Parliament is mindful that the Commission and Council are already working on arrangements for the service. To ensure a swift Parliament position, the EP Constitutional Affairs Committee will hold an extraordinary meeting Monday 19 October to vote on the draft report calling on the Commission to preserve the Community model in the Union's external relations. The plenary vote follows on Thursday.
The EU's new European External Action Service (EEAS) will be established by the Lisbon Treaty. Consisting of officials from the Commission, Council and Member States, the EEAS will assist the High Representative for external relations. The Council will decide how to organise the service on the basis of a proposal from the High Representative.

Green money: new ways to help developing countries fight climate change
2009-10-15 - 17:37
MEPs will hold a debate with Council and Commission on Tuesday morning on how to support developing countries in the fight against climate change, ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in December. The issue of international funding to help developing countries on this front is crucial if an ambitious global agreement is to be struck in Copenhagen.
By 2020 developing countries are likely to face annual costs of around €100 billion to mitigate their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impact of climate change. In a draft resolution MEPs call on the international community to increase significantly its financial support for developing countries and underline the responsibility of industrialised countries for providing sufficient, sustainable and predictable financial and technical support to the poorer countries.
EP will adopt a resolution on this topic during the second plenary session in November.

MEPs will discuss and are then expected to vote on the Commission's proposals. Assuming the committee vote goes ahead, the full Parliament will be able to vote on the issue on Thursday. Members of the committee have asked the Commission to provide full details of the proposed measures, before deciding whether to support them or not. The committee meeting takes place at the same time as the meeting of EU agriculture ministers in Luxembourg. While Parliament has only consultation rights in this matter, a quick decision by the ministers requires the EP to give its go-ahead first. EP Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development

MEPs: immunity and statute
MEPs expected to defend the immunity of MEP Marek Siwiec
2009-10-15 - 17:37
Parliament is expected to vote to preserve the parliamentary immunity of Polish MEP Marek Siwiec through a draft resolution which argues that "the charges against Mr Siwiec have been brought by a political opponent, with the principal aim of undermining his activity as MEP". In 2004 Jerzy Pietrowicz brought charges against Mr Siwiec for "offending his religious feelings". This followed a party-political broadcast in October 2000 which showed Mr Siwiec making the sign of the cross and then kissing the ground (gestures commonly associated with the late Pope John Paul II).
The draft resolution was agreed unanimously by the Legal Affairs Committee.
Debate: Monday 19 October
Vote: Tuesday 20 October (probably) Request for waiver of the immunity of Mr Marek Siwiec

Budget
Aid for German workers hit by Nokia closure
2009-10-15 - 17:37
Parliament will vote on a proposal to release €5.6 million from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to Germany's North Rhine-Westphalia region, where 1,337 workers lost their jobs when Nokia closed its factory. Telecommunications group Nokia moved production from its Bochum plant to China, South Korea, India, Mexico and Brazil between July and November 2008. the German authorities applied for help in February 2009 and the Commission proposed financial support in August.
On 5 October, the Budgets Committee approved a total of €5,553,850 for Bochum and neighbouring Gelsenkirchen, Recklinghausen and Dortmund. All four cities traditionally have higher unemployment rates - from 10.2% to 12.3% - than the rest of North Rhine-Westphalia and Germany. This sum is half the total budget for the employment measures in the region.
Note to editors: The funds are not for job losses in Bochum caused by relocation within the EU.

Schengen
Commission to be quizzed on delays over police database
2009-10-15 - 17:37
MEPs will question the Commission on Monday about delays in modernising the Schengen Information System, a database that enables police forces across the EU to share data for law enforcement purposes. It includes missing persons, stolen goods and court proceedings. Parliament will vote on a resolution on Tuesday. In operation since March 1995, the system could initially, for technical reasons, only serve a maximum of 18 Member States and so needed upgrading after the enlargements of 2004 and 2007. SIS II should also be easier to manage, more flexible and secure and capable of integrating new data and new functions. Technical problems seem to have delayed its start to 2011. Meanwhile, an intermediate upgraded version of the system, “SIS-I 4 all” has allowed nine of the new Member States (all but Cyprus) to be connected to the SIS.
The UK and Ireland are not part of the Schengen zone but do have opt-ins. They have started taking part in some aspects of it including the SIS for law enforcement purposes and they both intend to opt in to SIS II.

MEPs will debate transatlantic issues on Wednesday, including nuclear proliferation, the financial crisis, climate change, the Doha talks, and visas. They are set to adopt a resolution on these topics ahead of the next EU-US summit, in Washington on 2-3 November. The Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC), which brings together EU Commissioners and members of the US Administration to advance EU-US economic integration, also meets in Washington on 27 October.
