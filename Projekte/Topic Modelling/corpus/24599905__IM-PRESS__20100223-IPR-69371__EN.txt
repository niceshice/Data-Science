Late payment of bills in the business world: the same penalties for all

Companies should be able to get money owed to them more quickly thanks to an update of the existing EU directive on late payment in commercial transactions. This is crucial to the survival of businesses which are encountering growing cashflow problems in the economic crisis. The EP draft report on this subject was presented for the first time on Monday 23 February.
This first version of the parliamentary report on the thorny issue of late payments is the product of several months of work and consultation with experts, both sides of industry and national parliamentarians. The late payment of bills is a frequent cause of the cashflow problems suffered by thousands of firms on the edge of bankruptcy. According to studies by the European Commission, in some Member States the public authorities are the worst payers. For this reason the draft legislation differentiates between the private and public sectors.
Equal penalties for private firms and public bodies
Barbara Weiler (S&D, DE), author of the parliamentary report, recognises the justification for distinguishing between private companies and public authorities in this matter. However, she believes the penalties imposed on late payers should be the same for all. This view was backed by MPs from national parliaments invited to Brussels by the Internal Market Committee in September 2009.
Another change made to the draft legislation by the rapporteur is to the level of penalties. Instead of 5% of the sum due, as proposed by the European Commission when late payment interest is payable, Barbara Weiler calls for a sliding scale under which the debtor would pay 2% of the sum due as soon as interest becomes payable, then 4% of the sum from the forty-fifth day following this date and, lastly, 5% from the sixtieth day. The penalty should not exceed â‚¬50,000.
A 30-day deadline for public bodies
The draft directive does not propose setting payment deadlines for private firms but it does for public authorities. Barbara Weiler believes the derogations envisaged in the draft text are unhelpful for legal clarity. She argues that a 30-day payment deadline should be the basic principle for public bodies and that any derogations - which should be carefully defined - should remain the exception. However, she does agree with the idea of a 60-day payment deadline for public bodies in "genuinely justified cases" and for public authorities operating in the health sector.
The draft parliamentary report also proposes the introduction of staggered payments, which are already used in the construction industry, to improve firms' cashflow situations. The definition of public authorities is also broadened, to include public undertakings of general interest (for example, water, energy, transport and postal bodies).
Next steps
Members of the EP Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee, which is responsible for the passage of this legislation through Parliament, have until 2 March to table amendments to the draft report. The committee vote will take place in April and the plenary vote in May.
