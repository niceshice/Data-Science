MEPs gather for the first Plenary of 2007
Institutional change takes centre-stage at Parliament's first plenary session of 2007. President Josep Borrell is standing down at the end of his two-and-a-half-year term of office, so MEPs will be electing a new President, as well 14 Vice-Presidents. With the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the EU at the start of this year, the number of MEPs increases from 732 to 785.
Parliament will also have the chance to debate with German Chancellor Angela Merkel the work programme of her country's six-month presidency of the EU, which began on 1 January. On the legislative front, the third rail package comes up for second reading and MEPs will also respond to the Commission's latest road safety proposals. In addition, Parliament will give its view on the operation of the EU's code of conduct on arms exports. Monday 15 January At the start of the session, outgoing President Josep Borrell will formally welcome the 35 new Members from Romania and the 18 from Bulgaria, who take up their seats following the accession of their countries on 1 January. The arrival of the new intake of MEPs is providing an opportunity for the set up of a new political group. Mr Borrell will then give his farewell speech to the House as he completes his term of office, which began in July 2004 following the European elections of that year. Tuesday 16 January Nominations of candidates to replace Mr Borrell as President must be put forward by Monday evening. At the time of writing four candidates have been proposed. The election takes place on Tuesday and is followed by the election of the 14 Vice-Presidents and six Quaestors. Wednesday 17 January The House holds a keynote debate on Wednesday morning with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Commission President Jos√© Manuel Barroso on Germany's six-month presidency of the EU. The main issues are constitutional reform, the Lisbon economic agenda and the EU's area of freedom, security and justice. On Wednesday afternoon, MEPs will discuss with Commission and Council the case of the Bulgarian and Palestinian medical staff facing a death sentence in Libya, before adopting a resolution on the issue. They will then debate a report calling for tougher implementation of the EU's code of conduct on arms exports, before turning to the main legislative item on this week's agenda, the third rail package. This latest effort to inject more competition into Europe's rail networks focuses on passenger services but, given the sticking points between Parliament and Council, it looks as if conciliation will be needed. Other reports on Wednesday look at the Commission's mid-term review of the EU's road safety action programme and the request for Parliament's assent to an updated partnership agreement with the developing countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. Towards the end of the day proposed changes to the membership of Parliament's committees will be announced with a vote to follow on Thursday. New chairs and vice-chairs of the committees will be elected at the committee meetings the following week. Thursday 18 January A report on equality between men and women in the work of the EP's committees is the first item on Thursday's agenda. Another report, on the law on non-contractual obligations, deals with a range of topics to do with disputes between EU citizens from different Member States, such as traffic accidents.
