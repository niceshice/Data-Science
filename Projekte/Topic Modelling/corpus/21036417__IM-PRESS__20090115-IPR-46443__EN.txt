The President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering, has expressed his deep concern that even international relief organisations are no longer safe from attack in Gaza.
Following the latest media reports on the shelling of the headquarters of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in Gaza, in which UN personnel have been injured and relief material apparently burnt, Hans-Gert Pöttering stated:
"The international relief of the UN represents a last hope for the long-suffering civil population of Gaza. If even aid organisations such as UNRWA are no longer safe, this shows contempt for international law, and we have reached an absolute nadir in this conflict."
The European Parliament in its resolution adopted almost unanimously today expressed its shock at the suffering of the civilian population in Gaza and called for an immediate and permanent ceasefire which should include a halt to rocket attacks by Hamas on Israel and the end of Israel's military action in Gaza.
It called for a negotiated truce, which should be guaranteed by a mechanism, which could include the dispatching of a multinational presence, under a clear mandate, in order to restore security and secure respect for the ceasefire for the people in Israel and Gaza.
