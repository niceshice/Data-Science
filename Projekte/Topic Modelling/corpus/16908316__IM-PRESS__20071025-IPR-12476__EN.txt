MEPs adopted a written declaration on origin marking which emphasises the right of European consumers to immediate access to information about their purchases; stresses that fake indications concerning product origin are, like any kind of fraud, unacceptable; believes that a level playing field with the EU's trading partners must be guaranteed, in line with a fair trade agenda.
The declaration was sponsored by Joseph DAUL (EPP-ED, FR), Enrique BARÓN CRESPO (PES, ES), Graham WATSON (ALDE UK Liberal Democrat South West), Heide RÜHLE (Greens/EFA, DE)and Eugenijus MALDEIKIS (UEN, LT). Over half the total number of MEPs (399 so far) have signed the written declaration meaning that it becomes an official position of the European Parliament.
The declaration fully supports the Commission’s proposal for a Council regulation introducing compulsory indication of the country of origin of certain products imported into the European Union from third countries. MEPs also call on the Member States to adopt the proposal without delay, in the interests of consumers, industry and competitiveness in the EU.
MEPs underline that the European Union attaches the utmost importance to transparency for consumers, and whereas information on the origin of goods is vital in that respect.
The House also says that the number of cases of misleading and fraudulent indications of origin on goods imported into the European Union is increasing, potentially jeopardising consumer safety. A number of the EU's major trading partners, says MEPs, such as the United States, Japan and Canada, have enacted mandatory origin-marking requirements.
