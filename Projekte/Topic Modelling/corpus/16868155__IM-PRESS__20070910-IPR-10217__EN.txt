EU will need conventional energy sources for some time yet, says Industry Committee

On current trends, the EU will rely on imports to meet 65% of its energy needs by 2030. Yet gas and oil supplies are dogged by uncertainty due to geopolitical risks and growing demand elsewhere. The need to produce and use energy more safely, efficiently and sustainably across the Union is underlined in an own-initiative report on "conventional energy sources" adopted by the EP Industry Committee on Thursday.
Welcoming the Commission’s communications on sustainable power production from fossil fuels, MEPs underlined that these and other conventional sources will remain highly important in ensuring the EU’s security of energy supply. Given the EU's commitment to tackling climate change, however, MEPs stressed that the Union and its Member States should redouble their R&D efforts "with a view to enhancing the efficiency of energy production and supply, reducing environmental impact, improving the safety of existing technologies [and] developing storage techniques for renewables."
Carbon capture
MEPs called on the Commission quickly to table legislative proposals on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology "so as to respond to the legal issues surrounding the storage and transportation of CO2." They underlined "that CCS should be fitted to fossil fuel plants at the earliest practical opportunity". The committee nonetheless acknowledged that CCS technology is linked to losses of efficiency in power stations and called for research to address the issue.
Members also stressed the significant potential of energy generation from biomass, the need for the EU to support synthetic fuels technology and, with a view to the diversification of gas imports, the importance of liquefied natural gas (LNG).
Nuclear energy "indispensable" for some time to come
Acknowledging that nuclear energy is a key component of power supply in most EU Member States, providing one-third of the EU’s electricity supply, MEPs said that nuclear energy is "indispensable if basic energy needs are to be met in Europe in the medium term." Given that "nuclear energy is currently the largest low-CO2 energy source in Europe", they added, "the renunciation of nuclear power will make it impossible to achieve the objectives set regarding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and the combating of climate change".
The report, drafted by Herbert Reul (EPP-ED, DE), was adopted with 37 votes in favour, 7 against and 3 abstentions. It is scheduled for a plenary vote in October.
