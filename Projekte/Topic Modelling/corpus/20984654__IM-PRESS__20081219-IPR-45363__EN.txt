On Monday evening, the Bureau of the European Parliament decided to name three areas of the Parliament in memory of former Members who, both during and before their time as MEPs, made a significant contribution to the process of European integration.
The Bureau decided that:
the reading room of Parliament's Library will be named after Francisco Lucas Pires of Portugal. A professor of constitutional and European law, and a member of the EPP group, Mr Lucas Pires was a Vice-President of Parliament at the time of his death in 1998, after 12 years as MEP. His work strongly contributed to European integration and the full inclusion of Portugal in the EU.
the Conciliation Committee meeting room will be named after Renzo Imbeni of Italy. Mr Imbeni was a MEP in the Socialist group from 1989 to 2004 and served the Parliament as one of its vice-presidents for the last ten years of his career. He died in 2005. A supporter of increasing the Parliament's role within the EU system, Mr Imbeni was also a co-chair of the Conciliation Committee on behalf of the Parliament.
the main courtyard of the Tower building in Strasbourg will be named after Bronisław Geremek of Poland. Mr Geremek, an anti-communist dissident who then served as Polish Foreign Minister, was elected to the European Parliament in 2004 and represented the ALDE group on both the Foreign and Constitutional Affairs Committees. He was closely involved in the discussion over the EU institutional reforms until his death in 2008.
