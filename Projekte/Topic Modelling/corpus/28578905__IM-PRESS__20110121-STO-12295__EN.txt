A woman begs for a donation in the city centre of Cologne, Germany ©BELGA 17% of all women live in poverty Report urges use of Social Fund to fight poverty Women across Europe face greater poverty and poorer pay and working conditions than men. On average they earn between 14%-17% less than men and are more likely to be on fixed term contracts. A report backed the Parliament's Women's Rights and Gender Equality Committee Thursday (27 January) calls on governments to set targets to reduce pay disparities by 1% per year.
As well as the pay gap there is also the risk of poverty as 17% of all women across the 27 countries of the European Union live in poverty. The elderly, single mothers, the disabled and minority groups are particularly at risk in this instance.
The report - drafted by Romanian Socialist MEP Rovana Plumb also calls for more childcare facilities to be made available to mothers to allow work and life to be more finely balanced. MEPs on the Committee also called for more specific programmes to get women into the labour market.
In addition the report points out that the pension systems in most European countries is unfair to women as they are based on years of work - and women often miss several through child raising.
MEPs back European Women's Rights Charter
The Committee members would also like to see a specific European Women's Rights Charter adopted to improve women's rights and opportunities.
MEPs want the European Social Fund in particular to be used by governments to fight poverty amongst women.
Ms Rovana Plumb stressed "the current economic, financial and social crisis that affects the European Union, as well as the rest of the world, is generating a series of specific negative effects, directly influencing women’s living and working conditions, and their place in society in general."
She went on to say that "women’s contribution to the development of family, society and economy is regularly underestimated and underpaid".
