Ahead of the EU-Africa summit being held in Lisbon this weekend, a delegation of MEPs met members of the Pan-African Parliament on Friday morning in the Portuguese capital. A joint declaration by both Parliaments was adopted calling for them to have a stronger role in the new Joint EU-Africa strategy. EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering and Pan-African Parliament (PAP) President Gertrude Mongella will both address the EU-Africa Summit taking place during the weekend.
A Joint Strategy prepared by European and African governments lays out a long term shared vision of the future of EU-Africa relations which would bring benefits to both continents.
The priorities until the next EU-Africa summit in 2009 are peace and security, democracy, human rights, trade, regional integration, development, energy, climate change, migration, employment, science and the information society.
Before the Summit MEPs and Members of the Pan-African Parliament met and adopted a Joint Statement. They called for greater focus on the eradication of poverty and development, particularly through investing in people’s health and education.
The statement criticizes that there is little role for the parliaments foreseen in the strategy - EP and PAP ask for fully involvement into process. They believe that:
real progress can only be achieved having at its heart the people for whom this progress is meant.
parliaments are the democratically elected representatives of the people.
they reflect various opinions of society and are places where different views can be reconciled, compromise found.
Parliaments also must have stronger role in budgetary matters to ensure "that executives carry out the agreed policies in an effective, democratic and fiscally responsible manner". Financial aid too often runs directly form executive to executive bypassing parliamentary monitoring.
Facts:
Three out of every four persons who die from AIDS are Africans.
Every 30 seconds, an African child dies of malaria. Half the deaths could be avoided if parents had access to diagnosis and drugs that cost little more than 1 euro a dose. However, almost half of all Africans are still living on less than 1 Euro a day.
Hunger is a key factor in more deaths than all the continent’s infectious diseases put together.
Life expectancy is falling. People in Africa on average live to the age of just 46 but in some countries it is as low as 35.
The EU is already the world’s largest donor in Africa and is the continent’s most important economic and trade partner.
