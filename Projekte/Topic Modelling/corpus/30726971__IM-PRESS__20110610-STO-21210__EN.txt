Ban on phosphates in dishwasher detergents will improve water quality

EuroparlTV MEPs called on the Commission Wednesday to extend a proposed ban on phosphates in laundry detergents to household dishwashers, in an effort to help improve water quality and aquatic life, which are damaged by phosphates discharged into waste water.
Phosphates are used in detergents to combat water hardness and facilitate cleaning but when discharged into lakes and rivers, they cause a proliferation of algae which in turn kill fish and other species by starving them of oxygen.
Ban on dishwasher detergents by 2015?
The Environment Committee welcomed the Commission's proposal to ban the use of phosphates in household laundry detergents from 1 January 2013 and called for the ban to be extended to household dishwasher detergents from 2015. Given the current lack of suitable technical and economic alternatives to phosphates in dishwasher detergents, the Commission has only "encouraged" the industry to develop phosphate-free detergents for dishwashing machines.
"It is true that, compared to the market in laundry detergent, less progress has been made so far on formulating household dishwasher detergents that are both low-phosphorus and at the same time high-performance. Nonetheless, phosphate-free formulas are already available and manufacturers are innovating all the time," said British Liberal Bill Newton Dunn , who is guiding the legislation through Parliament.
"It is therefore reasonable to expect that in the next four years until my proposed ban comes into effect, the vast majority, if not all, will have been able to make the switch and to offer products that meet the expectations of consumers in terms of cleaning performance," he said.
Laundry detergents: a big phosphate contributor
Detergents are the third largest source of phosphate discharge into surface water, behind agriculture and sewage. Laundry is the largest contributor in the detergent sector. Alternative water-softening ingredients are available, although their effectiveness varies.
Some EU countries already have national restrictions, while others rely on the voluntary action of detergent manufacturers. This has led to poor water quality in some regions, like the Danube River and the Baltic Sea.
The Plenary vote is scheduled for November.
