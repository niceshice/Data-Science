Political storms, clouds and clear skies are expected this week when MEPs convene in Strasbourg. ©Belga Variable temperatures are on the horizon this week as MEPs gather in Strasbourg to prepare their position on December’s Copenhagen climate change summit and debate the next EU summit. Expect clear skies when the EP holds a final vote on new telecom rules after a long and stormy negotiations with the Council and a sunny day for European cinema, with the award of the 2009 LUX. Prize on Wednesday.
Monday
Mild temperatures are expected as MEPs discuss changes to the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure because of the Lisbon Treaty, which strengthens the EP’s powers, but are set to rise for the joint debate on macro-financial assistance to Georgia, Armenia, Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Tuesday
Long-term trends risk being very dry and arid as MEPs consider the forthcoming Copenhagen summit on climate change, as some of the world’s most polluting nations are dampening expectations that there will be a binding agreement in December.
From 1500-1600 CET, expect storms, clouds and clear skies during the second Question Time with the President of the Commission, which you can follow live on twitter - our micro blogging tool.

The sun could burst through for the European cinema at 1145 as the 2009 LUX Prize award ceremony takes place.
