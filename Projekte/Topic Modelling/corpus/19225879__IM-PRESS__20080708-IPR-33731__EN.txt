The European Parliament backed today the proposal instituting an ad hoc special temporary regime which will derogate from some provisions of the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) regulation up to the end of 2010. This proposal, presented by the Commission on Wednesday, pledges up to another 600 million euros to fund this temporary specific action to help the fishing industry to adapt to high fuel prices.
The core of the proposal, voted today in the European Parliament under the urgent procedure, consists of a regime of temporary derogations to the EFF allowing funds to be targeted quickly where they are needed most to address the underlying causes of the crisis, and provide short-term support to the hardest-hit segments of the fleet.
The Agriculture and Fisheries Council will discuss the package next week, with a view to ensuring its rapid entry into force.
