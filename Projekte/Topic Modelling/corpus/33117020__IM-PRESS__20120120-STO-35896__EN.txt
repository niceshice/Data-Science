Bill Gates Bill Gates praised European countries and the EU for their commitment to development aid Tuesday afternoon and encouraged them to continue despite the tough economic times. Speaking to the members of the Development Committee, Gates said "Europe's role will shape global action, what happens to people in need."
He noted that the EU is the largest development aid donor in the world. "Europe's generosity has helped save millions and millions of lives...it is critical that you continue your leadership and we continue working together and caring for each other."
Gates is "optimistic about solving poverty problems" and underlined "amazing progress" over the past 50 years. He said investment in health and agriculture in the world's poorest countries has brought far-reaching results. The setting of clearly measurable targets for development programmes, which are then tracked, should help reduce corruption concerns.
"You (Europeans) should feel very proud of what you have done," Gates said and concluded by highlighting the need of "spreading out success stories and continuing to increase commitment (to aid) in the name of humanity".
EP President Martin Schulz agreed that the European Union has a duty to show solidarity and contribute to international aid because the EU's "long-term stability depends on the long-term stability of other regions in the world". Thanking Gates for the work of his foundation, he stated: "Irrespective of political colours, the European Parliament will stand shoulder to shoulder with you".
Bill Gates was in the EP in his role as co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
