EP President Buzek prepares to give the 2009 internet journalism prize to Hungarian reporter Bálint Szlankó. Ines Possemeyer's article "How Europe is renewing itself" broke new ground when it looked at work and migration for people who lived in countries that joined the EU in 2004. Its impact led to it winning one of the four categories of the European annual journalism prize which is again open to journalists from the written, radio, TV and internet media.
The four winners came from 65 national winners chosen from across the European Union. All of the entries were articles or programmes that had drawn attention to some aspect of either EU policies or EU institutions.
For the 2010 prize entries must have been published or broadcast in an official EU language between 1 May 2009 and 31 March 2010.
For those who wished to apply applications will be accepted from 15 January 2010 until 31 March 2010 inclusive. The prize will be awarded in October 2010. The winner in each category will receive €5,000 .
