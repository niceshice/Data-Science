One of those areas is the Arctic, which is estimated to contain up to a quarter of undiscovered global oil reserves leading some experts to call the region the next Saudi Arabia.
Due to global warming, these resources will become more accessible as the sea ice melts, which makes it enticing enough for countries bordering the Arctic including Russia, Denmark, Canada, the US and Norway to begin staking their claims.
"Environmentally friendly extraction processes"
Oil extraction within the EU is on the decline, so Europeans are becoming more dependent on imports. MEPs led by German Christian Democrat Herbert Reul are calling for a series of unconventional measures to secure the EU's future oil supply including the possibility of oil production in the Arctic region.
The report, adopted earlier this month by the Industry, points to the "importance of the Arctic region as an oil-producing area" and calls for an "environmentally friendly extraction processes to be developed". In the interests of overall international stability, there needs to be an "equitable distribution of hydrocarbon resources in the Arctic", it says.
As the scramble for strategic resources beneath the ice begins to heat up along with the climate, environmental concerns and issues over the rights to the region may add oil to the fire. "Technically, extraction in the Arctic is already possible," Mr Reul said, but "strict environmental regulations must be in place".
Oil shale, oil sand, 2nd generation biofuels
Supply could also come from non-conventional sources of oil such as oil shale or oil sand and extra heavy oil if they can be made commercially viable. Compared to traditional oil "the big advantage of unconventional oil resources is that they are widely spread around the globe," Mr Reul said. "If you take these kinds of resources into account, Canada is the country with most oil resources after Saudi Arabia. If these resources are put to use, the EU can diversify its imports much more."
He is less convinced about whether first generation biofuels can substitute oil in the medium and long term. "There can be a competition between food crops and plants for biofuels production (which may) tighten the supplies of food crops and hence pushes prices up. Taking into account global population growth we should prefer in the medium and long run second generation biofuels which are not produced from food crops," Mr Reul said.
Back to nuclear energy?
Mr Reul also suggests a shift towards nuclear energy as a carbon-neutral solution. Many opponents are however not convinced that this is the way to go. "In terms of efficiency, nuclear energy is unbeatable...It offers good value for money, it is reliable and price fluctuations for uranium have little impact on the overall production costs. In addition, new plants are more efficient and reprocessing of old fuel rods is possible to a much wider extent than in previous power plants," Mr Reul said. He said that nuclear power plants save 160 million tons of CO2 in Germany and even more in France. "They are thus a central contribution to the EU’s climate protection efforts," he added.
