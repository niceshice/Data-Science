In adopting a joint resolution on the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, MEPs have noted with great interest the reports by the Commission on the state of preparedness of Bulgaria and Romania for their accession to the European Union and pay tribute to the great care and seriousness with which the Commission has monitored the preparatory efforts for and the implementing measures taken by both countries in order to meet the conditions for their entering the European Union by 1 January 2007.
MEPs note with satisfaction that the Commission maintains the deadline for both countries to enter the European Union by 1 January 2007 on condition that the necessary measures are taken to resolve the outstanding problems, and accepts the recommendations made by the Commission with regard to the further procedure for taking a final decision on the date of accession of Bulgaria and Romania.
The House calls on the European Council, at its Summit on 15-16 June, to maintain its commitment to Bulgaria and Romania joining the EU on 1 January 2007 if they are ready. MEPs at the same time, welcome the specialist assistance that has been provided by Member States, particularly in the field of justice and policing, and urges reinforcement of this assistance in the coming months.
MEPs stress that the Bulgarian and Romanian Governments must be aware of the need to make full use of the remaining months and produce concrete results in meeting the requirements for achieving full EU membership by 1 January 2007.
Parliament notes with satisfaction the serious efforts and considerable progress made by Bulgaria and Romania in past months to meet the EU's political and economic criteria and to gradually adopt and implement the acquis communautaire.
MEPs emphasise the need for both countries to continue to consolidate the ongoing reform of their justice systems, by further enhancing the transparency, efficiency and impartiality of the judiciary, and to demonstrate substantive further results in the fight against corruption, with special emphasis on the fight against organised crime. Parliament stresses the utmost importance of taking all the measures required to combat the trafficking of human beings and to substantially enhance the degree of social inclusion of Roma communities, especially with regard to housing, health care, education and unemployment.
The House is aware that a decision on the accession of each country will be taken on its own merits and in the light of each country's achievements, but would welcome it if, on the basis of the progress achieved so far by both countries and their activities geared to achieving further progress in the next few months, Bulgaria and Romania can enter the European Union together and on the same date. MEPs call on all political forces in Bulgaria and Romania to concentrate their activities on meeting the conditions for EU membership by 1 January 2007 and to maintain the political commitment needed to achieve this objective.
Parliament also calls on the Commission, as a matter of urgency, to provide Bulgaria and Romania with the clearest possible guidance on the outcomes that are expected in order to meet its concerns, to ensure that the maximum Community resources are targeted on these areas in order to help produce tangible improvements, and, in cooperation with the Bulgarian and Romanian authorities, to define the nature of and procedures for any possible post-accession monitoring measures and the circumstances under which they might be necessary. Finally, MEPs ask the Member States to complete the ratification process for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania on schedule.
