MEPs also approved stricter budgetary surveillance for member state while, Palestine was also in the spotlight. Read about these and other subjects dealt with during the plenary.
The introduction of an EU-wide financial transaction tax was the centrepiece of Commission President Barroso's state of the union speech on Wednesday, in which he defended the EU as the guarantor of peace and stability in Europe. Most political groups warmly welcomed his proposals, condemning member state efforts to combat the crisis outside the EU institutional framework.
Following intense negotiations, MEPs approved the economic governance "six-pack" on stronger budgetary surveillance, which should limit the ability of member states to ignore eurozone public finance rules.
MEPs discussed the situation in the Middle East after the Palestinian Authority applied for UN membership and, thus, recognition of a Palestinian state. Some MEPs expressed support, others emphasised Israel's desire for security and most speakers called for a resumption of peace negotiations. MEPs also approved a deal that should boost Palestinian exports of farm and fisheries products to the EU.
More than 35,000 people were killed in road accidents in the EU in 2009. "Alcolocks" on commercial goods and passenger vehicles and an EU-wide 30 km/h speed limit in residential areas, are among the 103 road safety measures proposed by the EP to halve road deaths by 2020.
Parliament revised EU rules on exports of products with both civilian and military use, such as chemicals, telecommunication devices and software. MEPs won an undertaking that no general export authorisation will be given to " dual-use " technologies that can be used to violate human rights.
EU-financed food aid to more than 13 million poor Europeans has run into trouble after the European Court of Justice declared the current mode of operation illegal. The Commission has had to cut projected spending for 2012 to €113.5 million from the €480 million originally planned. MEPs urged Council and Commission to act and criticised six member states for blocking efforts at a compromise.
Homosexuality, bisexuality and trans-sexuality are still seen by some as a mental illness. In a resolution, MEP's called for an end to the discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity suffered by lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.
MEPs expressed concern at the rising tensions between Turkey and Cyprus in a dispute over oil and gas exploration. They condemned Turkey's threats and stressed that a threat against one member state is a threat against the whole EU.
There was a lively debate Thursday morning over the technical parameters of body scanners at airports in the EU. MEPs are concerned they might reveal too much.
MEP voted on a resolution setting out a common EU position for next year's UN Rio +20 summit . MEPs want a strong and unified EU approach for the sustainable development summit next June.
