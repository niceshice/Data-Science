Juries of journalists in each EU Member State selected 64 national winners: 21 in the written press category, 16 for radio, 15 in the television category and 12 for internet. The award jury in Brussels, composed of three MEPs and six journalists, has since selected one final EU winner for each category: written press, radio, TV and the Internet. Each winner will receive €5000.
