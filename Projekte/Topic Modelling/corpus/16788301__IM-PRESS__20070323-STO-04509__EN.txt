They are listening, but are Europe's leaders?
Rome - the eternal city - played host to a gathering of 200 young Europeans over the weekend. While EU leaders met in Berlin to mark 50 years of the EU, a group of young people were setting out their vision for the next half century at the "European Youth Summit". Top of their list of demands was the right to a good education and that the EU should reform its institutions to be more democratic.
"Let's not make this event just a symbolic meeting"
One of those calling for the voice of youth to be heard was Sophie Tsouris from Cyprus. "EU leaders should really listen to us and take into account our proposals...Let's not make this event just a symbolic meeting," she demanded..
Some thought that the Summit should try and give clear guidance to those in power: "we should come up with more concrete proposals and ideas, offering more clear guidelines to the EU leaders" said Lina Nefaite from Lithuania.
Picking up on this theme was Matti Vandemaele from Belgium who said that "we should organise a meeting with 27 young people together with 27 EU leaders and discuss about Europe."
As well as the issues, the atmosphere was important: Brendon Browne from Irish National Youth Council commented that "it is fantastic opportunity to discuss issues of real interest to the youth. I really enjoyed the friendly atmosphere."
Rome Declaration: call for education and more democracy
In a final declaration young people called for the EU to concentrate on a number of issues. These include:
Education - access for all is crucial.
The need for sustainable development in light of global warming.
An increased role for NGOs in society.
Reform of the EU's institutions: to increase democratic decision-making and communicate better with citizens.
A "legitimate Constitution".
An increase in European Parliament's the role in decision-making.
This last point was reiterated by the President of the European Youth Forum, Bettina Schwarzmayr, who said that "we want to see a strong European Parliament, as the EU elected body that has legitimacy as the natural conduit connecting citizens to the European Union".
A number of leading EU figures attended or spoke at the meeting. For the Parliament its President Hans-Gert PÃ¶ttering was there as was Vice-President Alejo Vidal-Quadras - who was presented with the declaration. He said "that you can count on the European Parliament to see your ideas come to reality". The issues raised at the Summit are set to be discussed by the Parliament's Culture Committee.
The European Youth Forum, established in 1996, is an international organisation established by national youth councils and international non-governmental youth organisations.
