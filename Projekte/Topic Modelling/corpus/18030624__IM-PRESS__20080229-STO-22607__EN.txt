Globalisation: fears and opportunities

As the world shrinks and competition from places like the US, China and India intensifies, the debate over the social effects of globalisation in Europe will no doubt intensify. On 4 March in Brussels MEPs, experts and representatives of the EU's Foundation for Living and Working conditions debated the positive and negative aspects of globalisation. The need to tackle inequality, invest in human capital and a call for a realistic approach were among the themes raised during the hearing.
Speaking for the Dublin based Foundation for Living and Working conditions, Donald Storrie drew some historical parallels with what was happening to the world economy. He told them "to remember that we have been in a similar situation before 1914". Referring to recent turbulence and insecurity in the international credit market he went on to warn that "free financial markets are the Achilles heel of the globalisation process".
A need to "face the inequalities that globalisation is causing"
Some of the effects of globalisation can be seen in European companies outsourcing production to Asia where labour and costs are significantly lower than in Europe. They then sell their products back into the European market. The high tech boom of the last decade has also accelerated this process as outsourcing of financial services has boomed - the most obvious example being European customer call centres based in India.
As well as concerns about job security there are concerns about the working conditions of the labourers who produce goods for the European market. For British Labour party Member Stephen Hughes the main challenge internationally "is to face the inequalities that globalisation is causing". His Spanish colleague Alejandro Cercas (PSE) struck an upbeat note saying that "we shouldn't be too pessimistic and we need to give sensitive responses to people's needs".
"Invest, invest, invest and focus on human capital"
Many at the hearing stressed the need for Europe to invest in training and gearing itself towards a more flexible workforce that embraced a form of "flexicurity" (flexibility with high levels of social security protection). Italian academic Serafino Negrelli from the University of Milano-Bicocca told the hearing that Europe needed to "invest, invest, invest and focus on human capital".
Also under discussion was the European Globalisation adjustment Fund (EGF) set up in early 2007 to fund measures to keep people in employment. The fund was established to underwrite half of the cost of looking for a job, training and entrepreneurial support. The other half is supposed to come from EU members. It was set up to "provide additional support for workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns". It was specifically designed for cases where there are over 1,000 redundancies in one company.
For Portuguese MEP Jos√© Silva Peneda (EPP-ED) the fund "was a clear response to globalisation, for the first time, three (EU) institutions recognised that globalisation has both positive aspects and negative consequences".
Rolph Van der Hoeven of the International Labour Organisation made a plea for realism and for national actions. He cited the mining and textile industries and told those present that "Europe could not protect bad jobs". He added, "targeted politics will never replace national social programmes. Governments may not push all responsibilities to Brussels".
