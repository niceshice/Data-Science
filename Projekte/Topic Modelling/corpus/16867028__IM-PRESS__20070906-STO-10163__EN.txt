Parliament after 2009 - How many MEPs?
Institutions
2007-09-12 - 13:39
How will the EP look in 2009?
As more countries have joined the EU - so the number of people representing them in the European Parliament has increased. The current figure of 785 members is due to the mid-term "surge" caused by the entry of Bulgaria and Romania in January. The number is set at 736 for the next EP elections in 2009, while under the new still-to-be-finalised reform treaty the figure is set at 750. As work on the new treaty continues, a draft report in Parliament proposes a distribution of seats.
Although the final decision on the number of seat rests with EU leaders, the Parliament has been asked to table its own proposals by October. On 11 September Parliament's two rapporteurs - French EPP-ED member Alain Lamassoure and Romanian Socialist Adrian Severin - presented their draft report to Parliament's Constitutional Affairs Committee.
What is clear is that the both the largest and smallest countries will be affected. Under a deal confirmed by EU leaders in June, no country shall have more than 96 seats and none less than 6. This means that Germany with its current 99 Members and Malta with 5 will both see changes.
Some of the changes that the Lamassoure-Severin report suggest are that the UK, France and Italy would no longer each have the same amount of MEPs but would have 73, 74 and 72 respectively. Each currently has 78 representatives. Countries like Ireland and Lithuania would go from a current 13 MEPs to 12 under the new draft proposals. A full list of their proposals in terms of seats per country is available by clicking on the first link below.
How did they reach their conclusions?
A number of principles have governed the drafters of the report. They include:
The principle of “European solidarity”, larger states accept fewer seats (than their population size would suggest), to allow better representation for countries with less people.
The principle of “justified flexibility" allowing modifications to reduce differences between, for example, similar sized states.
"National representation" - ensuring that there is enough seats to recognise all strands of political opinion in a country.
Alain Lamassoure pleaded for "reason and logic" to prevail over "passion and national interest". He went on to explain that "we calculated how many citizens are represented by one MEP. While for example one German MEP represents 832 000 citizens, a Spanish one represents 875 000 people".
The report makes no mention of countries - such as Croatia - which may join the EU after 2009. This was a deliberate omission to avoid prejudicing any future deliberations on enlargements of the Union.
Plenary debate on 10-11 October
When MEPs meet in Strasbourg on 10-11 October for a plenary session the Lamassoure-Severin report will be debated and put to a vote.
Any proposals the Parliament agrees upon will then be put before European Union leaders at their October summit. If adopted they would be included in the reform treaty.
