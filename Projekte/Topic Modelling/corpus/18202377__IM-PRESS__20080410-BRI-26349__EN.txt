2008-04-17 - 09:46
Selected highlights of the Strasbourg plenary session 21-24 April 2008 include:
Budget discharge for 2006
US waiver program and new Member States
Slovenian President to address the House
War crimes committed by totalitarian regimes
Organ donation and transplantation - what can the EU do?
China's policy and its effects on Africa
Price rises of food products in the EU and in developing countries
Role of volunteering in contributing to economic and social cohesion
Situation in Zimbabwe - human rights
Monday 21 April 2008
MEPs will debate a hearing of the Commission on "crimes on genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed by totalitarian regimes." The hearing, held on 8 April, focused on two main issues: recognition of the crimes and reconciliation. It was organised in response to a request made by the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 19 April 2007 for a hearing on “crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed by totalitarian regimes as well as those who publicly condone, deny, grossly distort or trivialise them”.
The House will debate the rules for Belarusian and Ukrainian citizens to obtain visas to enter the EU/Schengen area .
Marian Harkin (ALDE, IE) will be putting forward her report on the role of volunteering in contributing to economic and social cohesion . Volunteering is good for you, your community, your region's economic development and your national economy. It also helps build the "social capital" that public policies need to succeed. Over 100 million EU citizens volunteer, and every €1 spent on supporting them generates a return of between €3 and €8 - a contribution that should appear in national accounts, says a report by the Regional Development Committee.
Proposed changes in the rules governing the European Ombudsman's access to information held by EU bodies and evidence given to him by EU civil servants, are set out in a report, proposed by the Constitutional Affairs Committee, on the Ombudsman's Statute. The key aim of these changes is to boost citizens' confidence in the Ombudsman's work.
Parliament will debate and vote on a report on organ donation and transplantation . Reducing the organ and donor shortage is “the main challenge that EU Member States face with regard to organ transplantation”, said the Committee for Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. MEPs in the committee propose a wide range of measures, including a European donor card, to tackle problems like organ shortage, transplantation risks and organ trafficking.
Tuesday 22 April 2008
Tuesday starts off with a debate on the 2006 annual report of the European Investment Bank . The committee gives clear backing to the EIB and welcomes its willingness to work with MEPs. The committee's report "congratulates the EIB on its 2006 activity report and encourages it to continue with its activities to promote the development of the European economy and foster growth, job creation, and interregional and social cohesion". It also "welcomes the EIB’s transparency and its total cooperation with Parliament".
The Budgetary Control Committee is recommending that Parliament sign off the accounts of all the EU's institutions and agencies for the financial year 2006 . However, it is also calling for the creation of a joint Parliament-Commission group to monitor the Commission's supervision of the structural funds and certain other matters.
On Tuesday afternoon, MEPs will also debate establishment of European satellite navigation system Galileo . The Industry Committee is recommending approval of a first-reading compromise on Galileo's deployment phase which would pave the way for the European satellite radio navigation system to be operational by 2013.
Parliament will also debate the protests against price rises of food products in the EU and in developing countries following statements from the Council and the Commission. A resolution will be voted on at one of the May plenary sessions.
The House will also examine China's policy and its effects on Africa . The EP Development Committee points the finger at investments made by China with no strings attached in African countries ruled by oppressive regimes. This policy helps perpetuate human rights violations, say MEPs in the committee, who also highlight Beijing's role in the spread of arms and the conditions under which natural resources are being exploited.
On Tuesday evening, MEPs debate the implementation of the posting of workers directive following the judgements of the European Court of Justice .
Wednesday 23 April 2008
The key debates of the Strasbourg plenary are on the EU - Latin America and Caribbean Summit and negotiations between the EU and US on visa waiver rules . The EU-LAC summit (between Latin America, the Caribbean and the European Union), which is due to take place on 16-17 May in Lima, Peru, is the subject of a plenary debate with the Council and Commission. MEPs will also vote on a resolution.
The outcome of talks held on 12-13 March between the EU troika and the United States on the USA's visa waiver program will be the subject of a debate by MEPs with the Council and Commission. The visa waiver program allows citizens of certain countries deemed by the US authorities to present a low security risk to travel to the USA for up to 90 days without having to obtain a visa. These countries include all those that were EU Member States before 2004 (except Greece) plus Slovenia. All the other "new" Member States are excluded from the program. However, some of these states (Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary and Slovakia) have recently signed bilateral agreements with the US enabling them to be admitted to the program. MEPs will vote on a resolution in May.
The Slovenian President Dr Danilo Türk will address the European Parliament on Wednesday 23 April at midday . Slovenia currently holds the six-month rotating presidency of the EU.
The House will vote on a report from the Chair of the Internal Market Committee Arlene McCarthy (PES, UK) on an agreement on a proposed directive to promote the use of mediation as a faster and cheaper alternative to going to court in civil and commercial cross-border disputes. MEPs in the Legal Affairs Committee recommend approving the text at second reading with no amendments to the Council's common position.
At 3pm on Wednesday the House will debate the situation in Burma/Myanmar following statements from Council and Commission. The House will also vote on a resolution on this topic.
Parliament then debates illegal immigration, the EU's external action and the role of Frontex - the body tasked to coordinate the operational cooperation between Member States in the field of border security.
Thursday 24 April 2008
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is proposing an own- initiative report on the Green Paper on market-based instruments for environment and related policy purposes. MEPs in the committee welcome the Green Paper but regret the absence of an in-depth analysis on the merits of differentiation between market-based instruments (MBIs) targeted at the consumer as opposed to the producer level.
The International Accounting Standards Board lacks transparency, legitimacy and accountability . It is not under the control of any democratically elected parliament or government. So says a report from the Economics Committee now due for debate by the full Parliament – and the IASB’s governing body has already made proposals for change.
As usual the session ends with three debates and votes on human rights issues in the world. On this occasion the topics are: Zimbabwe, Iran, the case of Khadijeh Moghaddam (imprisoned women's rights activist in Iran) and Chad.

2008-04-17 - 09:46
The Slovenian President Dr Danilo Türk will address the European Parliament on Wednesday 23 April at midday. Slovenia currently holds the six-month rotating presidency of the EU. Dr Danilo Türk was born on 19 February 1952 in Maribor, Slovenia. Since 1975 he has been actively involved with Amnesty International and has acted as adviser in many cases involving human rights violations in the former Yugoslavia. In 1982, he obtained his doctorate from the Faculty of Law in Ljubljana with a thesis on "The principle of non-intervention in international relations and in international law". From 1984 to 1992 he was member of the United Nations Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities as an independent expert and acted in his personal capacity.
In 1992 Dr Türk assumed the position of Ambassador of the Republic of Slovenia to the United Nations. During his term on the Security Council from 1998 to 1999 he dealt with the issues of Kosovo, Iraq, Libya, East Timor, Congo among others. Following the successful conclusion of Slovenia’s term as non-permanent member of the Security Council, Mr Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the UN, appointed Dr Türk as Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs.
After 13 years in New York Dr Türk returned to Slovenia in the summer of 2005. He resumed teaching International Law and related subjects at the Faculty of Law in Ljubljana. Since May 2006 he has served as Vice-Dean of the Faculty of Law.

MEPs to vote on the Commission's annual policy strategy 2009
2008-04-17 - 09:46
Following the debate that was held on 11 March in Strasbourg, the House will vote on a resolution on the Commission's annual policy strategy for 2009. During the debate, Commission President José Manuel Barroso said: "2009 will be a special year, a transition year of great importance marked, I am confident, by the likely entry into force of the new European Treaty, the Treaty of Lisbon. " "2009 will also be symbolically very important because we will have a chance to celebrate 20 years of the march of freedom since the fall of the Berlin Wall, so it is a very important opportunity to commemorate freedom and the reunification of Europe.
It will also be the year of the election of a new European Parliament and a new Commission, so what we do in the first six months of 2009 will set the mood for the European elections. The smooth implementation of the Lisbon Treaty will ensure a European Union fit to tackle the challenges of the future. I hope and expect that we will see the finishing touches to the most ambitious system in the world to tackle climate change and promote energy security. And it is particularly important that we do it in the first half of 2009 at the latest, so that the European Union can be ready to make a decisive contribution to the global negotiations at the Copenhagen Conference at the end of that year."

Budgetary control
2006 budget discharge: better supervision of the Structural Funds
2008-04-17 - 09:46
The Budgetary Control Committee is recommending that Parliament sign off the accounts of all the EU's institutions and agencies for the financial year 2006. However, it is also calling for the creation of a joint Parliament-Commission group to monitor the Commission's supervision of the structural funds and certain other matters. The joint Parliament-Commission group would follow up on the 2006 discharge by checking on the implementation of the Commission's action plan on the structural funds, as well as national declarations, annual summaries and the EU's external activities. The group would be co-chaired by the relevant Commissioner and the chair of the EP Budgetary Control Committee. The EP rapporteur on the Commission's 2006 discharge, Dan Jørgensen (PES, DK), and his colleagues expect the Commission to respond on this point before the plenary vote on the discharge.
Structural Funds: a practical solution
The proposal to monitor (on a quarterly basis) the Commission’s own action plan on better supervision of the structural funds provides a practical solution to the thorny issue of the management of these funds, the key issue in this year's procedure.
MEPs regard as “a major achievement” the Commission’s undertaking “to correct all individual errors found in the Court’s annual report on 2006” with the commitment to make 100% corrections in all cases of “serious breaches of public procedure”. However, MEPs also want the Commission to present “objective, clear and full information on its capacity to recover unduly paid monies”.
In addition, the committee welcomes the fact that as a result of the 2006 discharge the Commission has “finally committed itself to apply a policy of suspending payments as soon as possible following the detection of serious weaknesses in the system”.
“Firm support” for national management declarations welcomed
Another important issue is national management declarations, which represent a major innovation in the management of Community funds and are already used in a number of Member States (Netherlands, Denmark, United Kingdom and Sweden).
The committee is critical of what it sees as the Commission's hitherto “tacit acceptance of Member States’ collective irresponsibility” (with the exception of the above four countries) concerning the EU's financial management. However, it welcomes the “firm political support” now given by the Commission for such declarations, although it says the Commission should encourage them more strongly
External activity: one final effort
The committee believes the management of the Community’s external aid raises numerous questions. It considers that, following this discharge procedure, the Commission is showing increasing awareness of the importance of the transparency and visibility of external aid (of all kinds, whether managed by the Commission or jointly managed via international partners). At the same time, the committee still awaits the list of entities which did not have to undergo tender procedures for contracts received in 2006.
MEPs accept the Commission’s proposal to discuss the matter of a definition for non-governmental organisations following the results of the Court of Auditors’ ongoing audit of NGOs (announced as part of the court’s work programme for 2008). Lastly, they say EU external aid should be more visible on the ground and more accessible to audit activities in cases of joint management of aid, in particular with the United Nations.
EP discharge - in line with the Bureau’s recommendations
MEPs are also proposing that the European Parliament be granted its discharge for 2006.
Among key points of the 2006 Parliament discharge (rapporteur: Javier Pomes Ruiz , EPP-ED, ES), the question of Members’ own administrative expenditure was the subject of a number of amendments, one of which (a compromise) welcomes the decisions of the Conference of Presidents and the Bureau on this matter. The committee believes that the working party on the Members’ statute, the assistants’ statute and the pension fund (set up following the decisions of those senior EP bodies) should include a member (yet to be designated) of the Budgetary Control Committee.
In this connection, shortly before the vote on the 2006 EP discharge, Vice-President Martine Roure (PES, FR), who chairs the working party on the Members' statute and assistants, urged MEPs to give her their “full support” in finding a solution to this matter.
The committee says that service providers must be paid [when fulfilling a contract for an MEP] by a payment agency based in their own Member State, and that MEPs may not employ members of their family.
Voluntary pension fund
The committee also says it is “surprised” at the recommendation by the Conference of Presidents of 13 March 2008 that MEPs be allowed to acquire new pension entitlements under the voluntary pension fund following the entry into force of the new Members’ statute. The discharge resolutions for 2004 and 2005 had stressed that this fund’s activities should be limited, from the start of the next term, to making payments for entitlements already acquired. For this reason, the committee insists that the Working Group (of the Bureau) on the Members’ Statues should respect the decisions taken by Parliament.
Discharge – a political process
The committee also uses its resolution to stress the political nature of the discharge voted by Parliament. In this context, it aims for both:
closer cooperation between Parliament’s Bureau and the Budgetary Control Committee; and
better linkage between the budget setting procedure and the discharge process.
Finally, the committee welcomes “the firm commitment of [Parliament’s] President to ensure the statute for assistants enters force at the same time as the new Members’ Statute.”
United Kingdom and Ireland
The committee's report urges the Commission to improve checks in the UK "which did not comply with Community legislation when allocating entitlements and paying Single Payment Scheme (SPS) and rural development aid to landlords for land let to and farmed by lessee farmers". It also calls for better checks in some Member States (Austria, Ireland and the UK) "who have failed to correctly apply certain key elements of the SPS and extended consolidation of entitlements beyond the provisions of the regulation".
Budget discharge: background
The purpose of the budget discharge procedure is to enable Parliament to make a political appraisal of how the EU budget has been spent and to recommend improvements.
The procedure begins each year at the EP when the Court of Auditors presents its Annual Report. Parliament then embarks on its own assessment of the way the budget was used. MEPs seek to ensure that any problems flagged up by the Court of Auditors or in investigations by the Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) are given political prominence and remedied by improvements in the system.
Parliament's Rules of Procedure say the Budgetary Control Committee may invite Parliament to grant, postpone or refuse discharge in respect of implementation of the budget. This enables MEPs to express their approval or disapproval of the way EU funds have been spent. The Commission must act upon any comments or recommendations in Parliament's resolution.
By granting a discharge through a resolution voted in April, Parliament approves the implementation of the budget in respect of the relevant financial year.
If Parliament concludes that there are serious issues to be addressed, it will postpone the granting of discharge. The Commission then has to take swift action to remedy the problems.
A refusal to grant discharge has no legal consequences but may be regarded as a serious political sanction . This has happened twice in the past twenty years, first in 1984 and then in December 1998, in the latter case leading to the resignation of the Santer Commission on 15 March 1999.
The discharge decision regarding the general budget managed by the Commission concerns by far the largest share of the EU budget, which goes to finance EU policies in the Member States. However, some 80-85% of EU funds are managed and monitored primarily by national and local administrations, under a system of "shared management" with the Commission. Only a small part of the budget is managed directly by the Commission itself.

Budgetary control
European Investment Bank annual report for 2006
2008-04-17 - 09:46
Parliament will vote on an own-initiative report by the Budgetary Control Committee on the European Investment Bank's activity report for 2006. The committee gives clear backing to the EIB and welcomes its willingness to work with MEPs. The committee's report, drafted by Jean-Pierre AUDY (EPP-ED, FR), "congratulates the EIB on its 2006 activity report and encourages it to continue with its activities to promote the development of the European economy and foster growth, job creation, and interregional and social cohesion". It also "welcomes the EIB’s transparency and its total cooperation with Parliament".
Among other things, the EIB funds major infrastructure projects such as the Trans-European Networks. In this area, MEPs ask the EIB "to give priority to infrastructure or transport projects with a lower or negative carbon footprint". They also believe that a "strategic reflection" would be useful and they suggest that "given the quality of the EIB’s human resources, its detachment and its experience of financing major infrastructure", the Bank would be well placed to conduct such an exercise itself.
In addition, the report calls on the EIB "to ensure that enough venture capital is made available to SMEs which experience difficulty in attracting venture capital".
Fiftieth anniversary of the Bank
The EIB was created by the Treaty of Rome and is celebrating its fiftieth anniversary in 2008. Its members are the Member States of the EU, whose finance ministers make up its Board of Governors. Its role is to contribute, using the capital markets and its own funds, to the development of the common market. It is a Community instrument but one within which power is exercised inter-governmentally.
Since 1999 the European Parliament has regularly given an opinion on the EIB’s activity report. Until now the EP opinion was drafted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs but from this year that role has been taken on by the Committee on Budgetary Control.

2009 EU budget: Parliament's priorities
2008-04-17 - 09:46
Among issues already influencing the debate on next year's EU budget are the European Parliament's new legislative and budgetary powers if the Lisbon Treaty is ratified and the membership of the next Commission and EP. A report by Jutta HAUG (PES, DE) on the budget framework and priorities for 2009 is the first programming text proposed by MEPs as part of preparations for the EU's next annual budget. It takes account of the changes set to take place in 2009 that will have a major impact on the budget. Some are linked to the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty: the shift in the EP-Council balance of budgetary power in Parliament's favour and the scrapping of the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory spending. Others will follow from the 2009 European elections and the end of the present Commission's mandate. The MEPs elected in 2009 must be ready to use the new budget procedure in time for the 2010 budget.
Reduced budget margins
In contrast to previous years, the report does not refer directly to the Commission's Annual Policy Strategy (APS). MEPs in the committee nevertheless take note of the priorities proposed by the Commission for 2009, namely climate change and sustainable development. But they are surprised that at this early stage the Commission "has already embarked on a reprioritisation exercise", including in those headings of the multiannual financial framework which have "a particularly small margin". MEPs in the committee call on the Commission to present a "clear and transparent" preliminary draft budget that can be understood by the public, is realistic and enables Parliament and Council to "thoroughly scrutinise" the implementation of the different EU programmes and policies.
MEPs in the committee say they are concerned that it is now more difficult to distinguish operational from administrative expenditure by the Commission, as well as by the Commission’s practice of outsourcing spending on staff, which they say reduces the transparency of the administrative expenditure in the budget.
In their negotiations with the Council, Parliament expects to make use of all the powers conferred on it under the interinstitutional agreement, including the flexibility instrument if necessary. The report stresses the importance of the solidarity principle, arguing that it must remain one of the EU's guiding principles, particularly for regional and development policy.
Later in the year, the Budgets Committee will make an initial assessment of the 2009 preliminary draft budget, which will be presented at the July plenary session.

External relations
EU-Latin America and Caribbean summit
2008-04-17 - 09:46
The EU-LAC summit (between Latin America, the Caribbean and the European Union), which is due to take place on 16-17 May in Lima, Peru, is the subject of a plenary debate with the Council and Commission. MEPs will also vote on a resolution. The summit, held every two years alternately in Europe and Latin America, seeks to strengthen strategic partnership between the two regions. This year's event, co-chaired by Peru and Slovenia (the holder of the EU presidency), will be attended by 60 heads of state or government.
The two main topics on the agenda are, firstly poverty and inequality, secondly sustainable development, including climate change, environment and energy. Among key ideas being promoted by the Slovenian presidency are improved primary and vocational education and the development of small and medium-sized firms, which can play a key role in job-creation in Latin America.
Previous summits
The first EU-LAC summit was held in Rio de Janeiro in 1999. It sought to strengthen political, economic and cultural understanding between the two regions in order to encourage the development of a strategic partnership. Subsequent summits were held in Madrid in 2002 and Guadalajara in 2004. The last summit, in Vienna in 2006, re-stated the commitment of both regions to strengthen the bi-regional strategic association. It also took the decision to launch negotiations for an association agreement between the EU and Central America and paved the way for the launch of negotiations for an association agreement between the EU and the Andean Community.

How to fight organ shortages and "transplant tourism"
2008-04-17 - 09:46
Reducing the organ and donor shortage is “the main challenge that EU Member States face with regard to organ transplantation”, said the Committee for Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. MEPs in the committee propose a wide range of measures, including a European donor card, to tackle problems like organ shortage, transplantation risks and organ trafficking. Although the use of human organs for transplantation has steadily increased in recent years across the EU, the number of people requiring a transplant is still greater than the number of organs available for transplant. The own-initiative report drafted by Adamos Adamou (GUE/NGL, CY) recalls that currently many thousands of patients in Europe, with a significant mortality rate, are registered on waiting lists.
Organ donation has to remain “strictly non-commercial”
The committee stresses that organ donation must stay “strictly non-commercial” and should be made altruistically and voluntarily, ruling out payments between donors and recipients. Compensation should be possible only to make good expenses and inconveniences related to the donation. “Any commercial exploitation of organs is unethical and inconsistent with the most basic human values”, and organ donation out of financial motivation “degrades the gift of an organ to a mere commodity which constitutes a violation of human dignity”, say MEPs in the committee.
Prevent organ trafficking and "transplant tourism"
The report stresses that “organ trafficking undermines the credibility of the system for potential voluntary and unpaid donors”. The Commission and Member States are asked to take measures to prevent "transplant tourism", including drawing up guidelines to protect the poorest and most vulnerable donors from being victims of organ trafficking and adopting measures that increase the availability of legally procured organs. Moreover, Member States should take the necessary measures to prevent insurance companies reimbursing costs incurred in obtaining illegal organ transplantation.
A European donor card
The committee proposes to introduce a European donor card, complementary to existing national systems. MEPs in the committee also note that those who are not suitable donors should be encouraged to carry a card to that effect as well in order to facilitate a swift identification of organs. Additionally, Member States should make it possible to appoint a legal representative who can decide on donation after one's death, states the report.
Organ sharing and new biotechnology to tackle organ shortage
Establishing well-structured operational systems and promoting successful models in and between Member States and at international level is of “utmost importance” to fight organ shortage more effectively, say MEPs in the committee. They call on the Commission to promote research in biotechnology which, in the future, “may offer the possibility for researchers to grow organs from existing tissues and cells, either from the patients themselves or from other tissue donors”.
MEPs in the committee support reinforced cooperation between Member States leading to increased organ sharing between EU Member States. In particular small Member States with a limited donor pool could clearly benefit from European co-operation, says the report. The Commission should, therefore, facilitate alliances between national transplantation organisations in Member States.
Transplant hotline for better information
Committee members stress that “a very effective way of increasing organ availability is to provide more information to the public”. They propose establishing a transplant "hotline" with a single telephone number managed by a national transplantation organisation and manned 24 hours/day, which can rapidly provide relevant and accurate information.
Reduce transplant risks
Finally, MEPs in the committee recognise that it is “vitally important to improve the quality and safety of organ donation and transplantation” to reduce transplant risks. Hence, the committee looks forward to the Commission’s proposal for a directive setting requirements to assure the quality and safety for organ donation across the EU. However, the forthcoming legislative framework should not create an additional administrative burden nor should it jeopardise the use of existing good practices or lead to a decrease in the number of potential and actual donors, stress MEPs in the committee.

Green light for establishment of European satellite navigation system Galileo?
2008-04-17 - 09:46
The Industry Committee is recommending approval of a first-reading compromise on Galileo's deployment phase which would pave the way for the European satellite radio navigation system to be operational by 2013. A new regulation lays down security requirements for Galileo and the European Geostationary Satellite Navigation Service (EGNOS), to be managed by the Commission and the European Global Navigation Satellite System Supervisory Authority. Galileo infrastructure contracts will be put out to competitive tender.
The deployment phase, in which all space and ground-based infrastructure is to be established, will run from 2008 to 2013. The exploitation phase will follow. The compromise text, negotiated with Council and Commission in informal meetings, took on board most of the amendments proposed by the committee on 29 January.
Controlled access to security technologies
The amended regulation asks the European Commission to lay down the main technical requirements for controlling access to the technologies that provide security to Galileo and EGNOS. Member States should adopt national security regulations that guarantee at least the same level of protection for EU classified information on the two programmes as is required for the industrial security of EURATOM, says the new text. If the operation of the systems should pose a risk to the security of the EU or the Member States, joint action should be taken under the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
European GNSS Supervisory Authority will monitor security procedures
Following MEPs’ criticism that the role of the European GNSS Supervisory Authority (GSA) was not clearly set out in the Commission proposal for the deployment phase, the agency’s tasks were revised.
Originally designed to be the licensing authority for private undertakings within the public-private partnership first planned, the GSA will now instead monitor the implementation of security procedures and perform system security audits. The authority’s tasks will also include the preparation of the commercialisation of the systems, including market analysis. The Commission is asked to formally align the structures for the programmes' management with the GSA's new role.
The compromise also took on board the Industry Committee’s call for the Commission to guarantee the protection of personal data and privacy by integrating it into Galileo's technical set-up.
Guarantee fair competition and minimise dependence on one supplier
The regulation will also stipulate public procurement rules. Infrastructure contracts will be split into six main packages (system engineering support, ground mission infrastructure completion, ground control infrastructure completion, satellites, launchers and operations) and additional work packages. The competitive tendering of all packages should take place in a single procedure and any one company or group may bid for no more than two of the six main work packages.
In order to prevent any possible abuse of dominance or long-term dependency on single suppliers, the amended text takes up the Industry Committee’s suggestion to apply dual sourcing – i.e. using two different suppliers for one product. The aim of this procurement procedure is to improve the overall control of programme, cost and schedule. Moreover, at least 40% of the total value of the activities should be subcontracted to companies which do not belong to the prime contractor of any of the main work packages, says another proposed Industry Committee amendment.
High-quality services at fair prices
Galileo's deployment phase, which runs until 2013, will be entirely funded by the EU, which, by investing €3.4 billion, will become “the owner of all tangible and intangible assets created or developed under the programmes”. Member States, third countries or international organisations may provide additional funding.
In 2010, the Commission should table a proposal on the public funds and commitments needed for the exploitation phase over the next financial programming period, starting in 2014, says the compromise text. This proposal would also have to include a revenue-sharing mechanism and objectives for a pricing policy to guarantee that costumers receive high-quality services at fair prices adds the text.
Galileo Inter-institutional Panel
Given the uniqueness of the programmes and the Community’s ownership of the satellite radio navigation systems, Parliament, Council and Commission agreed to set up a new inter-institutional framework, the Galileo Inter-institutional Panel (GIP) which will be composed of three representatives each of the Council and the Parliament, and one representative of the Commission. The GIP will follow closely the implementation of the GNSS programmes, the international agreements with third countries, and the preparation of the satellite navigation markets.

Development and cooperation
China's policy in Africa
2008-04-17 - 09:46
In a report on the effects of China's growing presence in Africa, the EP Development Committee points the finger at investments made by China with no strings attached in African countries ruled by oppressive regimes. This policy helps perpetuate human rights violations, say MEPs in the committee, who also highlight Beijing's role in the spread of arms and the conditions under which natural resources are being exploited. The report, drafted by Ana GOMES (PES, PT), urges the EU to call on China "to suspend any arms trade deals with those governments that are responsible for human rights violations, are involved in conflicts or on the brink of war", such as Zimbabwe, Sudan, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia and Eritrea.
In addition, says the report, China should increase the transparency of its national arms export control regime, namely by ensuring complete reporting on exports to the UN Register on Conventional Arms Exports.
The EU should maintain its arms embargo on China, adds the committee, for as long as China continues to export arms to armed forces and armed groups in countries, many of them in Africa, that fuels and perpetuates conflicts and perpetrate gross violations of human rights.
Investment in Africa
Unlike the EU, which ties its investment to respect for human rights and good governance, China makes most of its investments without laying down any particular conditions. Such investment in countries suffering from bad governance by oppressive regimes helps perpetuate human rights abuses, say MEPs in the committee.
The EU should encourage Chinese export-credit agencies, including the Exim Bank, to conduct systematic environmental assessments of infrastructure projects in Africa, such as dams, roads and mines, believes the committee.
The report also calls on the EU to actively promote transparency regarding revenue generated by natural resources. MEPs in the committee argue that a clause requiring the investment of "a percentage of profit in local community development" should be included in international conventions on energy resources extraction or exploration.
Peacekeeping and non-interference
MEPs in the committee call on the EU to encourage China to continue increasing its participation in UN or African Union (AU) peacekeeping missions in Africa "by also supplying combat troops, when necessary". The EU is also urged to encourage China to assume its responsibilities as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, including the "responsibility to protect" civilians.
However, the report stresses that the EU should avoid generalisations about China’s role and should regard it with an "open and constructive attitude". MEPs also call for joint projects (EU, China, Africa) to fight climate change and develop renewable energies.
In addition, the EU should devise a strategy to meet the new challenges raised by emerging donors in Africa, such as China, including a coordinated approach between different Member States and EU institutions. It should also enter into a dialogue with China, in order to discuss methods and aims of development policy.
Role of parliaments
Lastly, the Development Committee stresses that the European Parliament is willing to engage with the Chinese National People's Congress, the Pan-African Parliament and African national parliaments in a dialogue aimed at fostering sustainable development and enhancing their scrutinising capabilities.

Parliament's priorities for the 10th European Development Fund
2008-04-17 - 09:46
In an own-initiative report drafted by Marie-Arlette Carlotti (PES, FR) for the Development Committee, MEPs urge that the European Development Fund (EDF) be incorporated into the EU budget "in order to increase the consistency, transparency and effectiveness of development cooperation and guarantee democratic scrutiny". MEPs in the committee would also like to see democratic scrutiny by the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) of national strategy papers - the main instruments for implementing the EDF - as this would be a step towards conferring institutional power over development policy on the JPA and the European Parliament.
Believing that a posteriori examination of the EDF budget discharge by the European Parliament is not an adequate means of democratic scrutiny, the Development Committee proposes that the Council confer on Parliament, pending the EDF's incorporation into the EU budget, an institutional role relating to the entire process of monitoring and assessing the Fund's programming.
Call to focus on health and basic education
As to the EDF's policy priorities, the committee maintains that the undertaking given in the context of the development cooperation instrument (DCI) to devote 20% of funds to health and basic education by 2009 should apply to all European development policy spending, including the EDF.
MEPs in the committee deplore the Council’s decision of 11 April 2006 that the African Peace Facility should be financed by the EDF, since this takes funds away from development in order to use them for foreign policy purposes. They believe the peace facility should be regarded as a Common Foreign and Security Policy instrument and not a development tool.
The report criticises the fact that the gender dimension has not been included in the 10th EDF as a specific area of action.
The committee is also against any attempt to tie to the allocation of integrated regional programme funds to participation in an Economic Partnership Agreement.
The EDF is the EU's main instrument for development cooperation with the ACP countries and the Community's overseas territories. The 10th fund, covering the period 2008-2103, has a budget of €22 682 million.

Genocide and other crimes committed by totalitarian regimes
2008-04-17 - 09:46
MEPs and the Commission will hold a debate on crimes committed by totalitarian regimes, a topic examined at a recent public hearing organized jointly by the Slovenian presidency and the Commission. The hearing, held on 8 April, focused on two main issues: recognition of the crimes and reconciliation. It was organised in response to a request made by the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 19 April 2007 for a hearing on “crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed by totalitarian regimes as well as those who publicly condone, deny, grossly distort or trivialise them”. The Commission is planning to analyse the findings of the hearing and use them as input to a report to the Council. MEPs will be using Monday's debate to find out more.
The JHA Council made its request because on the same day (19.4.2007) it had reached a political agreement on a framework decision on combating certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia. The denial or trivialization of genocide and war crimes were not covered by this legislation. The question thus arose as to whether a separate EU legal instrument was needed to cover such issues and this month's hearing was intended to contribute to that discussion.
At present, Parliament is only consulted on such legislation (it adopted its opinion on the framework decision on 29 November 2007) and unanimity is required in Council, which has yet to give its final approval to the decision.

US visa waivers and passenger name records: one rule for all EU states?
2008-04-17 - 09:46
The outcome of talks held on 12-13 March between the EU troika and the United States on the USA's visa waiver program will be the subject of a debate by MEPs with the Council and Commission. MEPs will vote on a resolution in May. The visa waiver program allows citizens of certain countries deemed by the US authorities to present a low security risk to travel to the USA for up to 90 days without having to obtain a visa. These countries include all those that were EU Member States before 2004 (except Greece) plus Slovenia. All the other "new" Member States are excluded from the program. However, some of these states (Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary and Slovakia) have recently signed bilateral agreements with the US enabling them to be admitted to the program.
The European Commission has argued that, in this area, differential treatment by the USA of individual EU Member States conflicts with EU law, since some points of the accords come under Community legislation, notably transfers of "passenger name records".
On 12-13 March the EU troika proposed a dual approach: matters coming under national law would be dealt with by national authorities while those falling under Community law would be negotiated by the Commission. The Council (Coreper) then agreed on a draft mandate to allow the Commission to negotiate an overall agreement with the US at the US-EU summit of 12 June.

Fighting crime and terrorism while safeguarding privacy
2008-04-17 - 09:46
Parliament is being consulted on a proposal for closer cooperation between EU Member States in the fight against terrorism and cross-border crime. The EP Civil Liberties Committee backs the plans but wants to beef up the rules on personal data protection. The draft Council decision under consideration - put forward by Germany - seeks to incorporate into Community law the Prüm Treaty, adopted on 27 May 2005 outside the EU framework, initially by Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Austria. The treaty strengthens cross-border cooperation on terrorism, crime and illegal immigration and provides for exchanges of DNA data, fingerprints and other information as well as joint police operations. If it is incorporated into EU law there will be guarantees on data protection, which is the weak point of the Prüm treaty.
MEPs wary over data protection
The Civil Liberties Committee (whose report by Barbara Dührkop Dührkop (PES, DE) was adopted by 31 votes to 2 with 4 abstentions) approves the proposal but wants data transfers under the new decision to be governed by the future framework decision on data protection. MEPs believe transfers should be subject to control by the European Data Protection Supervisor. The committee's report also introduces a clear definition of "personal data" and calls for a ban on exchanging DNA and fingerprints of innocent people.

Refugees to have residence rights after five years?
2008-04-17 - 09:46
Parliament is being consulted on a Commission proposal for refugees to acquire long-term resident status after they have been in an EU Member State for five years. The EP Civil Liberties Committee supports the proposal, although some Member States in the Council (where unanimity is required) oppose it. Directive 2003/109/EC grants non-EU nationals who are long-term residents in the EU a uniform status throughout the European Union. However, the Member States excluded "beneficiaries of international protection" from the scope of the directive (this term covers two categories: refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection, the latter being asylum-seekers not covered by the Geneva Convention).
The aim of the Commission's proposal is to extend the scope of the existing directive to include "beneficiaries of international protection". Such people would be entitled to long-term resident status after five years of regular residence. This would include the time taken to process their asylum applications. The amended directive would also protect the refugees against deportation (except if they commit a crime).
The Civil Liberties Committee backs the Commission proposal but also calls for:
- refugees (or protected persons) without access to employment not to be required to show that they have sickness insurance and sufficient "stable resources" to support themselves;
- national integration conditions not to be imposed on such persons, given their vulnerability;
- measures to ensure that a person who has been granted refugee status in one Member State cannot be deported to their country of origin from another Member State.
In the Council, the unanimity required to adopt this legislation has not been reached because some Member States do not want beneficiaries of subsidiary protection to be included in the directive.

Green Paper on the role of civil society in drugs policy in the European Union
2008-04-17 - 09:46
Parliament will vote on a report by Giusto CATANIA (GUE/NGL, IT) on the Green Paper on the role of civil society in drugs policy in the European Union. The report indicates that civil society has an essential role to play in promoting the emergence, definition, implementation, assessment and monitoring of drug policies. With its experience gained at grass-roots level, its innovative capacity and its potential in terms of the exchange of information and sound practices, civil society can bring significant added value to planned measures. However, in order to do so, civil society must be recognised and supported in both its internal and external dimensions.
Civil society – the internal dimension : MEPs in the committee stress the importance of action by civil society in the achievement of the objectives set out in the EU's drugs strategy as regards prevention, the provision of information and the management of problems associated with drugs dependencies. They call upon all parties involved at both EU and Member-State level to better recognise the role of civil society in terms of damage-reduction, rehabilitation and social-reintegration policies. At the same time, MEPs in the committee call on the Commission and Member States to promote civil society initiatives, particularly those aiming to: i) reinforce the prevention of and information on the risks associated with drug use; ii) treat drug addicts in prison; iii) establish special preventive procedures in “at-risk” metropolitan areas; iv) organise, with the cooperation of parents’, students’ and teachers’ organisations, awareness and prevention campaigns on drugs and their harmful effects on health; v) implement damage-reduction policies through direct contact with people in the street and in neighbourhoods; vi) establish reintegration projects for street children and disadvantaged families.
Civil Society – the external dimension : MEPs call for a strengthening of the external dimension of the EU’s drug strategy in order to have a sustainable impact on drug-producing countries. The experience of European NGOs that are active in this area should also be taken into account in order to help the countries in question to switch local cultivation to therapeutic and medical uses. In particular, they call on the Commission and Member States to explore forms of cooperation with civil society organisations involved in the promotion of legal substances derived from coca leaves. Other initiatives have also been proposed such as those set out in the European Parliament and Council Recommendation of 25 October 2007 on the production of opium for medical purposes in Afghanistan or through the possibility of combating illegal poppy plantations by means of spraying, which is not harmful to humans, animals or the environment. Cooperation with the science industry is also highly recommended as well as with international networks of associations active in the area of combating drugs (for example, the Vienna NGOs Committee on Narcotic Drugs or the “Beyond 2008” initiative which aims to promote the role of civil society within the General Assembly of the United Nations (UNGASS) regarding drugs).
Role of the media : given the vital role of the media, and particularly digital media, in raising awareness among citizens, especially young people at risk of becoming drug addicts, MEPs call for these to become privileged partners in the fight against drugs by establishing awareness measures specifically aimed at female drug addicts. In this respect, MEPs call for targeted campaigns on the damaging effects of drugs to the physical and mental health of young girls, pregnant or breastfeeding women and on maternal health and the transmission of drugs between mother and foetus. Information campaigns should also be targeted at young consumers, in other words children and minors.
Role of the church : The report acknowledges that churches and religious communities have been very active in the fight against drugs, and their experiences should therefore be taken into account in the formulation, implementation and assessment of drugs policies.
MEPs in the committee also highlight the importance of the Civil Society Drugs Forum, which represents the first step towards more concrete and constructive involvement of European civil society associations in the dynamics of the EU in terms of the prevention of and fight against drug use. While regretting the selection process for participants in the Forum, MEPs recall that its aim is to establish direct contact with associations that are on the front line in the fight against drugs.
More financial means : MEPs in the committee request that, subject to budgetary control, the EU becomes involved at a financial level in supporting civil society activities. They call on Member States to cover as far as possible, through public financing, the services proposed by professional civil organisations and request that financial measures be set out in order to assist voluntary organisations and parents’ associations that take action in the fight against drugs. While they welcome the launch of the 2007-2013 “Specific Programme on Drugs Prevention and Information”, they regret the delay in the implementation of the funding made available in connection with that Programme.

Go-ahead for EU law to encourage mediation for cross-border legal disputes?
2008-04-17 - 09:46
Parliament and Council have reached agreement on a proposed directive to promote the use of mediation as a faster and cheaper alternative to going to court in civil and commercial cross-border disputes. MEPs in the Legal Affairs Committee recommend approving the text at second reading with no amendments to the Council's common position. Mediation can provide a cost-efficient and quick extra-judicial resolution of disputes. The Commission's proposal for a directive to promote its use everywhere in the EU has reached its final stage. If the plenary confirms the approval of the report by Arlene McCarthy (PES, UK), the new provisions on mediation in cross-border cases will be need to be implemented within three years.
Right to choose mediation to solve dispute
MEPs in the committee and the Council agreed that recourse to mediation must always be voluntary, even if, in some cases it is advised by a court. In any event an EU citizen who chose a mediation procedure to resolve a dispute would not thereby be precluded from recourse to an ordinary court.
To ensure that any agreement reached by the parties to mediation proceedings is enforced, the text specifies that the agreement should be applicable in all Member States.
Confidentiality ens ured
The Council had endorsed MEPs' first-reading position on confidentiality, to ensure that neither mediators nor the parties involved in the proceedings may disclose information regarding the mediation.
The approved text also asks Member States to provide training for national mediators and to encourage the drawing up of voluntary codes of conduct to guarantee a fair trial. At a later stage, EU governments could post the list of trained mediators on the internet.
An opt-out means that the legislation will not apply to Denmark. Rapporteur Arlene MCCARTHY PES UK A6-0150/2008 Judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters: resolution of disputes by use of mediation Procedure : Codecision (2nd reading)

Agriculture
Zero tolerance regime for unauthorised GMOs and economic consequences thereof
2008-04-17 - 09:46
Neil Parish (EPP-ED, UK) on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development will be asking the following questions to the Commission on zero tolerance regime for unauthorised GMOs and economic consequences thereof: Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 was adopted to regulate the placing on the market of genetically modified crops. The European Union is currently facing a rising number of incidents related to the adventitious presence of traces of genetically modified crops that are not yet authorised in the EU, but have already received approval from major trading partners of the EU. Although importers and stakeholders are acting with due diligence to avoid such incidents, they are likely to recur due to the introduction of new events in the exporting countries and the application of a zero tolerance regime for the presence of unauthorised GMOs in imports to the EU. This situation is worsening and is likely to result in ever higher feeding stuff prices in the EU.
Given the high import dependency of the EU for protein-rich feeding stuffs (e.g. soybean meal, corn gluten feed), how would the European Commission assess the consequences of the zero tolerance policy on the competitiveness of EU livestock production in the short term and in the long run?
How can the Commission justify the current situation in which even feeding stuffs with only small traces of unauthorised GMOs are banned, whereas meat derived from animals that were fed with these unauthorised GMOs can freely enter the EU, thus causing a major distortion of competition to the detriment of European farmers?
Is the Commission of the opinion that instead of the current zero tolerance regime, a threshold value (as is already the case for the adventitious presence of traces of authorised GMOs for labelling of products as 'GMO free') should be applied for the adventitious presence of traces of unauthorised GMOs that have already obtained a positive assessment from the EFSA or that have undergone a feed and food safety risk assessment in accordance with the CODEX GM plant guideline? Is the Commission planning to come forward with concrete proposals to that end?
Does the Commission expect the current situation, if left unchanged, to result in trade disputes with affected exporting countries, which could have negative implications for the export of certain European products? If so, how does the Commission intend to avoid these trade disputes?

Regional policy
Volunteering empowers you
2008-04-17 - 09:46
Volunteering is good for you, your community, your region's economic development and your national economy. It also helps build the "social capital" that public policies need to succeed. Over 100 million EU citizens volunteer, and every €1 spent on supporting them generates a return of between €3 and €8 - a contribution that should appear in national accounts, says a report by the Regional Development Committee. Promoting volunteering through Community policies, supporting voluntary action using EU funds, and recognising and committing to voluntary activity at EU level helps to establish direct links between citizens, their communities and the Union, explained rapporteur Marian HARKIN (ALDE, IE).
Volunteering nurtures solidarity
Volunteers help to implement projects under EU-funded initiatives such as the LEADER (rural development) programme, INTERREG (linking European regions) and the Northern Ireland PEACE Programme, notes the report, which calls on the Commission to put in place a system across all funds that recognises the contribution of volunteering towards co-financing EU-funded projects, and to devise mechanisms for costing and using it as a means of matching funding for them.
Volunteering is also "a major force nurturing civil society and strengthening solidarity", and supporting community development programmes, says the report, which notes that "re-stimulating" volunteering may be especially necessary in those Member States, such as those emerging from a post-communist transition period, where voluntary activity "has come to be associated with actions of a compulsory nature".
The report stresses that volunteering and voluntary activity should in any event not take the place of paid work.
Corporate volunteering
The report encourages firms to help fund initiatives to promote and enhance volunteering, as part of their corporate social responsibility strategies. It also urges Member States to create incentives for business to fund and support the voluntary sector, so as to help transfer corporate skills and know-how to the public sector and to improve the quality of life locally, by encouraging "self help" solutions to local problems.
Satellite accounts
The report recommends that all Member States produce regular non-profit institution (NPI) "satellite accounts", and include volunteer work in them, to enable policy makers to take account of NPIs in policy formulation. It also suggests that volunteering be made a specific category in EUROSTAT accounts.
Volunteering as an education
The report calls on the Commission, Member States and regional and local authorities to promote volunteering through education at all levels, including degree programmes, so that learning during volunteering is recognized as part of lifelong learning.
Making life easier for voluntary bodies
The report encourages Member States, regional and local authorities and voluntary organisations to develop plans to recognise, value, support, facilitate and encourage volunteering, and to work in partnership to do so.
It also urges Member States, regional and local authorities to help voluntary bodies to access sufficient and sustainable funding, without excessive form-filling, red tape or bureaucracy, while maintaining controls on public expenditure.
The European Commission is asked to put in place a Plan V for Valuing, Validating and ensuring Visibility of Volunteers, to mainstream "volunteer-friendliness" across all areas of policy and legislation, and to investigate the introduction of a legal basis in Community law whereby voluntary organisations would be exempted from paying VAT on purchases.
Promoting volunteering
The report encourages Member States to promote volunteering within all communities, both real and virtual, e.g. family volunteering, or volunteering in marginalised groups or groups that might not traditionally volunteer.
It also asks the Commission to review its visa policy for non-EU participants in recognised EU volunteer programmes with a view to introducing a more liberal visa regime in particular towards volunteers from EU neighbouring countries.
Finally, the report calls on local and regional stakeholders, voluntary organisations and the media to inform citizens about opportunities to volunteer. Rapporteur Marian HARKIN ALDE IE A6-0070/2008 Role of volunteering in contributing to economic and social cohesion Procedure : own-initiative

Market-based instruments for the environment
2008-04-17 - 09:46
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is proposing an own- initiative report by Anne FERREIRA (PES, FR), on the Green Paper on market-based instruments for environment and related policy purposes. MEPs in the committee welcome the Green Paper but regret the absence of an in-depth analysis on the merits of differentiation between market-based instruments (MBIs) targeted at the consumer as opposed to the producer level. They also criticise the fact that the Green Paper concentrates mainly on atmospheric pollution and global warming, and by and large disregards the other negative impacts of production and distribution processes and consumption patterns on the environment.
The Commission is urged to develop a clear strategy on the use of MBIs to price environmental damage and correct related market failures. This strategy should cover taxation, the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) review, trade, and technology policy.
The report recognises that MBIs constitute important tools for implementing the ‘polluter pays’ principle, and that they are one of the most effective ways of achieving environmental objectives at reasonable cost. MEPs stress, however, that these instruments cannot be a substitute for environmental legislation, which lays down targets to be achieved and standards to be complied with, and that their effectiveness depends on how they are coordinated with and complement other instruments. MEPs also take the view that social consequences resulting from the implementation of MBIs should be compensated for by specific policy measures such as floor prices, rate reductions, subsidies etc. for low-income households.
Members emphasise the important role of environmental taxation in achieving environmental objectives. They call upon the Commission to put forward a legislative proposal for a Community minimum tax on CO2 before the end of 2008. MEPs in the committee particularly support proposals to allow Member States to reduce VAT rates or offer tax credits for energy efficient products and energy saving materials.
The report points out that, despite the unanimity requirement in the area of taxation, the treaties offer the possibility of enhanced cooperation, and draws attention to the existence of the open coordination method. Member States are, therefore, called upon to make progress on the issue of environmental taxation at European level in order to prevent all forms of fiscal dumping.
Members stress the urgent need for a revision of the EU ETS, which currently has too narrow a field of application given the numerous greenhouse gas (GHG) sources and sectors involved. The Commission is called to strengthen the EU ETS by establishing a progressively tightening cap and extend it to all first-tier emitters as the main means of achieving the 2020 GHG reduction targets.
The Committee on the Environment believes that an increased use of MBIs in the transport sector is particularly important in order to fully internalise the environmental and social costs of all transport modes. The Commission is called upon to present, by 2009, a legislative proposal for GHG reduction in the area of maritime transport, which is not currently subject to any Community or international legislation in this area.
The report also welcomes the Commission's proposal to include aviation activities in the EU ETS, but considers that parallel and complementary measures, such as a kerosene tax and NOx emission charges, are necessary in order to address the climate change impacts from this sector. In addition, MEPs in the committee call for the revision of the Energy Taxation Directive to be carried out rapidly, and in conjunction with that on heavy goods vehicles, in order to bring about a rapid reorientation towards environment conscious behaviour in the various sectors of the economy.
Stressing the importance of supporting the development of passive, positive energy housing, the Parliamentary Committee calls on the Member States to strengthen their incentive policies for the construction sector, to facilitate a reduction in energy demand and CO2 emissions.
Members in the committee also call on the Commission to rapidly propose a roadmap for the gradual, but rapid, abolition of EHS in accordance with the European Council’s decision on the review of the sustainable development strategy. On this matter, they expect the Commission, when it revises the Community guidelines on state aid for environmental protection, to take proper account of the need to influence production, traffic, transport and consumption patterns, and to reduce waste.
Lastly, the report calls on the European Union to distinguish gross economic wealth per inhabitant from net economic, social and environmental wealth as the true progress indicator (TPI). The European Commission and the Member States are called upon to study in more depth the possibility of measuring European growth using ‘green’ indicators, which factor in the wealth lost as a result of environmental damage.

New Flame shipwreck and its consequences in Algeciras Bay
2008-04-17 - 09:46
MEPs will quiz the Commission about oil and other pollution off the coast of southern Spain in a debate on Monday afternoon. The debate is based on Oral Question O-0024/08, tabled on behalf of the EPP-ED Group by Spanish Members Gerardo Galeote and Luis de Grandes Pascual, which reads as follows: "New Flame shipwreck and its consequences in Algeciras Bay
Since 12 August 2007, the Panamanian bulk carrier New Flame has been resting on the sea floor alongside the coast of Algeciras (Cádiz) and Gibraltar. In recent months, these coasts have been polluted by oil over more than one kilometre and in total, seven oil spills occurred between 28 August 2007 and 10 February 2008. On top of that, ongoing bunkering practices constantly take place in Algeciras Bay. These are extremely polluting and despite being prohibited, are carried out with the most absolute impunity.
Both bunkering practices as well as contamination caused by the oil spills of the New Flame are in breach of European environmental law in general and, Directive 2005/35/CE of 7 September 2005 on ship-source pollution and on the introduction of penalties for infringements in particular.
In order to solve this situation, what concrete actions will the European Commission adopt? Is this situation currently being analysed within the European Commission?
As ‘guardian of the Treaties’, is the European Commission planning to launch the infringement procedure against one or several Member States whose active or passive behaviour might be in breach of the relevant European legislation?
Has the European Commission been informed by the competent national authorities of the situation of the New Flame?" Gerardo GALEOTE EPP-ED ES Luis DE GRANDES PASCUAL EPP-ED ES B6-0018/2008 New Flame shipwreck and its consequences in Algeciras Bay Oral question to the Commission

Towards a reform of the World Trade Organisation
2008-04-17 - 09:46
Cristiana MUSCARDINI (UEN, IT) for the International Trade Committee will be putting forward an own-initiative report entitled "Towards a reform of the World Trade Organisation". The report calls for a redefinition of the role and format of Ministerial Conferences; observes already the tendency of WTO members to prefer more informal methods of coordination and decision-making at this level and notes that no Ministerial Conference was convened in 2007. The report calls for the introduction of a more democratic system of decision-making at the WTO that takes into account the views of the entire membership, which comprises countries at varying levels of development.
Parliamentary dimension
The committee stresses the importance of the parliamentary dimension of the WTO in order to enhance the democratic legitimacy and transparency of WTO negotiations. The report stresses the importance of the work done by the Parliamentary Conference on the WTO, which is organised jointly by the European Parliament and the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), whose activities could be stepped up.
Balanced secretariat
The report stresses that the role of the WTO secretariat is critical, and believes that it is important that the secretariat has a proportionate representation of officials from developed and developing countries in order for it to discharge its mandate more effectively.
Pre-accession
The committee calls on the WTO members to consider the idea of a special pre-accession status for candidate countries which, while not having yet concluded their bilateral market access negotiations with their key partners in the organisation, pledge to take on without delay all the obligations resulting from the application of the existing rules.
The report stresses that the decision on whether or not to admit a new member country to the WTO should always be adopted on the basis of strictly commercial considerations. Rapporteur Cristiana MUSCARDINI UEN IT A6-0104/2008 Towards a reformed World Trade Organisation Procedure : own-initiative

Free trade agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council
2008-04-17 - 09:46
Helmuth MARKOV (GUE/NGL, DE), on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, will be asking the Commission the following questions on the Free Trade Agreement between the EC and the Gulf Cooperation Council: The conclusion of a Free Trade Agreement between the EC and the GCC is under negotiation since 1988. The negotiations have been intensified only in 2002 after the GCC started setting up its Customs Union that came into force in 2003. The 17th GCC-EU Joint Council and Ministerial meeting that took place in Riyadh on 8 May 2007 concluded that the parties were getting closer to an agreement. Given that Parliament needs to give its consent to the FTA after the entry into force of the Reform Treaty, could the Commission:
1) Set out the latest developments in the negotiations towards an EC/GCC FTA, the expected timetable and the region to region process?
2) Provide the European Parliament with information why the mandate has not been updated?
3) Explain what steps it is taking to improve the reciprocal market access for GCC and EU exporters, dealing with tariff and NTBs, especially with regard to the services, standardisation, chemicals, energy, transport, and food products sectors?
4) Explain if and what progress on investment has been achieved?
5) Explain how it addresses the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with the GCC and the respect of human rights, workers and migrant workers' rights, environmental and social standards within the FTA negotiations?
6) Clarify whether it envisages to update the Sustainable Impact Assessment (SIA) and to take into account the results for the negotiations?
7) Ensure, in accordance with Article 19 of the Framework Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission, that “early and clear information” is provided to Parliament during the conduct of the negotiations and provide the negotiating mandate to the European Parliament?

Strong criticism of the International Accounting Standards Board’s governance
2008-04-17 - 09:46
The International Accounting Standards Board lacks transparency, legitimacy and accountability. It is not under the control of any democratically elected parliament or government. So says a report from the Economics Committee now due for debate by the full Parliament – and the IASB’s governing body has already made proposals for change. The report, drawn up by Alexander RADWAN (EPP-ED, DE) welcomes the moves made by the IASB – the body which draws up the International Financial Reporting Standards which EU law requires stock exchange-listed companies to use for their accounts – and the International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation – the IASB’S oversight body – have made to redress these deficiencies, but it argues that there is more to be done. A debate should be launched, it says, on integrating the IASB into the system of international governance with the IMF, OECD and World Bank.
More European representation and more public oversight
MEPs in the committee believe that since the EU is the largest jurisdiction which has adopted the IFRS, there should be more representatives of a European background in the standard setting bodies, and that all trustees of the IASB should come from nations that have signed up to the IFRS, or intend to do so.
The committee wants to see a public oversight body set up involving all IASCF/IASB public stakeholders, including legislators and supervisors, and a second body representing market participants, which would deliver an annual report on the functioning of the IASCF/IASB. Such a body could also be responsible for selecting and appointing trustees in a transparent manner.
More use of impact assessments and involvement of stakeholders
The report urges IASB to carry out impact studies among all interested parties before adopting new accounting standards.
As for the funding of the IASB, MEPs in the committee want to ensure that all user groups are adequately involved, that there is no conflict of interest between financiers and users and that access to the standards themselves is made easier. They call on the Commission to examine how it might be able to contribute to funding the IASCF/IASB. It also suggests a funding method involving all publicly traded companies in the EU.
MEPs are keen to ensure the IFRS themselves are interpreted in a consistent manner. They ask the Commission to develop an EU structure as an international partner for third country bodies on this issue and to guarantee uniform interpretation and application.
IFRS for SMEs – too complicated for most
The report says that the IASB’s proposed version of the IFRS for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) is far to complicated for most of them. While it might be a transitional option for larger SMEs hoping to expand, it should not be used for enforced harmonisation of SME accounting standards. The committee says the Commission should arrange a proper consultation procedure for an EU accounting framework for SMEs.
Among other points, the report emphasises that convergence with third-country standards (such as US GAAP) must be based on a prior assessment of the impact and merits of changes for EU companies and users of financial statements. It also calls for the “fair value” principle to be limited in scope, noting that it can be costly and lead to unrealistic valuations in some circumstances.
Message received?
Since the adoption of the report in committee, Gerrit Zalm, Chair of the International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation, has appeared before the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee. He announced a number of changes to the governance mechanisms of the IASCF and IASB, notably the proposed creation of a Monitoring Group (made up, he suggested of the responsible European Commissioner, the heads of the IMF, World Bank, Japan Financial Services Agency, US Securities and Exchange Commission and the chairs of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions’ Emerging Markets Committee and the IOSCO Technical Committee). This body would approve the appointment of Trustees to the IASCF, ending the self-appointment system, and more generally monitor the work of the IASCF and IASB . Mr Zalm also proposed a new size and structure for the IASB itself, with a system to ensure geographical balance between its members. He hoped these arrangements could be in place by January 2009.

Clearer rules on European Ombudsman's access to information
2008-04-17 - 09:46
Proposed changes in the rules governing the European Ombudsman's access to information held by EU bodies and evidence given to him by EU civil servants, are set out in a report, proposed by the Constitutional Affairs Committee, on the Ombudsman's Statute. The key aim of these changes is to boost citizens' confidence in the Ombudsman's work. Changes in the Ombudsman's statute were requested by the Ombudsman himself, Mr Diamandouros, in a letter sent to EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering in July 2006.
Clearer rules on access to confidential documents
Committee members propose an amendment to a provision that obliges all EU institutions and bodies to provide the Ombudsman with the information he requests. This amendment deletes the current caveat that information may be refused on grounds of secrecy, which Members felt that citizens could interpret as restricting the Ombudsman's right to acquire information.
The new text spells out the rules on the handling of classified information obtained by the Ombudsman and his staff in the course of their inquiries. The report says that they would be required not to divulge any sensitive information or any document falling under the scope of the Community legislation regarding the protection of personal data.
Officials bound to testify
Committee members also agreed to change the rule on the testimony of EU officials. The approved text deletes a requirement that Community civil servants must testify "in accordance with the instructions from their administrations". Again, the committee felt that this wording might mislead citizens into thinking that officials are not always required to tell the truth.
The report setting out amendments to the statute of the European Ombudsman and his staff is drafted by Anneli JÄÄTTEENMÄKI (ALDE, FI).
After the plenary vote in Parliament, the agreement of the Council is also needed for the changes to enter into force. Rapporteur Anneli JÄÄTTEENMÄKI ALDE FI A6-0076/2008 Statute of the European Ombudsman Procedure : Own-initiative European Ombudsman homepage
