Parliament is asking the Commission to submit a legislative proposal for a directive aimed at facilitating cross-border transfers of registered offices within the European Union. The proposed directive will lay down measures for coordinating Member States’ national legislation in order to give companies freedom of establishment within the internal market. The resolution was adopted with 608 votes in favour, 51 against and 13 abstentions.
Under current circumstances, undertakings can only transfer their seat either by dissolution and establishing a new legal entity in the Member State of destination, or by establishing a new legal entity in the Member State of destination and then merging both undertakings, the report drafted by Klaus-Heiner LEHNE (EPP-ED, DE) says.
Transfer to be tax neutral
This procedure involves administrative obstacles, costs and social consequences and offers no legal certainty, the report notes; therefore the transfer of a company seat should be tax-neutral. In this regard, exchange of information and mutual assistance between tax authorities needs to be improved.
No "overkill" or excessive information in the proposed directive
MEPs also call for transparency in the application of the new directive in the Member States and propose a reporting requirement for Member States vis-à-vis the Commission whereby undertakings transferring their registered office under the directive must be entered in a European companies register. They point out that, in the interests of better law-making, excessive information (“overkill”) must be avoided when the reporting requirement is transposed into national law, provided that sufficient information is guaranteed.
Moreover, MEPs are of the view that a transfer of a company's seat must be preceded by the issuing of a transfer plan and a report explaining and justifying the legal and economic aspects and any consequences of the transfer for shareholders and employees.
