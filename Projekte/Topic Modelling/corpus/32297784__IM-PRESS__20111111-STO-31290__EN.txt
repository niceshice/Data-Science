Students join EP's Buzek in the hemicycle in Strasbourg About 250 students stepped into the shoes and sat in the seats of MEPs last weekend as they participated in the EuroMedScola programme in the European Parliament in Strasbourg. A group of students, aged 16-18, from EU and Mediterranean countries dealt with issues normally dealt with by the MEPs and, according to EP President Jerzy Buzek, "we can be proud of their responsibility for the future".
From 12-14 November, the EP played host to 250 students and their teachers from 27 EU member states and 13 Mediterranean countries*. Over two days, the students worked in five committee-like groups covering education and employment, migration, equal opportunities, environment and getting involved and held plenary session in the EP's hemicycle in the presence of Buzek, who welcomed their involvement: "We can be proud of their responsibility for the future of the Euro-Mediterranean region, which showed these young people to be future political leaders."
EuroMedScola aims to promote the involvement of young people in politics by simulating the work of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union for the Mediterranean. Participants were selected on the basis of their engagement in social activities on human rights, fundamental freedoms, tolerance and peaceful conflict resolution. This was the second EuroMedScola event. The first took place in 2008.
