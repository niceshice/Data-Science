Counter-terrorism policy must match the terrorist threat and be based on evidence, not assumptions, says a resolution approved by the Civil Liberties Committee on Tuesday. MEPs call for a proper evaluation of measures taken to combat terrorism in Europe since 9/11 and urge the Commission to present a study on the cost of counter-terrorism policy.
The resolution was approved in committee with 29 votes in favour and 24 against. The EPP, ECR and EFD groups voted against.
Ten years after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center triggered a "War on Terrorism", counter-terrorism policy needs to be properly evaluated, not least to ascertain whether the measures taken are based on evidence, or merely on assumptions, says the committee.
“Counter-terrorism policy must meet standards of necessity, effectiveness, proportionality, civil liberties, the rule of law and democratic scrutiny and accountability. An in-depth and complete evaluation of the current EU counter-terrorism measures is long overdue and will lead to more efficient policies. A study of the costs borne by the private sector is also needed”, said rapporteur Sophie in't Veld (ALDE, NL) after the vote.
MEPs stress that counter-terrorism measures must be commensurate with the threat level, and adjusted in response to it. The committee calls on the Commission to draw up a map of all existing counter-terrorism policies in Europe, at both EU and national levels, to serve as a basis for the evaluation.
Cost of counter-terrorism measures
The Commission is urged to present a detailed report on all EU funds used for counter-terrorism purposes, such as spending for EU staff and agencies carrying out counter-terrorism tasks or IT systems and databases. The Commission should also present an analysis of the development of the EU budget in this field since 2001, says the committee.
The committee also calls on the Commission to present a study on the costs of counter-terrorism policies borne by the private sector, and an overview of which business sectors benefit from counter-terrorism policies.
CIA renditions programme and Guantánamo
The EU and its Member States must fully clarify their role in the CIA programme of renditions, in the light of new evidence brought to light thereafter, says the resolution. MEPs also say that the EU must help the US to find appropriate was to close the Guantánamo detention facility and ensure that its prisoners get a fair trial.
Victims' rights and data protection
The committee calls for special attention to the victims of terrorism and says a uniform set of standards must be defined for protecting and supporting victims, including witnesses.
MEPs also underline the need to improve the use of data for counter-terrorism purposes. To this end, the Commission should table a proposal for data protection legislation, which should also apply in the common foreign and security policy field, they add.
Radicalisation and recruitment
Investment is needed in anti-racism and anti-discrimination policies, to prevent the radicalisation and recruitment of potential terrorists, which represents "the most significant and continuous long-term threat", says the resolution.
