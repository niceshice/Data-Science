Arcades and pasta - Bologna
Dante, Erasmus and Copernicus are just three of the names that have passed through Bologna's University since it was founded in 1088. They and other students probably enjoyed ragu, tortellini and lasagne along the way. Dishes like these have led many to call it the food capital of Italy - a title no doubt hotly contested by other Italians! The town also lends its name to the EU's efforts to ensure that higher education qualifications are recognized from one state to the next.
By allowing qualifications to be more readily recognised outside the county where they were gained, the hope is that it will increase the likelihood of people working and studying abroad.
Launched by EU leaders in 1999 the "Bologna process" for higher education has three main goals: to introduce a three level system of degrees (bachelor/master/doctorate), ensure a high level of quality assurance and recognising qualifications and periods of study. It aims to create a European Higher Education Area by 2010. When they say "European" it means not just EU members but 46 countries across Europe.
Parliamentary Hearing identifies student and staff mobility as essential
On 4 October the European Parliament's Culture Committee organised a public hearing on the Bologna process and what has been achieved and what needs to be done. It brought together MEPS, Academics from across Europe's Universities and education ministers from EU members. One of the key issues discussed was ways in which students and staff could be encouraged to move around Europe more easily.
In late October in Strasbourg MEPs voted to back the "European Qualifications Framework" for lifelong learning, built on the achievements of the Bologna process. The report was drafted by Italian MEP Mario Mantovani (EPP-ED) and aims to improve "transparency, comparability and transferability of national qualifications".
Bologna - the "learned" city
The city of Bologna - capital of Emilia-Romagna region is known as one of the most beautiful Italian cities. Its famous arcades are the longest in the world and it has the second biggest medieval historic city centre in Europe, after Venice.
Its global fame however rest on the famous Bolognese sauce which is eaten the world over. Tortellini and lasagne are just three other dishes synonymous with the town. This culinary heritage may explain why one of its nicknames is "la grassa" (the fat one) although Bologna residents probably prefer its other nickname of "la dotta" - (the learned one).
