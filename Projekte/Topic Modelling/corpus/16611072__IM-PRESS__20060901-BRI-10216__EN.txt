Opening of the Strasbourg session - President Borrell on Lebanon and influx of immigrants
2006-09-11 - 12:36
Opening this, the first plenary session after the summer recess, President Josep BORRELL set the stage for the week's work in Parliament by referring to a number of events which occurred over the summer.
Regarding the war in Lebanon, Parliament issued a call on 20 July - for an immediate ceasefire and had urged the EU Member States to speak with a single voice. The Euromediterranean Parliamentary Assembly had then called for European participation in a peace-keeping force. On 25 August, EU governments responded to these calls. Now, said Mr Borrell, "the EU is embarking on its largest-ever military mission". It faced a "challenge to its political credibility" but this was also "an opportunity to support effective European diplomacy throughout the region and to revive the peace process".
Turning to the influx of illegal immigrants in the islands of Lampedusa and the Canaries, the President highlighted the figures: 10,000 had arrived at Lampedusa and 20,000 in the Canaries since the start of the year and hundreds had perished at sea. Moreover, this was not a one-off event but "a permanent, structural problem" which meant that "Europe must formulate a common policy for managing migration" and "commit itself to the development of Africa".
Other topics highlighted by Mr Borrell were the planned attacks on airlines flying between the UK and the USA, and the recent bombings in Turkey. All available resources should be deployed to deal with such threats, he said, but they must also be "acceptable from the point of view of respecting our liberties". In relation to Thursday's debate on the personal data of air passengers, he noted that Ireland had brought an action over the directive on data retention, which called into question the "delicate balance" Parliament had reached with Council on this issue.
Following the death of Hungarian MEP István PÁLFI on 15 July, the President asked the House to observe a minute's silence.

Finnish President focuses on international issues
2006-09-11 - 12:36
In his welcome to Finnish President Tarja HALONEN, who addressed the House on behalf of Finland's presidency of the Council, EP President BORRELL praised the country for its example in promoting research and innovation and facing up to issues such as energy security. He also stressed that, given the problems facing the EU, there was no question of Finland's term of office being a "transitional" one, as some commentators had predicted.
In her speech to the House, President Halonen focused on the EU's international role, which she pointed out had increased greatly in recent years.
"The international threats we are facing are increasingly non-military", she said. They included "climate change, pollution, natural disasters, contagious diseases and economic insecurity". International crime and terrorism were further threats requiring cooperation between Member States. The EU aimed to promote multilateral solutions to these problems.
Security linked to development and human rights
It was important to acknowledge "the link between human rights, development and security". Indeed, "EU development policy can also be seen as part of EU security policy". She therefore urged the EU institutions to agree on continued EU funding for development beyond 2007. There was also a link between development and trade - although "not always automatically a positive one". Developing countries must undertake reforms "to promote good governance and eliminate corruption" but "the poorest countries also need special measures". In October the EU's development and trade ministers aimed to agree "a strong EU commitment to the Aid for Trade recommendations of the WTO".
On human rights, Ms Halonen said "the EU must pursue a consistent human rights policy in all parts of the world". The Council of Europe was an important partner in this area and "the accession of the EU to the European Human Rights Convention remains an important goal".
The Finnish president welcomed the EU's "rapidly developing crisis management policy", including the sending of a force to help the UN in Congo and its support for the peacekeeping operation in Darfur.
Middle East
Turning to the Middle East, she argued that "a coherent EU is a strong actor, as the Lebanon situation has shown" and said "the determined action of the EU has increased confidence in the EU as a peace broker in the region". The decision by the Member States to commit 7,000 peacekeepers to the UNIFIL operation showed they were able to take decisions "that were difficult domestically". Measures to tackle the humanitarian situation had been a success, including the pledge of over 300 million euros in aid.
The EU must also take the initiative in promoting efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This must include confidence-building at grass-roots level, including an active role for women. The EU must continue to work to bring about stability and security in the Middle East. "The region is our neighbourhood, after all", she emphasised.
Russia
Another key topic was Russia, whose leadership had repeatedly declared that it was "turned irreversibly towards Europe". Broad cooperation on a range of issues, including energy and the environment, was thus inevitable. At the EU-Russia summit in November, a key goal would be to agree on a renewal of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement due to expire next year. And the Northern Dimension, which focuses on the environment, social welfare and health, should be given greater prominence.
Enlargement
Turning to EU enlargement, Ms Halonen believed "the EU should remain open to all European countries that fulfil the membership criteria" since "the EU membership is a powerful incentive for implementing reforms". However, it was also important to remember what the criteria do not include. "We share common values but we are not seeking cultural harmonisation". "Plurality of cultures is Europe's richness and strength". Another form of plurality was also crucial, namely that of political views, as evidenced in the European Parliament itself. "A pluralistic Union needs to have a multidimensional parliamentarism".
Lastly, the Finnish president mentioned the ASEM summit of EU and Asian nations being held in Finland this week, where the two sides would discuss the global challenges they both faced.

MEP say tax cars on pollution, not on registration
2006-09-11 - 12:36
MEPs backed plans to scrap passenger car registration taxes throughout the EU. MEPs adopted a report by 385 votes in favour to 139 against with 109 abstentions saying annual circulation taxes should be used instead, and that these should be linked to the level of pollution produced by the car. MEPs stressed that the directive should not prevent governments from exempting vintage cars from road taxes.
Car registration taxes vary widely across the EU from 0 to 180 per cent of the pre-tax price of a car. According to the Commission, this distorts the internal market, is administratively complex, encourages tax avoidance – and can often mean people buying a vehicle in one Member State then moving it to another have to pay twice. To solve these problems, the Commission has proposed a directive to phase out registration taxes over ten years and replace them with Annual Circulation Taxes linked to the carbon dioxide emissions of the car concerned – so the less environmentally damaging the car is, the less the owner has to pay.
By approving the report from Karin Riis-Jørgensen (ALDE, DK), Parliament backs the Commission’s general approach, though it says that the environmental aspect should be more broad, with the level of tax linked to fuel efficiency and pollutant emissions as well as carbon dioxide. MEPs also note that the changes should be revenue neutral.
As will most matters concerning taxation, Parliament's role is consultative - the final decision must be taken unanimously by the Council. Text adopted

Oil pollution at sea: €154m for satellite imagery services and anti-pollution vessels
2006-09-11 - 12:36
Parliament adopted a first-reading report (in agreement with Council) on funding for the action of the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) in the field of response to pollution caused by ships. Just before EMSA's official launch on 14 September next week, MEPs agreed to provide €154m for the period 2007-2013 to allow the implementation of the Agency's new tasks.
MEPs believe that the time is ripe for taking measures additional to those taken by coastal states in order to provide an effective response to cases of maritime pollution.
The activities of the Agency should, however, not relieve coastal states of their responsibility to have appropriate pollution response mechanisms in place. In the event of a maritime pollution incident, EMSA should assist the Member State(s) affected, under the authority of which the clean-up operation will be conducted.
Anti-pollution vessels
On request, EMSA will provide anti-pollution vessels to combat oil pollution and other types of pollution, such as that caused by hazardous and noxious substances to combat oil pollution, such as that caused by hazardous and noxious substances. EMSA should play particular attention to those areas identified and most vulnerable without prejudice to any other area in need.
Satellite imagery service
The Agency will play an important role in developing a centralised satellite imagery service for the surveillance, the early detection of pollution and identification of the ships responsible. This new system will improve the availability of data and the effectiveness of the response to pollution caused by ships.
Not just oil pollution
An amendment was also adopted pointing on the definition of "oil". Oil means petroleum in any form; including crude oil, fuel oil, sludge, oil refuse and refined products as established by the Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation OPRC in 1990.
Hazardous and noxious substances
In addition to the Commission proposals, Parliament took the view that hazardous and noxious substances should also be under the scope of this regulation. These substances are likely to create hazards to human health, to harm living resources and marine life, to damage amenities or to interfere uses of the sea. Text adopted

Daphne III - fighting violence against children, young people and women - MEPs call for an increase in the budget
2006-09-11 - 12:36
Parliament adopted a first-reading report on the successful EU programme seeking to combat and prevent violence against children, young people and women: Daphne. The Parliament calls for a budget of €125 million for 2007-2013 as compared to €116.85 million in the Commission's proposal. MEPs also want to include domestic violence, genital mutilation and protection of victims as objectives of the programme.
Initially the Commission proposed a single programme covering "Daphne" and "Drugs and Prevention and information". In May 2006, the Commission presented a modified proposal taking into account the Parliament's request to split the two programmes. The report was adopted with 552 votes in favour 51 against with 64 abstentions.
A common programme was criticised out of the concern that the Daphne programme might loose visibility if combined with measures related to drug addiction.
Special attention to vulnerable groups
MEPs add fighting domestic violence and female genital mutilation among the objectives of Daphne as well as protection of victims. The programme's target groups for actions should be "all those that directly or indirectly deal with violence in all its forms and with trafficking in human beings".
MEPs remind that it is necessary to recognise that some groups, namely women belonging to minority groups, refugee women, women migrants, women living in poverty in rural or remote communities, women in institutions or in detention, female children, lesbian women, women with disabilities and elderly women, are particularly vulnerable to violence.
Clear and credible targets
Clear and credible targets are required, say MEPs. Parliament also proposes to set up a Europe-wide child helpline for children who have experienced violence.
Daphne should as well be open to a wider range of NGOs, for example organisations that fight against child abduction and paedophilia and for the European Network of Ombudspeople for Children (ENOC), say MEPs. They also call on the Commission to "aim at ensuring the participation of all countries to which the programme is open".
Third phase of Daphne
The anti-violence plans would not be a new programme, but a third phase of Daphne ('Daphne III'). It will cover the period from 1 January 2007- 31 December 2013 and should build on the policies and objectives laid down in the "Daphne" (2000-2003) and "Daphne II" (2004-2008) programmes, according to the Parliament.
Given that problems linked to violence are likely to continue occurring in the future the Parliament calls for prior arrangements to allow for the extension of the programme. Text adopted

Costs of interpretation in the EU institutions - call for pragmatic solutions
2006-09-11 - 12:36
MEPs adopted an own-initiative report on interpretation expenditure incurred by the Parliament, the Commission and the Council. The House sees multilingualism as essential cultural and linguistic diversity and ensures equal treatment of EU citizens. Parliament also considers that multilingualism is an expression of the EU's cultural diversity, and that while the increasing number of official languages calls for pragmatic solutions in the preparatory work within the institutions.
This report follows the presentation in November 2005 of a Special Report by the Court of Auditors on the interpretation expenditures of Parliament, Commission and Council for the year 2003. (See link at the end of the article)
The report says that the total cost of all the linguistic services of the EU institutions, translation and interpretation combined, represent merely 1 % of the total EU budget. MEPs consider that multilingualism is one of the key features of the European Union, which highlights cultural and linguistic diversity and ensures equal treatment of EU citizens. The House also considers that multilingualism is an expression of the EU's cultural diversity, which must be preserved, and that, therefore, while the increasing number of official languages calls for pragmatic solutions in the preparatory work within the institutions, multilingualism must be guaranteed to ensure the legitimacy and diversity of the European Union.
MEPs note that the overall cost of interpretation in 2003 was €57m as regards the European Parliament and €106m as regards the Council, the Commission, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions and some agencies. MEPs are, however, very concerned that in 2003 approximately 16% (€25.9m) of the total interpretation costs of €163m represented costs for services supplied but not used and for stand-by arrangements.
Parliament is of the opinion that the Parliament, the Council and the Commission should endeavour to reduce 'implicit or explicit stand-by duty', these arrangements accounting for €18m spent on interpretation services supplied but not used. The House notes that reserve interpreters should be available for ad hoc meetings with a short request time.
European Parliament costs
MEPs note that the full cost for an interpretation day is almost 30% higher in Parliament than in the Council or the Commission, one reason being that very few local interpreters can be used during Strasbourg sessions, which increases Parliament's interpretation costs in Strasbourg by 13 %.
Parliament also urges its administration to raise Members' awareness of interpretation costs. Parliament also asks if the administration makes best possible use of the language profiles of Members. MEPs stress that this should not lead to a ranking of official EU languages.
The House notes that in 2003, it spent €4m on interpretation services made available but not used due to late requests or cancellations. MEPs also ask that last-minute cancellations and last-minute requests be discouraged. Finally, MEPs call on the interpretation services to be more flexible in their service planning and request system. Text adopted

Situation in Middle East - MEPs support UN resolution
2006-09-11 - 12:36
The European Parliament welcomed the United Nations decision to send 15,000 troops to southern Lebanon in a resolution adopted on Thursday, 7 September. MEPs stress that UNIFIL should have a clear mandate and clear rules of engagement. They also call for the immediate release of the kidnapped Israeli soldiers, as well as the imprisoned members of the Palestinian government and Legislative Council. Israel should transfer withheld Palestinian tax revenues and open the Gaza Strip's borders.
MEPs expressed their serious concern over the extension and intensity of the military conflict in South Lebanon and deeply regret the casualties among civilians in Lebanon and in Israel, soldiers and UN observers, and the massive destruction of infrastructure. The House reaffirmed that there is no military solution to the conflict in the Middle East.
Parliament reiterates the call for the immediate release of the kidnapped Israeli soldiers and of the members of the Palestinian Government and members of the Palestinian Legislative Council imprisoned by Israel.
The House stresses the need to bring the Middle East peace process back to the top of the international political agenda. MEPs call on the Quartet to revive the implementation of the Roadmap with a view to the annual UN General Assembly session in September. Parliament reaffirms that the two-state solution, with an Israeli and a Palestinian state living side-by-side in peace and security, is a key condition for a peaceful and lasting settlement in the Middle East.
The House considers it vital that all weapon imports into Lebanon go only to the official Lebanese army and asks the Lebanese Government to ensure, in cooperation with UNIFIL, the full implementation of UNSC Resolution 1559. The House stresses also the importance for all the EU Member States to act in line with the requirements of Resolution 1701 related to arms supplies. MEPs stress that this settlement should lead to the disarming of all militias, including that of Hezbollah, and measures to prevent the entry of arms into Lebanon.
The House reaffirmed that "there is no military solution to the conflict in the Middle East" and called on the Council to convene an international peace conference to find a comprehensive solution to the problems in the Middle East. MEPs calls on the Council and the Commission to continue their efforts to establish a living partnership with democratic political forces and civil society, in order to support further democratisation in Lebanon after the events of March 2005
MEPs welcome the outcome of the extraordinary General Affairs Council meeting of 25 August, in particular the full support expressed by the Council for the implementation of UNSC Resolution 1701, and the Member States' commitment to provide about 7 000 soldiers out of a maximum of 15 000 UNIFIL forces. The House underlines the active role taken by France and Italy and fully supports the decision that France will continue to assume the command of UNIFIL until February 2007 and that Italy will then take over ground control. Parliament stresses nevertheless the importance of clearly and adequately defining the mandate, rules of engagement, structure and competences of UNIFIL, if necessary to be agreed under a new UN Security Council resolution, which should take into account the lessons learnt from previous UN peacekeeping engagements, notably in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Parliament calls urgently on Iran and Syria to play a constructive role, especially with regard to the implementation of UNSC Resolutions 1559 and 1701. They call specifically on Syria to step up controls on its side of the Lebanese-Syrian border in accordance with Resolution 1701, which requires neighbouring countries to prevent supplies of weapons to non-State entities.
MEPs deeply deplore the deteriorating situation of the population and civilian infrastructure in Gaza and the West Bank. The House asks all sides to break the vicious circle of attacks and counter- attacks, which resulted in hundreds of deaths and injuries and extensive damage to civilian infrastructure.
Finally, the House resolves to send a fact-finding delegation to Lebanon, Palestine and Israel in order to monitor the situation, with special focus on the humanitarian and political conditions.
Debate preceding the vote (Wednesday 6 September)
Ahead of the vote on the resolution on the situation in the Middle East to took place on Thursday (7 September), MEPs debated the events of the summer including the reconstruction and humanitarian efforts as well as the new UNIFIL force for south Lebanon.
Speaking for the Council, Finnish Foreign Minister speaking for the Erkki TUOMIOJA opened the debate by saying that: "the latest Middle East crisis in the summer is the first Middle East crisis where the European Union became the international actor on which the greatest hopes and expectations were placed in particular by the Lebanese people and the Government, but also more widely in the region".
"There is a need to move troops into the area quickly to avoid a security vacuum while the IDF withdraws and the Lebanese Armed Forces gradually deploy into Southern Lebanon. In order to restore peace and security, UNIFIL's mission is to ensure the withdrawal from Southern Lebanon and to help the Lebanese Government and army to extend its authority to the area and to all of Lebanon. While the Lebanese Army carries out the disarming of Hezbollah, UNIFIL will also have an important task in ensuring the delivery of humanitarian aid."
On the ceasefire, Minister Tuomioja said: "The ceasefire has, notwithstanding some deplorable incidents, been respected. The Lebanese Government remains united and all the political parties, including Hezbollah, have pledged their support for Resolution 1701 and the political agreement it incorporates.
The role of the European Union in the humanitarian aid, early recovery and reconstruction in Lebanon has been remarkable. The Donor Conference in Stockholm last week was a major success. The European Union's humanitarian aid response has already been swift and significant. The total humanitarian aid pledged or effectively granted by the European Community and Member States is approximately 330 million euros. Right now we can already focus more on the early recovery and strengthening local capacity."
On the Road Map, the Minister said: "We do not need to reinvent the wheel for the Peace Process. All the elements needed are well known and can be found in the Road Map and other documents. But pulling these in the right sequence and order remains challenging. In our discussions at the Gymnich meeting in Lappeenranta last week we were in full agreement that the EU now has to take an active role to initiate a return to the peace process. In the future we may need to be able to take new responsibilities as well as part of the quest for peace.
The Council will thus stay engaged in the MEPP. We have made clear that the High Representative Javier Solana has the full support and mandate of the Council, working together with the Presidency and the Commission, to do what needs to be done and meet with whoever is relevant to get the Middle East Peace process working and keep it working until we reach a comprehensive peace settlement. "
European Commissioner for External Relations
External Relations Commissioner Benita FERRERO-WALDNER said "these conflicts, and the misery suffered by ordinary Lebanese, Israelis and Palestinians, have once more brought to the forefront the need for a negotiated, regional solution". They were a "stark and cruel reminder that security and stability cannot be imposed unilaterally, without dialogue and diplomacy".
The European Union was now playing an "unprecedented role" to help the victims, by mobilising "the considerable resources of the EU - from the political and security to the technical, economic and financial". Over the past six weeks, the Commission had provided rapid humanitarian assistance, with total humanitarian support of over €50 million. It had helped evacuation efforts, including €11 million for the evacuation of third-country nationals.
It had also set up the first coordination exercise among donors and had responded to the environmental disaster through the Community Civil Protection Mechanism.
At the Stockholm Conference last week, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner had announced a package of €42 million to support early recovery to the end of the year. Thus total EU aid had come to €100 million. "The European Commission has shown that it is ready to act and act fast", she said.
On the diplomatic front, the EU's support for UN resolution 1701 and for a lasting settlement to the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah was crucial. Above all, "the Middle East needs a strong sovereign, unified and politically independent Lebanon… to contain the very real risk of spill over of tension that remains".
The Lebanese population must also feel the tangible benefits of the cessation of hostilities. For this, "the lifting of Israel's air and sea blockade is essential".
Over the longer term, "the international community must remain engaged". That means "pursuing the political, social and economic agenda already outlined in the EU Lebanon Action Plan". At the same time it was important to "remove the ambiguity surrounding the disarming of Hezbollah".
The Commissioner also stressed that we must not lose sight of the broader picture across the region. While attention was being drawn to Lebanon, "violence and suffering continued in the Palestinian territories and rockets continued to fall on Israeli towns and villages".
The EU must be ready to respond to the formation of a Palestinian national unity government. It must "engage with any Palestinian government that was ready to work by peaceful means". Indeed, it had already helped keep sanitation, hospitals and health care centres open in the summer". But Israel, for its part, must unblock the Palestinian fiscal revenues.
Ultimately, "decisive action is needed to get the parties back on track to a negotiated peace". Various ideas had been floated but at last week's informal meeting of EU foreign ministers "many voices called for greater EU leadership in the Middle East". "I believe they are right", concluded the Commissioner. "Our credibility, that of the Quartet and the UN, is at stake".
Political group speakers
For the EPP-ED group, Hans-Gert POETTERING (DE) said a military solution in the Middle East was not possible. It was a political solution which would bring peace. “Peace must start in the heads of those responsible,” he said, “but a military presence can help create the right conditions.” That Europe was involved militarily in a way that would have been unimaginable twenty years ago was encouraging. An objective was for Lebanon to be sovereign without direct or indirect control from Iran or Syria. While the outcome of elections meant Hezbollah had a place in the government of Lebanon, it was not acceptable for such a party to have its own militia, undermining the sovereignty of the government itself. “The disarmament of Hezbollah must be part of the process,” he said. Mr Poettering said that, while he had criticised Israel's action as disproportionate, he respected the free democratic debate taking place there on what had gone wrong during the fighting. A similar debate in neighbouring countries would be a welcome step towards democracy in the region. “As a German, I was deeply touched by the Israeli Prime Minister's statement that a German contribution to the peacekeeping force would be welcome,” he said. He added that people in Palestine had the same dignity and the right to live in peace within secure borders. He called for a government of national unity including both Hamas and Fatah. The EU should go beyond providing aid and make a political contribution to achieving that end via the Quartet. Finally, he condemned those “abusing young people by making them into 'martyrs' Instead they should be able to make a living, constructive contribution.”
The leader of the Socialist group, Martin SCHULZ (DE) said there was a historic opportunity for Europeans and the EU, who had a duty to make practical contributions to finding solutions, when the United States' proposed solutions had completely failed, contributing to the current crisis. Europe's contribution should be military, but also based on international law, with a humanitarian and diplomatic aspect. “The core problem is to solve the Palestinian issue, which is the heart of destabilisation in the region. Israel has the right to exist, and anyone who questions that will have us to content with, and we need to strengthen Lebanon [...] to get back to the hopes that were there before the war, but we must begin with humanitarian assistance to Palestine, where the situation is dramatic.” He wanted to the forces of dialogue on all sides to be able to make their contribution. Inter-cultural dialogue was essential, to help avoid Muslims being equated with terrorists. He also called for the release of prisoners as a vital confidence building measure, and asked for Syria to adopt a positive role. He called for a regional organisation to be created, along the lines of the CSCE which had provided a forum for dialogue between all sides in Europe even at the height of the Cold War. He concluded by condemning terrorism as something all should combat.
Graham WATSON (UK) for the ALDE group said “This summer's conflict had killed over a thousand people, most of them innocent civilians. Europe should waste no time” in sending the 7,000 troops it had promised. The EU needed to speak with one voice to clarify the UNIFIL mandate, and to demand the lifting of Israel's blockades on Lebanon and Gaza. Hezbollah and Hamas needed to be brought in from the cold to engage in a democratic framework, and Europe should support an independent inquiry into the civilian deaths caused by all sides. He spoke of the institutions needed to build peace, mentioning Romano Prodi's idea of a Euro-Arab development bank and Anders Fogh Rasmussen's proposal for a Middle Eastern version of the CSCE. Europe also needed a proper immigration policy including all the countries of the Mediterranean basin. “As Einstein said, peace cannot be kept by force, only built by understanding,” he said. He said Europe should not exaggerate the scale of its response which would have been more effective under the constitution, had it been adopted. He strongly criticised Javier Solana's absence from the Chamber, and warned EU leaders that, by insisting on national sovereignty rather than working through the EU, they were risking global anarchy.
Speaking for the Greens/EFA, Daniel COHN-BENDIT (DE) pointed out that Parliament had not paid attention to resolution 1559 or the disarmament of Hezbollah a year ago: “The international community had a UN resolution, but it was shelved rather than being used as a tool for politics.” The whole region had been cursed with misfortunes, he said, and could not afford more mistakes. It was fair enough for individuals to support the Israeli or Palestinian side, but the key thing was to have two states living peacefully alongside each other. He said we needed to persuade the Israelis that the creation of a Palestinian state would in fact weaken Hamas's Islamist project. He said he had dreamed that it was Europe as such which was sending troops to the region, not individual states, but this was just a dream. Finally, he called on Mr Watson and Mr Wurtz to intervene with their political allies in Germany, whose stance on German involvement in UNIFIL was, he said, scandalous.
Francis WURTZ (GUE/NGL, FR) said the events of the summer in the Middle East had been beyond belief. 2,000 people had been killed and Lebanon had been crushed. The Israeli army had deliberately targeted the Lebanese infrastructure destroying not only roads but people with the use of indiscriminate cluster bombs. It was important to learn the lessons of the conflict, essential to return to peace and for the Quartet to be fully engaged in the region in order to achieve a lasting peace.
Cristiana MUSCARDINI (UEN, IT) said that the EU had been short on details during the conflict, rockets had been landing in Israel and the Iranian President had called for the country "to be wiped off the map". The EU's primary role should be to protect the State of Israel and its people, she said. She also stressed the importance of retuning to the road-map with the support of the UNIFIL forces. A government needed to be installed in Lebanon which had full control of the country. "Israeli citizens are European citizens", she concluded.
Bastiaan BELDER (IND/DEM, NL), for his group, raised various points. He said the German press had highlighted the Budeswehr's role of stopping the flow of weapons into Lebanon, and certainly the EU Member States did not want to stand idly by watching Hezbollah going about its business. And yet there were two Hezbollah representatives in the Lebanese government. He also asked whether Israel planned to maintain its blockade of Lebanon.
Gianni De MICHELIS (NA, IT) agreed that the EU should be involved in the Middle East. An EU diplomatic initiative could help prompt a resumption of dialogue. However, a global, not a piecemeal approach was the only way forward in the Middle East, bringing all interested parties in the region round the table to discuss all the issues at once.
British and Irish speakers
Brian CROWLEY (UEN, IE) said it was important to reinvigorate the existing Road Map as it chartered the way for peace for the whole region. While there had been disagreement among certain Member States on the policy towards the Middle East, Mr Crowley, however, welcomed the fact that Europe was heading up the new UNIFIL force. It was also important for Europe to its economic and moral diplomatic powers to achieve peace.
For Caroline LUCAS (Greens/EFA, UK), while the Lebanese situation was a tragedy, Gaza must not be forgotten. Over 200 Palestinians, including children, had been killed since June. The Israeli prisoners should certainly be released but there were also 9,000 Palestinians in Israeli prisons. She believed stronger EU action was needed and that a suspension of the EU-Israel association agreement on human rights grounds should be contemplated.
Gerard BATTEN (IND/DEM, UK) stated firmly that the war was caused by the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah. He described the Hezbollah leader as "a political gangster and a terrorist" and added that in Gaza the Palestinians had elected a terrorist government. The EU had responded by "sending the protagonists more money". Unless Hamas and Hezbollah renounced their intention of driving Israel into the sea, the EU was in effect "financing terrorism" by supporting the Palestinians financially.
James ALLISTER (NA, UK) said he did not endorse every act of Israel, “but in this case it was clear that it was not the aggressor and was fully entitled to defend itself against sustained and murderous rocket attacks from Hezbollah.” The fact that Hezbollah was able to act in that way while being part of the government of Lebanon showed, he said, the folly of allowing terrorist organisations into government, “whether in Lebanon, the Palestinian territories or, for that matter, in my own country.” He said the UN forces in Lebanon must not dodge the disarming of Hezbollah.
Liz LYNNE (ALDE, UK) said the Council's failure to call for an immediate ceasefire meant “We stood back and let civilian infrastructure be destroyed, and over a thousand people be killed in Lebanon and Israel.” She said the blame lies directly with Tony Blair, for his “dog like devotion” to George Bush. “He has the nerve to say he doesn't believe his policy will lead to further terrorist attacks. But if I and people like me are angry about Lebanon [...] just think of the ammunition given to those indoctrinating young Muslims. Nothing – nothing – justifies terrorist acts, but Mr Blair must realise his actions make him culpable.”
Charles TANNOCK (EPP-ED, UK) said the recent conflict was a tragedy for Israel and the people of Lebanon. Hezbollah, he said, had seriously miscalculated the scale of retribution which would come from its deliberate provocation. “Hezbollah now needs to explain why its actions led to so much destruction, in particular through its use of civilian shields,” he said. The Israelis too had miscalculated, believing its air power would be enough to dislodge Hezbollah when “more boots on the ground were clearly needed.” Russia, he said, needed to explain how so many of its weapons had ended up in the hands of a fundamentalist, Islamist militia. He was concerned as to who would finally be disarming Hezbollah, and how to avoid EU money ending up in Hezbollah's hands via its “so-called charities.” He asked what was to prevent troops from Muslim countries which did not recognise Israel turning a blind eye to Hezbollah rearmament. It was time, he said, to try to prize the brutal but secular regime in Syria away from the fundamentalist regime in Iran.
Speaking next, Richard HOWITT (PES, UK) wondered what Muslims in Britain would think when “UK Conservatives say Muslim countries cannot be relied upon to play their part in a UN force.” He said a just peace between Israel and the Palestinians was the key to resolving the crises of the region. The world had ignored what was going on in Gaza, he said. “Is cutting off electricity to half of its people justified? Closing nearly every school? Even stopping the fishermen from taking to their boats? The UN has described Gaza as a time bomb whose people are living in a cage.” He said the Hezbollah statement that it had not anticipated the conflict, the prospect of a Palestinian national unity government and Israeli recognition of the failings of unilateralism “must presage a diplomatic drive to return to a negotiated solution. Today we have a map for the road, but no-one in the car.” He called for Europe to recognise not just election results but also their consequences, and for Turkey to play an intermediary role.
Proinsias DE ROSSA (PES, IE) pointed out that, despite the very welcome efforts of the Commission and the UN, it is difficult to remain optimistic about the situation. Although he did not dismiss the maligned role of Hezbollah and indeed the maligned role of the US in encouraging Israel, he stated that Israel must face an international enquiry. He also stated that any international peace conference which does not carry a price for failure for the protagonists will not succeed in the Middle East.
Simon COVENEY (EPP-ED, IE) admitted that this is a time of crisis in the Middle East, but he also claimed that it is perhaps a time of opportunity. He called on the international community to ensure that the UN resolution is enforced and that the UNIFIL mission is successful. On the issue of the commitment of troops to the UNIFIL mission, he reiterated his call on the Irish Government, which has such an experience of peacekeeping in this area of the Middle East, to make further commitments to the UNIFIL mission. Mr Coveney also stated that, while providing assistance to rebuild Lebanon's infrastructure, this situation also provides an opportunity for the EU to rebuild its reputation in the area.
Sajjad KARIM (ALDE, UK) quoted from an article by Israeli journalist Gideon Levy on 3 September, which argued "Gaza has been reoccupied…" and "Under cover of the Lebanon war, Israel has returned to its old practices". Taking the EU to task for not demanding an early ceasefire, Mr Karim asked "Are our hands clean?" He also condemned Israel for its "policy of collective punishment".
Geoffrey Van ORDEN (EPP-ED, UK) said it was "difficult to see a shaft of light" in the situation but "at least the moderate Arab states have now witnessed the catastrophe that could be provoked by organisations such as Hezbollah" and "Lebanon has seen the effect of tolerating a state within a state". He believed it would be a "tragic wasted opportunity" if "UNIFIL merely becomes a bystander while Hezbollah prepares for its next attacks in the months and years ahead". If there was not the international resolve to disarm Hezbollah, at least "there should be a requirement to monitor and report on Hezbollah's activities".
Response to the debate
Speaking for the Council, Finnish Foreign Minister Erkki TUOMIOJA said that the clear message from the European Parliament was that it was supportive and appreciative of the position which ended the conflict, and one which would enable Lebanon to exercise full responsibility. The EU could not solve the Middle East problems by itself, and this was logical since the EU supported multilateralism. Nevertheless, the EU had showed leadership in many areas.
In her concluding speech, Commissioner FERRERO-WALDNER was pleased to note that MEPs broadly agreed that there could be no military solution, that the root causes of the conflict must be tackled and that a comprehensive approach to the issues was needed.
Replying to specific points made by MEPs, she said the Commission was not in favour of suspending the association agreement with Israel, preferring instead to work with, and influence, the country. To Mr Tannock, she said the allegations he referred to had never been substantiated. Lastly, she insisted that EU money would go to the Lebanese government or organisations working with it (i.e. not to Hezbollah) as Europe wished to empower the government. Resolution adopted

Turkey urged to reinvigorate reforms and admit Cypriot planes and vessels
2006-09-11 - 12:36
The Foreign Affairs Committee remains firmly committed to accession as the goal of EU negotiations with Turkey, but says that both in Turkey and in the EU important reforms are needed in order to achieve this outcome. In a report adopted on 4 September 2006, the committee welcomed the start of the accession negotiations with Turkey, but expressed regret that the reform process in Turkey has slowed down.
The text will be debated by the whole Parliament during the plenary session of 25-28 September in Strasbourg.
The report, prepared by Camiel Eurlings (EPP-ED, NL) and adopted by 53 votes in favour to 6 against with 8 abstentions, notes "persistent shortcomings" in areas such as freedom of expression, religious and minority rights, the role of the military, policing, women's rights, trade union rights and cultural rights. It urges Turkey to "reinvigorate" the reform process.
MEPs also urge Turkey "to take concrete steps for the normalisation of bilateral relations" with Cyprus "as soon as possible". They refer to the Council declaration of 21 September 2005, which said that continuing negotiations would depend on Turkey opening its borders to Cypriot vessels and airplanes and that the situation would be reviewed in 2006. Regarding Cyprus itself, MEPs welcome the meeting between Mr Papadopoulos and Mr Talat, which led to the agreement of 8 July.
On other issues, the Foreign Affairs committee call on Turkey to recognise the Armenian genocide as a precondition for accession. And it called for a lowering of the threshold of ten percent of the votes below which political parties cannot enter the Turkish parliament.
MEPs repeat that negotiations do no lead automatically to accession and said that whether or not negotiations are successfully concluded, Turkey must remain "fully anchored in European structures."
Before the start of the vote, Mr Eurlings said that "unfortunately, reforms have clearly slowed down." He hoped that the Turkish government would regard his report "as a signal and an incentive to reintroduce the vigorous speed of reform it had shown in the year before accession negotiations started."

MEPs give assent to the Association Agreement with Albania
2006-09-11 - 12:36
Parliament gave its assent to the conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EC and the Republic of Albania. The House also adopted a resolution on the conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EU and Albania.
MEPs welcome the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, which will hold out the prospect of a close and far-reaching contractual relationship between the EU and Albania, instrumental for achieving political, economic and institutional stability in the country as well as in the whole region and for promoting the transformation of Albania into a pluralist democracy respecting the rule of law, with a functioning market economy. The House believes that progress in achieving the standards laid down in the Agreement should be monitored by means of concrete measurable benchmarks by the SAA Council and the relevant joint parliamentary committee.
The House urges the EU and Albania to use the Agreement as a mutually beneficial opportunity. MEPs furthermore advise Albania to exploit the opportunity to find its own niche on the European market and develop competitiveness in targeted sectors.
MEPs recommend that Albania focus more strongly on developing its economic potential, not least through the expansion of its infrastructure and the development of tourism. The House regrets the recent cuts in external action assistance as foreseen in the Financial Perspective. Parliament calls on the Commission to earmark sufficient funds for the development of the country’s infrastructure, in particular for the development of transport.
Parliament encourages Albanian governmental bodies to empower civil society by providing it with wider opportunities to participate in the formulation of policy and in the monitoring of its implementation and effectiveness at all levels of government to improve the quality and credibility of reform, as well as to increase transparency and accountability.
The House also stresses that there are still significant violations of human rights in Albania which should be addressed. MEPs urge the Albanian Government to implement the necessary reforms to give detainees access to defence in legal proceedings and to combat torture, brutality or inhuman or degrading treatment. Parliament calls on the government to carry out the relevant legislative reforms required for the full implementation of the 2003 Family Code, particularly as regards making domestic violence a criminal offence.
Finally, the House calls on Albania to make further efforts to protect minority rights, including the rights of the Greek minority in Albania, and to complete and implement its minority-related legislation so that it supports the implementation of the relevant international conventions ratified by Albania. The House observes that further efforts are needed, in particular, as regards increasing the use of minority languages in citizens' dealings with the authorities and the display of traditional local names, improving access to the media for members of minority groups and extending minority language education. The House notes the shortage of accurate statistical information on national minorities. Text adopted

EP adopts report critical of human rights violations in China
2006-09-11 - 12:36
China's policy towards Taiwan and Tibet, as well as human rights questions about the death penalty, forced labour camps, and the freedom of religion, the press and the internet constitute the bulk of a report adopted by the European Parliament. The own-initiative report by Bastiaan Belder (IND/DEM, NL) was approved by (351-48-160) and comes on the eve of a high-level EU-China summit, which will be held on 9 September in Helsinki.
The Parliament's report concentrates on the human rights situation in China. Specifically, it "deplores the contradiction between the constitutional freedom of belief (enshrined in Article 36 of the Constitution) and the ongoing interference of the State in the affairs of religious communities." The EP is deeply concerned "that the practice of torture remains widespread in China," and condemns the Laogai labour camps across the country. On the political front, the EP calls on China to abolish the death penalty, and to "refrain from intimidating, cracking down on or imprisoning those who advocate freedom of expression." In addition, MEPs express their worry about "recent reports of continuing serious human rights abuses in Tibetan areas of China."
On the foreign relations front, the Parliament's report strongly recommends "that the EU arms embargo against China remain intact until greater progress is made on human rights issues". It also criticises China's provocative behaviour towards Taiwan and Japan, and asks the Chinese government for a "decisive stance" on the Iranian nuclear crisis. MEPs adopted an amendment which makes specific mention of Taiwan's "territorial sovereignty and integrity."
The House also notes some concerns about economic relations. It urges the Chinese authorities to improve the protection of Intellectual Property Rights, and calls on the Commission to "exert political and economic pressure aimed at bringing flexibility to bear on the exchange rate of the Chinese currency, which is being pegged at an artificially low rate."
The PES group decided to abstain from the report. Hannes Swoboda (PES, AT) explained that although his group agreed with the human rights parts of the report, the failure to include mention of the EU's "one China - two systems" policy in the report. Text adopted

MEPs adopt written declaration on banning seal products in the EU
2006-09-11 - 12:36
The European Parliament adopted a written declaration on banning seal products in the European Union. The House requests the Commission to immediately draft a regulation to ban the import, export and sale of all harp and hooded seal products. MEPs considers that this regulation should not have an impact on traditional Inuit seal hunting which, however, only accounts for 3% of the current hunt.
The written declaration achieved more than half the signatures of all MEPs with some 373 signing so far. The written declaration was originally put forward by Carl SCHLYTER (Green/EFA, SE), Paulo CASACA (PES, PT), Karl-Heinz FLORENZ (EPP-ED, DE), Mojca DRČAR MURKO (ALDE, SI) and Caroline LUCAS (Greens/EFA, UK).
MEPs say that more than one and a half million harp seal pups have been slaughtered in the North West Atlantic over the last four years and the vast majority of these animals were less than three months old. The last time the annual number of seals now being killed were slaughtered in the 1950s and 1960s the seal population was reduced by two thirds,
The declaration points out that, on average, sealers receive less than 5% of their income from sealing which provides only a few days' work each year, a team of international veterinarians concluded that 42% of the slaughtered seals they examined may have been skinned whilst still conscious.
The written declaration also says that the import of whitecoat harp seal and blueback hooded seal furs and furskin products was banned within the EEC in 1983 (83/129/EEC), whereas sealers now wait a few days until harp seal pups have moulted and whereas the products of these animals are still imported into the European Union.
MEPs point out that a number of EU countries (Belgium, Luxembourg and Italy) have already taken steps to ban the trade in seal products, and others (the UK and the Netherlands) are considering action, and the USA, Mexico and Croatia have banned the trade in seal products. Finally, the declaration says that the Council of Europe is currently considering a motion that calls for a ban on the import and use of seals and seal parts. Text adopted

Social policy
A European Social Model for the future: a unity of values with a diversity of systems
2006-09-11 - 12:36
Parliament adopted an own-initiative report on the future of the European Social Model. Supporting this model, the report outlines the concept of the European Social Model which reflects a common set of values implemented in different ways in the Member States. The House underlined the urgent need for the concept to be reformed and stressed what has to be done in future to preserve the model.
The European Social model: not a cost, but a positive factor in the EU's economic growth
The European Social Model "reflects a common set of values, based on the preservation of peace, social justice, equality, solidarity, the promotion of freedom and democracy and respect of human rights". According to MEPs, "in the last 60 years this set of common values has allowed a growing EU to successfully become an area of greater economic prosperity and social justice". They underline that social policies, when appropriately designed "cannot be regarded as a cost but, instead, as a positive factor in the EU's economic growth".
Although Member States have different social systems, and have implemented these values in different ways, they commonly aim to attain a balance between economic growth and social solidarity, and this is reflected in the European Social Model as a unity of values with a diversity of systems, members underline.
Urgent need to reform to preserve the model
MEPs stress the necessity to preserve and enhance the values associated with the European Social Model and the high social standards already achieved. They are convinced that the economic and social systems must be urgently reformed where they fail to meet the criteria of efficiency and socially sustainable development, and where they are inadequate to tackle the challenges of demographic change, globalisation and the IT revolution.
Also to restore citizen's confidence in the EU project, which provides jobs, growth and prosperity, the EU's commitment to a Social Europe needs to be renewed, members stress.
Actions needed on EU and Member State level
Members underline that even if employment and social policy remain broadly within national competence, the EU needs to create an economic and social framework which allows Member States to implement reforms as necessary at national level, according to their own economic, social and political circumstances
They call on the Commission and the Council to respect the initial equilateral triangle of the Lisbon Strategy and to develop an approach that is better balanced between economic coordination on the one hand and employment and social protection policy on the other
The Commission is asked to take further initiatives to achieve full implementation of the internal market, having regard to exclude any race to the bottom in social, consumer or environmental standards. The Commission shall also incorporate already now the social dimension in its impact analyses, in accordance with the social clause provided for in the proposed Constitutional Treaty.
Members recognise the advantages of 'flexicurity' systems which Member States should adopt. They consider them as a means of promoting reconciliation of work-life balance and work and life-cycle concepts.
Since many Member States are far from achieving the Lisbon Strategy objectives they are called to achieve, in particular, the specific targets set for employment, especially of women and young people, Research and Development investment, child care and lifelong learning.
Member States shall furthermore undertake reforms in order to ensure the financial sustainability of national social systems, without prejudicing acquired rights, mutual support and intergenerational solidarity. They should also improve the coordination of their tax policies with a view to avoiding harmful tax competition, ensuring sustainable financing for social protection and making tax policy more employment friendly. The EU funds, such as the European Structural Funds, shall be used more efficiently to co-finance national reforms.
MEPs underline that any successful reform of the social systems should involve all stakeholders, in particular the social partners and civil society. Text adopted

Simplifying the Common Fisheries Policy
2006-09-11 - 12:36
The House adopted an own-initiative report by Philippe MORILLON (ALDE, FR) on the Commission's Action Plan for simplifying and improving the Common Fisheries Policy. The report welcomes the Commission's plans, but calls for more pre-legislative consultation with all parties concerned, as well as a 'standard agreement' to base all fishing agreements on.
Parliament rejects the Commission's idea to submit 'short regulation' on technical measures to the Council, which would bypass the European Parliament in these areas. Text adopted

Improving the mental health of the EU population
2006-09-11 - 12:36
MEPs adopted a report drawn up by John BOWIS (EPP-ED, UK) in response to the Commission's Green Paper on a strategy on mental health for the European Union. Parliament says that Member States should work together to find and implement effective strategies to reduce suicide, particularly among young people and other at risk groups.
The report says that mental ill health affects everyone in the EU either directly or indirectly, and during the course of any one year 18.4 million people in the European Union aged between 18 and 65 are estimated to suffer from major depression.
The report highlights some 58,000 European Union citizens commit suicide each year, more than the annual deaths from road traffic accidents or HIV/AIDS, and points out that ten times this number attempt suicide. The report also sets out that one in four people in Europe experience at least one significant episode of mental ill health during their lives.
MEPs draw attention to the "sizeable differences" in mental health expenditure in individual Member States and welcomed the Commission's commitment to mental health promotion.
Parliament calls for the Green Paper to be followed up with a proposal for a directive on mental health in Europe and "the defence of and respect for the civil and fundamental rights of persons suffering from mental disorders". Any such proposal should involve partnership and consultation with those who have experienced or are experiencing mental health problems, their families and carers and advocacy NGOs, associations of family members and other interested parties.
MEPs want the key target groups identified by the Commission (children, employees, older people and disadvantaged members of society) to be extended to include those with severe mental illness, those with long-term and terminal illnesses, the disabled, prisoners, ethnic and other minority groups, those sleeping rough, migrants, those in precarious jobs and the unemployed. They also feel that the Green Paper did not take due account of the gender dimension. The report acknowledges that men and women may have different mental health needs, and called for more research in order to develop separate approaches and treatments for the two sexes.
Among its many recommendations, the House calls for "a multi-disciplinary and multi-agency response" to tackling complex mental ill health situations, such as those involving children or adolescents. It also urges employers to introduce "Mental Health at Work" policies with a view to ensuring the best possible jobs for and best possible incorporation into the labour market of persons with mental disorders.
Pointing out that one of the greatest challenges in mental health is the ageing of Europe's population; the report wants to see more research into neurodegenerative diseases or other psychiatric illnesses in the elderly. MEPs also stress that the "defeat of stigma" should be at the heart of any future mental health strategy, for example by establishing annual campaigns on mental health issues in order to combat ignorance and injustice. Parliament also wants to see mental health services reformed with a view to providing high-quality community care at home or in sheltered accommodation, regular monitoring and assessment and respite care. The Commission is urged to support continuing reforms in any Member State that practised the abuse of psychiatry, over-use of medication or incarceration, or "inhumane practices such as caged beds or excessive use of seclusion rooms".
Other points raised in the report include the need for more research into therapeutic and psychological interventions, into the development of more effective drugs with fewer side-effects, and into determinants of mental disorders and suicide. There should also be greater involvement of service users in all aspects of mental health research.
Challenges in some of the new Member States
The House urges the Commission to support continuing reforms in any Member State that practised the abuse of psychiatry, over-use of medication or incarceration, or inhumane practices such as caged beds or excessive use of seclusion rooms, particularly in some of the new Member States. MEPs stress that in some of the new Member States mental health indicators in society are as a rule drifting in the wrong direction, with a lot of suicides, violence and dependencies, especially on alcohol. The House underlines that these countries inherited inadequate mental health care systems and large psychiatric and care institutions which increase social exclusion and stigma, while at the same time there is a lack of community services which need to be integrated into general health and social protection systems. MEPs call on the Commission to place the reform of psychiatry on the agenda for EU accession negotiations. The House considers that prison is not a suitable environment for those suffering mental ill health and that alternatives should be actively pursued.
Lastly, the House calls for the Commission to set up a "Mental Health Coordinating and Monitoring Group" to collect information on mental health practice and promotion in the EU, to assess the adequacy (in terms of numbers and training) of existing mental health professionals and infrastructure, and to disseminate information on best practice.

Justice and home affairs
Balancing security and data protection for air travel
2006-09-11 - 12:36
With the 30 September deadline imposed by the European Court of Justice for the EU to end passenger data transfers to the US rapidly approaching, Parliament adopted a report calling on the US to ensure that it offers adequate protection of European passenger data and that sufficient safeguards are in place. It is asking the Council to negotiate an interim agreement, valid until November 2007 only, with MEPs observing the negotiations.
Subsequently, EP wants to have joint decision-making rights (together with the Council of ministers) over the negotiation of the agreement after November 2007 and on an eventual EU policy on passenger data.
Parliament's two-step strategy on PNR
The Parliament proposes a two-step negotiation strategy. According to the rapporteur, Sophia IN 'T VELD (ALDE, NL), the EU should reach a new short-term international agreement to run for the period covered by the original, now annulled, deal, with MEPs present at the negotiations as observers.
MEPs want to ensure that the US offers adequate protection of European passenger data and that sufficient safeguards are in place. This would in particular mean ensuring that deficiencies already identified in the current agreement be rectified, such as the switch to a PUSH system - US officers should request the specifically required data on a case by case basis, instead of being granted access to the full database - and reducing the number of PNR data fields which can be checked.
For the medium and long-term, MEPs propose "a more coherent approach (...) towards the exchange of passenger data". By the time of the review of the agreement in 2007, MEPs want the Council to give Parliament full co-decision rights on such issues so they can ensure future agreements are properly respect data protection safeguards. Such a change would mean invoking the so-called "passerelle" clause of the Treaty, which allows the Council, by a unanimous decision, to move policy areas from decision making by unanimity in Council and consultation of Parliament to qualified majority voting in Council and co-decision with Parliament.
Finally, MEPs also propose a dialogue this year with parliamentarians from the EU, US, Canada and Australia, to help prepare for the review.
Debate preceding the vote
Opening the debate, Justice and Home Affairs Commissioner Franco FRATTINI said that the situation following the Court of Justice's decision to strike down the EU-US agreement on passenger name records (PNR) "underlines the need for a single legal basis for justice, liberty and security issues" and for "communitarisation of the third pillar". In this connection he had called on EU ministers to favour use of the "passerelle clause".
The Commissioner stressed that the new agreement being negotiated with the USA "should include the same content" as the old one. However, it could also incorporate "rules and procedures which effectively restrict the use of PNR data by the United States authorities". At all events, to protect public safety all efforts must be made to ensure the existing agreement is replaced by 30 September.
The Commissioner told MEPs that negotiations on a new agreement are due to start tomorrow in Brussels and a draft text has already been sent to the US side. The talks will be led by the Council, assisted by the Commission. However, "the Commission intends to fulfil its obligations under the inter-institutional agreement to keep Parliament fully informed throughout the negotiations". He would report regularly to MEPs on the matter, including at the meeting of the EP Civil Liberties Committee on 12 September.
He pointed out that if no new agreement is in place by 1 October, air carriers flying from Europe to America risk legal complaints from EU citizens because differing national rules will apply on the transfer of PNR data to the United States. It was thus very important to "guarantee legal certainty with an agreement at European-level, to ensure a high level of security and at the same time privacy protection for our citizens".
Sophia IN 'T VELD (ALDE, NL), Parliament's rapporteur on PNR said the debate had to be seen in a broader context of the methods used to fight terrorism, especially given President Bush's statement on the existence of secret detention camps outside the US. She stressed the importance of Europe speaking with a single voice on this subject, as well as proper parliamentary scrutiny meaning co-decision powers for the European Parliament.
In the short-term, she stressed the importance of re-negotiating the agreement between the EU and the US before the end of September stating that there were rumours circulating that the US might favour bilateral agreements. In the longer term, parliamentary scrutiny should be ensured. The rapporteur also underlined the importance of "proportionality" and the creation of a parliamentary transatlantic dialogue in order to heal the rift between Europe and the US on this subject.
Carlos COELHO (EPP-ED, PT) stressed his group's support for the goal of combating terrorism but said it was keen to see cooperation not just among EU Member States but particularly with the United States. Effective cooperation meant that an "EU-US agreement was better than 25 bilateral agreements". There must be no legal vacuum. Therefore the EPP-ED hoped to be able to vote soon on an interim agreement before turning to the longer term.
He referred to the agreements concluded by the USA with Australia and Canada, saying "they have acceptable levels of proportionality" on the scope and type of data that can be collected as well as oversight by an independent authority. He added "We need dialogue between the EU, the US, Canada and Australia so we can prepare for the 2007 review and a global approach on PNR". As regards cooperation within the European Union itself, it was time "to move from words to facts", he concluded.
Martine ROURE (PES, FR) said the Socialists also favoured a two-pronged strategy: an interim agreement by 30 September plus negotiations on a new agreement for 2007. But an interim agreement should not be concluded hastily. Parliament must be kept fully informed of the talks, as should national parliaments, and it was important that all undertakings given should be implemented and respected by the Americans.
Mr Frattini said he had made proposals at an informal EU summit in London on PNR data. Positive biometric profiling on a voluntary basis was among the issues discussed. What was the status of this summit, she wondered, "where important proposals were discussed without Parliament being involved"?
Regarding a possible future European PNR system, this must "not allow circumvention of Community or national legislation on protection of personal data of citizens". Proposals by the Commission would only be acceptable if we adopt a framework decision on data protection under the third pillar.
On behalf of the Liberals, Sarah LUDFORD (ALDE, UK) voiced concern at a recent statement by the head of US Homeland Security, who had said he "wants to analyse PNR records in conjunction with current intelligence to identify high-risk travellers who are 'unnamed threats'". He even wished to share such information routinely with Immigration, the FBI and "our allies in London".
There was also a danger, she said, of profiling on the basis of stereotypes of terrorists. "We need a very good explanation of what PNR data is being used for in the US", she stressed.
Above all, however, there was "a need for a coherent EU policy". Recent events had given a picture of "a disunited Europe, with the Member States running around like headless chickens". In fact, "we are ineffective, dysfunctional and we are letting our citizens down". There was a clear need for an EU policy but it must be one that safeguards privacy.
Cem ÖZDEMIR (Greens/EFA, DE) said that the vast majority of MEPs were in favour of strengthening security and co-operating with the US where possible, but were opposed to the current proposal on PNR: The transfer of data had to take place under "reasonable conditions". The legal basis and the scope of the transfer had to be re-examined.
Giusto CATANIA (GUE/NGL, IT) was also opposed to the proposed agreement and said that the European Parliament had been excluded from the debate. Direct transfers of data to should be avoided.
Gerard BATTEN (IND/DEM, UK) said that, following the Court of Justice's decision, the only point that would be changed would be the legal basis for the agreement. The Council would simply continue to ignore the Parliament and it would be better for Member States to agree bi-lateral agreements with the US.
Non-aligned MEP, Frank VANHECKE (NI, BE) said that his phone had been tapped by "state authorities" but little attention had been paid to this. The rights of the European traveller should be protected, he said, but greater transfers of data was the "price to pay" for greater security.
British Speaker
Michael CASHMAN (PES, UK) stated that an agreement with the US is essential if the fundamental rights of EU citizens are to be protected. In the absence of an agreement, he pointed out that the US will quite legally ask passengers to sign a data waiver, which would mean that any notion of EU-wide data protection would be absolutely and fundamentally lost. Mr Cashman also stated that an attack on any one EU Member State is an attack on all Member States because of the common values shared by EU citizens.
Response to the debate
Responding to the debate, Commissioner FRATTINI made a number of points.
Firstly, he said some speakers appeared to have misinterpreted the Court of Justice's ruling, regarding it as a victory for the EU and for Parliament. In fact, he argued, "that ruling was a great defeat for Community interests, for this Parliament and for the Commission". It had established that this subject was not an area of Community competence and that it was an area where EC privacy directives did not apply. "That ruling, which has to be respected, was a distinct defeat for all of us and we should say that".
He added that if no agreement was reached now, EU citizens "will see a reduction in the protection of their personal data", as they will continue to travel but will have to make individual declarations. But if an agreement is reached, "the protection of EU citizens' rights will not be discretionary, as it would be with bilateral agreements between the US and individual carriers".
Secondly, he emphasised that Europe's problem was not with the US but with terrorists, such as those who had been on the point of perpetrating attacks in the UK and Denmark this summer. The EP would be kept informed about the progress of negotiations for an agreement but ultimately "the need is for more cooperation with the US, not less".
Lastly, further work was needed in some areas. He would seek to convince the Council to adopt a framework directive on personal data. He also favoured a move to the PUSH system and hoped that, thanks to new technical advances, such a system could start functioning in a few weeks' time. He promised to speak in detail about the London summit referred to by Martine Roure (PES, FR) when he appeared before Parliament's Civil Liberties Committee next week. Lastly, he said that positive profiling should be seen as a benefit, as "it can mean you spend less time at borders" but "negative ethnic or religious profiling is clearly unacceptable". Text adopted

Forest fires and floods - MEPs want EU to strengthen civil protection capacity
2006-09-11 - 12:36
In adopting a resolution on forest fires and floods, MEPs express their solidarity with the relatives of those who have lost their lives as well as the inhabitants of the damaged areas, in particular in Galicia, and thanks all those – professionals and volunteers – who helped to extinguish the fires and rescue the victims of the floods.
The resolution was adopted by 534 votes in favour to 10 against and 29 abstentions. The House calls on the Finnish Presidency-in-Office to pay particular attention to the development of the Union’s rapid response capacity for such disasters and to the proposals by the Commission and the European Parliament on reinforcing the Community’s civil protection capacity and to propose the adoption of the legal instruments by the end of 2006, in line with the mandate given by the European Council of 15 and 16 June 2006.
MEPs are concerned at the growing number of disasters which, according to experts, may be attributed largely to climate change. The House calls, accordingly, on the Member States to do what is necessary to attain the Kyoto goals, and calls on the Commission to take initiatives to guarantee compliance with the Kyoto commitments and the follow-up to them. MEPs believe that the damage caused by recent events further emphasises that mitigation will be much less costly than the consequences of global warming.
Parliament asks the Commission for the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund to be applied with flexibility, facilitating its implementation in order to tackle the serious damage caused by fires, bearing in mind that the damage affects the way of life of the population, especially in the less prosperous regions that have to cope with the adverse effects on infrastructure, economic potential, employment, the natural and cultural heritage, the environment and tourism, which all have an adverse effect on economic and social cohesion.
MEPs call on the European Institutions to adopt, and on the Member States to implement as soon as possible, the ongoing procedures to establish a Community civil defence mechanism and concerning the assessment and management of floods.
MEPs call on the Commission to reintroduce aids to farmers for creating and maintaining firebreaks as part of the implementing rules for the new European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).
The House regrets that Russia neglected cooperation with its neighbouring countries during its recent forest fires. Finally, Parliament calls for the Commission to raise this issue in the framework of the EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. Text adopted

Doha round pause: opportunity to increase accountability and democratic legitimacy of the WTO
2006-09-11 - 12:36
Regretting the suspension sine die of the Doha Round negotiations in July 2006, the European Parliament reiterates in a resolution adopted on Thursday, 7 September that it is fully committed to the multilateral approach to trade policy and suggests institutional reforms of the WTO to increase accountability.
The EP is concerned that a failure of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) could lead to the collapse of the present multilateral trading system and stresses that a shift to bilateral/regional agreements would lead to unequal and less transparent negotiations, often putting the poorer countries at a disadvantage.
The EP therefore urges a strong commitment of all major players, including the EU, the US and the G-20, to come to a balanced agreement on each of the Round’s main negotiation topics, putting development at the heart of the conclusions and further evaluating the outcome in order to ensure that the DDA ultimately results in meaningful and sustainable economic gains, particularly for the developing countries; stresses that, in order fully to implement the Doha mandate, the positive achievements of the negotiations must be preserved and offers made to date on various elements of the negotiating agenda should form the basis of the negotiations.
The EP underlines the need for institutional reforms of the WTO enhancing the accountability and democratic legitimacy of the negotiations and organisation. MEPs are convinced that the multilateral process based on the bottom-up and transparent approach should be at the core of the negotiations. MEPs also stress at the same time the need for an inclusive process involving all members. Text adopted

Counterfeiting of medicines: MEPs want improved access to affordable medicines
2006-09-11 - 12:36
In adopting a resolution on the counterfeiting of medicinal products, MEPs consider that the European Community should equip itself as a matter of urgency with the means to combat effectively illicit practices in the area of piracy and the counterfeiting of medicines.
The House calls on the EU to take steps to strengthen the regulatory and quality-control capacity for medicinal products and medical equipment put on the market in countries with inadequate resources and to improve access to affordable medicines.
The House calls on the Commission to go beyond its communication 'Strategy to enforce intellectual property rights in third countries.' MEPs in particular, urge the European Union to take adequate measures to combat the scourge of counterfeiting of medicines in its territory. Parliament urges the European Union to play a key role in promoting an international convention to create a specific criminal offence of counterfeiting or the receiving and distribution of counterfeit medicines in the legislation of every country.
MEPs also call for greater cooperation at both national and international level between the various authorities involved in anti-counterfeiting measures. Finally, the House emphasises the importance of preventive measures in action programmes, more specifically, the establishment of structures, cooperation, awareness campaigns, preferably carried out by the public authorities, and finally the political will to carry through such measures successfully.

Human rights: Sri Lanka, North Korean refugees in Thailand, Zimbabwe
2006-09-11 - 12:36
At the close of the plenary week in Strasbourg, Parliament adopted three resolutions on the continuing violence in Sri Lanka, the plight of North Korean refugees in Thailand and the situation in Zimbabwe.
Sri Lanka
In its resolution on Sri Lanka, Parliament highlights the deteriorating situation in the country, the results of which have been "hundreds of deaths, 200,000 people displaced from their homes, 500,000 civilians in Jaffna deprived of essential food and water supplies and vital post-tsunami reconstruction disrupted".
MEPs deplore the resumption of large-scale violence and they level criticism at both sides in the conflict, the Tamil Tigers (LTTE) and government forces, saying that "elements on both sides of the divide in Sri Lanka are intent on conflict" and insisting that "they pull back from the brink".
Among other things, MEPs point to the bombing, apparently by the LTTE, of a bus in a land-mine attack on 15 June that killed 64 people as well as the shooting, apparently by government forces, of 17 Sri Lankans working for the NGO Action against Hunger.
The resolution stresses "the need for Government forces engaged in counter-insurgency and domestic security operations to exercise maximum restraint in order to minimise any risk of innocent civilian casualties". It also repeats the EP's "condemnation of the appalling abuse of children through the recruitment of child soldiers, which is a war crime, and calls on all rebel groups to stop this practice". The "intransigence of the LTTE leadership over the years" is also criticised.
MEPs regret the breakdown of peace negotiations and underscore the need for a human rights agreement between the parties. They call on "all parties to the conflict to guarantee the security of the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission", which has recently felt obliged to withdraw some of its monitors following a demand by the LTTE that all EU nationals be excluded from the SLMM. The government and the LTTE are urged to "grant unhindered access for humanitarian aid workers, UN organisations and truce monitors".
While calling on the Sri Lankan government and other parties to "take robust action against terrorism", MEPs also urge them to address legitimate Tamil grievances, for example an "early revision of the Constitution of Sri Lanka…to define the state as a secular, democratic republic in which all religions are respected". They welcome the Sri Lankan president's "commitment to maximum devolution for the Tamil peoples" and call for this to be given substance.
Lastly, the resolution voices concern that "although the EU has allocated almost €125 million in post-tsunami humanitarian aid and reconstruction aid for Sri Lanka" enduring political gridlock is delaying the release of a further €50 million, thereby hindering vital reconstruction work.
North Korean asylum seekers in Thailand
In this resolution Parliament notes that in recent years "tens of thousands of North Koreans have fled from their home country because of repression and widespread hunger" and that some have risked their lives to reach other countries, including Thailand, which has become a transit destination for such refugees.
The Thai authorities are keen to enforce the law on illegal immigration and on 22 August arrested a group of 175 asylum seekers in Bangkok. These people were taken to court, fined and then jailed because they were unable to pay the fines.
The European Parliament's response is first to deplore the situation whereby thousands of North Koreans flee their country because of the conditions there. However, MEPs go on to urge the Thai authorities "not to repatriate the North Korean refugees, since they and their families will face dire consequences".
Indeed, they call on Thailand, in view of its "long tradition of hospitality towards refugees" and as a "responsible member of the international community" to seek a solution by sending the refugees to a third country of their choice after their 30-day jail sentence expires. Parliament also "calls on countries able to take the refugees to make this known at the earliest opportunity to ensure that they are not kept in detention".
Lastly, the Council and Commission are asked to bring up this question at the ASEM summit on 10 and 11 September.
Zimbabwe
Not for the first time, MEPs feel compelled to draw attention to the situation in Zimbabwe. In its resolution the EP "condemns the Mugabe dictatorship for its relentless oppression of the Zimbabwean people and expresses its profound disappointment at the refusal of regional actors such as the AU, the SADC and South Africa to take a more robust stance".
MEPs highlight the plight of "those forced out of their homes during the atrocious 'Operation Murumbatsvina' campaign" and what they say is "one of the world's worst HIV-AIDS epidemics, with over 3,200 people a week dying from the disease".
Parliament refuses to recognise the recently created 'Senate' in Zimbabwe as a mere 15 per cent of Zimbabweans voted in an election process guaranteed to favour Zanu-PF.
MEPs voice "consternation at the regime's covert attempts to take control of the Zimbabwe Red Cross Society" and the impact this could have on many vulnerable Zimbabweans who receive vital assistance from it.
Parliament regrets the split in the opposition MDC and calls on all those opposed to the regime to come together to bring about change for the better in the country.
The resolution recognises that the EU's targeted sanctions "have failed to have the desired impact" and asks the Council "to ensure that all Member States rigorously apply existing restrictive measures".
MEPs deplore the regime's lavish spending on military aircraft from China as well as on vehicles for senior army officers. In an appeal to China itself, MEPs urge it and other countries to desist from supplying weapons and other support to the Mugabe regime.
Parliament also "insists that all aid destined for Zimbabwe must be delivered through genuine non-governmental organisations". It asks the Commission to give assurances that none of the aid provided by the EU for seven major projects benefited the Mugabe regime.
The resolution also suggests that Zimbabwe be excluded from any involvement in the 2010 World Cup - which is to be held in South Africa - a point which generated some debate among MEPs, who in the end voted in favour of the idea. Text adopted
