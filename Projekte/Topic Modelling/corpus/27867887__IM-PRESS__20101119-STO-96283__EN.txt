Â©BELGA UN Goals on poverty, parent / child mortality on agenda Security situation in parts of Africa also being debated One of the few Parliamentary assemblies bringing together MPs from Europe, Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific will meet in the Kinshasa this week. MEPs from the European Parliament will be there to discuss issues ranging from mortality among mothers and the UN's Millennium Development Goals on poverty reduction to security in the Sahel and Sahara region of Africa. The situation of the host nation - the Democratic Republic of Congo will also be discussed.
The meeting from 2-4 December is the 20th meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly and brings together elected representatives from almost 80 countries.
During last week's plenary session, MEPs scrutinised a report by the head of the Parliament's Development Committee, Eva Joly, on progress over the last year.
New ways of funding development?
In adopting a parliamentary resolution, MEPs called for the ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly to continue monitoring Economic Partnership Agreements between developed and developing countries, which can play such a crucial part in opening up markets.
The EP also argues that the Parliamentary Assembly should examine other ways of funding development aid - notably through a possible financial transaction tax.
Finally it restated the European Parliament's long standing demand that the European Development Fund (EDF) be incorporated into the EU budget "to guarantee democratic scrutiny".
