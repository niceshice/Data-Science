State of union address Wednesday Less horse trading, more transparency for future economic governance
Parliament will vote on the economic governance "six-pack", which aims to prevent Eurozone members from simply ignoring Commission warnings to correct their budgetary policies and make them tackle economic imbalances more promptly. The package would greatly enhance overall transparency and accountability, and should also improve the quality and accuracy of statistics, by ensuring that they are gathered independently.
MEPs to debate Palestine's bid for statehood at the UN
Parliament votes Thursday on a resolution on developments in Palestine. On Tuesday afternoon, MEPs will debate UN General Assembly work, inter alia on the Middle East peace process and developments in North Africa, with EU foreign policy High Representative Catherine Ashton.
Boosting trade with the Palestinian Authority
Parliament votes Tuesday on a trade agreement that aims to boost the Palestinian economy, and help build the Palestinian state, by enabling the Palestinian Territories to export farm and fisheries products to the EU directly, rather than via Israel, from early 2012.
Barroso to give State of the Union address in Parliament
President José Manuel Barroso will set out the European Commission's strategic priorities in his annual State of the Union address to Parliament on Wednesday. There will then be a debate in which MEPs set out their thoughts on and requests for the future work of the Union. The Commission will approve its work programme for 2012 in October.
Plenary to debate Eurozone issues with Jean-Claude Juncker
MEPs will press Eurogroup President Jean-Claude Juncker for his thoughts on the Eurozone's most pressing problems, and their long-run solutions, in a plenary debate on Tuesday at 15.00h.
Tougher times ahead for Commissioners
To make Commissioners' question time more dynamic, MEPs will no longer table their questions in advance. From now on, three or more Commissioners will answer questions on a specific topic for a full 90 minutes. The topic for Tuesday, 27 September is "EU trade and third country relations", with Commissioners De Gucht, Füle, Georgieva, and Piebalgs.
Rio+20 sustainable development targets
The EU should push for a global renewable energy target and other "accountable" sustainable development goals at next year's UN Rio+20 summit, says a draft resolution to be put to a vote on Thursday.
Future of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund
MEPs vote Thursday on an Employment and Social Affairs Committee resolution proposing that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) should have a specific budget line, to enable it to provide aid faster to sacked workers.

Main challenges for EU trade
Debate on trade Tuesday morning ©BELGA/AFP/R.Magunia Debate Tuesday morning Question time with Commission on external trade External trade remains a major element in the EU economy, but as the world changes so should trade policy if it is to remain effective, according to a report by German Christian Democrat Daniel Caspary that outlines the challenges facing EU trade policy in the future. It aims to add a long-term strategy to a communication from the European Commission, says the MEP. It was discussed in plenary Tuesday.
So, what are the key challenges?
As the centre of gravity of the world economy moves towards emerging markets, the share of the EU and US in global GDP is declining . It is estimated to fall to 35% in 2020 from 48% in 2000. Exports are also falling. The EU accounted for 19% of global exports in 1999, dropping to 17% in 2009.
Demographic changes : The EU population is still growing, but is expected to start declining after 2035 and the working population has already begun to decrease.
High dependence on trade : in the EU 36 million jobs, accounting for 18% of the total, are linked to external trade. In 2009 exports were valued €1.6 trillion, 13% of gross national income. By 2015, 90% of world growth will be generated outside the EU, reinforcing the bloc's dependence on trade.
How do we answer these challenges?
"Exports are the best prerequisite for more economic growth and to secure jobs. That's why the Commission should propose a new strategy about how the EU can remain the biggest exporter of goods and services," Mr Caspary said.
He said the Commission communication isn't focused enough on the long-term and "lacks a strategy about how to better link trade policies with foreign and development policies. The Commission should see the strengthening of external trade as a priority". Among the proposals in the Caspary report are:
the consideration of other policy areas (including human rights, climate change, labour rights) in trade policy
more free trade agreements
more high-level dialogue with major trading partners like the US, China, Russia and Japan to eliminate trade barriers.

European disaster response - more efficient, simpler, leaner?
Focus should be on prevention ©BELGA/MaxPPP As the EU, and the world, faces an increasing number of disasters, Italian EPP member Elisabetta Gardini is calling for more effective and coordinated disaster management and simplification of the "too bureaucratic" European Civil Protection Mechanism. In a report discussed and voted Tuesday, Ms Gardini calls on the European Commission to come up with proposals for an EU Civil Protection Force based on the Emergency Response Centre.
Worldwide, over the past 35 years the recorded number of annual disasters has risen fivefold to almost 400. In Europe alone over the past 20 years, such disasters have killed around 90,000, affected the lives of more than 29 million and caused €211 billion in damage.
Ms Gardini says more efficiency is needed at all stages of disaster management, including prevention, preparedness, response and recovery. She notes that it is particularly important to optimise resources during times of austerity.
The report underlines the need for better coordination to avoid duplication of effort and to ensure rapid and effective help for victims of disasters. It also highlights the need for greater solidarity among member states and says the focus should be on prevention as that is far more cost-effective than combating disaster.
The report calls for more research into the causes of droughts and forest fires. Report on disaster response (own initiative) Elisabetta Gardini
Opening of Strasbourg plenary session
Opening President Jerzy Buzek opened the plenary by looking forward to the economic governance "six pack" vote, question time with EuroGroup President Jean-Claude Juncker, and Commission President José Manuel Barroso's State of the Union address. He also mentioned the Eastern Partnership debate with High Representative Catherine Ashton, welcomed Council President Herman Van Rompuy's first UN Assembly address on the EU's behalf, and condemned the executions of Troy Davis and Alireza Molla-Soltani.
That the "six pack" is ready for a vote on Wednesday, after a year's negotiations, is a "great triumph", which "demonstrates that the Community method is a good way to deal with the crisis", said Mr Buzek, adding that the crisis had highlighted the need to process some legislation faster.
Tuesday's question time with eurogroup President Jean-Claude Juncker would give MEPs a "new means to represent citizens", by putting their questions about the crisis to him, said Mr Buzek.
Turning to Wednesday's State of the Union address, Mr Buzek said that he was expecting further legislation to counter the crisis.
The debate with foreign policy High Representative Ashton, in the run-up to the 29-30 September Eastern Partnership Summit in Warsaw would be another opportunity for MEPs to demonstrate their awareness of the seriousness of the problems facing citizens, he added.
Executions of Troy Davis and Alireza Molla-Soltani
Mr Buzek condemned the execution in the US of Troy Davis on 21 September. Capital punishment is "inhuman and unacceptable" in any circumstances, said Mr Buzek, reiterating Parliament's opposition to the death penalty.
At the same time, Mr Buzek condemned the execution in Iran, on the same day, of 17-year old Alireza Molla-Soltani, adding that executing minors breaches international law.
Resignations and new arrivals
Mr Buzek announced the resignation of Daniël van der Stoep (NI, NL), who will be replaced by Auke Zijlstra.
Former MEP Eva-Britt Svensson, who had already resigned, will be replaced by Mikael Gustafsson (GUE/NGL, SE) Final draft agenda Plenary Newsletter

Road safety: 103 measures to halve road accident deaths by 2020
aim is "zero death toll" ©BELGA/PHOTONONSTOP The EU should promote the use of alcolocks on commercial goods and passenger vehicles and seek an EU-wide 30 km/h speed limit in residential areas, says a resolution approved by a show of hands on Tuesday. Parliament calls for a new road safety action plan as a matter of urgency, and recommends harmonising road traffic rules, road signs, roadworthiness tests and blood alcohol limits.
A "zero death toll" is the long-run aim that guided Parliament's rapporteur Dieter-Lebrecht Koch (EPP, DE) in drafting a resolution that aims to reduce road deaths by half, serious injuries by 40% and child deaths by 60% between 2010 and 2020.
"The choice of measures and their assessment should be a scientific process, based on comparable, high-quality data, definitions and statistics", said Mr Koch in the debate, adding that "We expect a harmonised analysis of the causes of accidents and injuries and an EU-wide exchange of data which respects a high standard of data privacy".
MEPs call on the European Commission to appoint an EU road safety co-ordinator to help Member States to put the action plan into effect.
The proposed measures are set out in a background note (link below).

Parliament approves deal to boost trade with Palestinian Authority
West Bank, Gaza to export farm, fish products direct to EU in 2012 ©BELGA/ZUMAPRESS Parliament voted today to approve a trade agreement that will help boost the Palestinian economy by enabling the West Bank and Gaza to expand exports of farm and fisheries products to the EU from early 2012.
The agreement between the EU and the Palestinian Authority grants duty-free and mostly quota-free access to the European market for agricultural and fisheries products from the West Bank and Gaza Strip and provides access to Palestinian markets for some European produce.
"This agreement offers an opportunity for the Palestinian people, a first step towards the development of a nation", said EP rapporteur Maria Eleni Koppa (S&D, EL) during the debate. She emphasized that the deal complied with the rules of origin and that this should ensure that the Palestinian economy will benefit fully from the expansion in trade.
MEPs believe that opening EU markets to Palestinian products, which have up to now been under the direct control of the Israeli customs authorities, will help the Palestinian people expand their economy. Now that it has Parliament´s approval, the agreement can enter into force early next year.
The Palestinian Authority is at present the EU's smallest trading partner in the Euro-Mediterranean region and one of the smallest worldwide. Total trade amounted to EUR 56.6 million in 2009, of which EUR 50.5 million were EU exports. Imports to the EU from the Palestinian Authority amounted to EUR 6.1 million in 2009, with agricultural products making up 70.1 per cent of this total. Imports rose, however, by 32.6 per cent in the first three months of 2010.
The import conditions are valid for a period of 10 years, which can be extended. In the unlikely event that Palestinian imports of agricultural products and fisheries products increase to a point at which they distort the EU's internal market, the EU can adopt safeguard measures.

Palestinian case: controversial issue within Parliament
Israel and the West Bank ©UN/OCHA On 23 September Palestine applied for UN membership. Its request for recognition of Palestinian statehood is controversial, with some seeing it as a legitimate step, while others regard it as provocation. The US has already opposed it and the EU is divided. We asked Proinsias De Rossa, the head of the Delegation for relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council, and Bastiaan Belder, the head of the Israel Delegation, for their opinions.
How should the UN react to this request, should it back a state with pre-1967 borders?
De Rossa : It is likely that the UN will say "no" if it comes to a formal vote because the US has said it will veto such an application. But what is the justification? There is no justification in international law, no justification in morality. There is no contradiction between being a member of the UN and negotiations about the final status for Palestine.
In terms of what the borders will be, President Obama himself outlined what should be the basis of a solution: the 1967 Green line with land swaps. The Palestinians have said "yes" to that, Netanyahu has said "no". The obstacle is on the Israeli side.
Belder : First, for whom is (president of the Palestinian Authority) Mahmoud Abbas speaking? Hamas said very clearly that they don't share his position. So is he a real peace partner for Israel? There is reconciliation but there is still no unified government. Second, what legitimacy does a president that postpoed several elections have?
Furthermore, it's a fundamental problem for me that Mahmoud Abbas refuses to speak about a two-state solution, with a Jewish State next to the Palestinian state. He took a unilateral step, not backed by the whole Palestinian people. It is a propaganda offensive by the Palestinian Authority that is in my view entirely weak and divided.
What would UN recognition change for the people of Palestine?
Belder : That is the big problem, should it really bring a change? Mahmoud Abbas wants to use an upgrading, for example an observer status like the Vatican, to file accusations at the International Criminal Court. Again - that is confrontation not peace.
Abbas said that he was going to the UN because after all these decades there is no real peace proposal. But twice in 2000 Yasser Arafat refused far-reaching peace proposals as did Mr Abbas in 2008.
De Rossa: It changes their sense of who they are, it grants them the dignity of being part of the international family of nations. At the moment they are referred to in the UN as an entity. Given that the Palestinians agreed more than 20 years ago that they would accept the Green line as the border with Israel, accounting for 22% of the original Palestinian territory before partition in 1947, they should be given a seat in the UN.
It also gives the Palestinians negotiators equal status. There is clearly a mismatch in terms of power and resources, in favour of the Israeli side.
The EU is the biggest donor to the Palestinian Authority. What position should it take an can a common position be achieved?
De Rossa : So far unfortunately no EU common position has been found. It's a mistake for some member states to believe that it has to be a choice between membership of the UN and negotiations.
When I talk to Palestinians, their only question is when negotiations will resume. Their land is being taken by Israeli settlers - as a Palestinian explained: it's like negotiating the sharing of a pizza when the other party keeps eating the pizza.
It's clear from Obama's speech last week that the Palestinians can't expect more concessions from the US before the American elections. The EU should take the lead now and to act as a mediator. All the member states want an independent Palestinian State to be established on the basis of negotiations. They have all acknowledged the enormous progress that Abbas and (prime minister) Fayyad have made in terms of putting institutions in place. We all must be united in bringing starting negotiations and bringing them to a conclusion.
Belder : The EU signed the Oslo agreements, which clearly said that there should not be any unilateral step by any party. The EU should stick to its position and to the negotiation table, and unambiguously call on the Palestinians to sit down with the Israelis. Look at what happened when the Quartet (UN, US, EU and Russia) called for: negotiations. Israel accepted and the Palestinians refused. They are now reconsidering it and I hope that they will come back to the negotiation table.
The issue was debated in plenary with High Representative Catherine Ashton Tuesday afternoon. Proinsias De Rossa (left) and Bastiaan Belder (right) Bastiaan Belder Proinsias De Rossa Jerzy Buzek in Gaza (17/06/2011)
MEPs want help for tourism sector as key for growth, employment
Call for a "European quality tourism label" ©BELGA/Belpress September 27 was World Tourism Day and the European Parliament marked the occasion with a call for a "European quality tourism label" and efforts to promote Europe as the world's top tourism destination.
Tourism accounts for 10% of GDP and 12% of total employment in the EU, much of it generated by EU citizens, and the report by Italian EPP member Carlo Fidanza on Tourism in Europe calls on the EU to promote quality tourism as a way to create local jobs. It calls for EU subsidies to help rehabilitate declining areas, innovate and roll out high-quality services that build on a multicultural heritage.
Among the proposals are:
creation of a "European quality tourism label"
identification of common quality criteria
a "European Tourism Card", with a common set of passengers' rights
harmonisation of the accommodation classification and reduced VAT rate for tourism.
"We have good tourist numbers despite the difficult economic situation...tourism is doing better than other sectors (because) this wealth can't be shifted to other parts of the world," Mr Fidanza said during a press conference following the adoption of his report. "It is up to us to support the competiveness of our companies and find the right tools to allow for growth."
Environment, jobs
MEPs also called for a reduction in the impact of tourism on the environment . They want the European Commission to promote better planning, particularly in coastal areas, and encourage the use of environmentally-friendly transport. They also want the EU executive to come up with an integrated strategy to encourage tourism by 2012 that raises awareness of culture, history, religion and nature while offering new services in the fields of sport, promoting industrial heritage and farm tourism.
Together with rapid, EU-wide access to the internet this would allow: the creation of sustainable jobs, reduce undeclared work and counter the rural exodus and problems arising from the seasonal nature of the work, say MEPs. Europe and tourism * in 2010, EU residents made 1 billion trips, 75% of which were domestic local tourism in Romania, Spain, Greece, Bulgaria over 90% Dutch, Slovenes, Belgians, Luxembourgers spend most holidays abroad Spain, Italy, Greece attract more than 50% of foreign tourists Lisbon Treaty made tourism EU competence *source: Eurostat Press release Video of the debate European Tourism Day Eurostat news release about European Tourism Day
State of the Union: Barroso warns of dangers of fragmented Europe
Barroso strongly reaffirms EU vision, method We must not allow the achievement of a united Europe to be called into question, European Commission President José Manuel Barroso warned in his State of the Union address to MEPs Wednesday, pointing out that the horrors of the world wars of the previous century are now unimaginable, the EU being a guarantee of peace on the continent. MEPs largely supported Mr Barroso's view that more economic government and less intergovernmental bickering is the right response to the crisis.
" Greece will remain a member of the euro area ," Mr Barroso said, noting that a belief in a common currency without closer economic governance leading to economic union was an illusion. Should stability or growth take precedence? We need both, he said.
With European taxpayers having given €4.6 trillion in aid and guarantees to the financial sector, it is now time for the latter to make its contribution, Mr Barroso said. That is why the Commission is now proposing the introduction of a financial transaction tax , a long-standing demand of the Parliament, which is expected to generate €55 billion a year, and is also exploring the introduction of eurobonds.
He characterised youth unemployment as the most urgent social issue. As citizens we all gain through Europe, whether studying or working abroad, and that is why the Commission will not tolerate a rolling back of freedoms, such as free circulation of people, Mr Barroso promised.
For the EPP Joseph Daul said problems arose because the euro was not equipped with the means to govern it and countries lived beyond their means for decades. The "six pack" is a step in the right direction but the EU should also focus on growth and invest in training, education and help smaller companies, he said. The only way out is through a common EU response, not agreements between governments, he added.
Socialist leader Martin Schulz agreed. "Challenges cannot be met by capitals acting alone, we have to act as community through the institutions. Pro-European groups are called to act together." He said the EU is in "a crisis of management and leadership " and called on governments to swiftly finalise rules for financial market regulation.
The crisis is not about Greece, but about the euro and the EU, Liberal leader Guy Verhofstadt said. "Are we able to stand united in this crisis," he said. The intergovernmental method is not working, the "only way out is a new transfer of powers to EU," he said, proposing the creation of an EU minister of finance .
However, Jan Zahradil for the conservative ECR group said people don't like power moving from member states to the EU. The euro was imposed on economies that were too diverse, for political and ideological reasons, he said. "Maintaining the euro at any cost will destroy the euro." In addition, he warned that a financial transaction tax will cause businesses to leave EU .
EFD leader Nigel Farage also opposed the idea of giving more power to the EU and replacing national government by the community method. He said there are many presidents in the EU, many of them unelected by the populace. "When you take away any democratic accountability nobody is in charge," he said.
Greens leader Rebecca Harms said the economic governance package is a step in the right direction, but does not properly address the balance between stability and growth. We have to fight poverty, invest in education, training and sustainable economic growth otherwise there will be no backing from the majority of our citizens, she said.
Billions of euros were pumped in banks, and now people are footing the bill, working more for lower wages, where is social justice now, Lothar Bisky said for the GUE/NGL group. Solidarity is not just about handouts but also resisting obsessive budget cuts by the governments, he said.
For the Polish Presidency of the Council Mikołaj Dowgielewicz said the need to restore EU growth is a shared concern of the institutions. He called the vote on the six pack "a milestone on our way out of the debt crisis and towards more fiscal and economic control". He added, "the message here is: the community method works and the sceptics can be proven wrong." Video of the debate Our Twitter coverage Our feature on economic governance Flickr Barroso's speech
Parliament gives green light to future economic governance plans
vote was close Eurozone members will no longer be able simply to ignore Commission warnings to correct their budgetary policies. The economic governance legislation voted in plenary on Wednesday should also help ensure that countries tackle unsound economic policies more promptly, considerably increases transparency and accountability and will improve the compilation of statistics to make them more reliable and accurate.
As expected, the plenary vote was tight with left-of-centre groups abstaining and voting against some parts of the deal for fear that the package is overly focused on budgetary correction, to the detriment of growth and employment. On the part of the package dealing with macroeconomic imbalances, a large majority was obtained because centre-left groups felt that an adequate balance had been struck between social and financial imperatives.
ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet had congratulated EP negotiators a week earlier for resisting attempts to water down the package: "If I compare the deal to the initial proposals, there is substantial improvement. I have to pay homage to the Parliament for this."
More details on the deal are available in an FAQ published separately.
Less horse trading, more responsibility
The vote came two weeks after certain Member States, led by France, climbed down from their insistence that a warning to a country would require approval by the Council. MEPs feared that this would lead to back-room deals in which countries needing to reform their budgetary policies would be let off the hook.
Instead, the agreement will force Eurozone governments to muster a majority to block a warning being issued. Neither can the governments opt to do nothing, since such a warning will in any event be issued if the vote is not taken within 10 days of it being proposed by the Commission. And if governments do vote to reject a warning, they will need to explain themselves to the European Parliament in public.
Public hearings and macroeconomic surveillance
Parliament also won the right to invite finance ministers from countries that have received a warning to hearings. Member States long insisted that this should not be the case.
MEPs also negotiated that the Commission would look not only at countries with a trade deficit, but also at those running current account surpluses, when investigating the sources of macroeconomic instability. Member States had initially insisted that only current account deficit countries would be investigated. The agreed rules will therefore require the Commission to consider the possibility that countries like Germany or the Netherlands are a cause of instability and reforms could be asked of them too.
Other improvements by Parliament
Apart from the issues settled, many other improvements were brought about by pressure from MEPs.
Some of the most important improvements are:
putting into law the European semester (annual assessment of national budgets for economic policy coordination), through its inclusion in the legal texts. This will give the procedure much more weight and bite,
establishing a legal framework for the surveillance of the national reform programmes
increased powers for the Commission, which can ask for more information to be supplied to it than envisaged in the original proposals and through on the spot checks to Member States,
A new fine (0.2% GDP) for Eurozone members which supply fraudulent statistics with regard to data on deficits and debt,
an interest-bearing deposit sanction (0.1% GDP) for Eurozone members in cases where a Member State fails to act on recommendations to rectify a macroeconomic imbalance.
greater independence of statistical bodies and standards for the compilation of statistics, and
safeguarding social bargaining processes and wage setting agreements when delivering recommendations.
Background: the package in a nutshell
Firstly, the "six-pack" gives more bite to the current stability and growth pact (SGP), so as to control deficits and debt levels better and from an earlier stage.
Secondly, it innovates, by aiming to oblige policy makers to act swiftly to restore the health of economies that are threatened by macro-economic imbalances, such as house-price bubbles or loss of competitiveness. Both these aims are to be achieved through preventive action, primarily warnings, and corrective action, in the form of sanctions.
Thirdly, the rules aim to ensure that the statistics vital to sound budgetary policy-making and budget monitoring are more accurate, inter alia by having them gathered more independently.
Besides these three key goals, the "six-pack" is also designed, specifically at the insistence of MEPs, to improve transparency and accountability across the board and to increase the powers of the Commission.

Overcoming obstacles to trade with EU key to Palestine's development
EU should use its economic leverage to forward negotiations Being able to tap the EU market with its 500 million consumers would greatly help the economic development of Palestine and on Tuesday MEPs backed an agreement with the Palestinian Authority giving fish and farm products from the Palestinian territories duty-free access to the EU. Israel has long profited from its trade links with the EU; the Parliament now seeks to extend such opportunities to the Palestinians.
The 2011 UNCTAD report on the Palestinian economy describes the bleak "reality of worsening long-term development prospects, caused by the ongoing loss of Palestinian land and natural resources, isolation from global markets, and fragmentation."
Greek Socialist Maria Eleni Koppa , guided the trade agreement between the EU and the Palestinian Authority through the EP and explained that far from being destined for export "much of the agricultural produce, especially in exceptionally poor regions like the Gaza Strip, is geared towards subsistence farming" where even "survival is a daunting task".
Other trade barriers
Ms Koppa said there are also obstacles to trade posed by " non-tariff barriers ", like check points, imposed by Israel on Palestinian exports that lead to high transaction costs and restrictions on the free movement of products.
Israel has "legitimate security concerns, but there are also human rights standards", she said. "If ever Israel needed to demonstrate good will, it is in the current political context" regarding a more trade-friendly environment for Palestine, she added.
"Made in Israel"
The EP report highlights the problem of the status of goods from Israeli settlements in the occupied territories. Goods produced by factories and businesses in the settlements have been classified as "made in Israel", allowing them to qualify for tariff-free access to the EU market, a practice ruled out by the European Court of Justice in February 2010.
"Marketing studies indicate a sizeable part of public opinion is opposed to consuming products from the settlements," Ms Koppa said. People should be provided with clear information about what they consume, "it is every citizen’s duty to vote with their pocket," she said. The establishment of an EU control mechanism over the origin of the products would help, she added.
The EU is Israel's biggest trading partner , importing 29% of all Israeli exports. Under the EU-Israel association agreement Israeli products largely enter the EU market tariff-free. A human rights clause in the agreement says the "respect for human rights and democratic principles" is an "essential element".
Finding a way forward
"Antagonizing Israeli public opinion or delivering threats is not the way forward for anyone familiar with the domestic political scene," but the EU could use its economic leverage to push negotiations forward, Ms Koppa said.
"It's hard to establish a political environment conducive to negotiation when the spectrum of hunger is haunting your constituency...(so) empowering Palestinians to survive, doing something to ameliorate the economic welfare of people living in absolute poverty, would do much for Israel’s moral authoritiy," she said.

Parliament supports Palestine's "legitimate" bid for statehood
Support for two-state solution. ©Platt/Getty Images/AFP Parliament called Palestine's bid for statehood "legitimate" in a resolution passed on Thursday, and said that a solution should be found within a year. MEPs believe, however, that Palestinian statehood should result from negotiations, during the current UN General Assembly session.
"The right of Palestinians to self-determination and to have their own state is unquestionable, as is the right of Israel to exist within safe borders", says the resolution, adopted by a show of hands.
1967 borders, Jerusalem as capital
Parliament reiterates its strong support for the two-state solution on the basis of the 1967 borders with Jerusalem as capital of both states, and stresses that direct negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians should resume without delay.
The resolution underlines that "no changes to the pre-1967 borders, including with regard to Jerusalem, other than those agreed by the parties should be accepted".
Common EU position needed
Parliament calls on the EU's foreign affairs High Representative and Member States to find a common EU position on the Palestinian request and to avoid divisions among Member States. MEPs also underline that Member States and the international community should reconfirm their strong commitment to the security of the Israel.
Stop settlement construction
Parliament calls on the Israeli Government to stop all construction and extension of settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. MEPs also insist that rocket attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip should cease and a permanent truce should be agreed.

EP ushers are always perfectly dressed during plenary Eurogroup president Jean-Claude Juncker meets EP President Jerzy Buzek Road safety: 103 measures to halve road accident deaths by 2020 High Representative Catherine Ashton debated Palestine and other issues with MEPs A determined-looking President Barroso arrives at the EP to deliver his state of the union address MEPs generally welcomed Mr Barroso's proposals A smiling Mr Barroso appreciates MEPs' comments Voting in favour of the economic governance packaage Economic six-pack rapporteurs face the press after the vote Snapping a photo to be tweeted José Manuel Barroso announced a proposal to tax financial transactions during his "State of the Union" address to Parliament, a high point of September's second plenary session. MEPs also approved stricter budgetary surveillance for member state while, Palestine was also in the spotlight. Read about these and other subjects dealt with during the plenary.
The introduction of an EU-wide financial transaction tax was the centrepiece of Commission President Barroso's state of the union speech on Wednesday, in which he defended the EU as the guarantor of peace and stability in Europe. Most political groups warmly welcomed his proposals, condemning member state efforts to combat the crisis outside the EU institutional framework.
Following intense negotiations, MEPs approved the economic governance "six-pack" on stronger budgetary surveillance, which should limit the ability of member states to ignore eurozone public finance rules.
MEPs discussed the situation in the Middle East after the Palestinian Authority applied for UN membership and, thus, recognition of a Palestinian state. Some MEPs expressed support, others emphasised Israel's desire for security and most speakers called for a resumption of peace negotiations. MEPs also approved a deal that should boost Palestinian exports of farm and fisheries products to the EU.
More than 35,000 people were killed in road accidents in the EU in 2009. "Alcolocks" on commercial goods and passenger vehicles and an EU-wide 30 km/h speed limit in residential areas, are among the 103 road safety measures proposed by the EP to halve road deaths by 2020.
Parliament revised EU rules on exports of products with both civilian and military use, such as chemicals, telecommunication devices and software. MEPs won an undertaking that no general export authorisation will be given to " dual-use " technologies that can be used to violate human rights.
EU-financed food aid to more than 13 million poor Europeans has run into trouble after the European Court of Justice declared the current mode of operation illegal. The Commission has had to cut projected spending for 2012 to €113.5 million from the €480 million originally planned. MEPs urged Council and Commission to act and criticised six member states for blocking efforts at a compromise.
Homosexuality, bisexuality and trans-sexuality are still seen by some as a mental illness. In a resolution, MEP's called for an end to the discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity suffered by lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.
MEPs expressed concern at the rising tensions between Turkey and Cyprus in a dispute over oil and gas exploration. They condemned Turkey's threats and stressed that a threat against one member state is a threat against the whole EU.
There was a lively debate Thursday morning over the technical parameters of body scanners at airports in the EU. MEPs are concerned they might reveal too much.
MEP voted on a resolution setting out a common EU position for next year's UN Rio +20 summit . MEPs want a strong and unified EU approach for the sustainable development summit next June. The plenary in photos EP on facebook Check us out on Twitter
