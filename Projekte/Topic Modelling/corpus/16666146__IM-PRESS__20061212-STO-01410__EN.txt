Monday, 11 December, the last Plenary of 2006 begins
The last Strasbourg Plenary session of the year was opened yesterday by Parliament's President Josep Borrell. After the traditional "1 minute" speeches by some individual MEPs, the Chamber moved on to discuss the long running and complex REACH chemicals package - a final vote on this is due Wednesday. MEPs also debated compensation for banana growers. Today sees the awarding of the Sakharov prize and a debate on the "Television Without Frontiers" directive.
Tuesday: development, groundwater, Sakharov, TV
Today begins with a debate on financing development cooperation for the next six years. Following this MEPs will debate hygienic standards for groundwater in the European Union.
With just two weeks before Romania and Bulgaria join the EU, their nominees to sit on the European Commission - the EU's executive - will be put to the vote by MEPs. It follows an earlier question and answer session between them and MEPs.
Later in the day the MEPs will debate the EU's € 115.5 billion euro budget for next year. A vote follows Thursday.
At midday the much awaited Sakharov Prize 2006 will be presented to Belarus Opposition leader Alexander Milinkevich by President Borrell.
In the afternoon the debates will focus on the advertising rules for TV channels in Europe, including a new approach to product placement. In the evening the House will debate the Commission's proposal to establish the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF). This initiative aims to provide up to €500 million to help workers made redundant by globalisation find new jobs.
Wednesday: EU enlargement, European Council, driving licences
The ever increasing numbers of EU members and how the Union will cope as it enlarges is debated on Wednesday morning. Also discussed by MEPs will be the agenda of EU leaders who are due to meet on Thursday. Enlargement of the EU and justice and home affairs issues are expected to dominate the summit.
Later, proposals for an EU wide driving licence to replace the over 100 in existence will be discussed at their second reading.
Thursday: climate change, human rights
The last day of the last plenary of 2006 is made up of two issues that have been in the news during the year - climate change and human rights.
A report on setting binding targets for the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and on increasing the use of renewable energy sources will be tabled by British Socialist MEP Eluned Morgan.
The Thursday afternoon debate will reflect on three human rights issues: the situation in Fiji, the alleged involvement of UN forces in sexual abuse while on mission in Liberia and Haiti and the situation in Burma.
