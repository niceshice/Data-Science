The post–Mubarak era is dawning and 80 million Egyptians face the complex task of establishing a new democratic order which could inspire the entire region. Parliament discussed the extraordinary developments in the Arab world, the high hopes for the future but also the fears that can't be ignored in this "democratic tsunami" as one MEP described it during Wednesday's debate (16 February).
On behalf of Catherine Ashton the Commissioner for Enlargement and Neighbourhood Policy, Štefan Füle , announced an extraordinary meeting of EU Foreign Ministers this coming Saturday ahead of her visit to Egypt on Monday.
