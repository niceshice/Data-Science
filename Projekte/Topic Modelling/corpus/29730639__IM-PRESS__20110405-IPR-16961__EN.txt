EU globalisation adjustment fund aid totalling €777,820 for 834 workers in the Czech Republic and Poland who lost their jobs when their companies closed was backed The European Parliament on Tuesday. Parliament also asked for an evaluation of the long-term impact of European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) aid.
The Czech Republic applied for €323,820 in EGF aid to help find new jobs for 634 former workers at the Unilever ČR, a retailer in the Střední Čechy region. The aid was approved with 553 votes in favour, 53 against and 19 abstentions.
Poland applied for €453,570 in EGF aid to help find new jobs for 200 former workers at three firms which produced machinery and equipment in the Podkarpackie region, which was severely hit by the economic crisis. The aid was approved with 514 votes in favour, 50 against and 16 abstentions.
Evaluating EGF impact
The plenary vote follows a 16 March recommendation by Parliament's Budgets Committee, which also asked for an evaluation of the long-term integration into the labour market of workers in receipt of EGF support. EU Member States approved the aid for the Czech Republic and Poland at the 21 March General Affairs Council.
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was established to provide additional support for workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation or the financial crisis and to help them to reintegrate into the labour market. The fund's annual ceiling is €500 million.
