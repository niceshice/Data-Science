Equality in the workplace: MEPs discuss proposals
Women's rights/Equal opportunities
2007-01-23 - 18:05
Women form a majority of the population but a minority of the workforce
How to get more women into the workplace will be discussed on Wednesday in Parliament's Women's Rights committee. MEPs will look at a report on a European Commission "roadmap" for the next 3 years on improving equality in the EU. Among its priorities are steps to make care assistance more accessible for working mothers and eradicating discrimination at work. Going some way to achieving these aims would be a solid start to 2007 which is the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
The Italian MEP who drafted the report - Amalia Sartori of the European People's Party - says getting more women into work will help "growth" and "social cohesion".
The report also suggests steps to reconcile women's professional and personal lives and stresses that the cost of motherhood should be borne not by business but by society. She believes that it will also help the EU in its "Lisbon strategy" of boosting growth and jobs. The aims of Lisbon in 2000 called for a 60% employment rate of women by 2010. It currently stands at 55.7%.
Women still earning 15% less than men
Overall in the European Union, women are far more likely to be unemployed, earn 15% than men in the same job and be under represented at boardroom level. These facts are in contrast to the right to equal pay and gender equality enshrined in the EU Treaties.
Last year MEPs adopted a resolution with the aim of pushing for better implementation of existing community law. Specifically it aimed to highlight the gender divide in the workplace. They also strongly supported the setting up of the EU's new Gender Equality Agency in Vilnius, Lithuania, later this year. With women making up 52% of the EU's population, the situation could clearly improve.
Last year the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers jointly adopted a directive which brought together existing key elements concerning access to employment, working conditions, social security schemes.
