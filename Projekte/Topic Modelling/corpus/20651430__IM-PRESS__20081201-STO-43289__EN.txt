How will voter turnout look in 2009? Although the European Parliament is now much more powerful than when it was first directly elected in 1979, voter turnout for elections has declined steadily, reaching a new low in 2004. It's a worrying trend but MEPs believe strongly that the apathy can be countered as long as people grasp clearly what is at stake. We asked MEPs what can be done.
Voter turnout fell to 46% in 2004 from 62% in 1979. While turnout held up quite well in the 15 older member countries, it was fairly low in the 10 new, mainly former communist Central and Eastern European states who joined the EU in 2004. Slovakia and Poland had the lowest turnout, at 17% and 21% respectively.
The new members brought the electorate to around 350 million, of whom 160 million voted. So how can the European Union fight the lethargy of the 190 million who stayed away and renew their interest in European politics?
Slovakia, Poland should see voter turnout double - MEPs
Countering the poor turnout is at the top of every MEP's agenda and Slovak EPP-ED member Miroslav Mikolášik expects things to be very different in 2009. "We are actually hoping to double the turnout numbers from 2004. It is my job to assure my constituents that I will be a strong force in supporting policies like Cohesion, which is a good thing for our country."
Polish UEN MEP Mieczysław Janowski also hopes turnout will double for Poland as citizens see the tangible benefits of being in the EU. "I would estimate the level of participation in 2009 at around 40%...the New Member States will have seen the effects of EU funds, and thus will participate with more enthusiasm in the elections."
Media has a key role
It was "the lack of information in the national media concerning European issues" that deterred Slovaks from the polls, said Zita Pleštinská of the centre right EPP-ED group. Emphasising the role of the press, she said, "If the media will not focus on the substance of European politics our citizens will remain sceptical about voting in European elections".
Estonia had a turnout of 27% in 2004, and Liberal MEP Toomas Savi also expects a higher turnout as voters see the positive effects of the EU. "After five years in the Union Estonian people do have a clearer understanding about what is going on in EP."
Talk is key - MEP Bart Staes
Bart Staes comes from a country with a 91% turnout, but then voting is compulsory in Belgium. His advice for raising turnout, "talk, talk, talk...democracy is about organising our disagreements and trying to make compromises when we have conflicts of interest."
The Green MEP said that Belgian turnout would probably be lower if voting wasn't obligatory, but "given the very special political situation and tense politicised climate in Belgium, I think it is possible that people are more motivated to vote."
