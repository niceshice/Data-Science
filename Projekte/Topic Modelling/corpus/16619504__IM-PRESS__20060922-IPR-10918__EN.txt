At a joint meeting on Monday evening of the Foreign Affairs and Development committees, MEPs selected the shortlist of three candidates for the 2006 Sakharov Prize, which is awarded every year by the European Parliament to individuals or organisations who have stood up for human rights or fought against intolerance.
The three candidates are, in alphabetical order:
- A joint nomination: All those fighting for the hostages kidnapped in Colombia, represented by Ingrid Betancourt and the Pais Libre Foundation;
- Alexander Milinkevich, leader of the opposition in Belarus and an ex-presidential candidate who was jailed for 15 days for taking part in an unauthorised rally in Minsk;
- Ghassan Tueni , a Lebanese journalist and diplomat, who has been nominated for the prize to commemorate the sacrifices of several prominent Lebanese figures who were assassinated: Rafiq Hariri, Basil Fuleihane, Samir Kassir, Georges Haoui and Gebrane Tueni.
The European Parliament has awarded the Sakharov Prize every year since 1988 in memory of Andrei Sakharov (1921-1989), the Russian physicist and inventor of the hydrogen bomb, who in the 1970s set up a committee for the defence of human rights and political victims. His efforts were honoured in 1975 when he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
The next step will be the selection of this year's Sakharov Prize winner by the Conference of Presidents in October. The prize will then be presented at the December plenary session by Parliament's President Josep Borrell.
