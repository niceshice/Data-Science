EP President Jerzey Buzek and many senior political figures will be at the Strasbourg Open Day on Sunday. And you will have the chance in Brussels and Strasbourg to meet MEPs and political and parliamentary staff who can explain their work, answer your questions and demonstrate what they do.
Don't miss our live chat on Facebook with Belgian Green and Vice-President of Parliament, Isabelle Durant, starting at 1630.
If I can't make it?
We will keep you updated from Brussels on the web via Twitter, with photos on Flickr and updates on our Facebook page. We will publish a full report from Strasbourg next week
For real internet addicts who do make it to Brussels, you can watch the Facebook chat in the flesh and go behind the scenes of the European Parliament web operation at our special stand, and even post your own tweets and comments on the spot.
