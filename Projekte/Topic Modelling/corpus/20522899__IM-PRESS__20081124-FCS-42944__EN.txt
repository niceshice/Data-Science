In the key debate on the Auditor's report, MEPs said they were dissatisfied with the level of errors. Members called for the UN's peacekeeping mission in DR Congo to be beefed up amid renewed fighting in the North Kivu part of the country. Other hot topics were the state of Europe's car industry, where output will fall by 1 million cars next year, and the recent reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy.

Monday in Strasbourg: wage gap, euro at 10, EuroMedscola
Monday: MEPs debated equal pay for men and women Monday MEPs discussed ways to narrow the gender pay gap that still exists in Europe, despite 30 years of legislation. MEPs also discussed the future of economic and monetary union as EMU hits 10. Ahead of the plenary in Strasbourg, young students from the EU and its Mediterranean neighbours discussed the conclusions of two days of debates with EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering.
Wage gap still exists
Despite years of legislation to equalise pay, women earn on average 15% less than men and up to 25% less in the private sector, so the women's rights committee is tabling proposals on how to improve things. Slovak EPP-ED member Edit Bauer outlined proposals including the revision of existing legislation, regular pay audits, a special role for equality bodies and appropriate sanctions, but stressed the whole problem can't be solved by legislation alone.
10 years of the euro
MEPs discussed the challenges ahead after 10 years of EMU, particularly in light of the current recession. They also discussed a report on improving consumer education and awareness on credit and finance.
"EuroMedScola"- young students meet to discuss Mediterranean issues
Earlier, on Sunday and Monday, the Parliament welcomed around 250 16-18 year olds from the EU and 10 of its Mediterranean neighbours to take part in a two-day seminar. The event was designed to encourage debate and dialogue between youngsters in 2008, the Year of Intercultural Dialogue. The students discussed the environment, equal opportunities and the role of education and training.
Speaking at the closing ceremony Mr Pöttering said, "EuroMedScola is a symbol of hope for the future and Euro-Mediterranean cooperation. It is also proof of its dynamism."
Concluding his speech, Mr Pöttering used the famous words of Jean Monnet, one of the founding fathers of the European Community, who said in 1950 about the European project: "We are not bringing together states, we are uniting people".

Tuesday in plenary: financial crisis post G20 summit, CAP health check
MEPs want more milk for Europe in 2009 MEPs on Tuesday 18 November debated the state of the Common Agricultural Policy which holds sway over 62% of the EU budget. Following the G20 meeting in Washington, where 85% of the world's economy was represented, MEPs discussed the financial and economic crisis.
Financial crisis post G-20 summit
Tuesday afternoon in Strasbourg was devoted to money as MEPs discussed the financial and economic crisis, in the light of the Washington G-20 summit on 14-­15 November with the Commission and Council.
French European Affairs minister Jean-Pierre Jouyet said, the current situation is in dire need of rectification, "since 1929 this is the most severe financial crisis; the effects of crisis on economy are now showing clearly, with many countries having entered recession."
European Commission President José Manuel Barroso said the G20 meeting "marked a new era in collective steering of the global economic crisis and has made people realise that we need a global approach."
For those worried about the future of capitalism, Joseph Daul of the centre-right EPP-ED group had some reassurance. "The financial crisis is not a defeat of capitalism but a result of poor regulation, a lack of market transparency and of proper financial supervisory bodies." But Graham Watson of the Liberal group ALDE group feared that things will never return to normal. "It will never again be business as before."
The Socialists want greater control of the international financial system. "Do we now protect banks and funds from a collapse? They take the money gratefully and carry on unhampered. It is like giving money to a gambler who went broke in casino and he continues gambling cheerfully," said Martin Schulz.
CAP Health Check
Earlier, MEPs discussed agriculture in the final stages of the CAP health check, before Ministers decide on legislation.
MEPs looked at four reports, drafted by Portuguese Socialist Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos, which had 1170 amendments in committee stage. Among the recommendations are:
A smaller cut in farm aid. Farmers receiving payments above €5000 should by 2013 face a subsidy cut of 7% and not of 13% as the Commission proposed;
Limited increase in milk quotas: Milk quotas should increase by 1% in 2009 and 2010. They should be reviewed before the Commission makes further proposals (the quota system expires in 2015);
Special aid for milk producers and livestock farmers. Member states should be allowed to use up to 15% of Community funding in support of hard-hit sectors such as livestock and dairy farming.
MEPs were split on the outcome of the CAP health check, with some pushing for greater production and others fearing lower prices if production increases.
Mr Capoulas Santos said, "It is necessary to maintain a CAP, it is a precondition for competitive agriculture in Europe."
More fruit and vegetables
Also Tuesday, MEPs debated plans to make more fruit and vegetables available in schools in order to encourage healthier eating habits in children and combat obesity. They discussed plans to equalise pay between men and women and a report on the first 10 years of EMU and future challenges.

Wednesday's session: Europe's car makers, DR Congo's 'dirty war'
MEPs debated the crisis Wednesday, which has seen 250,000 displaced Wednesday's sitting started with discussions on the deteriorating humanitarian situation in DR Congo. MEPs called for a halt to atrocities and a strengthening of the UN's peacekeeping force (MONUC). A debate on the hardships faced by Europe's car industry had many calling for investment in more efficient vehicles.
Wednesday also saw MEPs debate the Blue Card scheme for skilled migrants. They also discussed compliance with a ban on cluster bombs and earlier HIV/AIDS diagnosis and care. The UK's Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks also addressed the House in the framework of the year of Intercultural Dialogue.
1 million less cars in 2009 says Verheugen
MEPs discussed Europe's car industry and Industry Commissioner Günter Verheugen said sales could fall by up to 1 million cars next year.
Around 15 million Europeans are employed in the motor industry and one of the main names - Opel (Vauxhall in the UK) - is in difficulty due to the credit crunch and falling sales.
MEPs urged greater investment to build more efficient cars and a move away from subsidies for older models.
They also want realistic targets set for manufacturers and more incentives to boost car sales in Europe and globally.
A representative of the French Presidency said that European Ministers have already accepted the principle that support for Europe's car makers could be useful. Mr Verheugen said he wanted clear and predictable rules rather than subsidies.
DR Congo's 'dirty war' condemned
Recent fighting in the Democratic Republic of Congo's North Kivu province has focused world attention on the plight of the 250,000 displaced people.
It comes five years after the end of previous wars in DR Congo which left an estimated 5 million dead and at times involved 11 countries.
MEPs urged the European Union to keep up its regional development aid to the region. Thus far countries from the Union have pledged 43.5 million euro in additional aid.
The House also called for the strengthening of the UN's MONUC peacekeeping forces with additional EU forces if necessary.
At present several European Union countries have observers with the force but only one European country, Serbia, has a military contingent.
Members from all sides condemned the plunder of the country's vast mineral resources to fund conflict and profiteering. MEPs also commended the aid efforts of Development Commissioner Louis Michel.
France's European affairs Minister Jean-Pierre Jouyet, speaking on behalf of the Council said that the current situation involves sexual violence, looting and the use of child soldiers. He told MEPs that the UN Security Council will consider strengthening the MONUC mandate to be able to protect civilians
Background: After the 1994 Rwandan genocide the Hutu militias responsible were chased out of Rwanda and ended up in DR Congo destabilising the country and leading to the start of the first Congo war in 1997. In the current conflict Rwanda's Tutsi General Laurent Nkunda claims he is fight the Hutu militias.

Thursday in plenary: Court of Auditors report, European Anti-Fraud
Thursday in plenary saw MEPs debate the Court of Auditors Report for 2007 Thursday morning MEPs debated a report from the European Court of Auditors on EU expenditure in 2007. Many Members expressed concern at the high rate of errors and lack of accountability from EU states - who manage 80% of the budget. Parliament's Budgetary Control Committee will now start an in-depth look at expenditure through the "discharge procedure".
Discussions over the budget were followed by a debate over improving the powers of OLAF, the European Anti Fraud Office. Later MEPs voted on environmental inspection criteria, the Blue Card scheme, the banning of cluster munitions and the crisis in DR Congo and human rights issues.
Scrutinising the 2007 budget
The President of the European Court of Auditors, Vítor Manuel da Silva Caldeira, presented his findings to MEPs. He noted that for the 14th year running, the Commission had not received a clean bill of health, but acknowledged the progress made.
The largest error rates came in the funds for economic and social cohesion, where 11% of the spending was not in line with the rules.
MEPs dissatisfied with errors
While welcoming the report and its thorough and professional execution, MEPs were very dissatisfied by the high rate of errors and the lack of accountability by nation states.
The main political groups criticised EU Members for their part in the co-management of the EU funds and expressed disappointment that representatives of the Council didn't take part in the discussion.
Around 80% of the EU budget is managed at the final beneficiary level by the Member States, leaving the Commission exclusively accountable for around 20% of spending.
Defending the Commission's position, Vice-president Siim Kallas responsible for administrative affairs and audit said the Commission gives the highest priority to reducing error rates.
The Parliament now begins the discharge procedure, through which it "signs off" on the budget.
MEPs back a more independent Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)
MEPs later discussed and voted on a report with 92 amendments to the Commission's proposal to change the regulation of OLAF. The parliament wants more independence and autonomy for OLAF.
German Christian Democrat Ingeborg Grässle who drafted the report said: "We are behind this office, we want it and we want it to do its job properly."
Debates over human rights
In the afternoon's debates over human rights MEPs discussed the case of a 13 year old girl who was stoned to death in Somalia. The House condemned this crime and voiced its support for the Somali government's attempt to bring that area of the country under its control.
MEPs also condemned the continued use of the death penalty in Nigeria where 720 men and 11 women are under sentence of death in Nigeria's prisons.
In a resolution on the case of the al-Kurd family who have been evicted from their home in East Jerusalem by the Israeli authorities, Parliament voiced concern at this and other operations and pointed to the possible consequences for the peace process.
Thursday's other key votes
MEPs backed the Blue Card scheme to allow highly skilled immigrants to take jobs in the EU.
They called for member states to sign, ratify and implement a universal ban on cluster bomb manufacture.
Following an oral question to Council on Thursday, MEPs backed a recommendation for minimum criteria for environmental inspections in EU countries. European Court of Auditors European Parliament Press Service Article on the Discharge Procedure The Blue Card: Feature Article on Cluster Bombs
