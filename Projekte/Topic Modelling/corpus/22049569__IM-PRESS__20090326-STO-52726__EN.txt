MEPs want to protect the Arctic which is believed to contain 20% of the world's undiscovered oil and gas reserves ©NASA European Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering expressed sadness at the deaths of over 300 migrants who drowned off the Libyan coast this week, at the opening of the two-day plenary session in Brussels. MEPs called for renewed negotiations on an EU-Russia partnership agreement to improve respect for human rights and ensure the security of gas supplies. They also debated a possible international treaty for the protection of the Arctic region.
As the migrants were hoping to reach Europe, "we are all challenged to find solutions," said the President. The House observed a minute's silence in respect of the victims. New EU-Russia agreement Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee is recommending that a number of issues are included in the EU's cooperation agreement with Russia: a ban on the suspension or reduction of energy supplies in the case of disputes more focus on human rightsa commitment from Russia not to use force against its neighbours The debate showed clear difference between the biggest groups: The Christian Democrat EPP-ED and Liberal ALDE group welcomed the report, but the Socialists found it "unbalanced", particularly in its attribution of responsibility for recent conflicts between Russia and its neighbours and said they would only support the report if their amendments are accepted. Liberal Janusz Onyszkiewicz, who is guiding the report through the EP, said, "No strategic partnership is possible if the values of democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law are not fully shared and respected." "We must not forget the role of Russia in the Georgian war of last summer or in the January gas crisis," said Josef Zieleniec for the EPP-ED. The agreement must include "the requirement for clear assurances that Russia does not apply force against any of their neighbours." Hungarian Socialist Csaba Tabajdi said, "as for as gas supplies are concerned, we are mutually dependent, because Russia wouldn't be able to sell its gas to anyone else." Liberal leader Graham Watson said, "Europe today has a population three and a half times the size of Russia’s. We have military spending that is 10 times bigger, and an economy 15 times the size. We have no reason to cower from the Kremlin." Protection of the Arctic region MEPs debated a possible international treaty for the protection of the Arctic region, which is mostly sea, but where Norway, Canada, the US, Russia and Denmark have claims. It is important because it accounts for 20% of the world's undiscovered oil and gas reserves and because melting ice and a rising sea show that the global warming in the Arctic region is much higher than in the rest of the world There was agreement that the world must find a way to reconcile the conflicting territorial and resource demands made on this fragile region with its long-term environmental security, but not everyone agreed that there should be a treaty.
