CAP: new members have felt benefits but more needs to be done

An own-initiative report by Hungarian Socialist Csaba Sandor Tabajdi about the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) in the countries that joined the EU in 2004 calls it a “win-win situation”. However, the 10 new states are concerned that the low level of direct aid they receive is creating unequal competition. The report, the first review by an EU institution of the integration of the new countries into the CAP, was adopted during the last plenary session in Brussels.
Agriculture has a much bigger role in the countries that joined the EU in 2004 than in "older" members. In the new members the total area dedicated to agriculture is 22% with 13% of the work force involved in farming, compared to 4% of land and 1.6% of the workforce in the EU-15.
Mr. Tabajdi said the report has two aims: to make a thorough analysis of the impact of accession on the CAP, both the advantages and problems and tensions, to fuel thinking on the future of the CAP in the light of recent reforms. It was strongly backed in plenary.
"Win-win?"
The Tabajdi report said that the CAP has led to a "win-win situation” for the following reasons:
There were no big changes in the EU's single market after the 2004 enlargement. The report says that "goods from new Member States were not dumped in the EU-15 countries, owing partly to the fact that the major part of the agricultural and food trade was duty-and subsidy-free prior to the enlargement."
There has been good adaptation to food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary systems in the new countries.
Existing EU members have benefited from open markets in the new countries, while the new members have seen agricultural incomes rise and stable prices and markets for cereal, sugar beet and beef increase of agricultural incomes.
Level of payments still not same as "old" members
However, the report identifies areas where improvements could be made:
Money: “By the end of the 2007-2013 financial perspective the share of direct payments and rural development appropriations for the new Member States from the EU-27 budget will climb to about 19% only."
Unequal competition: the phasing-in over 9 years, from 25%, of direct payments to the new members, means their farmers are not competing on a level playing field with other EU farmers in the EU and even on their domestic markets, particularly since the new countries must comply with EU health and hygiene costs, which mean higher production costs.
In its report, the Parliament said the Commission should take the concerns of the new member States into account more. It also said the CAP should be revised to take account of the objectives and needs of agriculture, rural areas, farmers, consumers and the entire society in the enlarged EU 27. MEPs “expect that the future CAP will reduce the administrative burden of farmers and national authorities and will support the market-oriented, environmentally sound production of safe products, while ensuring the future of sustainable agriculture.“
