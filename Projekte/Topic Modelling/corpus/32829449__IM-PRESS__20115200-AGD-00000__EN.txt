Committee meetings - Brussels
Intergovernmental pact . The Economic and monetary affairs and the Constitutional affairs committees will meet jointly with the MEPs representing the European Parliament in the Council working group on the new fiscal pact, one day after it starts its work (Tuesday).
Eurozone/Mario Draghi. The Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee will discuss sovereign debt markets and Eurozone developments with ECB President Mario Draghi. This will be his first visit to the committee since taking up his post (Monday).
Derivatives trading. Parliament, Council and Commission will pursue talks on new legislation to regulate trade in derivatives, which is widely believed to have aggravated the global financial crisis. The draft aims to enhance the safety, transparency and stability of the over-the-counter derivatives market (Monday).
Eurobonds/Credit Rating Agencies. The Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee will vote a resolution on eurobonds. The Committee will also begin discussing new legislation to tighten up rules on credit rating agencies, including stiffer reporting requirements (Tuesday).
Cross-border payments. MEPs, Council and Commission will try to agree a deal to make cross-border payment services faster, cheaper and safer for EU citizens. Ensuring that payment service providers compete fairly, eliminating hidden national bank charges, and accelerating transfers could save banks, clients and businesses up to €123 billion within six years (Wednesday).
EU patent. The Legal Affairs Committee will vote on a deal with Council to create a single EU patent, aimed at cutting costs for firms and boosting the EU's competitiveness (Tuesday).
Roaming. The Industry Committee will hold a hearing and begin discussing new legislation on mobile-phone roaming charges, which would set new retail and wholesale price caps and should boost competition (Tuesday).
President's diary. President Buzek will pay an official visit to Uruguay (Monday-Tuesday ) and Argentina (Wednesday-Thursday). He will be guest speaker at the Mercosur Summit of Heads of State (Tuesday).
Parliament's offices close from 22 December until 3 January. Business resumes on 9 January, with a week of meetings of parliamentary committees and political groups.
