The President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering, made a statement on Wednesday, the eve of the 4-7 June European elections, calling on citizens to vote.
Hans-Gert Pöttering said:
"The elections to the European Parliament are of a greatest importance. They are a great occasion to re-launch the European Union and to address the issues that are important to citizens such as the economic crisis, unemployment, climate change, energy security, globalization or immigration.
Elections will decide the composition of the European Parliament for the next five years. Today approximately 75 % of the European Union legislation is decided by the European Parliament together with the Council of Ministers and has a direct impact in our daily lives. The greater the participation, the less likely that votes for extremist parties will distort the outcome.
The European Parliament represents European shared values: The dignity of the human being, Human Rights, Peace, Freedom, Democracy, Justice, the Rule of Law, and the principles of solidarity and subsidiary. Those values stand for our joint European identity.
Now is a very good moment to give the European project new impetus and direction. I call on voters to support those parties that are in favour of European integration and that are committed to our European values.
With your vote you will take a decision about the future of Europe and about your future in our common Europe! Use your vote to decide which kind of European Union you would like to see. Go to vote! It is your choice!"
