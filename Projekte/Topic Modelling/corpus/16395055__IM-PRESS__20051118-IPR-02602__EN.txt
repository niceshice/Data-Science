2005-11-25 - 11:34
The budgetary conciliation held on 24 November ended in stalemate as no agreement could be found at this stage on the 2006 budget.
Shortly after the adjournment of the negotiations, Budgets Committee chair Janusz LEWANDOWSKI (EPP-ED, PL) underlined the need to "make the utmost efforts to strike a deal in the coming weeks" and remained "hopeful that the needs of citizens will be satisfied" .
General rapporteur on the 2006 budget Gianni PITTELLA (PES, IT) is confident that "the goodwill shown on both sides will lead to an agreement in due course" .
The European Parliament's last offer which could not be accepted by Council after a 12-hour negotiation was based on the following points:
- a level of payment appropriations at the same level as the Commission's preliminary draft budget (€112,226 billion, equalling 1.0123% of GNI of the EU25). This amount was deemed by Parliament's delegation to be acceptable since it was based on an update made by Commission in October.
- an extra amount of €230 million to address new needs towards the EU's external actions coming from the flexibility instrument;
- Parliament agreed on an additional amount of €35 million for the Common Foreign and Security Policy;
- an increase of €100 million for six codecision programmes: Socrates, Youth, SMEs, LIFE III, cultural organisations and the 6th Research Framework Programme.
Negotiations will resume next week. Parliament's second reading is still expected to take place on 15 December.
