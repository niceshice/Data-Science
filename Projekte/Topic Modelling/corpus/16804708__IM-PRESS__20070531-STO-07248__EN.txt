EU MiniChefs -helping people make the right choice
While Europe's supermarkets may bulge with ever more exotic foods, it is traditional fruit and vegetables that are key to healthy living says the WHO. They can help fight rising obesity across the continent as well as many diseases. Eating habits start early and ahead of the European Day for Healthy Food on 8 November a new "EU MiniChefs" website has been launched for children to promote healthy eating. On 7 June MEPs will debate a report that calls for funding to promote fruit and vegetables.
"EU MiniChefs" is a website for children that aim to show them ways in which they can eat and cook healthily in a fun way. The website also contains a competition for children to allow them to design the poster for the European Day of Healthy Food and Cooking.
This day will see chefs across Europe going to schools to promote healthy eating for children. The theme of the competition open to 9-12 year olds is "the pleasure of eating well in Europe" and is open from mid-May to mid-June. The winner will be announced in Brussels in September.
400,000 more overweight children a year
According to the European Commission, every year another 400,000 children become overweight or obese in the European Union. A diet of chips, burgers and other forms of fast food is largely to blame. The situation is exacerbated by the decreasing amount of physical exercise children are doing. Many no longer walk or cycle to school but have their parents drop them off in the car. Added to this development pressure of the urban landscape has led to fewer playgrounds and playing fields.
Another factor is cost. Fruit and vegetables can cost considerably more than cheap processed foods. The report that MEPs will debate next week in their plenary session in Brussels on 7 June attempts to look at ways of making fruit and vegetables more accessible to poorer families and young people. Spanish Socialist MEP María Isabel Salinas Garcia drafted the report which calls for more funding for campaigns which promote fruit and vegetables. It also wants conditions improved to allow for their free distribution.
Only Greece and Italy meet WHO guidelines
At their last plenary session in Strasbourg on 22 May MEPs voted to back a report calling for stricter rules governing organic products in the EU. It calls for a compulsory EU-wide logo that would make it easier for consumers to clearly identify organic products. The report suggested amendments to legislation on GMO's that the Council of Ministers are considering.
Eating fruit and vegetables can make a substantial difference to health according to the World Health Organisation. In particular they pinpoint cardiovascular disorders and certain cancers as preventable through a healthily diet. At present in the 27 states of the European Union only in Greece and Italy do people eat the 400-gramme daily intake recommended by the WHO. The rate of consumption of fruit and vegetables is so low in come countries that consumption would have to double to reach that amount. So, it may be a clich é but it appears that an apple a day really does keeps the doctor away!
