Immigration

A picture of a castle wall and a hedge. Part of the Parliament's European election campaign 2009 As long as the European Union remains relatively safe and affluent the "pull" factor for immigration into it from outside will be strong. Literally thousands of people have lost their lives trying to get into Europe for a better way of life. Over the last few years there has been cross party support in the European Parliament for Europe to take steps against illegal immigration, manage the issues and adopt a "blue card" visa scheme for skilled migrants.
The contribution that immigrants make and have made over decades has been a crucial part in the economic growth of the EU. However, much of the labour came from European countries that were not part of the EU. Nowadays, immigrants often come from another continent and managing the political, cultural and social challenges ahead is a daunting task.
Action against those who exploit Europe's illegal workforce
Up to 8 million people across the EU are working illegally. This "black labour" force works in trades such as cleaning, building and agriculture. Often they are exploited by ruthless employers and criminal organisations. They work without any health cover or social security rights.
MEPs recently backed EU-wide laws that would ensure employers who exploit illegal workers face tough legal and financial sanctions. The House also ensured that the people who are exploited can complain about their employers. Through these measures it is hoped that more balance can be brought to immigration and the EU's workforce.
"Blue card" offers a legal door to working in Europe
At present 27 different and often overlapping visa rules for EU countries mean that many skilled workers from places like India are heading for the US or Canada.
Taking a cue from America's Green Card system, which allows people to live and work there, the EU's blue card scheme has been endorsed by MEPs last year. It offers a way for highly skilled people from outside Europe to work in jobs that many countries are struggling to fill - such as science or engineering.
Having common and humane rules for returning immigrants
The question of how to return immigrants to their country of origin is a delicate one. Many fear persecution if they return and destroy what documents they have when they arrive to make it impossible for the authorities to detect the country they originally came from.
It is also delicate across different countries in Europe as some states - notably Spain, Italy and Malta - have a disproportionate number of illegal immigrants landing on their shores. To prevent simply moving the problem around, many have argued for common rules on the return of immigrants. At present a person has 7-30 days to voluntarily return or face legal action to expel them.
The conditions in which immigrants are held is a key concern that many MEPs on Parliament's Civil Liberties Committee have taken an interest in. They have visited scores of detention facilities around Europe to press for better facilities to ensure people are kept in as humane conditions as possible.
