Mountain and island regions: special measures needed, say MEPs
Regional policy
Plenary sittings
2010-09-22 - 14:23
With over 10% of the EU population located in mountains, islands and sparsely populated areas, a distinctive European policy framework is needed to help these regions overcome their inherent disadvantages and exploit their resources better, argues a resolution adopted on Wednesday by the European Parliament.
The Lisbon Treaty recognises that regions that suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic disadvantages need "particular attention". The European Parliament believes these Treaty clauses must be translated into development strategies and concrete measures.
While Gross Domestic Product must continue to be the key yardstick for qualifying for regional aid, MEPs urge the Commission and Member States to work on other indicators that give a fuller picture of the development of these areas. They also want such regions to continue benefiting from special provisions in the new long-term EU budget that begins in 2014.
Adjust the instruments already available
Existing instruments - such as the European Groupings of Territorial Cooperation and the European Neighbourhood Policy - can be used to overcome the obstacles to territorial cooperation and make use of the resources available across borders, says today's resolution. It also argues in favour of dropping distance-related criteria (150 km) for islands to qualify as border regions eligible for funding under cross-border cooperation programmes.
The non-binding resolution, put forward by the EPP, S&D, ALDE, Greens/EFA, GUE/NGL and EFD groups was adopted by 538 votes to 17, with 58 abstentions.
