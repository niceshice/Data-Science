A cluster bomb in Sultaniyeh, Lebanon. Spotted by Mines Advisory Group, Aug '06 MEPs will discuss a landmark agreement to ban the use of cluster bombs Wednesday afternoon. They are likely to press the Council of Ministers to ensure that all 27 EU members sign up to the treaty. Thus far some states have not yet committed themselves to signing the Convention. Watch MEPs discuss it live online this afternoon.
The convention on cluster munitions was adopted by 107 countries in Dublin in May and is a pact to outlaw the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions.
Cluster bombs scatter over a wide area when dropped from the air or used in artillery shells. Many do not explode and it is often children who pick them up - with devastating consequences. The charity Handicap International estimates that 98% of the victims of cluster bombs are civilians of whom 27% are children.
They were used in the recent conflict in Georgia and by the Israeli army in Lebanon in 2006.
US and China not yet on board
Official signature of the agreement begins in Oslo on 3 December, after which countries should ratify it. It will come into force six months after it has been ratified by 30 states. Three of the largest producers of cluster bombs, the US, China and Russia - have not adopted the Convention.
MEPs will vote Thursday on a resolution that is expected to support the Convention, condemn the use of cluster bombs and call for effective steps to make safe existing unexploded munitions.
They will also ask for "adequate provision of care and rehabilitation for victims" and the destruction of stockpiles.
According to the London-based "Cluster Munition Coalition" which is a network of 250 civil society organisations in 70 countries, so far Poland, Romania, Greece, Estonia, Cyprus and Slovakia have not publically declared that they will sign the Convention. Finland is the only country who has publically declared they will not sign.
