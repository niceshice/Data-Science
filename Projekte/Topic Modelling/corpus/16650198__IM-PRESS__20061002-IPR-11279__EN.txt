MEPs investigate Equitable Life crisis in Dublin
On Friday 6 October, the European Parliament's Temporary Committee of Inquiry into the Crisis of the Equitable Life Assurance Society visited Dublin to hear evidence from Irish Equitable Life policyholders, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority (IFSRA) and from the Financial Services Ombudsman, Mr Joe Meade.
The Equitable Life Assurance Society began selling policies in Europe in the 1950s. In the 1990s however, the company began to experience a number of difficulties brought on by falling inflation. In July 2001, having closed its doors to new business, the Society announced its intention to reduce the value of its policies, eventually reaching agreement with policy holders which involved them relinquishing certain rights.
The Equitable Life crisis has affected 6,500 policy holders in Ireland, over one million policy holders in the UK and 7,500 policy holders elsewhere in Europe (notably Germany).
The Parliament's Committee of Inquiry is expected to produce its final report in the spring of 2007 and a n interim report was approved by the European Parliament in July (see link).
As Chairperson of the Committee, Fine Gael MEP Mairéad McGuinness (EPP-ED) stated that "while the Equitable Life débacle has played a part in bringing about more robust consumer protection, there are still many outstanding questions for the thousands of people who suffered losses".
Commenting on the occasion of the Committee's hearing in the European Parliament's Office in Ireland, Ms McGuinness said that “it remains very unclear what transpired between the Regulators in Ireland and the UK (the Department of Industry and Employment and the Department of Trade and Industry) at the time of the establishment of the Equitable Life business in Ireland and when the new Regulators took over. We established today, much to our regret and concern, that we cannot have access to the files containing correspondence between the Irish and British Departments. We understand from this morning’s hearing with IFSRA that there is such a file but that confidentiality rules apply to it. Access to the file might give us clear information as to who knew what, when and whether this information, if known by potential policyholders, would have dissuaded them from investing. We need to establish the status of this file and whether we can obtain access to it."
Mairéad McGuiness concluded by pointing out that "it is of cold comfort to the policyholders to know that things are better in Ireland now in terms of rules for the conduct of business. The Committee will be investigating whether there are still avenues of redress within the Irish system for policyholders of Equitable Life who experienced difficulties. We will be communicating directly with policyholders on this."
Labour MEP Proinsias De Rossa (PES) and Fine Gael MEP Gay Mitchell (EPP-ED) also attended the hearing in Dublin and asked a number of questions of the policy holders.
On 16 October 2006, the Temporary Committee of Inquiry into the Equitable Life crisis will visit London to hold further hearings with the UK policyholders and financial authorities.
