The European Parliament should refuse to grant the European Police College (CEPOL) a budget discharge for financial 2008, said the Budgetary Control Committee on Monday. Although Parliament has so far granted discharges to all other EU agencies, the committee finds it unacceptable that CEPOL, established as an agency in 2006, has yet to meet good administration standards.
This unique decision to refuse a budget discharge follows Parliament's May 2010 decision to postpone the CEPOL discharge and request an action plan and a list of specific remedial measures with an implementation timetable.
"CEPOL's governing board did come up with the action plan, but we did not receive the specific measures and their timetable for implementation", said rapporteur Veronique Mathieu (EPP, FR), adding that "we asked for an implementation plan that was adopted by the governing board and had been subject to a professional assessment. Neither of these requests have not been respected."
Committee MEPs were also able to consult confidential documents providing information on the recovery status of money that had been used for private expenses, the management shortcomings attributable to CEPOL's previous director and the way in which the new board handled the situation. "It made the seriousness of the shortcomings crystal clear. We have had all the necessary information to make a political decision to refuse the discharge", said Ms Mathieu.
The Committee voted unanimously in favour of the Mathieu report, which will now be put to a vote by Parliament as a whole at the October I plenary session. If Parliament as whole decides to refuse the discharge, a formal proposal to close the accounts for the year 2008 will be submitted and to a vote at the October II session.
