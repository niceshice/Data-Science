As a result many tangible changes over equal working conditions, discrimination and violence. To date campaigns have been varied and included the help of NGOs and charities.
EP legislation: Equality at work
Since the 1970s the EU has used legislative powers to push for equal pay. MEPs amended equal pay legislation in 1999 and have reviewed it every 2 years from 2002.
In 2006 the number of female managers in the European Union was 32.6%. There was also a rise in the number of women MEPs from 16.3% in 1979 to 31% in 2009. However, there is still a pay gap. Women in Europe earn on average 17% less than their male counterparts.
Condemning violence against women
It is estimated that around a quarter of all women in Europe have experienced physical acts of violence at least once in their adult lives. The "Daphne Programme", launched in 1997, aims to fund and support projects charged with eradicating violence against women. The programme also supports schemes aimed at safeguarding young people.
The Parliament unites against forced prostitution
In 2006 before the football World Cup, the committee on gender rights and female equality (FEMM) launched the campaign, "Red Card to Forced Prostitution". The scheme has been reused at other sporting events such as the Euro 2008 football championship.
The Chair of Parliament's Women's Rights Committee Anna Záborská (EPP-ED) said, "this so-called 'Red Card to Forced Prostitution' campaign was a great success because it contributed positively towards reducing trafficking and forced prostitution during the championship games."
Creating greater visibility of equality issues
In 2006 the European Institute for Gender Equality was created in Vilnius to promote gender equality, fight against discrimination and analyse and disseminate data on gender equality.
As well as the measures mentioned above, the Parliament also draws attention to specific issues with its own initiative reports from Members which can become valuable tools for raising awareness.
