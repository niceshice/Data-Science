Ferrari says "brake" for pedestrians!

STOP! Zebra crossings should be safe for people Traffic and pedestrians can be a fatal combination. Every year around 8,000 people are killed in road accidents across the European Union. The number injured is over 300,000 - bigger than many cities in Europe. Tuesday night will see MEPs debate a report on pedestrian safety drafted by appropriately-named Italian Liberal Francesco Ferrari. It calls for the earlier introduction of break-assist systems and for any new anti-collision system (once developed) to be assessed at a European level.
The Ferrari report is on a technical regulation on which compromise has already been reached between EU transport Ministers and MEPs from Parliament's Transport committee.
Breaking and anti-collision measures key
In particular Mr Ferrari wants an earlier introduction of compulsory brake-assist systems (BAS) from 2009. This technology increases braking pressure in an emergency situation thus avoiding collisions or having them occur at less speed.
He also believes that once an anti-collision system for pedestrians is developed (this would warn drivers of collision and slam on the breaks) it should be assessed by the Parliament and the Council to see if the technology can be used across Europe. Mr Ferrari is of the belief that at present no such system exists although several car manufacturers are working on them.
Target of halving road casualties
The Italian Liberal also wants a more ambitious timetable for the implementation of the regulation by the automotive industry. If adopted this regulation should replace the 2003 and 2005 Directives on improving the safety of pedestrians and other vulnerable road users.
In 2001 a white paper from the European Commission called for road casualties to be halved by 2010 - with new safety devices playing a leading role. According to the Commission, the lives of up to 2,000 pedestrians and cyclists could be saved each year using safety standards for the design of car fronts.
The Ferrari-report (co-decision, first reading) will be debated on Tuesday evening - you can watch it live here on the Parliament's website.
