Better housing for poor communities
Regional policy
2010-02-10 - 12:34
Poor communities in all Member States could get EU regional funding for renovation or replacement of their housing, under a regulation approved by the European Parliament on Wednesday.
There are very limited cases in which the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) can be used to finance housing measures. Until recently only urban housing improvements in the 12 countries that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007 were eligible for ERDF money. However, last year the EU amended the ERDF regulation to allow financing energy-efficiency measures in housing in all EU Member States.
The approval of the current amended regulation, the text of which has already been agreed between Parliament and Council, will entitle all 27 Member States to use the ERDF funds, in addition to other sources, to renovate the existing houses of their "marginalised communities" or to replace them with new ones, irrespective of whether these are in urban or rural areas.
The amended regulation aims at improving the situation of all marginalised communities, among them the Roma, which is currently the largest poverty-affected social group in Europe.
Parliament's report, drafted by Lambert van Nistelrooij (EPP, NL), was adopted by 588 votes to 57, with 16 abstentions.
