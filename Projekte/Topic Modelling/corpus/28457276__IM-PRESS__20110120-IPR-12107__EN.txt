Bold Commission proposals are needed to help individuals and firms to claim compensation for damages due to breaches of EU antitrust law, says Parliament in its opinion, approved Thursday, on the Commission's 2009 competition policy report. The Commission is also asked to review its fines policy, and to assess in detail how state aid affected the economy during the financial crisis and what it has done to spur a green economic recovery.
The Commission should come forward with bold proposals to facilitate individual and class-actions for effective compensation for damages resulting from breaches of EU antitrust law, says the opinion, which nonetheless warns that care must be taken not to go as far as the relevant US law, which has led to excesses.
On the key issue of fines, the opinion says that imposing ever-higher fines as the sole deterrent may be too blunt an instrument, not least in view of the job losses that may result from an inability to make payments. It therefore calls a wider range of more sophisticated instruments to be developed, including individual liability, transparency and accountability of firms, the right of defence and due process, mechanisms to ensure the effective operation of leniency applications, corporate compliance programmes and developing European standards.
The report, prepared by Derk-Jan Eppink (ECR, NL) also suggests that this would be an opportune moment to tackle tax distortion and move towards a more level fiscal playing field. As is customary, the report also looks at various sectors where competition needs further attention, such as energy, ICT, farm produce, and health.
