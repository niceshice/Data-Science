Post-Briefing - Brussels plenary session - 28-29 November 2007
2007-11-30 - 11:50
Selected highlights from the Brussels plenary session - 28-29 November 2007 include:
Zapatero to MEPs: "Be ambitious, experience tells us that when we are, things tend to go well"
MEPs debated the future of Europe, with Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero. PM Zapatero staunchly supported both the work of the European Parliament and a strong Union. "Too often have we heard that Europe is in crisis", said Mr Zapatero, but he stressed "I do not share this pessimistic outlook". The new treaty should enable Europe to become "a beacon of progress and welfare. "Let us be ambitious" he told MEPs. "Experience tells us that when we are, things tend to go well".
Sounder funding arrangements for European political parties
A Commission proposal to allow European political parties to finance campaign activities for the 2009 elections is backed by the European Parliament. The new legislation improves the financial stability of European parties, and thus facilitate long-term planning. It also permits the creation of European political foundations. The committee will ask the House to vote in favour of the legislation so funding for political foundations can go ahead from 2008.
European Parliament approves the Charter of Fundamental Rights and urges UK and Poland to apply it
The European Parliament gave its assent to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union with 534 votes in favour 85 against and 21 abstentions. MEPs also adopted an amendment with 477 votes in favour, 106 against and 35 abstentions urging Poland and the United Kingdom to make every effort to arrive, after all, at a consensus on the unrestricted applicability of the Charter.
MEPs tighten EU rules on gun ownership
MEPs adopted a legislative report which calls for new measures to update a 1991 directive on firearms to bring it into line with a UN Protocol on firearms and to generally update the text. The new agreed legislation classifies convertible weapons as firearms, ensure that all firearms sold in the EU are traceable to their owners. The legislation introduces rules enhancing safety with respect to gun ownership, while not inconveniencing hunters, target shooters and other legitimate owners.
New TV and product placement rules should be applied before end 2009
The European Parliament approved new EU rules on TV advertising and product placement. The new directive on Audiovisual Media Services is a modernisation of the 'TV without frontiers' directive and now also covers new media services such as Web TV and on-demand services. With the Parliament's approval today, the rules would have to be implemented in the Member States by the end of 2009.
Labour market should reflect a good balance of flexibility and employment security
The European Council should adopt a balanced approach towards flexicurity which should include key principles like adaptable and reliable contracts, investment in lifelong learning, and a core of rights regardless of workers' employment status, says an own-initiative report adopted by the European Parliament.
EP calls on Georgia to respect democratic principles and freedom of expression
The European Parliament held a debate during the Strasbourg plenary on 14 November, debating the situation in Georgia along with the EU's Neighbourhood Policy. The resolution following this debate was voted in Brussels, and calls on the Georgian authorities to "respect the principle of freedom of expression, including freedom of assembly and freedom of the media," and to investigate violations of human rights and the freedom of the media during the past few weeks.

Opening of the Brussels plenary session
2007-11-30 - 11:50
The Brussels plenary session was opened by Rodi KRATSA-TSAGAROPOULOU , Vice-President of Parliament, who announced a number of changes to the agenda that had already been agreed by the political groups: Among the agenda changes mentioned were the following:
The vote on the report by Josu ORTUONDO LARREA (ALDE, ES) on the interoperability of the Community rail system will take place in December in Strasbourg (10-13 December).
The report by Johannes BLOKLAND (IND/DEM, NL) on export and import of dangerous chemicals is postponed to January, in order to reach a first-reading agreement.
A debate with the Commission took place on Economic Partnership Agreements with ACP countries but the House voted to postpone to December the vote on a resolution on this subject, to enable the groups to seek a compromise.
The House also decided against voting on a motion for a resolution on the referendum in Venezuela to wind up the debate on this topic which took place on 28 November.
Welcome for parliamentary delegation from Afghanistan
The Vice-President welcomed a visiting delegation from the parliament of Afghanistan (the Wolesi Jirga) and expressed her condolences for the terrorist attack of 6 November 2007, where 6 Afghan MPs and around 100 other Afghans lost their lives. She added "The purpose of this visit is the beginning of a regular dialogue, which gives us the opportunity to achieve a better understanding of the political and social situation in Afghanistan and to discuss the assistance needed by your country".

Sounder funding arrangements for European political parties
2007-11-30 - 11:50
A Commission proposal to allow European political parties to finance campaign activities for the 2009 elections is backed by the European Parliament. The new legislation improves the financial stability of European parties, and thus facilitate long-term planning. It also permits the creation of European political foundations. The committee will ask the House to vote in favour of the legislation so funding for political foundations can go ahead from 2008. A total of €7 million is foreseen in the EU 2008 budget for the new political foundations. European political parties receive total EU funding of about €10 million per year.
The existing legislation on the financing of European political parties needs to be amended to enhance the European nature of Parliament's elections, and European political parties should enjoy more flexibility in managing their funds and financing their electoral activities, says the House in a report by Jo Leinen (PES, DE) adopted with 538 votes in favour, 74 against and 10 abstentions.
No funding of national parties permitted
To enhance political debate at EU level with a view to the European Parliament's 2009 elections, the European Parliament welcomes a Commission proposal to allow European political parties to use their money to finance campaign activities for European elections.
Such use of public funds is currently forbidden under EU law. The report as approved by the European Parliament also endorses the general principle that in no circumstances should these funds constitute direct or indirect financing of other parties and particularly of national parties and candidates.
The 2007 budget set out the money allocated to the EU parties. It is the EP who controls and manages the funds. In fact, the budget line for them is in the Parliament's section of the EU budget (line 402, chapter 40, title IV section I (Parliament, see link below) Ten parties were eligible for funds for 2007.
More financial stability
In an effort to strengthen the European dimension of political parties, MEPs also support the aim of improving financial stability of European parties, so as to facilitate long-term planning. This financial stability is currently lacking, said MEPs, because the grants given to European political parties are subject to change every year, discouraging any proper financial self-management.
The Commission proposes to allow political parties to carry over, by way of derogation from the no-profit rule, 25% of annual total income from one year to the first quarter of the following year. Moreover, the new legislation would introduce the possibility of accumulating reserves, over several years as own resources, of up to 100% of parties' average annual income. These resources would consist of donations, contributions from member parties and individual members.
It is also proposed that the EU general budget may finance up to 85% of the expenditure of a European political party or foundation, compared with 75% now.
MEPs clarify that the election of the members of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage, the funding of and limitation of election expenses for all parties and candidates at European Parliament elections is governed in each Member State by national provision.
Foundations
If approved, the Commission proposal for amending the 2003 Regulation on the statute and financing of European political parties would also introduce a new legal basis for establishing European political foundations.
According to the proposal, endorsed by the House, foundations would have to be formally associated with an already established European party in order to access funding - a foundation may receive funds only by applying through the political party with which is affiliated.
Finally, the proposed regulation leaves to European political parties the task of defining their relations with associated foundations, including an "appropriate degree of separation". Adopted text 28-29 November 2007

Future of Europe/European integration
Zapatero to MEPs: "Be ambitious, experience tells us that when we are, things tend to go well"
2007-11-30 - 11:50
MEPs debated the future of Europe, with Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero. PM Zapatero staunchly supported both the work of the European Parliament and a strong Union. "Too often have we heard that Europe is in crisis", said Mr Zapatero, but he stressed "I do not share this pessimistic outlook". The new treaty should enable Europe to become "a beacon of progress and welfare. "Let us be ambitious" he told MEPs. "Experience tells us that when we are, things tend to go well". In welcoming Prime Minister Zapatero, European Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering said: "These debates are extremely important for the European Parliament." He announced the end of these types of meetings with the agreements reached in Lisbon, after the next debate with the Swedish Prime Minister. The EP President also recalled that Spain was the first country to approve the Constitutional Treaty by referendum, with 77 per cent voting in favour. President Pöttering stated: "It gives me even more pleasure to welcome the head of government of Spain just a few days before the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon. Since accession in 1986, Spain has always given a lot to Europe and Spain is ready to commit to Europe's future."
Spanish Prime Minister José Luis RODRÍGUEZ ZAPATERO told the European Parliament meeting in Brussels in its plenary session that "in Spain, the notion of Europe is associated with our longing for peace, freedom, democracy and prosperity" and that "we owe a lot to Europe, and the people of Spain consider this project, in the first place, with a sense of deep gratitude".
Now, however, the challenge is to create the "Europe of values" the world needs in the 21st century. "Freedom, the rule of law, human rights, tolerance, equality between men and women, solidarity – this is the moral code of Europe." "We Europeans enjoy the most rights and are best protected. But we are not an island, and cannot live at ease knowing that these rights are absent or are trampled upon in other parts of the world. We must obey an ethical imperative to strive to disseminate them".
No need for pessimism
"Too often have we heard that Europe is in crisis", said Mr Zapatero, but he stressed "I do not share this pessimistic outlook". The new treaty should enable Europe to become "a beacon of progress and welfare", partly by opening up and modernizing its economies. "Let us be ambitious" he told MEPs. "Experience tells us that when we are, things tend to go well".
Mr Zapatero also stressed that "our economic model is inconceivable if fairness is absent", Stable, decent employment was required, as well as continued solidarity among Member States through cohesion policy.
Immigration seen as a boon but root causes must be tackled too
Mr Zapatero pointed to the creation of a Common Space of Freedom, Security and Justice, the development of the Schengen space and the system of external borders as important future EU policies that Spain would support. Then, turning to the subject of immigration, he said "Let us begin by unequivocally acknowledging immigration’s positive potential, which ranges from the demographic contribution to the dynamism of cultural diversity, including the boost to the potential growth of our economies, which has been very clear in the case of Spain". At the same time, he said, "let us address the causes that spur emigration" and "neutralize the mafias that profit from the urgent desire of these men and women to leave their lives of misery and frustration".
Isolation not an option for Europe
On external affairs, he said "With the new Treaty, we will have effective instruments for our common external policy". He added "We are the largest donor of development assistance and humanitarian aid. But we must be more ambitious. We are so obliged by our concept of dignity, by our humanist roots, by our sense of justice. But also by our interest. Only shared development and equality can ensure security in an ever more agitated world."
In particular, he emphasised that "The new Europe cannot be understood in isolation from its Eastern and Southern neighbours" and stressed "the importance of intensifying our relations with Latin America". A common defence policy was also needed to enable Europe to help preserve international peace and security under the United Nations mandate.
Spain's economic and social progress
Turning to developments in recent years in Spain, he told the House "We have gone through, and are still undergoing, a period of intense economic growth, becoming ever more open, introducing reforms in line with the Lisbon Strategy". He added "Our social model has become richer and stronger".
In his view, "Spaniards today have more rights". "The right with greatest social impact, that of equality between men and women, is extensively developed and guaranteed by Law. A right with great significance, that of marriage between people of the same gender, provides these men and women with equality with others and dignifies us all as a society".
Winding up his speech, the prime minister said "I am fully convinced that Europe will continue to exceed our expectations. We can count on the extraordinary capacity of all its institutions. And, most particularly, we trust in this Parliament. At the most difficult times, the European Parliament has always been able to repel pessimism, and to be a tough and tireless champion of European integration". His final words were "Let us keep our eyes raised towards the future and work together so that we may soon achieve the Europe we need. The Europe the world needs".
Political group speakers
For the EPP-ED group, Jaime MAYOR OREJA (ES) argued that words were not enough and that deeds were needed, for example to transpose EU directives and comply with the Kyoto protocol. He also stressed the need to strengthen the moral values of the Union, which in his view meant "being honest with our citizens about the difficulties we face".
His group believed in the need not just to reinforce the EU but also to strengthen Europe's different nations, and in this connection pointed out that freedom was one of the EU's basic values. He closed his speech by emphasising the importance of "consistency" rather than mere words.
Martin SCHULZ (DE), for the Socialist group, highlighted Spain's progress on democracy, the economy and social issues.
He saw Spain as a country that had set an example in emerging from dictatorship and, by "blossoming economically", had shown how the value of the EU's structural funds. It had also demonstrated that ceding sovereignty - e.g. over its currency - could bring benefits.
Lastly, he pointed to the "progressive policies on equal opportunities and gender issues" pursued by Mr Zapatero's government, saying they were "good for Spain and good for Europe".
Graham WATSON (ALDE, UK) said: "When Member States ratify the reform Treaty as we hope and believe they will, we can look forward at long last to a revitalised European Union, a Union with the capacity to confront new challenges, with the humility to listen to its citizens and the political will to act ratification of the Treaty cannot come a moment too soon and my Group thanks you Mr Zapatero for your efforts to speed up the process. My Group sees no need for a group of wise people to ponder Europe's future. We have been there, done that, we even have the T-shirts to prove it. It was called ‘the period of reflection’ and it has come to an end.
Now is not the time to go back to a French drawing board nor to follow a new British plan for a glorified free trade zone. those visions are just views from the margins packaged as majority opinion. They are not where consensus lies. Liberals and democrats will work together with all those who share it and live up to it whether on the right, the left or in the centre, to ensure Europe moves forward. What we will not tolerate are those who profess such a vision but fail to live up to it.
Prime Minister, Spain is often and rightly praised for its social and economic transformation since joining our Union. We need others to follow your example and your ambition for a prosperous and open Europe."
Brian CROWLEY (UEN, IE) said "Too often the views and opinions of the European Parliament are kept to the sidelines as regards what kind of discussion debate takes place at intergovernmental level. Indeed, I was delighted some time ago that when the whole issue of reflection with regard to the Treaty that has now gone and that will no longer be around again, that the Prime Minister decided to regroup the friends of the Community method and call it the ‘friends of the Constitution method’ and to bring those together to try and form a vanguard as regards how things can move forward. He saw that the success of that move opened up other doors and opportunities for him in government when he needed support with regard to immigration and other developments.
If I could make an appeal as regards the future of Europe to the Prime Minister today. I would ask that he would continue to use his influence not just in the European Union but particularly in Latin America where the issues with regard to freedom, democracy and respect for human rights are becoming ever more apparent under the guise of democratic movements.
Finally, some of us see a vision of Europe that brings bright stars, great opportunities and, most importantly of all, respect for the fundamental differences and dignities that exist within the European Union. We should come at a time when no longer do we try to homogenise everything into one single shape or size but understand that by giving dignity to that difference we can actually create a better, more colourful and certainly a more vibrant European Union for the future."
Monica FRASSONI (Greens/EFA, IT) praised Mr Zapatero for his "European-minded position and courage of organising a referendum" on the European Constitutional Treaty. "We also appreciated what you said on integration, even though it was not always followed up by action." She stated that she had missed Mr Zapatero during the constitutional crisis, which was in the end "concluded without much glory or passion." The agenda, she said, was dictated by enemies of the constitution, the friends of the constitution, like you, were far too discreet." On climate change, Ms Frassoni said that Spain was "far away from the Kyoto objectives." She hoped that with the election commitment the Prime Minister had made on climate change, Spain will move forward decisively."
Francis WURTZ (GUE/NGL, FR) thanked the Spanish Prime Minster for a "wonderful speech. In many ways, he said, it was a humanist speech, as well as something which is idealistic for the future. Mr Wurtz said that a social Europe "basically is still to be built - the current framework of European social policy is an open market economy where you have competition." This would foster competition of social models, tending to lead to a downward spiral in salaries and social rights. "This is one of the main problems" he concluded.
Graham BOOTH (IND/DEM, UK) said: "Prime Minister, It is a pleasure to see you here in Brussels. You are an exemplar to other European heads of government as a man who allowed your own people to decide whether they wished to have the Constitution. For that you must be applauded. In the event the people of Spain voted overwhelmingly to support the plans.
What I would like to know is why you have no intention of repeating the exercise? After all you should be confident that you will get a similar result. Is it because, as you have said the Reform Treaty has "not let a single substantial point of the Constitutional treaty go"?
This of course is key to all our futures. Either the political elite don't care what people want, as in the case of Mr Sarkozy and Mr Brown, or they feel that the people are too stupid to make any decision more important than what burger to buy at McDonalds. It seems to me that the European Union is rapidly becoming the world's first post democratic state I can tell you this Prime Minister, if the European elite do not allow the people to speak, then in the end they will find other ways to make their voice heard".
Frank VANHECKE (NI, BE) said that the big challenge facing the EU is the lack of democratic decision-making. The EU Institutions, he said, increasingly ignore the people and decisions are taken behind people's backs and there is no proper scrutiny. He said that everyone is aware that the Reform Treaty is a scarcely altered version of the Constitution. "Despite the No in two countries, eurocrats will have their way, they will be smug, but there won't be democracy. Europe is descending into an elite run superstate devoid of democracy", he concluded.
British speakers
Andrew DUFF (ALDE, UK) thanked the Prime Minister for his refreshing speech about political union. Noting that, in a fortnight, the Prime Minister will be in the December European Council discussing with President Sarkozy the proposal to establish a ‘comité de sages’. he asked the Prime Minister to please tell President Sarkozy that "we ought not to upset the prospects for the ratification of the Treaty by reopening the quarrels about procedures and the balance of power; and also say to him that it is not sensible to try to set the geographical frontiers of Europe. The enlargement process is firmly set and established. Europe will find its final shape when European countries as yet outside the Union stop wanting to join us."
Roger HELMER (NI, UK) stated that the Lisbon Treaty, or rather the renamed Constitution, is the Constitution that was decisively rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and which we are now seeking to force through without the consent of the people.
Across the 27 Member States, he said, opinion polls show that a majority of citizens want a referendum on the Treaty. In the UK, he said, 80% want a referendum and two-thirds would vote ‘no’, "yet our government denies us the vote it solemnly pledged in its election manifesto."
While the Prime Minister, he said, spoke of a Europe of democracy but Europe tramples on public opinion. "The contempt we show for public opinion makes a mockery of our claim to be a union of values. Over and over again my constituents tell me they voted in 1975 for a free trade area, not a political union. It is time to dismantle the supranational political structures of the EU and return to the simple trading group which the British people were promised in 1972."
Spanish Prime Minister responds to the debate
Responding to the debate, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero reaffirmed the need for a common policy on immigration, the only solution which would avoid "the temptation to criticise the policies of other Member States". The Prime Minister also underlined that his government " was the on only one to be successful in reducing increases in greenhouse gas emissions", and concluded "I felt European when I came into this House of Europeans, and in leaving, I feel even more European".

Fundamental rights
European Parliament approves the Charter of Fundamental Rights and urges UK and Poland to apply it
2007-11-30 - 11:50
The European Parliament gave its assent to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union with 534 votes in favour 85 against and 21 abstentions. MEPs also adopted an amendment with 477 votes in favour, 106 against and 35 abstentions urging Poland and the United Kingdom to make every effort to arrive, after all, at a consensus on the unrestricted applicability of the Charter. The UK has a special protocol on its application which makes clear that the Charter will not extend the powers of any court –UK or European – to strike down UK legislation. On Wednesday 12 December in Strasbourg, the European Parliament will hold a ceremony on the proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
The Charter sets out in one place the rights which citizens across the EU already have, for example through the European Convention on Human Rights, or through existing EU law. Its aim is to ensure that EU institutions respect those fundamental rights. The Charter reaffirms existing rights and will apply to all Member States when they implement Union law.
Position of the UK and Poland
There is a UK-specific protocol (see link below) which makes clear that the Charter will:
Not extend the powers of any court –UK or European – to strike down UK legislation; and
Not create any new justifiable rights in the UK. For example, it will not create any greater social or economic rights than are already provided in UK law. (The same applies to Poland) EP Press Release 29.11.2007 with added links Texts adopted 28-29 November 2007

MEPs tighten EU rules on gun ownership
2007-11-30 - 11:50
MEPs adopted a legislative report which calls for new measures to update a 1991 directive on firearms to bring it into line with a UN Protocol on firearms and to generally update the text. The new agreed legislation classifies convertible weapons as firearms, ensure that all firearms sold in the EU are traceable to their owners. The legislation introduces rules enhancing safety with respect to gun ownership, while not inconveniencing hunters, target shooters and other legitimate owners. It ensures clear and coherent marking and maintenance of a database system to aid traceability. The legislation ensures those under 18 are prohibited from acquiring and possessing firearms, except for hunting or target shooting purposes with parental permission or under the guidance of a licensed adult; and include a review of the sale of replica weapons across the EU, by 2010, with a view to bringing them under the control of the legislation as well.
The new directive, which will amend the current text passed in 1991, will tackle the criminal use of firearms without inconveniencing legal users of weapons. The text adopted by the EP is a result of 18 months of work which has led to a first reading compromise with the Council and was adopted with 588 votes in favour, 14 against and 11 abstentions.
The text includes control of the sale of guns over the internet, reinforcement of the marking system, computerisation and extension of the period of the record keeping and an increased exchange of information between Member States.
The report, drafted by Gisela Kallenbach (Greens/EFA, DE), broadly endorses a Commission proposal to update the EU's 1991 directive on the "acquisition and possession of weapons", so as to bring it into line with a UN Protocol against the illicit manufacturing and trafficking of firearms, signed by the EC in 2001. The text proposed by the European Parliament is a result of 18 months of work which has led to a first reading compromise with the Council.
Speaking on the first-reading agreement with the Council, Gisela Kallenbach said: "I am convinced that we finally agreed on a good compromise (with the Council), particularly ensuring the rights of legal users of weapons while also tackling the illegal aspects to improve the safety for European Citizens. The substance of the committee's concerns has been maintained in the final text. This result therefore represents a success for the Parliament's negotiating strategy. Let me thank all participants for the close cooperation as well as the constructive atmosphere during these negotiations."
Arlene McCarthy, Chair of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee (PES, Labour, North West UK) said in the debate on 28 November 2007: "I am speaking as a concerned MEP, and not as committee chairwoman. I believe that, with this new law on weapons, we can demonstrate to our citizens that Europe can act to tackle the problem of illegal guns. We have tough laws in Britain, but without this EU law guns will continue to find their way onto the streets of cities like Manchester and Liverpool."
The scope of the directive to be enlarged
The new directive would cover the possession and the acquisition of firearms but also of their parts and ammunition, including these imported from third countries. The Directive would as well apply to illicit manufacturing and trafficking of weapons and their essential components. Additionally, convertible weapons are brought within the new definition of 'firearm'. Such weapons have been identified by the police in many Member States as a growing source of firearms for criminals. The rules on acquisition and possession of weapons by individual collectors or officially recognised bodies concerned with the historical and cultural aspects of firearms remain unchanged. The text also says that the directive should cover "selling by means of distance communications" (e.g. via the internet), which should be "strictly controlled" by those Member States who allow it at all.
Better marking, details on file for 20 years
In order to make weapons traceability more efficient, the text requires the use of alphanumeric symbols. The marking, affixed to an "essential component of the firearm", must include the name of manufacturer, the place and the year of fabrication and the serial number.
MEPs say that Member States should maintain "a computerised data filing system", including the identification information of each firearm subject to the directive. Furthermore, whereas the Commission had proposed that such data be kept in registers for 10 years (the minimum required under the UN Protocol), MEPs feel that it should be "for not less than 20 years", given the very long lifespan of firearms. The MEPs also want to make more detailed the recorded data including type, make, model, calibre, serial number, names and addresses of the supplier and the person acquiring or possessing the weapon.
Data exchange and cooperation between Member States
MEPs also require Member States to exchange information to ensure an efficient application of the directive, with the assistance of a contact group to be set up by the Commission.
Make the live easier for legal users
The directive will not inconvenience legal users of firearms, such as hunters and target shooters. The four category system for classifying firearms is retailed, although several Member States have simplified the system by only using two categories. These Member States, according with the subsidiary principle, can go further than the directive and keep their stricter classification systems in the national gun law. The Commission will evaluate the four category system by 2012, with a view to the possibilities to enhance the functioning of the internal market in this area.
Member States will no longer be allowed to make acceptance of the European firearms pass conditional upon the payment of any fee or charge.
The text also calls Member States to simplify administrative procedure of authorisation to acquire and possess firearms.
Entry into force and implementation
The directive is expected to come into force by January 2008, with a transposition deadline by 2010.
Member States can have stricter rules and criminal sanctions
Member States would remain free to introduce stricter rules in their national legislation implementing the directive.
The UN Protocol, which Member States have undertaken to implement, requires that certain criminal sanctions are introduced into Member State law. The directive will contain a reminder of that. Text adopted 28-29 November 2007

Climate change: the role of trade policy
2007-11-30 - 11:50
As the scientific and political consensus on the seriousness of climate change grows, all policy areas of the industrialised nations are coming under scrutiny, including the EU's own trade policy. An own-initiative report by the European Parliament's takes a close look at this issue. The report, drafted by Alain Lipietz (Greens/EFA, FR), argues that "the current economic model, which entails constant maximisation of consumption, production and trade, is unsustainable as this results in ever-increasing demand for resources and transport and a growing quantity of waste and emissions".
Environmental cost of transporting goods is often overlooked
For two decades, international trade has been growing at a rate of two to two and a half times the rate of global production, as a result of the search for an international division of labour that optimises salary and tax costs - but in a context where greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are not properly internalised into transport costs. More specifically, the volume of sea transport is 40 times that of air transport (in tonnes/km) and yet produces only twice its greenhouse gas (GHG) contamination, whilst lorries produce 4 times more GHG emissions than trains per tonne/km.
How much carbon to transport a lamb chop?
The European Parliament therefore stresses the need "to raise public awareness of consumer products' total environmental costs" and "calls on the Commission and the Council to propose measures for the provision of information on the energy consumed, and greenhouse gases emitted, during the manufacture and transport of products placed on sale within the EU". A good example is the UK Government's proposal to introduce carbon footprint product labels displaying the level of CO2 emissions caused by the production, transport and eventual disposal of a product.
The rapporteur stresses that the means of transport is just as important as the distance a product has travelled: for a British consumer, a New Zealand lamb chop has a higher GHG cost than an English chop if it arrives by plane, but not if it arrives by boat. Therefore it is the GHG content that must be assessed.
International cooperation
Among its proposals the report argues for strong cooperation between the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the Climate Change Convention and the WTO, and asks the Commission to develop an initiative to support this aim.
The House calls on the Commission to ensure that energy and particularly the question of renewable energy and efficiency, and their connection to energy security, becomes an integral part of all external EU relations, with a particular emphasis on the European Neighbourhood Policy.
MEPs invite the Commission to consider whether it would be appropriate to evaluate the rules on trade defence measures, such as the rules on anti-dumping or subsidies, under the WTO aegis, with a view to taking into account, in some way, the disrespect of global, social and environmental agreements or international covenants as forms of dumping or undue subsidy.
Environmental protection clauses in trade agreements?
The report also urges the Commission "to systematically include environmental protection clauses, with special reference to reducing carbon dioxide emissions, in its trade agreements with third countries". It adds that "the transfer of energy efficient and other environmentally friendly technologies from the EU to developing countries has a crucial role to play in decoupling economic development from greenhouse gas emissions". And among other things, the report urges industrialised countries to take responsibility for the widespread deforestation caused by international trade. Adopted text 28-29 November 2007

New TV and product placement rules should be applied before end 2009
2007-11-30 - 11:50
The European Parliament approved new EU rules on TV advertising and product placement. The new directive on Audiovisual Media Services is a modernisation of the 'TV without frontiers' directive and now also covers new media services such as Web TV and on-demand services. With the Parliament's approval today, the rules would have to be implemented in the Member States by the end of 2009. The Parliaments' rapporteur Ruth Hieronymi (EPP-ED, DE) was satisfied with the Parliaments approval of the Council common position, which was a result of negotiations between Parliament and Council that took into account most of the concerns raised in Parliament's first reading.
"The modernisation of the rules for television comes just in time," Ms Hieronymi said during the debate Wednesday in Brussels, and underlined the importance of the new rules especially in view of the coming telecom-packages and directive on-line content.
New rules on advertising and product placement
The new rules update the 1997 Television without Frontiers directive, now to be dubbed the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, to keep pace with developments in audiovisual technology and advertising. They will apply to "TV-like services" such as web-streamed TV programmes, but not to private web sites. TV-programmes 'on-demand' from for instance the Internet will be covered by the qualitative rules concerning protection of minors and product placement - but not on the rules concerning the amount of time allowed for advertising.
One innovation is the rules on "product placement", whereby a specific product is placed in TV-programmes for commercial purposes. This would be allowed only in a limited range of programmes, and then only under strict rules. It would be prohibited in news and current affairs programmes, children's programmes, documentaries and programmes providing advice. Parliament has ensured, that signals must appear when a programme containing product placement starts, when it ends and after commercial breaks. Members states can still choose to have a ban on product placement.
Commercial breaks every half-hour
Commercial breaks will be permitted every 30 minutes in TV films, cinematographic works and news programmes. In children's programmes, commercial breaks will not be allowed unless the programmes are more than 30 minutes long. There are no insertion rules for other types of programmes, such as serials. The maximum of amount of advertising permitted under the new rules would not exceed be 12 minutes an hour.
Furthermore, Member States and the Commission are required to encourage media service providers to develop codes of conduct towards children, for example to preclude junk food commercials aimed at children.
Parliament also ensured that a provision on access to media services for disabled people was included in the legislation itself, and not just the introductory remarks, and included an the obligation for Member states to ensure that the directive's application is overseen by independent regulatory bodies.
Procedure
The new rules were given their first reading in Parliament in December 2006. Then negotiations between Parliament and the Council took place and a political agreement backed by the Committee on Culture and Education was reached in May 2007. Since May lawyer-linguists have been working on the final version, which was officially adopted in the Council on 15 October and the Culture and Education Committee on 12 November.

EP calls on Georgia to respect democratic principles and freedom of expression
2007-11-30 - 11:50
The European Parliament held a debate during the Strasbourg plenary on 14 November, debating the situation in Georgia along with the EU's Neighbourhood Policy. The resolution following this debate was voted in Brussels, and calls on the Georgian authorities to "respect the principle of freedom of expression, including freedom of assembly and freedom of the media," and to investigate violations of human rights and the freedom of the media during the past few weeks. After a week-long series of opposition protests in Tbilisi, which were dispersed using tear-gas, rubber bullets and water cannons, Georgian President Mikhail Saakishvili imposed a state of emergency on the country on 7 November. He blamed Russian agents for inciting the protests, and expelled some Russian embassy officials. A few days later, President Saakishvili announced early presidential elections for 5 January, 2008, which was one of the key demands of the opposition. He has also lifted the state of emergency on 16 November.
Political developments
The House welcomed the announcement of early elections, and "calls upon the Georgian authorities to ensure free and fair elections," with "impartial access to the media during the election campaign." MEPs also call on "all parties to show openness and restraint, tone down statements and engage in a constructive and fruitful dialogue aimed at supporting and consolidating Georgia's fragile democratic institutions." Finally, the Parliament encourages all Georgian political forces to start a debate that could lead to a more open public discussion about the pressing issue of the country, such as: 'the Russian factor' in Georgian politics, the fate of frozen conflicts, and the social implications of economic reforms.
Russia
The resolution also considers that "the EU must adopt a more resolute stance on crucial issues in the region and become more deeply involved, despite Russia’s current negative attitude towards the EU’s role in their common neighbourhood," and underlines that "in the end, it is up to the Russian authorities to understand that it is not so much geopolitical rivalry with the EU that diminishes Russian influence in its neighbourhood, but Russia’s own approach to some of its neighbours."

Development and cooperation
MEPs back the role of international organisations in support of African agriculture
2007-11-30 - 11:50
MEPs adopted a report on "Advancing African Agriculture - Proposal for agricultural development and food security in Africa" which emphasises the important role the EU should play, in international institutions such as the WTO, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, defending vigorously the right of African states to protect national and regional markets on the African continent against imports threatening the survival of local producers of essential agricultural products. A paragraph which expressed great regret at the prospect of the attendance of international outcast Robert Mugabe at the Lisbon EU-Africa Summit 8-9 December, whose presence will do much to discredit the good work of the Summit on democratic governance was deleted from the report by the vote in plenary.

Tourism
European Parliament favours single EC quality mark for tourist accommodation
2007-11-30 - 11:50
A three-star label does not always guarantee the same hotel quality standards in Amsterdam as in Athens. Plans for an EU-wide classification of tourist accommodation, an EC quality mark, and visa, labelling, health tourism, accessibility and promotion measures to boost the European tourism market, are set out in an own-initiative report adopted by the European Parliament by 536 votes in favour to 58 against and 22 abstentions. The difficulty of developing a consistent cross-policy approach to tourism at EU level has resulted in various drawbacks that have hampered growth in tourism and increase the risk that Europe could lose market share. To remedy these drawbacks, measures are needed in the following fields, says the report, which was drafted by Transport and Tourism Committee chair Paolo Costa (ALDE, IT)
Visa policy
MEPs call on the Schengen Member States to establish common consular desks for granting visas to non-EU applicants, and highlighted the need to simplify and reduce the cost of visa application procedures. These desks should apply the same visa criteria and improve the welcome offered to visa applicants. Procedures should also be simplified for tourists issued with visas for non-Schengen EU countries, within the limits of security rules required to combat illegal immigration, terrorism and cross-border crime, they added.
Labels
MEPs take the view that the EU's multiplicity of local labels needs to be consolidated, for better international recognition. They therefore called on the Commission, in co-operation with the European catering trade organisation, HOTREC to promote common tourist accommodation labelling processes in the different Member States and to promote quality models that had proved effective elsewhere (for example the Qualmark in New Zealand), in order to improve visibility.
Health tourism
The House also says that to combat a decline in health tourism, there was a need for a specific Community directive to define the recognition and use of hydro-thermal resorts and the role of health tourism and thermal cures in connection with tourist facilities. This is a sector in which additional resources could help to create a significant amount of new direct and indirect employment, it added.
Accessible tourism
Member States and the Commission were called on to initialize an "Access for all" EC label that would guarantee the accessibility of facilities to people with reduced mobility. This label would cover facilities such as accommodation, restaurants, leisure and natural sites, monuments and museums.
Promoting EU destinations
MEPs welcome the implementation of a selection process for a yearly "European destination of excellence" as Parliament had proposed in September 2005.
Cyclists and the Iron Curtain
Finally, the European Parliament urges the Commission to promote the cross-border memorial cycle route along the former Iron Curtain, as an example of "gentle mobility in tourism" and as a symbol of the reunification of Europe. Texts adopted 28-29 November 2007

Employment policy
Labour market should reflect a good balance of flexibility and employment security
2007-11-30 - 11:50
The European Council should adopt a balanced approach towards flexicurity which should include key principles like adaptable and reliable contracts, investment in lifelong learning, and a core of rights regardless of workers' employment status, says an own-initiative report adopted by the European Parliament. The report was adopted by 496 votes in favour, 92 against with 49 abstentions. The report stresses that the set of common principles of flexicurity which the European Council is to adopt during its next meeting on 13 and 14 December should include the following principles:
promoting stable employment relationships and sustainable labour market practices,
action for adaptable and reliable contractual arrangements and action against abusive labour practices especially in certain non-standard contracts,
promoting employment security and improving job security: all workers should have a core of rights regardless of their employment status,
reconciliation of employment and family or private life, and the promotion of the concept of "decent work",
partnership between government, social partners and civil society in managing change,
gender equality and promoting equal opportunities for all,
design and implementation of national pathways in close consultation with social partners, in accordance with national customs and practices,
enhancement of companies and workers' adaptability by strengthening transition security by better mobilising active labour market policies,
the need for a skilled and adaptable labour force, therefore combining active labour market policies with investment in lifelong learning to enhance employability,
a macro-economic framework for balanced and sustainable growth and more and better jobs
After the adoption by the European Council the common principles should become part of the "Integrated Guidelines for Growth and Jobs" and should thus be incorporated into Member States' national reform programmes.
No progress on key employment dossiers in Council
MEPs regret that "the Council has failed to progress key employment dossiers which could help promote flexicurity as a positive concept". Rapporteur Ole Christensen (PSE, DK) stated that "Directives such as Working Time, Temporary Agency, Posting of Workers and the European Works Council [...] need to guarantee and raise the protection of employees across the EU in order to enhance their trust and to balance the risks associated with the pressures of enhanced competition, restructuring and labour market flexibility".
More training and retraining programmes and integration of older workers into the labour market
MEPs believe that one of the EU's biggest problems concern "the supply of a skilled and adaptable workforce in competitive and innovative companies". Therefore, apprenticeship opportunities, training and retraining programmes should be extended, they say.
Member States and social partners should change their policies of putting workers into early retirement, says the report. The Parliament advocates a "flexible retirement of older workers" e.g. through part-time employment, job-sharing and similar schemes that promote active ageing.
Social benefits for women during transitional periods
Women are over-represented in non-standard employment i.e. fixed-term or part-time contracts, states the report. As they frequently have to switch between work and care activities, women need proper protection and social benefits during transitional periods, say MEPs. Adopted texts 28-29 November 2007

Humanitarian aid
MEPs welcome the consensus on humanitarian aid
2007-11-30 - 11:50
In adopting a joint resolution on the proclamation of a European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid, MEPs welcome the fact that for the first time the Council, the representatives of the Governments of the Member States meeting within the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission have agreed to define a common vision, policy objectives and shared principles for the delivery of more effective EU humanitarian aid in third countries.

Judicial cooperation
Civil and commercial court judgments to be recognised EU-wide under Rome I regulation
2007-11-30 - 11:50
The European Parliament approved the Rome I regulation, which is designed to improve the recognition and enforcement in all EU Member States of court judgments on contractual obligations. MEPs adopted the report by Cristian Dumitrescu (PES, RO) on the Rome I regulation. This adopted text, which reflects an agreement with Council for a first reading adoption, will provide common EU rules on the choice of the law to apply in case of cross-border disputes concerning contracts. In order to improve the mutual enforcement of court judgments among Member States, EU-wide rules are needed governing the choice of the applicable law. It is important that, if citizens are free to choose the court where they can make their claim, they cannot simply choose the courts of one Member State rather than another just because the law is more favourable to their cause there (a practice known as "forum-shopping").
As a basic rule, two persons who stipulate a contract are free to choose the law applicable in the event of a dispute. If no choice is made, to avoid forum-shopping, the regulation would introduce common EU rules on the choice of the applicable law.
Rules for consumer-business conflicts
The approved text provides, as a general rule, that, in the case of a contract between a professional and a consumer, the latter should be advantaged by the choice of the court. In fact, the adopted states that the applicable law should in general be the most familiar one, i.e. the law of the country where the consumer has his habitual residence.
However, according to Members, this would be a costly solution for small and medium sized business (SMEs), which do not have resources to comply with 27 different national legislations. This would be particularly true for e-trade firms.
Therefore, the EP successfully proposed to make an exception to the general rule that consumer's law should always apply. In fact, it will be possible for the parties involved in the dispute to make a choice of law. This will enable an e-trader to be free to impose his law when proposing a contract to a consumer.
In addition, the approved regulation also provides that the choice of the applicable law is always subject to the rules of the consumer's country of residence, thus offering a solution that is at the same time consumer-friendly and small business-friendly.
Finally, Parliament has managed to preserve the exception for cases in which consumers are provided with services in another country. As a result, bed & breakfast businesses, for instance, will be free to advertise their services on the net without fearing to break national laws on consumers' protection.
As far as individual contracts of employment are concerned, where the law applicable has not been chosen by the parties, the contract would be governed by the law of the country in which the employee habitually carries out his work.
Family matters excluded from the legislation
Obligations arising out of family relationships, from matrimonial property regimes, wills and succession are excluded from the scope of the regulation.
The Parliament called on the Commission to present, no later than two years after the date of application, a report on the implementation of this regulation.
Together with the recently approved Rome II regulation on non-contractual matters, this regulation provides a complete set of Community rules of private international law relating to contractual and non-contractual obligations. Adopted texts 28-29 November 2007

Budgetary control
MEPs approve seven Members of the Court of Auditors
2007-11-30 - 11:50
The House voted (by secret ballot) to approve seven Members of the Court of Auditors. MEPs in the Budgetary Control Committee had already given a favourable opinion of all the candidates but called for the appointment procedure to be reviewed, as Parliament is at present only consulted on the names put forward by the Council. With the mandate of seven Members of the Court expiring on 31 December 2007, the Budgetary Control Committee interviewed David Bostock (United Kingdom), Michel Cretin (France), Maarten Engwirda (Netherlands), Henri Grethen (Luxembourg), Harald Noack (Germany), Ioannis Sarmas (Greece) and Hubert Weber (Austria).
In the reports by Ines Ayala-Sender (PES, ES) which will be forwarded to the plenary so that the consultation procedure can be completed, MEPs stress their wish for the criteria for these appointments to be revised, partly because of difficulties encountered in past procedures.
"Closer cooperation is needed between Parliament and Council on the appointment procedure", said the rapporteur and Herbert Bösch (PES, AT), chair of the committee. "A more efficient and coherent procedure is needed in Parliament's view and the EP would also like to receive the information on the candidates sufficiently far in advance".
NB: Messrs Weber, Bostock, Sarmas and Engwirda were being re-appointed Adopted texts 28-29 November 2007
