Poster After more than 50 years of equal pay legislation in the EU, women still have to work 70 minutes in order to earn the same as men do in an hour. On International Women's Day this Thursday you will be able to follow a debate between MEPs and their national counterparts about how to change this live on our website. You will also have the chance to ask Mikael Gustafsson, chair of the EP's women's rights committee, about what he thinks should be done during a Facebook chat that same day.

Interparliamentary meeting: 900-1230 CET (watch it live on our website, see link on the right)
Facebook chat with Mikael Gustafsson: 1500-1545 CET (join us, see link on the right)
