Aggravation over Agriculture - again

It is difficult to be neutral about the European Union's Common Agriculture Policy (CAP). To its supporters the policy has guaranteed a plentiful and stable food supply for Europe. The CAP is also the most integrated of the EU's policies and is held up as proof that real policy integration is. To its critics, the economic inefficiency of the CAP is the main complaint. Subsidies to farmers, high prices for consumers and farm surpluses are the most-often voiced complaints about the policy.
The CAP comes to the European Parliament
The scrutiny of agriculture policy has been particularly intense over the last few weeks as EU leaders argue over the budget allocation for the Union between 2007 and 2013. As the agriculture and rural development budget accounts for 46% of EU spending annually - or some €50 billion a year - it is central to the debate and to the direction the EU will take in the coming years. In particular, the budget allocation is seen as having a vital link between the drive for economic reform in Europe through the so called "Lisbon Strategy". The aim of this strategy is to tackle low productivity, high unemployment and economic stagnation in Europe through reform and investment in research and education. In the words of the official communiqué the ambition is "to make the EU the world's most dynamic and competitive economy" by 2010.
In the aftermath of the failed European Council in June, when EU leaders could not agree a budgetary framework for the forthcoming years, the future and purpose of the CAP and the budget as a whole became the centre of often bitter political exchanges. In the European Parliament, Jean-Claude Juncker, the Prime Minister of Luxemburg and the holder of the rotating EU Presidency, called the failure of the budget talks "a crisis, but not just a financial crisis". His last words echoed around the Parliamentary chamber and prompted a standing ovation as he declared that "our generation does not have the right to unpick the achievements of our predecessors".
As fate would have it, the UK Prime Minister Tony Blair was due to address the Parliament to launch the UK's Presidency of the EU the following day. Addressing the Parliament Mr Blair put the arguments over the budget into the context of the wider European crisis following the rejection of the European Constitution by France and the Netherlands. He said that this reflected a wider disenchantment with Europe and that it was time to "give ourselves a reality check". He added that a budget settlement should be part of the solution, not "abstracted from it". Mr Blair urged Europe to implement the Lisbon agenda and adopt a budget along the lines of the Sapir report (see link below) in 2003.
The leader of the Conservative block in the Parliament, Hans-Gert Poettering, said that the failure to reach an agreement was not "tragic" in itself, but combined with the two "no" votes, Europe was "in a crisis". On a positive note "it was a triumph for democracy as people can and are participating in the debate". The leader of the Socialist group in the Parliament, Martin Schulz, called for "decent jobs that offer security and secure wages". As to the debate over research versus agricultural spending, he said "it is like comparing chalk and cheese." Graham Watson for the Liberal group stated that "third world development, climate change and the fight against international crime are the biggest challenges". He wondered how these could be tackled if countries would not contribute more to the budget. All of these political viewpoints are represented in the Parliament's Budget Committee which approves the annual expenditure of the EU.
Agriculture - why is it such a sacred cow?
Why is agriculture so special? Why does it have a special place in the EU and is enshrined in the founding Treaties of the Union? There are three reasons generally highlighted; firstly public intervention stabilises agriculture prices which would otherwise fluctuate due to weather conditions. If prices go up, it will fuel inflation, as food generally accounts for 20% of a household budget. The second argument is that self sufficiency in food supply is desirable politically, economically and from a psychological point of view. This will protect Europe from international trading conditions. Finally, the third is to encourage farmers to stay on the land to manage and sustain the rural environment and landscape.
These arguments have powerful supporters and critics. The countries most often associated with protecting agriculture are France, (which accounts for 22.5 percent of agricultural production) Ireland, Belgium and Spain. There is also the organised farm lobby - with over 130 EU-wide agriculture groups alone. The critics of the CAP do not enjoy the unity or vigour that would allow them to make a powerful counter argument. The "natural opponents" of the CAP - mainly consumers and environmentalists - are relatively weak in comparison. Unlike the farming community who constitute a clear section of the population, they do not have a clearly defined common interest and are more widely dispersed. Increasingly, the CAP also finds itself under the spotlight from anti-poverty campaigners who claim that it prevents farmers in developing countries having a fair market for their produce. Some have coalesced around the "make poverty history" group which campaigns for fairer trade and better access to western markets for small farmers in the developing world.
Assessment - the consequences of the CAP
In Article 33 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, there are five priorities for the common agricultural policy. They are; to increase productivity, ensure a fair standard of living, stabilise markets, ensure the availability of prices and make sure that supplies reach consumers. Has it succeeded? Efficiency has certainly increased due to modernisation. While the number of people engaged in agriculture has fallen by 60 percent since the CAP was created - output has increased steadily by about 1.7 per annum since the 1970's. Agricultural incomes have grown according to other sectors - larger farms have done particular well, as have those who produce dairy products, cereal and beef (relative to those that produce Mediterranean goods). In addition markets have been stabilised and the EU is self-sufficient in the food that its climate could support. As for reasonable prices, that's a matter of debate.
Despite these successes, the dominance that the CAP has had over the EU has made it difficult to pursue other policies. Despite the reforms of the 1960's and 1980's it still accounts for almost half of the Union's budget. The CAP has fuelled tensions and arguments within the EU over different aspects of agriculture policy - the current dispute being just the latest. The CAP has also led to many trading disputes, not least with America. Finally, the intensive farming practices that the CAP encourages have undoubtedly damaged the environment and had food safety implications. The most obvious would be the outbreak of BSE. These concerns have attempted to be addressed in the reforms of 1992 and 1999 and the creation of a European Food Safety Authority in 2002. The only certainty for the future is that agriculture policy will continue to dominate the European Union.
