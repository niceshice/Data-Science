They all picked up honours at this years Cannes film festival and all were part financed by the European Union's MEDIA programme. Since 2000 eight of the illustrious Palme d'Or winners have been financed by the EU. Some films have also picked up several Oscars, notably "Slumdog Millionaire".
Commented on the awards the Chair of Parliament's Culture Committee Doris Pack MEP said "the results in Cannes are very pleasant but it's not a surprise. It's a sign of the excellent quality of the European films. These films are often made possible thanks to the support of the MEDIA programme".
"Of Gods and Men"
The "Grand Prix" - the Festival's second prize after the "Palme d'Or" - was awarded to the French "Of Gods and Men", by French film maker Xavier Beauvois. The film is based on the true story of kidnapping and killing of a group of Christian Monks in the mountains of Algeria by fundamentalist Islamists in 1996.
The award for Best Director was given to Frenchman Mathieu Amalric whose "On tour", tells the story a team of Burlesque strip-teasers dreaming of fame and success in Paris.
"Certified Copy"
Finally, the intriguing French actress Juliette Binoche was awarded the Best Actress prize for the movie "Certified Copy" by Iranian filmaker Abbas Kiarostami. She plays the role of a gallery owner who hooks up with a British art historian in Tuscany.
Mrs Pack also stressed the importance of home grown films saying "European films tell European stories, they reveal the European soul. During decades, we only watched Hollywood films and thus the "American way of life".
