Streaming photo Greece, the impact of austerity measures and how to revive its economy will be discussed at a meeting of the EP's employment and economic affairs committees. MEPs will question members of the Troika - consisting of the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund - about their recent mission to Greece and the rationale behind the austerity efforts demanded of Athens. Watch the meeting live on our website on Tuesday 27 March from 1700 CET.
