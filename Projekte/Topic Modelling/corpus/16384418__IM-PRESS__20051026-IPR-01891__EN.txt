The European Parliament is calling for 1 and 2 euro banknotes to be issued. A majority of MEPs signed up to a written declaration to this effect and this was formally adopted during present plenary session in Strasbourg.
Some 371 MEPs put their names to a written declaration drawn up by Amalia SARTORI (EPP-ED, IT) which argues that many European citizens are still unhappy about the euro, and that the absence of 1 and 2 euro banknotes has an effect on people's perception of how much the equivalent coins are worth and an adverse effect on the perceived value of cents. They say the issuing and circulation of 1 and 2 euro banknotes would have a positive effect on inflation and keeping the cost of living under control, and that this change is all the more necessary in view of the forthcoming introduction of the single currency in the new Member States. In view of what Parliament says are unquestionable advantages for all Member States, it calls on the Commission, the Council and the European Central Bank to recognise the need to issue 1 and 2 euro banknotes.
A written declaration is deemed adopted by Parliament without debate if more than half the MEPs sign up to it in the three months after it is submitted by its authors.
