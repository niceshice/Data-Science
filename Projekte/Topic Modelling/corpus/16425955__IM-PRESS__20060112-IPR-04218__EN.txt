Financial perspective 2007-13: Council's current position rejected
Budget
2006-01-12 - 12:36
The Council's position on the financial perspective for 2007-2013 has been "rejected" by MEPs because it "does not guarantee an EU budget enhancing prosperity, competitiveness, solidarity and cohesion", according to a draft resolution adopted on Wednesday by the Budgets Committee, whose members have thus issued a clear warning that Parliament intends to stand up for its policy priorities in the next EU budget.
The draft resolution calls for Parliament to be involved in the revision of the EU budget due to take place starting in 2008 (as laid down by the European Council). MEPs also want the negotiations on the financial perspective to take account of the question of the supervision and proper implementation of EU spending in the Member States.
The resolution stresses that the Council's position does not enable the EU "to face new challenges" . The Member States have limited themselves to financing "traditional policies with redistributive character" , say members of the Budgets Committee, who are disappointed that the Council has given priority to "national interests" rather than to fostering the "European dimension " of the EU budget.
However, the Budgets Committee believes that the Council's position, which was achieved at the last minute at the summit of heads of state or government on 15 and 16 December, enables "constructive negotiations" to be opened with Parliament on the financial perspective. The committee also hopes that the Austrian Presidency will be "entrusted with a real negotiating mandate" .
Parliament's President, Josep Borrell, will meet his counterparts in the Council and Commission on 18 January in Strasbourg to agree on the procedure and timetable for the negotiations. Another multilateral meeting is scheduled for 23 January and the Commission will present a proposal for a new interinstitutional agreement on 1 February.
