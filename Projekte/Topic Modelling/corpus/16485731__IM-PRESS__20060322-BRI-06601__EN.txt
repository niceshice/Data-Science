Opening of the session : Reaction to ETA ceasefire
2006-04-25 - 10:12
President Josep BORRELL opened this Parliamentary session with an announcement which, he said, was good news for Spain and for the whole of Europe.
" A communiqué has been issued by the ETA announcing a permanent ceasefire. We can now glimpse a future in Spain without terrorist violence. Obviously, this is a time to remain calm and be cautious, and also remember the many victims of terrorism. It is a time for hope and for all democratic forces to work together. It is good news for the whole of Europe, as it shows one can fight terrorism from the castle of democracy ."
Socialist group leader Martin SCHULZ (DE) ceded the floor to Bárbara Dührkop Dührkop (PES, ES), whose husband was killed by the ETA. She said: " ETA's announcement of a permanent ceasefire is a terrifically hopeful piece of news for everybody in Spain and indeed in Europe. We are making a call for unity, for all democrats in Europe to stand together to build a definitive peace. I am quite emotional in saying this, but it is indeed a time to think of the victims of ETA ."
Hans-Gert POETTERING (EPP-ED, DE) also said it was time to think of the victims of ETA and their families. While welcoming the news, he insisted there should be no quid pro quo: " ETA should not expect anything in exchange. We look forward to peace across the Basque country and across the whole Spanish nation. "
Graham WATSON (UK) spoke for the ALDE group, saying it was a pleasure to celebrate something that can only be regarded as a victory. " In a democracy change comes through the ballot not the bullet. The actions of ETA, like the IRA, the Red Brigades and others have been terrorist actions and unjustifiable ." He looked forward to a peaceful future in Spain.
Daniel Cohn BENDIT (DE) spoke for the Greens/EFA group. He said the statement showed two things: " Democracies are right to resist terrorism and since we are right to do so, we also have to know how to negotiate and how to talk ." He congratulated all the political forces of Spain for standing firm against violence, and also for being willing to negotiate.
Brian CROWLEY (IE), of the UEN group, also welcomed the statement, although, he said, it came too late for the many victims of ETA. He said ceasefires and negotiations do not mean subjugation, but parity of esteem. In Spain as in Ireland, he said, "Lives were sacrificed needlessly because people refused to talk to each other on an equal footing. The EU is the best possible peace process", he said, saying it spread respect for dialogue and tolerance.
Jens-Peter BONDE (DK) for the IND/DEM group said he was very happy with this news. He said his own area of Denmark, near the German border, was another example where old enemies were now friends. "I hope peace will also be found in Spain and the Basque country."
A number of other speakers took the floor, including James ALLISTER (NA, UK), James NICHOLSON (EPP-ED, UK) and Proinsias DE ROSSA (PES, IE) who spoke of the lessons to be learned from the Northern Irish peace process. The question of how the Spanish government should react was also raised, notably by Alejo VIDAL QUADRAS (EPP-ED, ES) and Enrique BARÓN CRESPO (PSE, ES).

The role and power of the European political parties
2006-04-25 - 10:12
MEPs adopted a non-binding report by 498 votes in favour to 95 against with 7 abstentions on the status of European political parties. The report discusses the current structural conditions for political parties in the European Union and makes suggestions as to how to promote the stability and financial autonomy of these parties.
The report opens with the concept that political parties play a vital role in the procedure of promoting democracy within the EU - they are fundamental to the endorsement of the values of "freedom, tolerance, solidarity and gender equality". It remarks that they are the key element in the linking of public opinion with the actions of the European institutions. Correspondingly, it advises that political parties must "take on a further role than that of umbrella organisations and become active proponents of European policy options" in order to minimise the "gulf" between the European public and its institutions.
Bearing in mind the important role that political parties play, the House makes some suggestions as to how to strengthen the stability and autonomy of political parties as tools of representation. It notes the importance for any organisation - whether profit making or not - to have financial stability so that it can make long-term decisions with economic certainty. In correlation with this notion, the report notes that such financial stability is lacking for European political parties in that the grants given to them are subject to change every year, discouraging any proper financial self-management. In so doing, the current structures make the parties "financially highly dependent on the European Parliament", diminishing their power of autonomy. As do the limitations applied to the transfer of funds between the five budget categories. The disparity between the treatment of parties and that of institutions is also noted.
In view of their critique, Parliament advises some changes, including the following: a change in the timing of the payment of funds so that they are "in tune with the way the recipients work"; funding plans prepared for several years should be agreed; the political parties must be put in the position to make financial decisions in view of long-term planning; the regulations should allow for higher amounts of money to be transferred between the different budget categories; and an increase in the financial support that parties receive should be realised.
Finally, Parliament notes with satisfaction that, in terms of appointing staff, the political parties at European level have taken account of the principle of equal opportunities for women and men to a large extent, and encourages them to ensure a better representation of women and men on lists and among elected members.

Social policy
European Parliament delves into demographic change
2006-04-25 - 10:12
Europe is currently facing unprecedented demographic change. People are living longer and less children are born. In this context, the European Parliament adopted a report about the challenges for politics and society due to these changes. Key issues for the MEPs are employment promotion, more attention to family needs, the reconciliation of work and family life, a balanced immigration policy and encouragement for older people to work longer.
In view of the Commission's Green Paper "Confronting demographic change: a new solidarity between the generations" MEPs adopted a report by 448 votes in favour to 70 against with 20 abstentions concerning the new challenges in the wake of an ageing European population. The report, drafted by Philip Bushill-Matthews (EPP-ED, UK) suggests that an increase in employment and the prioritisation of family needs are the key issues for MEPs to consider.
Particularly with regard to the Lisbon Agenda and its aim to increase economic growth, the demographic change has to be taken seriously - the Commission notes that "never in history has there been economic growth without population growth" and considers there to be three basic trends concerning demographic change: a continuing increase in longevity; a continuing growth in the number of workers over 60; and continuing low birth rates. The report points out that, although demographic change demands adequate political measures, it "should not just be treated as a problem, but also represents a positive challenge to societies to engage those in all age groups and to offer opportunities which previously did not exist".
MEPs emphasise that these three basic trends require certain political measures to be taken: a better promotion of families; further attention to be paid to the importance of a balanced immigration policy; and the encouragement of older people to participate in the labour market. Further measures should be taken in order to foster a reconcilability of work and family life: "The improvement of work-life balance for individuals should be a perpetual priority for governments." The report suggests that this could be achieved, for example, through more flexible working hours, higher equality in the work-place, family-friendly tax policies and better accessibility to childcare and dependent-care facilities. They call upon the Member States to take such measures into account, and adapt their policies accordingly.
MEPs believe that solidarity between the generations means not only a better integration of young people - e.g. regarding their access to the labour market - but also the promotion of access to lifelong education and training for people of all ages. In this context "the emphasis should be to encourage and enable people to work longer."
The House calls on the Commission to underline the importance of demographic change and its challenges by understanding it as a horizontal task, with a view to mainstreaming it as an issue in all the Union's activities. Furthermore, the Commission should decide on a more intensive exchange of views at the Spring Summit. Appropriate studies, analyses and a peer review relating to demographic change and its impact on society should be carried out within the context of the Community programme PROGRESS.
MEPs underline the fact that numerous issues relating to demographic change in society fall exclusively within the sphere of competence of the Member States and that therefore there is no general Community competence for establishing European rules in this area.

Energy
Parliament wants new targets on energy security and energy supply
2006-04-25 - 10:12
MEPs adopted a joint resolution on security of energy supply in the European Union. The resolution, drafted on behalf of the EPP-ED, PES, ALDE and UEN groups urges the Commission and Council to realise a more resolute European energy policy, with "more concrete measures" and "to come forward with new, ambitious targets".
If no additional measures are taken, Europe will have to import a projected 71% of its energy in 2030. Recent energy disputes with Russia and the increase in the oil price show the need for action. Therefore, in adopting a joint resolution, Parliament underlines the need for a more ambitious Common European Energy Policy, focusing on renewable energy sources, solidarity between the Member States and the need to complete the internal market for electricity and gas.
The importance of security in the supply of energy
In 2002, the European Union's import dependency on energy was 48%, by 2030 this figure is "estimated to rise to 71%...if no additional measure is taken." In 2005, the primary energy consumption of the Union stood at 1700 million tonnes of oil equivalent, with this figure rising at an average rate of 0.8% per year. With this in mind, the resolution recognises the importance of energy security as one of the three main objectives for EU energy policy. Correspondingly, it recalls the "recent disputes over gas prices between Russia and its neighbours" and "recent increase in the price of crude oil", both of which demonstrated "the vulnerability of the supply and distribution of energy". The House calls on the Commission to strongly react to the market dominance and market imperfections as described in the 'sector inquiry' forwarded by DG Competition on 16 February 2006 and to submit new proposals for combating market dominance and market imperfections with a concrete set of actions and instruments. MEPs call for closer cooperation between European and national competition authorities in order to give a coordinated and truly European answer to the emerging national economic patriotism.
Methods for assuring such security
In order to realise better security within the area of energy supply, the text proposes further solidarity within the Union, an efficient working European internal market, better use of sustainable energy sources and further research and development in the area.
In response to the "difficulties related to the physical security of infrastructure and security of supply", the resolution emphasises the importance of solidarity within Europe, further cooperation with neighbouring countries and a "strengthening of the European Neighbourhood Policy". It also calls on the Commission to put forward a "mediation system" to deal with such cases of dispute over the distribution of energy.
The resolution considers that imperative to the maintenance of energy security is a "well functioning internal market", therefore it is concerned by "protectionist support for national market leaders", and "urges the Commission to ensure full implementation of the internal market rules to ensure fair and non-discriminatory competition and avoid the formation of oligopolistic energy markets".
The text also highlights the role of sustainability energy sources and "stresses the exceptional importance of renewable energy sources, along with energy efficiency". It therefore asks the Commission and Council to present "ambitious targets after 2010" for this area. Moreover the text calls on Member States to realise the targets of a "12% share of total energy consumption and 22.1% of electricity from RES by 2010". The resolution considers the area of energy-demand to be of relevance when considering levels of energy consumption. It therefore encourages measures to improve upon energy efficiency and promotes conservative strategies to reduce the rate of consumption. Correspondingly, it "notes the economic potential of saving a minimum of 20% of energy consumed" noting that "this potential will rise with energy prices, technological improvements and economies of sale". However, the resolution suggests that Member States should apply the principle of subsidiarity when it comes to policies on nuclear energy as it recognises nuclear energy to be "part of the European debate on the energy mix".
Within the area of research and development, the paper suggests that there is a need for better renewable energy technologies, more knowledge regarding conventional power stations and a development in the knowledge of nuclear fusion technology and its application.
Parliament recognises the role that nuclear energy currently plays in some Member States in maintaining security of electricity supply as part of the energy mix and as a way of avoiding CO2 emissions. Finally, the House insists that new strategies should be developed to reduce the possibilities of uranium and nuclear waste being used for the production and proliferation of nuclear weapons. MEPs therefore urge the Commission, the Council and the Member States to give their fullest support to the IAEA proposals to multilateralise the supply of fissile material for nuclear energy production .

MEPs condemn the Belarus elections - "It won't always be winter in Minsk"
2006-04-25 - 10:12
The House debated the recent Belarusian elections with all speakers condemning them as neither free nor fair. Several MEPs raised the issue of possible sanctions against the Belarusian authorities. Mr Hans Winkler, Austrian State Secretary for Foreign Affairs, said that it was very important to send a "clear signal" on Belarus. There had been concern for some time about repression of opposition groups and the series of measures taken against the opposition prior to the elections only served to boost this concern. The negative expectations were born out by events. The elections were not free or fair and did not meet OSCE standards. The EU Presidency took a clear stance on 20 March. The Council was now considering what practical measures could be taken against Belarus. The Council would support the strengthening of civil society and consider what further measures might be appropriate. The Council had also contacted Moldova, and Ukraine on this issue and it must also talk to Russia. "It is the last country in Europe where human rights are not respected." He quoted the Austrian Foreign Minister who said after the election "It won't always be winter in Minsk."
For the Commission, Commissioner László Kovács said that the Belarus regime was repressive and politically oppressive. He welcomed that there had been some limited consolidation of opposition groups. The elections clearly failed to meet OSCE standards on freedom of assembly, association and expression. The Commission considers that the elections were "fundamentally flawed" he said. Commissioner Kovács also deplored the fact that EU observers were not permitted access as well as the arrest of opposition activists. The Commission was now considering sanctions in line with what the Council would agree. The Commission continued to support Belarusian civil society and worked with "middle-ranking officials". The Commission was active, he said, in the health and environment sectors. The important television and radio channels that the Commission was supporting would be important for the development of democracy and the visibility of the EU.
Political group speakers
Bogdan KLICH (EPP- ED, PL) said of Belarus that we must "isolate the government - but not the society, we much show Belarus support". He noted that the House has "for a long time been calling for the imposition of some sanctions against the government and the leaders", however he recommended that our borders should be opened to the Belarusians "who cannot live in Belarus any more". Mr. Klich also suggested the introduction of a "special programme of bursaries" for the young people of Belarus: "we owe it to them".
Jan Marinus WIERSMA (PES, NL) stated that "the only line of action is to condemn out of hand" what happened on Sunday, and that the elections were obviously "not free, and not fair". He wanted to say "loud and clear" that "we will not idly stand by while there is a dictatorship ruling over the country". He considered the problem of how to impose sanctions without adversely affecting the Belarusian population itself, and noted there to be a "need for consultation between the EU and Russia on this issue".
Jeanine HENNIS-PLASSCHAERT (ALDE, NL) said that it was important to "help the ordinary people of Belarus" but that the "role of Russia is vitally important" also. Ms. Hennis-Plasschaert asserted that it is Russia that "keeps Belarus's economy ticking over" and that "we really need to talk with President Putin". She said that "we cannot allow the very ideas that our Union is based on to be dissolved in Russian oil and gas".
Elisabeth SCHROEDTER (Greens/EFA, DE) sent a special greeting to the Belarusians who gathered on October Square, calling them "our greatest hope", and that we must "recognise these people as our partners and support their democratic activities". She also suggested that the political situation should be discussed in the next G8 summit.
Michał Tomasz KAMIŃSKI (UEN, PL) asserted that the only reason that the government of President Alexander Lukashenko is still in power is because he has "friends in the Kremlin who support it". He called on the Union to make it clear that this situation entirely unacceptable, and that President Lukashenko's regime "exists purely because he's brainwashing his fellow citizens".
British Speaker
Charles TANNOCK (EPP-ED, UK) described Belarus as the "Cuba of Europe", saying that President Lukashenko obviously conducted his affairs with the Stalinist mantra: "it doesn't matter how the vote is conducted, it's who controls it that counts". He saluted the courage of those who have taken to the streets and declared that "we must support their civil society".
Council and Commission responses
Responding to the debate, Austrian State Secretary Winkler said the EU would try to find some means of hitting the regime without affecting the lives of ordinary people. He said the Council intended to follow many of the recommendations made by MEPs: "We have every admiration for courageous opposition in Belarus and we will support them. Sanctions and restrictions are a possibility, including extending existing measures, perhaps a visa ban on whole leadership... We will analyse this in more detail. We hope any measures will not affect people who want to travel to see how democracy works here in Europe."
Commissioner Kovács said the EU was a community of shared values: "We must make it clear we do not accept the repressive regime of President Lukashenko, the violation of campaign rights, the arrest of the opposition and peaceful demonstrators. We need to introduce and maintain sanctions, but avoid economic measures which would hit the general population. We must precisely target the persons responsible for elections and survival of repressive regime." The Commission, he said, would also aim to support NGOs in Belarus. He was pleased there appeared to be unity between Parliament, Council and the Commission, and hoped this might help democratic change in Belarus .

Democratic Republic of Congo - MEPs want EU peacekeeping troops
2006-04-25 - 10:12
Parliament wants the Council of EU Ministers to present a clear proposal on the sending of a peace-keeping mission to Congo and to limit the duration of such a mission very clearly to the duration of the parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for June.
In a resolution adopted by 455 votes in favour to 139 against with 15 abstentions, MEPs described the mission as "complex and potentially risky", while they pointed out that the EU has "only a limited number of deployable troops at its disposal" and that priority should be given to the Balkans. Therefore, they list a number of conditions to be met with for such a mission to be sent.
First of all, the Council should develop a clear concept of how to deploy the necessary military or police forces. The military operation would have to be limited to the election period and there should be a clear strategy for transferring the tasks to the UN and/or Congolese afterwards. The geographical scope of the mission should be determined taking the number of available troops and the security and operational requirements of the mission into account. The mission should be closely linked with efforts for the reconstruction of the Democratic Republic of Congo. And under no circumstances should the operation consist of troops from only one EU Member State. Text adopted

MEPs say European Development Fund is too low
2006-04-25 - 10:12
In adopting a joint resolution on the revision of the Cotonou Agreement and setting of the amount for the 10th European Development Fund (EDF), the House regrets that the overall amount for the 10th EDF decided by the European Council is below the original calculation of the Commission.
MEPs also regret that the plethora of political commitments made in 2005 in support of substantial increases in official development aid (ODA) have not been translated into a substantial increase in the contributions of Member States to the EDF. MEPs underline that the proposed amount for the10th EDF would amount to only 0.028% of Member States' GDP. The House deplores the fact that, on the one hand, Member States have made commitments to increase development aid but, on the other hand, if the level of the 10th EDF remains at that fixed by the European Council, the overall levels of ODA managed by the Commission will fall from 19% to just 14% by 2015, making this a de facto re-nationalisation of development policy. MEPs call on the Member States to consider significantly raising their contributions to the 10th EDF.
The House urges the Council to provide new money for 'aid for trade' programmes and insist that such programmes should not shift resources already earmarked for other development initiatives, such as the Millennium Development Goals. MEPs call on the Council to take into account the accession of East Timor to the Partnership Agreement and the fact that aid directed to this new country should clearly be additional in the light of the formula described in Annex 1a to the revised Cotonou Agreement.
Parliament calls on the Council and Commission to clarify the future financing of the African Union, including what level of financing should come from the MEDA programme. MEPs recall that all EDF expenditure must satisfy the ODA eligibility criteria, as defined by the OECD's Development Assistance Committee. Finally, the Parliament calls on the Commission to take the lead in ensuring coordination between the Member States in order to enhance the effectiveness of both EU and bilateral development funding .

Development impact of Economic Partnership Agreements
2006-04-25 - 10:12
"If long-term sustainable development is to be the overall outcome of Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs)" then the Commission must "act in accordance with the Cotonou objective of poverty eradication". This is the view expressed in a non-binding report on the development impact of Economic Partnership Agreements.
Between 1975 and 2000, the trade relationship between EU countries and those of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) was determined by the rules set out in the Lomé Conventions. This agreement granted ACP countries unilateral preferential (non-reciprocal) access to the European market. However, in September 2002, the ACP countries began to negotiate Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) that would make their trade-relationships with the EU compatible with the guidelines of the WTO. These guidelines stipulate that a trade relationship should be reciprocal: "countries at different levels of development can enter into a reciprocal free trade agreement providing that the liberalisation of substantially all trade occurs within a reasonable length of time”. Thus, under the proposed EPAs, the new trade relationship between the EU and ACP countries is reciprocal and aimed at the progressive liberalisation of trade.
The report opens by expressing the understanding that there is a necessity to make compatible the rules governing ACP-EU trade relations with those of the WTO. Nevertheless, it urges the Commission to ensure that the goals of liberalisation do not take precedence over the goals of development. In correlation with this, it advises caution when considering the liberalisation of public sectors in the ACP countries. Moreover, "too rapid a reciprocal trade liberalisation between the EU and the ACP could have a negative impact on vulnerable ACP economies and States". With a view to promoting economic integration, trade and investment, the House encourages the development of EPAs that concentrate on the principle of asymmetry in favour of ACP regions.
Parliament laments the lack of progress that there has been in the pursuit of "development-friendly" policies so far, and calls on the Commission to "pursue ambitious new initiatives to stabilise the price of commodities which are essential to developing countries" and to "support mechanisms for producers to be involved and participate in price determination where feasible". It also asserts the need for effective trade-related assistance and for an improvement in the infrastructure of ACP countries. The report calls for greater transparency in the negotiations, a real public debate on the issues, and a deeper involvement of other sectors. On the part of the ACP countries, it asks their governments to work within a framework of democracy, responsibility and good governance.
The main objective of the Cotonou Agreement was to reduce and eventually eradicate poverty along with the nurturing of sustainable development. The concept of "reciprocity" represents "a major shift in the EU's approach to development and trade policies with ACP partners". MEPs believe however, that the EU and ACP countries combined represent a substantial number, "large enough to demand eventual reforms of the WTO rules".
The House stresses that the outcome of the EPA negotiations should provide sufficient time for adjustment for ACP producers’ domestic and regional markets and allow ACP countries the necessary policy space to pursue their own development strategies. Parliament also stresses the importance of public services for development and democracy and consequently asks the Commission to always prioritise affordable access for all when considering promoting liberalisation or other options in areas such as water distribution and sanitation, health, education, transport and energy. Finally, the House urges the Commission to focus its attention on and prioritise improving production and processing capacities, and national and regional trade within the ACP.

Parliament calls for more support for non-food crops
2006-04-25 - 10:12
Parliament calls on the Commission to promote non-food crops in Europe, to increase the Union's production of energy crops, biofuels, biomass, pharmaceutical crops and speciality chemicals. It also asked for more research into alternative technologies, and a public information campaign to promote ecological awareness.
The own-initiative report by Neil PARISH (EPP-ED, UK) on the promotion of crops for non-food purposes was approved by 471 votes in favour 12 against and 12 abstentions. The report stresses "the importance of making the targets in Directive 2003/30/EC on biofuels obligatory," in order to increase demand for energy crops. MEPs also urged the Commission to "increase substantially the maximum area eligible for additional aid and the level of payment," and pointed to its recent demand that "aid granted in respect of land used to grow energy crops to be increased to € 80 per year, on the basis of a maximum guaranteed area of 2 200 000 hectares."
The Parliament also asks the Commission to "consider putting in place qualified market access arrangements from biofuel imports from third countries, such as Brazil," to allow a European industry to emerge. It also called on Member States to organise "publicity campaigns targeted at the younger generation, in particular, in whom an ecological awareness must be cultivated."
Besides energy crops for biofuel production, the House also wished to encourage the production of speciality chemicals (to replace non-biodegradable products), pharmaceutical crops (for instance to produce vaccines), and raw materials for the textile and cosmetics industries. Finally, the report underlines the potential in using organic waste to grow energy crops which could then, in turn, be used for heating, cooling and electricity .

Consumers
MEPs rein in Commission plans to merge health and consumer protection
2006-04-25 - 10:12
"To promote the interests of consumers," reads the EC's founding Treaty, the Community is to take "measures which support, supplement and monitor the policy pursued by the Member States." Meeting on 23 March, the European Parliament signed up to €233 million worth of such measures -- by lending its support to the 2007-2013 programme of Community action in the field of consumer protection.
The programme's objectives, to be achieved with a range of Community-financed actions and instruments, are fourfold: to aim for a better understanding of consumers and markets; to ensure better consumer protection regulation and greater participation of civil society stakeholders; to guarantee better enforcement, monitoring and redress; and lastly, to help produce better educated, responsible consumers.
Split, MEPs tell Commission
The Commission had originally suggested a single action programme for health and consumer protection in hopes of achieving more synergies between the two areas. "Bringing the two areas together", it argued, would "lead to greater policy coherence, economies of scale and increased visibility". MEPs, however, did not agree with this approach. In the words of rapporteur Marianne Thyssen (EPP-ED, BE), "neither the practical nor the policy arguments in favour of integrating the aforementioned action programmes [were] convincing. The synergies aimed at will in practice be much smaller than hoped for." It was with this in mind that the Parliament's Conference of Presidents -- citing additional budgetary considerations and noting that health and consumer protection are covered by different legal bases (Articles 152 and 153 of the EC Treaty) -- had decided to separate the integrated programme into two parts back in June 2005. The Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) thus dealt only with consumer protection, while the Environment and Public Health Committee (ENVI) was left to address the health component. The ENVI report had already been voted on during last week's session in Strasbourg plenary.
Given that MEPs decided to split the joint programme, it was only logical that they would do the same with its budget. 233 million euros, out of a total budget of €1,203 million, was consequently earmarked for consumer protection. However, with a view to the pending negotiations between Parliament and the Council on the 2007-2013 financial framework, MEPs, following the IMCO committee's recommendations, decided not to introduce any other amendments relating to the cost of the consumer action programme. Amending the Commission’s original figures, IMCO Chair Arlene McCarthy (PES, UK) had explained prior to the committee vote, would be “premature and would undermine our negotiating position.” Reimer Böge (EPP-ED, DE), the EP's rapporteur on the Financial Perspective, addressing IMCO members, was of the same opinion. Introducing new figures, he had claimed, “would undermine the credibility of the EP in the negotiations”.
The EP did vote, however, to decrease some maximum ceilings for Community financing for "actions in pursuit of the aims and objectives" of the programme -- from 60 to 50 percent. It also approved an amendment defining the eligibility criteria for bodies and legal persons seeking to qualify for such financing, all while expanding the list of actions eligible for Community support. Lastly, in keeping with their earlier appeals -- a 2005 own-initiative report by Henrik Dam Kristensen (PES, DK) being one example -- MEPs supported amendments to strengthen assistance to consumer organisations in the new Member States.
It is now up to the Council of Ministers, as joint legislator with Parliament, to decide its position on the amendments adopted by MEPs. If all of Parliament's amendments are acceptable to the Council, the legislation will be adopted in its modified form. If the Council rejects any of Parliament's amendments or adds any of its own, the text will return to Parliament for a second reading.
Speaking before the plenary, Mrs. Thyssen dedicated her report to Philip Whitehead, the former chair of the Internal Market Committee, who passed away on 31 December 2005. "We all stand in his debt", she said . Rapporteur Marianne THYSSEN EPP-ED BE Text adopted
