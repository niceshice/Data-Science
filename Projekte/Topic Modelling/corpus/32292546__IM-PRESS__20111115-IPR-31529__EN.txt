Václav LEBEDA BXL (+32) 2 28 32971 STR (+33) 3 881 73839 PORT (+32) 498 98 33 27 EMAIL region-press@europarl.europa.eu Paola BUONADONNA EMAIL Press-en@europarl.europa.eu EMAIL paola.buonadonna@europarl.europa.eu ADDINFO (+44) 207 227 43 35 STR (+33) 3 881 74822 PORT (+44) 7 786 060 531 MEPs gave their green light, Tuesday, to prolong a suspension of EU customs duties on imports of certain industrial goods to the Canary Islands. The proposal allows duty-free imports of raw materials, components and capital goods, so as to boost local firms' competitiveness and stabilise employment.
Current Common Customs Tariff suspensions for these goods would continue to apply until the end of 2021. To avoid possible distortions of competition, misuse or changes in traditional trade flows, the imported duty-free goods must be used in the Canary Islands.
The proposal was approved with 538 votes in favour, 66 against and 18 abstentions.
