The bluefin tuna - in demand and under threat: MEPs discuss ways to save it

Tuna trading - sustainable sushi?
Stocks of bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean could be heading for collapse - that was the message from a recent hearing held by the Parliament's fisheries committee. The fish, a source of food and commerce since Roman times, are now threatened by over-fishing and growing demand from the lucrative Japanese sushi market. Annual catches are now 50,000 tonnes, double the sustainable level. Fisheries experts, environmentalists and industry figures all agree action is needed to save the fish.
The market may be in Japan, but French, Italian and Spanish boats catch half of all tuna worldwide each year. There are two main stocks of the fish - western and eastern Atlantic, with about 80% of the latter being in the Mediterranean.
The large over-capacity of the fishing fleet, vessels using flags of convenience and now tuna "farming" all threaten the fragile bluefin tuna. Farming the fish allows them to be caught then fattened in fish-farms ready to be sold on for higher prices. The hearing was told this practice is new, poorly regulated and expanding rapidly: In 1997 there were just 200 tonnes of tuna farmed; by 2005 it had risen to 25,000 tonnes. What is clear is that the levels of fishing are well above the legal quota allocated by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT).
What can the EU do about it?
The European Union fleet is currently allocated 57% of the total allowable catch of bluefin tuna and 60% of the farming capacity. With much of the French fleet (the largest in the Med) being modernised in the last 10 years with EU subsidies, the Union clearly has a role to play. At the hearing, Sergi Tudela of the World Wildlife Fund criticised the EU for putting the interests of the fishing industry above conservation. Also present was a representative of the European Commission - which manages the EU's Common Fisheries Policy. They admitted that "restructuring is inevitable" in the industry.
During the hearing a variety of MEPs put forward measures that would protect bluefin tuna stocks. British Conservative (EPP-ED) Struan Stevenson said the "crisis is apparent" and called for spawning areas to be closed. Liberal (ALDE) member Elspeth Attwooll advocated the creation of a Mediterranean Regional Advisory Council to set the rules on fishing levels.
For the Greens, France's Marie-Hélène Aubert called on EU members to take responsibility and to use EU funds to reduce over-fishing. "We have already subsidised the modernisation of fleets to increase capacity, but now we need to finance their reduction, "she said. German Socialist (PSE) Heinz Kindermann asked whether the level of fines for breaking the rules should be raised.
With the biomass of the fish having declined 80% in 20 years - it is clear time could be up soon for the bluefin.
