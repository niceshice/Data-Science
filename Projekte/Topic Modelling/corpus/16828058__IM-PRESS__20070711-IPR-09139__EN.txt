In response to today's news that the death sentences on six medical personnel detained in Libya have been confirmed, the President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering, made the following statement to the House. "Today the Libyan Supreme Court confirmed the death sentence of the five Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor detained in Libya since February 1999, accused of deliberately infecting hundreds of Libyan children with HIV.
I am greatly disturbed by this news which is distressing for everybody, especially of course for the nurses and the doctor but in particular for their friends and relatives. I have met their family members in April and I would like to send them our solidarity and support at this difficult moment. In addition I want to transmit to them a clear message of hope: This is not the end of the procedure. The matter will now be referred to the Libyan High Judicial Council. We believe that the Libyan authorities will take the necessary measures to review and quash the death sentence and pave the way for an early resolution.
Once again we reiterate our fundamental opposition to the death penalty which is against human dignity and express our solidarity with the victims of the HIV/AIDS infection in the Benghazi hospital.
We appeal to the Libyan authorities to show clemency and to release the Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor."
