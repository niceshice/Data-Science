Hans-Gert Pöttering, the President of the European Parliament has called on Myanmar's military rulers immediately and unconditionally to release Aung San Suu Kyi.
Following the developments concerning the imprisonment and trial of Nobel Peace Prize winner and European Parliament Sakharov Prize 1990, Aung San Suu Kyi, the President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering, made the following statement:
"Now that the trial of Aung San Suu Kyi is set to resume on June 26, I strongly urge Myanmar's military rulers to release her immediately and unconditionally. She was arrested on 14 May accused of violating the conditions of her detention under house arrest, as an obvious pretext for keeping her detained as the country approaches new multi-party elections in 2010.
I appeal for a fair and transparent trial in accordance with international standards, which include full media access and the possibility of all witnesses to testify.
The European Parliament, which enshrines the values of democracy and freedom for which the European Union is a beacon throughout the world, reaffirms its complete support and solidarity with Aung San Suu Kyi. This courageous woman represents the best hopes of her people for a free and prosperous future."
