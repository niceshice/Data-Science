Anna Politkovskaya, one of the few journalists to concentrate on Chechnya, was shot dead on Saturday 7 October 2006 in Moscow. On Monday, the President of the European Parliament, Josep Borrell, made a statement condemning the killing.
Mr Borrell said:
"I am saddened and moved at the news of the unspeakable murder of Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya. I wish to pay tribute to this exceptional journalist, to her exceptional bravery and to her exceptional resolve.
I very much hope that the Russian authorities do their utmost as quickly as possible to get to the bottom this heinous act. Finding out who the perpetrators were will be a test for the state of democracy, freedom of expression and freedom of opinion in Russia.
On my own behalf, and on behalf of the whole of the European Parliament, I would ask Anna Politkovskayaâ€™s family and loved ones to accept our deepest sympathy."
Anna Politkovskaya's work was rewarded with journalism prizes from around the world, notably for her reporting of the conflict in Chechnya. She was the author of several books, including 'A Small Corner of Hell: Dispatches from Chechnya.'
