2007-04-04 - 12:16
The EU's €54 billion, seventh Framework Research Programme (FP7) for 2007-2013, was approved by Parliament in a plenary vote, on 30 November 2006. This vote, endorsing 10 separate reports on FP7 participation rules and various specific programme topics, enabled FP7 to begin, as scheduled, on 1 January 2007.
Parliament backed FP7 from the outset and helped speed it through the legislative process, but also insisted on shifting some spending towards its own priorities, including research on renewable energy and energy efficiency. It sought to encourage participation in FP7 by small and medium-sized firms (SMEs), and to boost the position of young researchers and women in science. Finally, Parliament also welcomed proposals to create a European Research Council - a new instrument to support investigator-driven “frontier research” - and sought to give the ERC real autonomy.

About FP7
FP7 is to build on the achievements of its predecessor programmes by helping to create a world-leading European Research Area, the equivalent of a "common market" for research, and help develop the knowledge economy and society in Europe. This demands a clear focus on promoting and investing in world-class research . The new programme has simpler instruments and procedures for funding and participation than its predecessors. It aims to promote collaborative research in broad research themes, rather than instruments, with much continuity from FP6 plus two new topics, space and security. The programme's funds are not general subsidies to research organisations or companies and may only be used for specific work or research projects.
The most important new actions are: funding for basic research through a European Research Council run by eminent scientists, support for large scale public-private partnerships to take forward industrial projects and funding for new research infrastructures.
Only projects involving several partners from different countries will be funded. Funds are allocated following competitive “calls for proposals” published by the European Commission. Projects are assessed by independent experts, but the Commission is responsible for FP7's implementation.
FP7 will be composed of four programmes, corresponding to four basic components of European research:
1) Co-operation: the co-operation programme aims at supporting co-operation among universities, industry, research centres and public authorities in order to gain leadership in the 10 different thematic areas. International co-operation between the EU and third countries is an integral part of this action.
This action is industry-driven and organized in four sub-programmes:
a) Collaborative research, which will account for the bulk of EU research funding,
b) Joint Technology Initiatives, which will be largely based on the work of European Technology Platforms,
c) Co-ordination of non-Community research programmes, and
d) International Co-operation .
2) Ideas: under the ideas programme, an autonomous European Research Council will be created to support investigator-driven “frontier research”.
3) People : through the People programme, activities supporting training and career development of researchers, referred to as “Marie Curie” actions, will be stepped up so as to develop and strengthen the human potential of European research.
4) Capacities: research and innovation capacity throughout Europe is to be enhanced through the co-ordination and development of research infrastructures, as well as support for regional research-driven clusters, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), a closer relationship between science and society, and the development of international co-operation.
Each of these programmes will be the subject of a Specific Programme. In addition, there will be a Specific Programme for the Joint Research Centre (non-nuclear activities) and one for Euratom nuclear research and training activities.
The Euratom Framework Programme covers two additional themes: Fusion energy research and Nuclear fission and radiation protection. Euratom research activities differ from those in other programmes in that they are carried out under a separate treaty. The European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) - set up in 1957 - is legally separate from the European Community (EC). The Euratom Framework Programme will also be the subject of a specific programme.
Parliament's role
The European Parliament was involved via the co-decision procedure in elaborating FP7 and its participation rules. It was also consulted on the Euratom part and on the various specific programmes.
Parliament adopted its first reading report on FP7 on 15 June 2006 (Buzek report) and was consulted on the Euratom part on the same date (Buzek report).
The second reading compromise put to the plenary vote on 30 November 2006 made no major changes to the structure, content or operational arrangements set out in the Commission’s proposal. The Commission's first draft of FP7 was nonetheless modified in some respects during the co-decision procedure between Parliament and the Council of Ministers. Many of Parliament's first-reading amendments were taken on board in the Council's common position, adopted on 25 September 2006, inter alia on encouraging the participation of small and medium-sized firms, boosting the position of young researchers and women in science, and dealing with stem cell research. The 39 new compromise amendments on which Parliament voted on 30 November 2006 deal with other issues that MEPs still wished to emphasise, including Parliament's priorities, the structure of the European Research Council and the proposed Risk Sharing Facility. Members also stress that no money from FP7 should be used to finance the proposed European Institute of Technology.

Main issues
Ten key areas - Parliament's priorities
Of the total budget, over €32 billion is allocated to ten key areas: Health; Food, Agriculture, Fisheries and Biotechnology; Information and Communication Technologies; Nanosciences, Nanotechnologies, Materials and new Production Technologies; Energy; Environment (including Climate Change); Transport (including Aeronautics); Socio-economic Sciences and the Humanities; and Security and Space. Parliament played a crucial role in improving and redefining these categories. In its Common Position the Council accepted Parliament' first-reading amendments, thus ensuring that at least 15% of the funding would be reserved for small and medium-sized enterprises whose participation in FP7 will be encouraged. Secondly, MEPs clarified the programme and extended the scope of certain key areas. MEPs also inserted amendments to improve the position of young researchers and women in science and reduce the "brain drain". In the compromise put to the vote on 30 November 2006, MEPs sought to shift some of the spending towards Parliament's own priorities, including research on renewable energy and energy efficiency, possible funding for research on children's health, respiratory diseases (including those induced by allergies), plus research into neglected diseases. The compromise states that renewables and end-use energy efficiency will account for the "major part" of the budget of FP7's energy theme, rather than the two thirds proposed in Parliament's first reading.
European Research Council
The compromise also included amendments concerning the European Research Council - a new body to support investigator-driven “frontier research”.
At the first reading, the European Parliament welcomed the proposal to create a European Research Council (ERC), but sought to ensure that it has real autonomy. A compromise amendment voted on 30.11.06 states that the co-decision procedure will be used should changes in the ERC's structure become necessary.
It was further agreed that the ERC's administration costs should not exceed 5% of its total budget, so as to maximise funding for frontier research (at the first reading, Parliament had asked for a 3% limit, to avoid top-heavy administration).
Ethical principles
Ethical issues were of great concern to all those involved in adopting the programme, with opinions varying sharply. At Parliament's first reading, MEPs adopted a compromise that could in principle be accepted by ministers in the common position (although several Member States opposed it).
Parliament and Council agreed that all research activities under FP7 shall be carried out in compliance with fundamental ethical principles.
Research fields that will not be eligible for Community funding include activities aimed at human cloning for reproductive purposes or intended to modify the genetic heritage of human beings, those which could make such changes inheritable, or research intended to create human embryos solely for the purposes of research or of stem cell procurement, including by means of somatic cell nuclear transfer.
Research on the use of human stem cells, both adult and embryonic, may be funded, depending both on the content of the scientific proposal and the legal framework of the Member State(s) involved. As regards the use of human embryonic stem cells, institutions, organisations and researchers must be subject to strict licensing and control in accordance with the legal framework of the Member State(s) involved.
In addition, the Commission has made it clear that it will maintain the FP6 practice of excluding activities that involve destroying human embryos, including for the procurement of stem cells, from Community financial support under FP7.
Risk sharing facility and European Institute of Technology
The Risk Sharing Finance Facility (RSFF), designed to encourage bank lending to research projects, was also the subject of a second reading compromise. While the Council had planned to allocate €1 billion from FP7 to finance the RSFF (which is to be matched by an equal amount from the European Investment Bank), the compromise provides for a lower contribution from FP7 until 2010 - €500 million - with the possibility of releasing up to an additional €500 million after an evaluation. Furthermore, in its 13 November 2006 vote, the Industry, Research and Energy Committee stressed its strong conviction that no funds under the FP7 programme should contribute to the establishment and/or administrative costs of the proposed European Institute of Technology. Only administrative costs directly associated with research projects should be covered.
Budget
The overall budget planned for FP7 in the Financial Perspective for 2007 to 2013 is €54 582 million at current prices. Of this, €50 521 million is allocated for the European Community programme and €2 751 million for Euratom programme which runs from 2007 to 2011. A further €1 310 million is indicatively planned for the Euratom programme for 2012-2013, but this will need to be confirmed at a later stage.

Participation rules
Implementing rules for the participation of undertakings, research centres and universities in actions under FP7 and for the dissemination of research results (2007-2011) were approved by Parliament on 30 Novmber 2007 (co-decision report by Philippe Busquin, PES, BE). This included a first-reading compromise, agreed by the rapporteur, shadow rapporteurs and the Council, that sought to simplify the rules.
The compromise amendments clarify certain concepts and definitions, introduce the main principles and criteria for evaluating proposals and awarding grants, raise the upper funding limit for security-related research and technological development activities from 50 % to 75 %, introduce the idea of a guarantee fund, define the role of the co-ordinator and specify the concept of direct and indirect eligible costs.
Following the wish of MEPs, a derogation for the calculation of indirect costs will be foreseen for SMEs and other research organisations which are unable to identify with certainty their real indirect costs. They will have the possibility to opt for a flat rate of 60% of the total direct eligible costs for projects awarded grants before the end of 2009, and 40% for projects awarded grants thereafter.
