Is the EU, in the midst of a financial crisis, ready to support its objectives as set out in the EU 2020 strategy? If so, how will this affect policy areas like agriculture and regional policy? These questions will be debated at a conference on Thursday 22 March, co-sponsored by the European Parliament, the EU's Danish Presidency and the European Commission. Representatives of national parliaments will also take part.
The conference will be held in the European Parliament's plenary chamber. For the complete programme, see links to the right.
