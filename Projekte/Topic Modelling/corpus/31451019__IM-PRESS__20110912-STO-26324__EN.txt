EP President Jerzy Buzek and Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski in the EP Chamber (from right to left) "Europe's history is a story of conflict, division and war, but it is also witness to the unbreakable desire for unification," Polish President Bronis≈Çaw Komorowski told MEPs Tuesday. In a formal address to the European Parliament he defended the euro and monetary union and called for "more "Europe". He said the EU must come up with a joint response to the crisis, as "only a strong and united Europe can give the right responses".
Introducing Mr Komorowski, EP President Jerzy Buzek underlined the Polish president's fight for democracy and democratic vales throughout his life. "Defending our system of values has been one of his key mottos," Mr Buzek said.
