MEPs want Russia to shed light on the murders of four human rights campaigners, Stanislav Markelov, Natalia Estemirova, Zarema Sadulayeva and Alik Dzhabrailov. They also call for the immediate release of Kazakh human rights activist Yevgeny Zhovtis and Syrian lawyer Muhannad Al-Hassani, in urgent resolutions adopted on Thursday in Strasbourg.
Parliament urges the Russian authorities "to investigate swiftly, thoroughly and effectively" the murders of Stanislav Markelov, Natalia Estemirova, Zarema Sadulayeva and Alik Dzhabrailov and to bring those responsible for, and those involved in, these brutal acts to justice.
It also welcomes the return of the archive confiscated from the organisation 'Memorial' in St Petersburg following the raid on 4 December 2008 and the decision of the Russian Supreme Court of 3 September 2009 to retry the case involving the murder of Anna Politkovskaya.
Kazakhstan
Parliament calls on the Kazakh authorities to review the conviction and the sentence imposed on human rights campaigner Yevgeny Zhovtis and to carry out a second "full and fair" investigation into the circumstances surrounding the road accident for which he was sentenced to four years in prison.
On 3 September 2009 Yevgeny Zhovtis, director of the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and the Rule of Law, was convicted of manslaughter for striking a pedestrian with his car, on 26 July 2009, and killing him.
Syria
MEPs also urge the Syrian authorities to release immediately Mr Muhannad al-Hassani, a leading human rights lawyer and President of the Syrian Human Rights Organisation (Swasiah), who was arrested by the Syrian authorities on 28 July 2009.
Muhannad al-Hassani was charged with ‘weakening national sentiments’ and ‘spreading false news’ in a closed session to which his lawyer was not allowed access.
Parliament expresses its deepest concern about Mr al-Hassani's detention, which seems to be intended to penalise his human rights activities.
