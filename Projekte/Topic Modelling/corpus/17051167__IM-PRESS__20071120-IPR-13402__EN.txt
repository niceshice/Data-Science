The President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering, has written to the Speaker of the National Assembly of Lebanon, Nabih Berri, stressing the European Parliament's commitment to a free and democratic Lebanon.
In view of the political situation in Lebanon and the fact that the time limit for the election of the State President laid down in the Lebanese Constitution will shortly expire, Mr Pöttering said that the Speaker of the National Assembly - bearing in mind his political authority - had an important role to play in finding a solution which would make the presidential elections possible. Mr Pöttering called on the Speaker of the Lebanese Parliament to do everything in his power to ensure that the Constitution was respected and that the Lebanese Parliament could elect the President within the required time limit.
On Saturday, the letter from EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering was delivered personally to Nabih Berri in Beirut by Rodi Kratsa, the First Vice-President of the European Parliament responsible for the Arab world. On behalf of Mr Pöttering she then also met majority leader Saad Hariri, opposition leader General Aoun and the Maronite Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir for political talks.
