Report on GMOs debated Monday Could make it easier for countries to restrict planting Europeans will be able to ask their governments to prohibit the cultivation of Genetically Modified Organisms in their country if a new EU regulation is adopted according to French MEP Corinne Lepage (ALDE). Her draft report (on the Commission's proposal modifying a 2001 Directive) which could allow governments to restrict or prohibit the cultivation of GMOs will be debated in the Environment Committee on Monday (28 February) from 1500 CET. You can watch the meeting live!
We spoke to Ms Lepage ahead of the debate on Monday afternoon.
Why is an amendment to the Directive necessary now?
The initiative for this change does not come from Parliament but the Commission, which took into account the fact that many states do not want to grow GMOs, because the people are against it. So it's a small step towards our fellow Europeans who do not want GMOs being planted.
According to a Eurobarometer survey, Europeans do not trust the cultivation of GMOs. How does the new regulation change things for the every day lives of people?
It will mean that any countries that do not want to grow GMOs will have the choice if their populations demand it. Today the countries that resist (and I am thinking especially of Austria and Hungary) always face the risk of having the Commission trying to force them to lift their national measures. What people want is to avoid eating GMOs. So as not to eat them there must be areas of crops where there are no GMOs. This change will make it legally possible.
On Monday, your draft report will be discussed in committee. As a rapporteur, can you already see the changes to the Commission's original proposal?
Yes. I proposed changes in order to secure the project because the project that was sent to us is legally unsafe, since the Commission gave no reason for its decisions. My proposal is to give specific reasons allowing Member States to ban GMOs in their territory while leaving in place a Community Assessment.
