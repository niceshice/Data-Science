The European Parliament delegation which went to Egypt to witness the first phase of parliamentary elections there has decided not to go back for the final phase. The delegation felt that there was little point in returning because of the negative impressions it had on 9 November. These impressions have since been confirmed by NGOs and subsequent events in Egypt.
“We heard of vote-buying, a rigged register, the bussing of voters and we witnessed intimidation. The government party is clinging to power by a variety of well-known tactics,” said Edward McMillan-Scott (EPP-ED, UK), who led the delegation. He has proposed that another delegation of MEPs return “to discuss with the Egyptian parliament and government, its Council on Human Rights and NGOs the application of EU finance, technical assistance and training for a systematic reform of the voting register, as well as the functioning and transparency of future polls.”
The delegation which went to Egypt on 9 November included Jana Hybaskova (EPP-ED, CZ), Joost Lagendijk (Greens/EFA, NL) and Francesco Speroni (IND/DEM, IT). It was the first time that the European Parliament had sent a delegation to witness elections without being invited.
