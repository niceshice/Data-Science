Contrasts at the Plenary session in Strasbourg 4-7 May Telecom troubles: Viviane Reding, the European Commission for the Information Society with Parliament's 3 rapporteurs: Pilar del Castillo, Catherine Trautmann and Malcolm Harbour. Every MEP has a post box in Strasbourg where they receive mail. Supporters of the ban in the trade in seal were pleased the trade was almost banned by a vote in Tuesday, 5 May. Old fashioned courtesy on display. Midweek media: the votes on Wednesday attract significant attention from the media. With his term ending Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering gave a farewell speech where he urged people to vote in the June European elections. MEPs mill around at the end of the votes on Wednesday, photo taken from behind the dais. Italian students in the courtyard of the Louise Weiss building in Strasbourg. Packing up - when the session closed at 1615 it marked the last debate of the 2004-2009 parliamentary term. The last session of the current parliamentary term took place in Strasbourg from 4-7 May. It saw MEPs back a ban in the seal trade as well as a fierce debate over telecoms reform. The session was also marked by the last speech of Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering as his term as Speaker ends with the European elections. Here in the slideshow are just a few of the images of Strasbourg last week.
The European elections will take place across Europe from 4-7 June where you will have a chance to decide who you want to represent you in the European Parliament.
