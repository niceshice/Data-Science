European Parliament acting for the environment
EP acting for the environment
Strict rules on hazardous chemical substances, targets for re-use and recycling of waste, protecting groundwater, collection rates for batteries and accumulators are some of the environmental topics on which the European Parliament adopted EU legislation in this legislature. MEPs also pushed for tighter control of pesticides . MEPs adopted strict conditions for the placing on the market of seal products in the European Union.
REACH: New EU chemicals legislation
The chemicals regulation, known as REACH, is meant to protect public health and the environment without threatening European competitiveness. It obliges producers to register all chemical substances produced or imported above 1 tonne per year. Registration affects about 30,000 substances. For more hazardous substances, producers have to submit a plan to replace them with safer alternatives or, if no alternative exists, a research plan aimed at finding one. Promotion of alternatives to animal testing of chemicals was an issue of prime concern to MEPs.
Regulation adopted by EP: 13.12.2006
Applicable progressively from: 1/06/2007
MEPs adopt strict conditions for the placing on the market of seal products in the European Union
The placing on the market of seal products should not be allowed say MEPs. It is permitted only where the seal products result from hunts traditionally conducted by Inuit and other indigenous communities. Otherwise the import is permitted where it is of an occasional nature and consists exclusively of goods for the personal use of the travellers. Furthermore it is allowed to place on the market products that result from by-products of hunting [and] conducted for the purpose of sustainable management of marine resources on a non-profit basis.
Adopted by the EP: 5.5.2009
Applicable: This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
The article on conditions for placing on the market enters into force nine months from the date of entry into force of this Regulation.
Safety first for pesticides
A new regulation on pesticides adopted by the European Parliament bans the use of certain highly toxic chemicals in the manufacture of pesticides and requires other risky substances to be replaced with safer alternatives. A directive adopted at the same time will reduce the amount of pesticides used, by prohibiting most aerial crop spraying with pesticides as well as the use of pesticides near parks and playgrounds and in buffer zones around rivers and lakes.
Directive and regulation adopted by EP: 13.1.2009 (2nd reading agreement with Council)
Date of directive transposition: about beginning 2011 (24 months following entry into force, not yet published)
Regulation fully applicable: 18 months following entry into force
New EU waste legislation with binding 2020 targets
The EU will have new waste legislation which includes targets for re-use and recycling of waste to be attained by 2020. The directive sets out rules on recycling and waste prevention. Recycling targets by 2020 are 50% for paper, metal and glass from households and 70% for non-hazardous construction and demolition waste. Only the most energy efficient incinerators can be classified as ‘recovery’ operations.
Directive adopted by EP: 17.06.2008
Deadline for transposition: end Dec 2010 (24 months from entry into force)
New schemes for recycling batteries
The European Parliament approved a directive setting up schemes for collecting spent portable batteries and accumulators throughout Europe by 2008. Minimum collection rates to be reached by all Member States are 25% by 2012 and 45 % by 2016. Collected batteries will be recycled. Strict limits to the content of cadmium and mercury in batteries have also been fixed. The UK recycles about 2% of domestic batteries at the moment.
Directive adopted by EP: 4.07.2006
EU criminal law to protect the environment
Criminal sanctions will be employed to punish all severe offences committed against EU environmental legislation. Member States can apply criminal measures to punish any illegal behaviour seriously likely to injure people or pollute air, soil, water, plants or harm animals, when committed intentionally or with serious negligence.
Directive adopted by EP: 21.05.2008
Deadline for transposition: end Dec 2010 (24 months after entry into force)
Improved standards to protect groundwater against pollution and deterioration
Rules to protect groundwater from pollution have been in place at European level since 1980. A new directive sets out criteria for assessing chemical levels in groundwater and lays down measures to prevent hazardous substances including cyanide, arsenic, biocides and phytopharmaceutical substances from entering groundwater.
Directive adopted by EP: 12.12.2006
Deadline for transposition: 16.01.2009
Water pollutants to be more strictly controlled
MEPs adopted a new directive aimed at reducing or ending use of 33 pollutants − mainly pesticides and heavy metals − likely to be found in rivers, lakes and coastal waters, depending on the level of risk involved. By 2018 Member States will have to cease or phase out emissions, discharges and losses of hazardous substances. This is the final piece in the jigsaw of legislation under the Water Framework Directive.
Directive adopted by EP: 17.06.2008
Date of transposition: 18 months following entry into force (2nd reading agreement reached, not yet published, Council formally adopted 18 Sept 2008)
Eco-labelling
MEPs adopted new measures aiming to encourage manufacturers to make more eco-friendly goods and to facilitate clear labelling for consumers. The aim is to extend EU rules on energy efficiency labelling to a much wider range of products - for example windows.

European Parliament seals climate change package
The climate package adopted by the EP in December 2008 will facilitate reaching the overall objective of a 20% reduction in greenhouse gases, 20% improvement in energy efficiency, and a 20% share for renewables in the EU energy mix by 2020. MEPs also set ambitious goals for CO2 emissions from cars and required fuel suppliers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions caused by extraction or cultivation, transport and distribution, processing and combustion of transport fuels.
Revision of the Emission Trading System: further reductions
The EP adopted a directive reforming the system that allows for trading of polluting rights. The directive aims to reduce emissions of sectors included in the scheme by 21% from 2005 levels. The revised directive establishes auctioning from 2013 in principle but includes several exceptions for example to take into account some new Member States' dependence on coal. Free allocation will end in 2020. Sectors covered include, among others, power stations, refineries, coke ovens, ceramics, cement, glass, metal ore, iron, steel, pulp, paper.
Directive adopted by EP: 17.12.2008
Applicable progressively from: 1 January 2013
Reducing emissions from road transport and other sectors
The "effort sharing" decision sets binding national targets for each EU Member State to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from non-ETS sources (e.g. road and sea transport, buildings, services, agriculture and smaller industrial installations), between 2013 and 2020. These sources currently account for about 60% of all EU greenhouse gas emissions. The decision aims to reduce these emissions by 10% overall between 2013 and 2020. The effort sharing decision is the first of its kind worldwide.
Decision adopted by EP: 17.12.2008
Equipping power plants to store CO2 underground
Parliament also approved a proposed directive providing the legal framework for the new carbon dioxide capture and storage technology (CCS). To cut their CO2 emissions, industrial installations and power plants could in future use this new technology to capture CO2 and store it "permanently and safely underground" in geological formations. MEPs secured the funding for demonstration projects by ensuring that 300 million ETS allowances will be awarded to large scale CCS projects in the EU.
Directive adopted by EP: 17.12.2008
Applicable from: 24 months from entry into force
20% renewable energy in the EU's energy mix by 2020
A new directive will lay down mandatory national targets to be achieved by the Member States through promoting the use of renewable energy in the electricity, heating & cooling, and transport sectors in order to ensure that by 2020 renewable energy makes up at least 20% of the EU's total energy consumption. Under the agreement, by 2020, renewable energy - biofuels, electricity and hydrogen produced from renewable sources - should account for at least 10% of the EU's total fuel consumption in all forms of transport.
Directive adopted by EP: 17.12.2008
Applicable from: 18 months from entry into force
Reducing CO2 emissions from new cars
A new regulation sets emission performance standards for new passenger cars registered in the EU. It sets a target of an average of 120g of CO2/km for the whole car industry by 2012, compared to the current levels of 160g/km. An average target of 130g CO2/km for new passenger cars should be reached by improvements in vehicle motor technology. This will be supplemented by additional measures to achieve a further 10g/km reduction, so as to reach the 120g/km target through other technical improvements. There is also a longer-term target for 2020 of an average 95g CO2/km emissions for the new car fleet.
Regulation adopted by EP: 17.12.2008
Applicable from: third day after publication
Less greenhouse gas emissions from fuels
The revised fuel quality directive requires fuel suppliers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions caused by farming, mining, transport and distribution, processing and combustion of transport fuels (i.e. fossil fuels like petrol, diesel and gas-oil and also biofuels, blends, electricity and hydrogen) by 6% by 2020 as compared to 2010.
Directive adopted by EP: 17.12.2008
Applicable from: 1 January 2011
CO2 caps on airlines
MEPs included the aviation sector in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). All flights starting or landing in Europe will be included in the ETS from 1 January 2012. By 2012 airline emissions have to be cut to 97% of historic levels and to 95% by 2013. Military and police flights, as well as fire-fighting, humanitarian and emergency medical service flights are not included.
Directive adopted by EP: 8.07.2008.
Date of transposition: 12 months following entry into force 18.12.20008 - European Parliament seals climate change package 14.07.2008 - Aviation to be included in the European Trading System from 2012 as MEPs adopt legislation
Transport policy in the European Parliament
Safety, passengers and competitiveness at the core of the EPs transport policy. Strengthening passengers' rights, increasing safety both in the air and on the ground and fair competition were the pivotal concerns of MEPs in the field of transport. Parliament also adopted measures to promote the railway sector.
Impulse to transport of passengers by train
The so-called 3rd railways package aims to increase competition among transport services providers and to guarantee interoperability of networks. The new legislation adopted by the European Parliament to revitalise this type of transport opens provision of international services of passengers to companies of other Member States from 1 January 2010, and establishes minimum requirements for train drivers and basic rights of passengers. Freight transport was already opened to competition from 2007. (See also factsheet on consumer rights).
Regulation and directives, adopted: 25.9.2007. Applicable from: 31.12.2009
Passengers´ rights strengthened
Air travellers will benefit from clear ticket prices when booking a plane trip, as all extra charges will be clearly indicated. Disabled persons must get assistance to access airplane. Rail passengers will be compensated for delays or cancellations. These are some examples of the impact on passengers' rights of legislation adopted by Parliament during this mandate in the field of transport. (See also factsheet on consumers' rights).
Regulation on ticket prices adopted by EP: 9.7.2008. Fully applicable from: 1.11.2008
Regulation on passengers with disabilities adopted in EP: 15.12.2005. Fully applicable from: 26.7.2008
All-inclusive air fares
As of 1 November 2008, air travellers benefit from clear ticket prices when booking a plane trip. Following new rules adopted by the European Parliament, passengers are able to see at a glance exactly what they have to pay for their tickets: fares have to include all taxes, fees and charges added to the basic ticket price.
Regulation adopted by EP: 9.7.2008. Fully applicable from: 1.11.2008
More rights for air passengers with disabilities
The European Parliament passed legislation that improves the rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air. They can not be refused transportation on the grounds of their disabilities. Also, they have to be given − without additional charge − assistance to meet their particular needs at airports.
Regulation, adopted in EP: 15.12.2005. Fully applicable from: 26.7.2008
Aviation security
MEPs passed a law that lays down common rules and standards, such as screening of passengers and cabin baggage, access control and aircraft security checks. Weapons on board are only allowed if certain security requirements are met. If sky marshals are deployed, they must be specially selected and trained.
Regulation, adopted in EP: 11.3.2008. Applicable from: 29.4.2010
A common blacklist for unsafe airlines
As of 16 July 2006, airlines that fail to meet safety requirements appear on an EU-wide blacklist and are subject to an operating ban throughout the EU. According to the regulation adopted by the EP, passengers are also informed of the identity of the operating carrier and will have a right to compensation should the carrier be included on the blacklist after the reservation has been made.
Regulation, adopted in EP: 17.11.2005. Applicable from: 16.7.2006
A new charge system for 69 EU airports
The European Parliament adopted new rules that lay down common principles for levying charges at Community airports and aim to prevent individual airports abusing a dominant position on the market. The rules apply to airports with an annual throughput of over five million passengers per year (or at least the biggest airport in each Member State) and provides for mechanisms for resolving disputes between users and airports. The British and Irish airports affected are : Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Dublin, East Midlands, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, London Gatwick, London Heathrow, London Luton, London Stansted, Manchester and Newcastle.
Directive, adopted by EP 22.10.2008. Applicable from: end of 2010
Parliament sinks port services proposals
The European Parliament for a second time torpedoed proposals on market access to port services. Many MEPs demanded in its place legislation on fair competition between ports. A number of MEPs were against opening pilot services to competition and were concerned with the social implications of self-handling proposals.
Rejection by EP: 18.1.2006
Better protection for pedestrians and cyclists
The European Parliament endorsed plans to reduce the number of pedestrians and cyclists injured on Europe's roads by introducing tougher standards on the safety of motor vehicles, for example through compulsory introduction of brake-assist systems and frontal protection systems. Each year 8,000 pedestrians and cyclists are killed and 300,000 injured across the EU.
Regulation adopted by EP 18.6.2008; Applicable 9 months after publication (around November 2009)
Higher safety standards for road infrastructure
MEPs endorsed a directive promoting EU-wide standards on road infrastructure management. Member States must ensure that signs are in place to warn road users of repair work. The Directive also covers safe parking areas, crash barriers, road safety impact assessments and safety inspections. Currently, safety standards for roads and road design maintenance differ greatly between the Member States.
Directive adopted by EP: 19. June 2008 (1st reading)
Newly issued driving licences in credit-card format from 2013
As from 2013, all newly issued or replacement driving licences will be in a single EU-wide credit card format. The new format will replace the more than 110 existing different models in the Member States.
Directive, adopted by EP: 14.12.2006 Applicable from: 19.1.2013
Better accident compensation for ship passengers under third maritime package
Compensation for passengers in the event of shipping accidents and an EU blacklist of substandard ships are among highlights of the third maritime package, a long-awaited raft of legislation that was adopted by the European Parliament. The seven pieces of legislation in the package - also known as "Erika III" after the 1999 Erika oil spill - will improve both the safety of ships and the action taken in the event of an accident. The package covers not just compensation for passengers but also ship inspections, port state control, shipping accident investigations and the choice of the authority that decides where a ship in distress should go. All the legislation was approved by Parliament following a deal reached with Council in conciliation negotiations.
Adopted by EP: 11.03.2009
Single European Sky
European aviation will be governed by more efficient rules, which should lead to shorter flights, fewer delays and reduced fuel consumption. The adopted regulation establishes binding objectives for air traffic control and air management in terms of safety, environment, capacity, and cost efficiency. Member States must establish a system of incentives and sanctions to assure that targets are met.
Regulation adopted by the EP: 25.03.2009
New maritime legislation
The third maritime package aims to reinforce existing legislation protecting Europe against maritime accidents and pollution. It includes provisions on flag states' obligations, the inspection regime in EU ports, places of refuge for ships in distress, passenger protection standards, insurance obligations, classification societies and civil liability issues.
Directives and regulations adopted by the EP: 11.03.2009
Airport slots: European Parliament agrees to suspend the "use it or lose it" rule
Airline companies hit by the economic slowdown will benefit from relaxed rules on the allocation of airport slots, allowing them not to lose unused slots, MEPs agree in Strasbourg today when they adopted a legislative report with 508 votes in favour, 20 against and 7 abstentions. Air carriers will be entitled to the same series of slots during the summer 2010 scheduling season as were allocated to them during the summer 2009 season, even if they use them less than 80% of the time this year, according to the draft Regulation revising rules laid out by the EU in 1993 (Regulation EEC No 95/93.)
Adopted: 7.5.2009
MEPs adopt road transport package
Fewer empty lorries travelling across Europe, longer maximum working hours for coach and bus drivers and tougher inspections of transport companies: these are the main elements of a package of legislation adopted today by Parliament following an agreement with Council.
Adopted: 23.4.2009 01.10.2007 - Third rail package approved - opening up the rail market and European licenses for train drivers 19.09.2007 - Plenary vote on the future of the Community's railways 09.07.2008 - All-inclusive air fares just around the corner as MEP back legislation on transparency 16.12.2005 - Parliament strengthens rights of air passengers with disabilities 11.03.2008 - Common rules for safeguarding civil aviation - sky marshals must be "specially selected and trained" 17.11.2005 - A common blacklist for unsafe airlines 23.10.2008 - MEPs agree common charge system for EU airports 23.06.2008 - Better protection for pedestrians and cyclists to be introduced more quickly 19.06.2008 - MEPs adopt legislation on higher safety standards for road infrastructure 09.06.2008 - Coach drivers will be able to work up to 12 consecutive days under strict conditions say MEPs 14.12.2006 - Newly issued driving licences in credit-card format from 2013 18.01.2006 - Parliament sinks port services proposals 25.09.2008 - Maritime package: Parliament still at odds with Council 21.05.2008 - Modern rules for road freight operations and road transport operator licensing 23.10.2008 - MEPs agree common charge system for EU airports 21.05.2008 - Modern rules for road freight operations and road transport operator licensing Access to the market in the carriage of goods by road to or from the territory of a Member State or passing across the territory of one or more Member States (repeal. Regulation (EEC) No 92/881 and Directive 2006/94/EC) MEPs adopt road transport package Airport slots: European Parliament agrees to suspend the "use it or lose it" rule
Products and services markets consumers' rights and the needs of industry
Further opening up of the single market has been one of the key themes of this legislature. MEPs have adopted legislation affecting the energy, telecoms, intellectual property, financial and postal sectors, as well as the overarching directive covering the market in services. At each vote, the European Parliament has sought to balance industry needs for easier access to markets with consumers' rights to adequate protection. MEPs give green light to further liberalisation of EU electricity and gas markets
Removing obstacles to the free movement of services
The Services Directive removes obstacles to the free movement of services and to the establishment of service providers in other Member States. Restrictions will only be acceptable on specific grounds (public policy and security, environmental protection, public health). Member States will have to reduce red tape, for instance by the creation of a single "point of contact" (one-stop shop), so service providers will not have to deal with several different authorities at national, regional and local level. Council followed Parliament's position so the final text reflects a balance between competition and social protection.
Directive adopted by EP: 15/11/2006
Transposition: 28/12/2009
MEPs give green light to further liberalisation of EU electricity and gas markets
EU energy markets will become more competitive as energy companies will have to separate supply and production from transmission activities. The wide-ranging rules adopted by Parliament also improve consumer rights, strengthen the powers of national regulators and promote regional solidarity in the event of severe gas supply disruptions. Parliament backed by a large majority a compromise on the "third energy package" agreed between MEPs and the Council Presidency ahead of the EP's second-reading vote. Member States will have one and a half years to put most of the new rules into effect.
Adopted 22.4.2009
Postal services fully open to competition
The remaining postal service monopolies in the EU should expire by 1 January 2011, although 11 Member States have the possibility to postpone market opening until 2013, either because they joined the EU after 2004 and had difficulty in adapting their postal markets, or because they have a difficult topography (huge number of islands, small population, limited size). To avoid unfair competition, those Member States having already opened their markets can refuse authorisation to operators still protected by a national monopoly. A universal service is still guaranteed: letters should go on being both delivered and collected at least once a day, at least five days a week, for every EU citizen, in remote areas as well as cities. Member States will be able to include employment and social considerations when opening up the postal market.
Directive adopted by EP: 31/01/2008
Transposition: 31/12/2010 (or 31/12/2012: MS concerned are Czech Republic, Greece, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia)
EP rejects proposals on port services and software patents
The EP used its power to reject proposals when MEPs considered that "no directive is better than a bad directive". That was for a proposed directive opening up port services to competition. Members were against the proposed rules on self-handling and pilot services, arguing that they would endanger jobs and security and lead to unfair competition. MEPs demanded in its place legislation on fair competition between ports. MEPs also voted against legislation on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions, which some believed would have led to software being patented.
EP vote on Port services: 17/01/2006, rejected by 532 votes to 120 with 25 abstentions
EP vote on Software patents: 6/07/2005, rejected by 648 votes to 14 with 1 abstentions
Independence of auditors
MEPs also adopted new rules intended to help improve quality audits within the EU and underpin confidence in the functioning of EU capital markets. European auditors and audit firms are required to prove their independence from the management of the audited company.
Directive adopted by EP: 28/09/2005
Transposition: 29/06/2008
Calls for legislation in financial services
MEPs have also taken a broader view of what is needed in the future and have formally requested the Commission to make proposals on a wide range of subjects, some in light of the financial crisis. Parliament was behind calls for regulation of credit rating agencies to address potential conflicts of interest. Also, it requested changes to ensure that a system of capital requirements applies to all financial institutions regardless of their precise legal form – this would include hedge funds and private equity vehicles − and to ensure the supervision of cross-border financial institutions is put on a firmer footing.
Looking ahead
Telecom package
Proposed reforms of existing legislation on electronic communications (such as mobile and fixed telephony, broadcasting, internet, etc.) are also due to return to the EP. The telecom package aims to improve competition, to eliminate barriers that remain in the already liberalised market and to promote investment in next-generation networks, while guaranteeing consumer protection. The reform also covers the management of radio spectrum.

Stability in financial services with safeguards for customers
MEPs have adopted legislation aiming to give Europe a stable and competitive financial services industry which gives priority to the interests of consumers. Parliament has been pressing the Commission for a more rapid response to the financial crisis and a better overall system of supervision for Europe’s still fragmented financial services markets. As a consequence, MEPs adopted new rules to avoid future financial crisis - Capital Requirements Directives , new rules on credit rating agencies and guaranteed better financial supervsion.
New rules to avoid future financial crisis - Capital Requirements Directives
The European Parliament adopted a legislative report by Othmar Karas (EPP-ED, AT) which amends the "Capital Requirements" Directives to improve the transparency and the supervision of the financial system to ensure proper risk management in the banking sector. The legislative resolution was adopted with 454 votes in favour, 106 against and 25 abstentions. The major change after negotiations is the inclusion of a review clause, asking the Commission to present a proposal by 31 December 2009, with an increase in the retention rate, if considered convenient after consulting the Committee of European Banking Supervisors and taking into account international developments.
Directive adopted by EP: 6.5.2009
Credit Rating Agencies: partially responsible for the current financial crisis say MEPs
Strict rules to improve transparency and independence of European credit rating were endorsed by the European Parliament on Thursday in Strasbourg when MEPs adopted a legislative report with 569 votes in favour, 47 against and 4 abstentions. According to Members, credit rating agencies failed to detect the worsening of the financial market conditions and to adapt their ratings in time. They also failed to adapt to the new risks of the credit market, e.g. structured credit products (derivatives) and hedge funds.
Adopted by EP: 23.4.2009
Solvency II: better financial supervision of the insurance industry
A major overhaul of the supervisory framework to enhance the financial stability of the insurance industry was approved on Wednesday by the European Parliament in Strasbourg. MEPs voted 593 votes in favour, 80 against with 3 abstentions on the so-called Solvency II legalisation. The aim of the approved legislation, called Solvency II, is to help ensure the financial stability of insurance (and reinsurance) companies by introducing more sophisticated solvency requirements which will take better account of the risks the companies must deal with: insurance risks as at present, but also market, credit and operational risks.
Adopted: 22.4.2009
Independence of auditors
MEPs adopted new rules intended to help improve quality audits within the EU and underpin confidence in the functioning of EU capital markets. European auditors and audit firms are required to prove their independence from the management of the audited company.
Directive adopted by EP: 28/09/2005
Bank deposits guaranteed up to €100,000
If a European bank fails, citizens' savings will be guaranteed up to €100,000, after Parliament backed legislation raising the guarantee level. The existing minimum guarantee of €20,000 will first rise to €50,000 by 30 June 2009, and then €100,000 by the end of 2010. MEPs also decided that bank customers should be given faster access to their deposits in emergencies and that a mechanism be established for cross-border cooperation in the event of another economic crisis.
Simpler, cheaper cross-border payments on the way
MEPs adopted a legal framework designed to make cashless payments – such as card transactions, bank transfers and direct debits – simpler and cheaper, paving the way for the creation the single Euro payments area. Adopted in April 2007, the legislation opened the door for the banking industry to meet its 2010 target for introducing new systems and procedures to make cross-border payments move as quickly and cheaply as national ones. 28.09.2005 - Parliament adopts Basel II directives Official Journal 30.6.2006 - Text of Directive 28.09.2005 - No to compulsory auditing committees Directive on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts 18.12.2008 - European Parliament approves increase in bank deposit guarantee 18.12.2008 - Text adopted - Deposit-guarantee schemes as regards the coverage level and the payout delay 23.09.2008 - MEPs call for new legislation to ensure financial stability 09.10.2008 - Financial market supervision: Parliament calls for wide-ranging reform 24.04.2007 - Simpler, cheaper cross-border payments on the way Directive on payment services in the internal market New rules to avoid future financial crisis - Capital Requirements Directives Credit Rating Agencies: partially responsible for the current financial crisis say MEPs Solvency II: better financial supervision of the insurance industry
European Parliament and the protection of consumers
Cheaper mobile phone roaming charges across the EU including SMS and data charges, a clear indication of charges for flight tickets, reinforcement of rail passenger rights and easier cross-border consumer credit are some of the most significant achievements of the European Parliament in the last 5 years. New rights for air passengers with disabilities and new TV advertising rules have also featured .
Lower charges for mobile roaming from 1 July 2009
Charges for calling, texting and mobile internet surfing while travelling abroad in the EU will be cut from 1 July 2009. The amended regulation was adopted by 646 votes in favour, with 22 votes against and 9 abstentions. MEPs backed by large majority a compromise agreement reached with Council on the extension of the 2007 roaming regulation.
The regulation does not fix roaming prices at rates set by the EU, but sets ceilings beneath which mobile operators can compete by offering lower prices. The existing 2007 roaming regulation lays down that from 1 July 2009 consumers will have to pay a maximum of €0.43 per minute (excluding VAT) for outgoing and a maximum of €0.19 per minute (excluding VAT) for incoming roaming calls.
The new legislative text sets roaming phone call caps for 2010 and 2011 - i.e. home operators may charge their customers for a roaming phone call:
from 1 July 2010: a maximum of €0.39 per minute (excluding VAT) for outgoing and a maximum of €0.15 per minute (excluding VAT) for incoming roaming calls;from 1 July 2011: a maximum of €0.35 per minute (excluding VAT) for outgoing and a maximum of €0.11 per minute (excluding VAT) for incoming roaming calls.
MEPs and the Council Presidency agreed with the Commission that a roamed text message (SMS) should cost a maximum of €0.11 (excluding VAT) from 1 July 2009.
Other data roaming services (such as sending emails and pictures or web-browsing from mobile phones or laptops) will be regulated at wholesale level – i.e. there will be a price cap for the rates the host operator charges a roaming customer’s home operator, calculated on a kilobyte basis:
from 1 July 2009: a maximum of €1.00 per megabyte (excluding VAT);from 1 July 2010: a maximum of €0.80 per megabyte (excluding VAT);from 1 July 2011: a maximum of €0.50 per megabyte (excluding VAT).
Regulation adopted by EP: 22.4.2009
Operators have had to offer the Eurotariff since 30.7.2007
The regulation expires: 30.6.2010 (but proposals have been tabled for new tariffs after that date)
Air fares must include all charges
Passengers can now see at a glance what they have to pay for a flight ticket thanks to a Regulation adopted by the European Parliament. Advertisements must indicate the final price of plane tickets, including all taxes, fees and charges added to the basic ticket price. This applies also to internet bookings. Any optional price supplements must be communicated in a clear way at the start of the booking process.
Regulation adopted by EP: 9.7.2008
Fully applicable from 1 November 2008
Rail passengers' rights strengthened
Reinforced rights of rail passengers, including compensation for delays and ease of access for disabled people, were the focus of a Regulation adopted by the EP. Compensation in the event of delays on international services will be 25% of the fare for a delay of at least 60 minutes and 50% for a delay of 120 minutes or more. MEPs insisted that the Regulation cover domestic journeys as well as international ones, though Member States can delay introducing this for up to 15 years.
Regulation adopted by EP: 25.9.2007
Fully applicable from 3.12.2009
Rights of air passengers with disabilities
New rules adopted by the European Parliament state that disabled persons may not be refused transport on the grounds of their disability or lack of mobility. They also have to be given − without additional charge − assistance to board the aircraft and reach the exit.
Regulation adopted by EP: 15.12.2005
Fully applicable from 26.7.2008
New TV advertising rules
The EP updated existing legislation on TV advertising which introduces new strict rules for commercials addressed to children and for product placement. The maximum amount of advertising will not exceed 12 minutes an hour. Films and news programmes can only be interrupted once in a schedule of at least 30 minutes. Children's programmes can only be interrupted once in a schedule of at least 30 minutes if they last more than half an hour. Product placement will only be allowed in films, series, sports programmes and entertainment programmes and is prohibited in all children's programmes.
Regulation adopted by EP: 29.11.2007
Fully applicable from 19.12.2009
Improving toy safety in Europe
European children will have safer toys to play with after the EP adopted a new EU directive which beefs up safety regulations. It bans carcinogenic substances and those toxic for reproduction; it also restricts the use of heavy metals and fragrances. It will reduce the risk of choking on toys contained in food such as chocolate eggs by prohibiting these practices in most cases. Warnings must be in language understandable to consumers and be visible at the point of sale, including for on line sales.
Directive adopted by EP: 18.12.2008 / Transposition date: beginning 2011 (2 years after entry into force)
Cross-border consumer credit simpler
A new directive approved by the EP aims to facilitate access to consumer credit in other Member States. For loans between €200 and €75 000, banks will have to provide standard information which can be compared with other offers, including on the right to pay off early. Although two out of three Europeans buy furniture or a car on credit, most use banks in their own countries. The idea is to create cross-border choice. Mortgage loans are excluded.
Regulation adopted by EP: 16.1.2008 / Fully applicable from 12.5.2010
New definition and labelling of spirit drinks
Traditional vodka can be made of any agricultural product if it is clearly indicated on the label, according to a regulation adopted by the EP. The new rules maintain existing geographical designations and do not allow flavouring of spirits.
Regulation adopted by the EP: 19.6.2007
Fully applicable from 20.5.2008
Tougher EU rules on gun ownership

Directive adopted by the EP: 29.11.2007
Fully applicable from 28.07.2010
More choice of package sizes for shoppers
Parliament gave the green light to deregulation of packaging sizes for products like milk, sugar, butter, coffee, pasta or rice. This will make it possible to sell these and other products in a wider range of sizes. The pint of milk is not banned, and producers will be free to determine which sizes should be sold.
Directive adopted by EP: 10.05.2007
Fully applicable from 11.04.2009
New rules on fireworks
The EP adopted a directive to reduce the number of accidents due to the misuse of fireworks. The new rules introduce a system of minimum age restrictions for potential buyers and set up basic safety requirements.

The European Parliament working for a healthier Europe
Rules on recognition of health professionals' qualifications, on cleaner air, better quality bathing water, safer medicines for children and on use of mercury are some examples of legislation adopted by the European Parliament in the last five years. MEPs also made funding available for health projects under the EU's overall Research Programme 2007-2013. Extending patients' rights to seek treatment in another EU Member State is a major piece of legislation to be voted soon .
Health professionals - recognition of qualifications
GPs, nurses, dentists, midwives and physiotherapists are among the health professionals covered by new rules on recognition of professional qualifications. The aim of the legislation adopted by the European Parliament was to make it easier for professionals to provide services in another EU Member State, while at the same time giving host countries greater powers to check qualifications before allowing individuals to practise.
Directive adopted by EP: 11/05/2005
Deadline for transposition into national law: 20 October 2007
Incentives for drug firms to develop child medicine
The European Parliament adopted new rules extending patent protection for paediatric medicines by six months. The aim is to encourage pharmaceutical companies to invest more in developing paediatric medicines and to ensure that only those firms meeting strict standards will be allowed to enter the market.
Regulation adopted by EP: 01/06/2006
Fully applicable from 26/01/2009
Bathing waters - cleaner beaches and rivers
Parliament revised European legislation dating from 1976 and tightened up water quality standards of beaches, rivers and lakes. The aim is to reduce the likelihood of infections from bacteria. There will be new standards of water quality (excellent, good, sufficient and poor) and, by 2015, all bathing waters will have to have achieved the 'sufficient' standard. Bathers will also have access to information on the safety of EU bathing sites both at the beach and on the internet.
Directive adopted by EP: 18/01/2006
Deadline for transposition into national law: 24/03/2008
Cleaner air
The European Parliament updated EU legislation to prevent and reduce air pollution. For the first time, MEPs defined maximum concentration levels for small particles or dust (known as PM2.5) which are the most hazardous to human health and can cause cancer and respiratory illnesses such as asthma, bronchitis and emphysema. The objective is to reduce concentration of these particles to 20 micrograms per cubic meter, but these indicative levels will be reviewed in 2013, with the possibility of making them obligatory. Sampling points must be established in cities of over 250,000 inhabitants and in rural areas.
Adopted by EP: 11/12/2007
Deadline for transposition: 11/06/2010
EU funding for health research – €6.1 billion over seven ye ars
The EU's overall research programme, adopted by the EP, includes a funding stream for health research projects. €6.1 billion has been set aside for health research between 2007 and 2013. At MEPs' insistence, stem cell research can be financed but only if this is in line with the law of the Member State concerned. EU research funds cannot be used for human cloning or genetics.
Adopted by EP: 30/11/2006
Implementation: 2007-2013
Mercury bans
MEPs adopted legislation to reduce the use of mercury, which carries a high risk to human cardiovascular and immune systems and to the development of embryos. From March 2011, the export of mercury from the EU will be prohibited. The sale of new mercury thermometers for both professional and private use is banned from 3 April 2009, with a six-month extension for barometers. Existing instruments can still be repaired or bought and sold second-hand.
Export ban adopted by EP: 21/05/2008; Applicable from: 15/03/2011
Ban on mercury instruments adopted by EP: 10/07/2007; Applicable from: 03/04/2009 .
Besides legislative acts, MEPs also adopted resolutions calling for immediate actions in several health-related fields:
Fight against smoking – smoke-free workplaces
The European Parliament called on member states to introduce, by the end of 2009, smoking bans in all enclosed workplaces, including catering establishments, public buildings and transport, and also in children's playgrounds.
Report adopted in EP: 24/10/2007
Step up against cancer

Patient mobility – healthcare without borders
The European Parliament is due to vote in April 2009 on a proposal to facilitate patients' access to healthcare anywhere in the EU. The aim is to clarify the conditions under which patients will have the right to treatment in other Member States, and how the costs of such treatment should be met.
Proposal adopted by the European Commission: 03/07/2008
Date of vote in EP: April 2009 01.06.2006 - EP vote should mean more medicine development for children 18.01.2006 - Safer bathing in cleaner water 11.12.2007 - Air quality: MEPs set maximum concentration of microparticles 30.11.2006 - Green light for seventh framework research programme for 2007-2013 21.05.2008 - Export-ban of mercury and mercury compounds from the EU by 2011 10.07.2007 - Ban on sale of mercury measuring instruments - MEPs agree two year exemption for barometers 24.10.2007 - EP calls for EU-wide ban on smoking in the workplace 10.04.2008 - Cancer: MEPs call for EU cancer task force to be set up 25.10.2006 - Fight against breast cancer in the enlarged EU 25.09.2008 - Fight obesity earlier in life say MEPs 22.04.2008 - How to fight organ shortages and "transplant tourism"
Employment and Social Affairs a key concern for the European Parliament
No agreement on the Working Time Directive, employment rights for temporary agency workers, cross-border recognition of professional qualifications to facilitate working in another Member State, and labour law aspects of the services directive are some examples of legislation in the social affairs field. Proposals to improve reconciliation of family and work will be in the parliamentary agenda in the months to come .
No agreement reached on the reform of Working Time Directive after conciliation
The working time directive limits the working week to 48 hours averaged out over a 17-week period, but it allows member states to opt out from that provision. It also regulates resting time and on-call time. After years of negotiations to reform the directive, the European Parliament and Council could not find a compromise on three crucial points: the opt-out, on-call time and multiple contracts. Since there is no agreement, the current directive remains into force. The Commission can draft a new proposal from scratch to take account the rulings of the European Court of Justice on on-call time.
Equal rights for temporary agency workers
Temporary agency workers will have the same rights as those employed directly by the company to which they are assigned. Equal treatment will apply from day one unless the social partners agree otherwise, as in the UK, where it only applies after 12 weeks. Basic conditions such as pay, training, maternity leave, holidays, are included, as well as access to facilities such as canteens, childcare or transport.
Adopted by EP: 22. 10. 2008 (co-decision, 2nd reading)
Fully applicable from: three years after entry into force (end of 2011)
Recognition of qualifications to facilitate working abroad
With the aim of helping professionals such as doctors, nurses and architects to work in another Member State, a new directive provides for the recognition of diplomas obtained in any country of the European Union. Notaries public were excluded. Member States have the power to check qualifications before allowing individuals to practise.
Adopted by EP: 11. 5. 2005 (co-decision)
Fully applicable from: 20. 10. 2007
Services directive − no change of labour law
The services directive, which removes obstacles to the establishment and provision of cross-border services, was amended by Parliament to make clear that national labour law, working conditions and social security legislation were not affected and remain unchanged.
Adopted by EP: 15. 11. 2006 (co-decision, 2nd reading)
Fully applicable from: 28. 12. 2009
New Fund to help people back to work
Parliament adopted a first -reading agreement with Council to broaden temporarily the scope of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. The aim of the agreement adopted by the European Parliament with 538 votes in favour, 35 against and 37 abstentions - rapporteur Gabriele Stauner (EPP-ED, DE) - is to provide support to workers made redundant as a direct result of the global financial and economic crisis. Member States applying for an EGF contribution should therefore establish a "direct and demonstrable" link between the redundancies and the financial and economic crisis. The derogation applies to all application receives from 1 May 2009 and submitted before 31 December 2011".

Measures to improve conciliation of family life and work
In the next few months, Parliament will be scrutinizing proposed changes in legislation which aim to improve work-life balance. All Member States would have to guarantee a minimum maternity leave of 18 weeks, instead of the current 14 weeks. Self-employed women will also get access to maternity leave.

Immigration and Free Movement
In this mandate, Parliament adopted legislation establishing key principles for an effective policy to return illegal immigrants, with safeguards for their rights. MEPs also called for the development of legal channels for immigrants to enter the EU, including a blue card for highly skilled workers. Parliament also gave the green light, in 2007, to nine new Members States joining the EU's Schengen area for free movement. Legislation introducing sanctions against employers of non-EU nationals working illegally in the Member States has also been adopted.
Return of illegal immigrants: towards common rules and minimum standards
A directive establishing common rules and minimum conditions for the return and expulsion of illegal immigrants was adopted by the European Parliament following a long debate. The text encourages voluntary departure of illegal non-EU nationals (giving them at least 7 days to leave voluntarily and up to 30 days, after which the Member State has the right to detain them), while at the same time fixing minimum standards for custody and deportation, including for children and health-related issues. The maximum period of custody is fixed at 6 months, which under certain circumstances can be extended by a further 12 months. Prohibition of re-entry is in principle for a maximum of five years, unless the deported person is a threat to public safety. Member States retain the right to suspend such a prohibition.
Directive adopted by EP: 18.06.08 (first reading) by 369 in favour, 197 against and 106 abstentions
Transposition: 24 months from publication in OJ; 36 months for providing free legal assistance.
Green light to expansion of the free movement space - Schengen
The Schengen Area has no border controls between its participating countries. The European Parliament supported the enlargement of the Schengen area to nine of the ten Member States that joined the EU in 2004. Thus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia have removed all land, sea and air border controls between them and the rest of the Schengen countries: Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Finland and Sweden, as well as Iceland and Norway – countries associated with Schengen). The UK, Ireland, Cyprus, Romania and Bulgaria are now the only EU Member States outside Schengen.
Adoption : 15.11.07 (consultation)
Implementation: 30 March 2008 for air controls, earlier for land and sea
Other votes
Opening up labour market to third country workers - blue card
In a resolution establishing priorities for an EU migration policy, the European Parliament underlined the need for well-managed legal immigration, as legal channels were needed to counter illegal immigration. MEPs had called, already in 2007, for a blue card to facilitate the entry of highly qualified migrants to take jobs in sectors suffering skills shortages. Subsequently, Parliament supported the scheme developed by the European Commission, but urged Member States to avoid a brain-drain from third countries.
Resolution adopted by EP: 26.09.07 by 557 in favour, 101 against and 22 abstentions
EP vote: 20.11.2008 (consultation)
Call for free access to labour markets for new Member States
Parliament called on "old" Member States to open their labour markets to workers from the new Member States, putting an end to the transitional measures restricting access to workers from eight new Member States until 2011. Most countries have subsequently opened their labour markets to workers from all the EU, but at the end of 2008 restrictions remained in Belgium, Denmark, Austria and Germany.
EP vote: 05.04.2006
Sanctions against employers who illegally employ third-country nationals
Parliament adopted the legislative resolution on the crackdown on employers of illegal immigrants, following the vote on the amendments in Strasbourg on 4 February. At the time, MEPs decided to postpone the final vote at the request of the rapporteur Claudio FAVA (PES, IT) to allow the addition of a declaration providing reassurance that this directive will not prevent further legislation on subcontractors. Between 4.5 and 8 million illegal immigrants work in the construction, farming, hotel and other sectors in the EU. One of the factors encouraging illegal immigration into the EU is the possibility of finding work. This legislation aims to reduce that pull factor by targeting the employment of third-country nationals who are illegally staying in the EU. Vote in EP January/February 2009 (first reading) 18.06.2008 - Parliament adopts directive on return of illegal immigrants 15.11.2007 - MEPs congratulate nine new Member States for joining the Schengen area 26.09.2007 - Parliament adopts priorities on legal and illegal immigration policies 20.11.2008 - MEPs support the European "Blue Card" proposal for highly-skilled immigrants 05.04.2006 - MEPs call for free access to EU15 labour markets for new Member States Legislative Observatory - Immigration policy: sanctions against employers of illegally staying third-country nationals 19.02.2009 - MEPs adopt legislative resolution on crackdown on employers of illegal immigrants
Security, terrorism and civil liberties
Parliament has supported measures to fight terrorism and to improve security, to react to new challenges the European Union was facing, while at the same time making sure legislation guaranteed core democratic values. MEPs were critical of CIA anti-terrorist activities in Europe and of agreements on data sharing with US authorities. During this legislature, Parliament has also revised existing legislation on civil aviation security, gun ownership and money laundering.
Countering air terrorism
To protect passengers and goods from terrorist attacks, the European Parliament adopted new measures on security at airports and planes. The law lays down common standards for screening of passengers and cabin baggage, security checks of cargo and mail, access control and staff selection and training. Should Member States choose to use them, in-flight security officers ('sky marshals') must be specially selected and trained.
Regulation adopted by EP: 11/03/2008
Fully applicable: 29/04/2009
Measures to fight money laundering and financing of terrorism
Financial institutions have to check customers' identity when they open an account or transfer sums above €15,000. Anonymous accounts and those opened under false names are banned. Casinos should also check the identity of any customers gambling more than €2 000. These new measures are part of the legislation on money laundering, revised to improve the fight against organised crime and terrorism. Parliament amended the proposed legislation to ensure it included financing of terrorism within the scope.

Transposition deadline : 15/12/2007
Biometric passports
All EU countries will be issuing biometric passports from the end of June this year. Following the vote of Parliament, no fingerprints will be taken of children under 12: experience shows that such data is of insufficient quality and changes as children grow older. Instead, to prevent child trafficking, minors will have their own passports containing parents' names. However, already issued documents will continue to be valid. The UK has not opted into this legislation but has said it will introduce rules to mirror the EU Regulation.
Regulation adopted by EP: 14.01.2009 (Council's formal decision pending)
Deadline for introduction of one person, one passport: 36 months after entry into force
Deadline for introduction of biometric passports (including fingerprinting provisions): 28.06.2009
Tougher EU rules on gun ownership
The European Parliament updated current EU rules on gun ownership to reduce illegal traffic, including over the internet. The legislation sets up computerised data systems so that all firearms can be traceable to owners, and prohibits people under 18 from possessing firearms.
Directive adopted by EP: 29/11/2007
Deadline for transposition: 28/07/2010. For computerized databases: 31/12/2014
Telecommunication companies to retain call data, but no content
To help national authorities to combat terrorism and organised crime, a new directive requires telecommunication companies to retain certain call data. They must keep the information necessary to identify the source, destination and location of communications made by phone and on the internet, but this does not include the content. Data must be kept for between 6 and 24 months, and it is up to each Member State to decide how long. The law also sets data protection standards.
Directive adopted by EP: 24/11/2005
Transposition deadline: 15/09/2009
Political positions and consultations
In addition to legislation, the EP has been questioning the actions of Member States where these were not consistent with the core values of the EU. It has also aimed to reinforce civil liberties in legislation on which it was consulted, but did not have the final say.
CIA activities in Europe
According to Parliament's final report, adopted after a year of work by its temporary committee, "at least 1,245 flights operated by the CIA flew into European airspace or stopped over at European airports" from 2001 to 2005. MEPs regret that European countries had been "turning a blind eye" to such flights, "which, on some occasions, were being used for extraordinary rendition or the illegal transportation of detainees".
Report adopted by EP: 14/02/2007
Concerns over air passenger data exchanges
MEPs were concerned that agreements to provide non-EU countries with data on air passengers contravened data protection legislation. On several occasions, Parliament requested more democratic control of these so-called Passenger Name Record (PNR) agreements. Due to privacy concerns, Parliament also criticised a European plan to collect air passenger records for law enforcement purposes.
Body scanners raise concerns
MEPs expressed concerns over the proposal to generalise the introduction of 'body scanners' at European airports, which would produce images of people as if they were naked. Subsequently the Commission withdrew the proposal so that it could be reconsidered.
New antiterrorist measures
Parliament supported the inclusion of incitement to terrorism, recruitment and terrorism training in the list of offences covered by European anti-terrorism legislation. However, MEPs called for changes so that any risks to freedom of expression should be minimised.
EP vote (consultation): 23.9.2008

MEPs active on culture, education and sport
In the field of culture, education and sport, the European Parliament has fought for more money to go to education programmes, emphasised the important role of sport in society, and shown its support for European cinema. The new directive on audiovisual services was also adopted. When celebrating the Year of Intercultural dialogue in 2008 Parliament hosted a number of leading cultural figures and religious leaders.
Easier to compare qualifications
To ease mobility of students and workers, Parliament adopted legislation which will facilitate, as of 2012, the comparison of qualifications from school-leavers´ diplomas, vocational training certificates and academic degrees. Another directive already applicable provides for the recognition of diplomas obtained in any country of the European Union regarding certain professions such as doctors, nurses and architects. Member States will retain powers to check qualifications before allowing individuals to practise.
Recognition of higher education diplomas
Adopted by EP: 11. 5. 2005 (codecision)
Fully applicable from: 20. 10. 2007
More money for Erasmus students
MEPs have ensured more EU money to facilitate studying in another Member State: On 1 January 2007, grants to Erasmus students went up from €150 to €200 a month. Erasmus is one of the programmes financed by the European Union. Other strands of the EU's Lifelong Learning Programme, running from 2007-2013 are the Leonardo training programme and the Comenius school exchange programme. The funding for all of these got the green light from the European Parliament in October 2006.
Lifelong Learning programmes including Erasmus adopted 25.10.2006
New rules for TV content
The new rules on audiovisual services adopted by the European Parliament established that not only television broadcasters, but also on-demand services like web-tv, should promote European programmes. The new legislation updates the TV without Frontiers Directive which allowed Member States to guarantee free access to events of major national importance (these are usually sports events, but can also mean culture in its broadest sense, including music festivals or royal weddings). The legislation also updates rules on advertising and product placement, and does not allow the sponsoring of news and current affairs programmes.
Adopted in EP 29.11.2007
Implementation in Member states by 19.12. 2009

Proposals for university reform
In a report on the Bologna Process, which aims to create a European Higher Education Area by 2010, MEPs argued for a more flexible university system in three stages: bachelor/master/doctorate. They suggested a "4+1" year system for the first 2 stages could facilitate employability. Parliament also proposed the introduction of a European Student Identity Card to facilitate mobility and enable students to get discounts in other countries.
Bologna-process, Initiative report adopted 23.09.2008
Early learning of foreign langua ges
Proficiency in at least two foreign languages should be a basic skill for every European, stressed the European Parliament. MEPs argued in a non binding resolution that pupils should learn at least two foreign languages at an early age. Language studies also receive financing from the EU Lifelong learning programmes (Erasmus. Leonardo, Comenius)
Common indicator for language learning. Report adopted in EP: 27.04.2006
Call for more sports in schools
Parliament highlighted the importance of sports in society and called for at least three hours a week of compulsory physical education in schools. A key aim is to combat children obesity.
Football in the spotlight
Several parliamentary resolutions addressed professional football in the EU and emphasised that EU competition rules should not impede recruitment of locally trained players. Following racist remarks in football stadiums, MEPs called on UEFA and other competition organisers in Europe to ensure that referees stop or abandon matches in the event of serious racist abuse. Parliament also alerted on possible corruption in football.
LUX-prize: commitment to cinema
MEPs have repeatedly voiced their strong support for the European film industry. In 2006, they adopted the €755 million EU Media programme (2007-2013), supporting audiovisual production in Europe. In 2007, the LUX-prize for cinema was first awarded. The objective of the European Parliament cinema-prize is to facilitate the distribution of European films in other member states by subtitling the winning film in the 23 official EU-languages.
2008: Year of Intercultural Dialogue
To celebrate the Year of Intercultural dialogue in 2008 the Parliament hosted, in formal plenary sitting, the Dalai Lama, Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, the Grand Mufti of Syria, Ahmad Bader Hassoun, the Ecumenical Patriarch of the Orthodox Church, Bartholomew I, the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, Asma Jilani Jahangir and Jorge Sampaio, high representative of the UN-initiative Alliance of Civilisations.
Looking ahead
Protection of authors' rights
Parliament will be assessing a proposal to extend the term of protection for sound recordings and performers from the current 50 year term, to 70 years following their death. The extension, according to the proposal, will bring added income to authors, performers and record companies. This would offset losses due to internet piracy and allow companies to spend money on new European performers.

Money for Policies: Political priorities backed up by financial means
The European Parliament used the power it shares with the Council of Ministers on budgetary matters to make its mark on the overall EU budget planning for 2007-2013 as well on each annual EU budget. The European Parliament's political priorities are reflected in the allocation of funding across different programmes.
Some examples of money allocated by Parliament during this mandate :

In 2006, after two year of negotiations with the representatives of national governments in the EU Council of Ministers, the European Parliament adopted the overall financial framework for 2007-2013. Agriculture and structural/cohesion funds represent the bulk of the budget namely 42.9% and 35.6% respectively.
Parliament managed to obtain € 4 billion more than the EU Member States had initially envisaged for 2007-2013. MEP priority areas were: foreign policy (+1 billion), research and innovation (+700 million), Trans European Networks (+500 million), consumer protection (+500 million), structural funds (+300 million) and the environment (+100 million).

Vote: 30 November 2006, Implementation period: January 2007- December 2013
Galileo- the European satellite navigation system

EP Vote: 25 October 2007

Reform of the financing system
MEPs will be involved in assessing how to reform the Union's financing system. In this mandate, the European Parliament said that funding the EU by direct contributions from the Member States was "unfair to the general public and anti-democratic". The EP called for an examination of the possibility of using an existing tax to finance the European budget, thereby establishing a direct link between the tax payer and the spending of the European Union.

The EP active on the world stage
The EP involvement in foreign policy has been very focused on human rights abuses around the world, also illustrated by the annual award of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. Parliament has also sought to increase funding for the external actions of the EU. The Middle East, China, Russia and Guantánamo were also the subject of parliamentary debates and resolutions.
Death penalty: EP called for a universal moratorium
The European Parliament asked the Council to submit a resolution calling for a universal moratorium on the death penalty to the UN General Assembly. Eventually, the UN General Assembly adopted such a resolution on 18 December 2007.

Sakharov Prize: Honouring those fighting for the Freedom of Thought
Sakharov Prize winners during this legislature were Hu Jia, Salih, Mahmoud Osman, Aliaksandr Milinkevich, the Ladies in White, Hauwa Ibrahim, the Reporters without Borders and the Belarus Association of Journalists. In awarding the Sakharov Prize, the European Parliament honours outstanding achievements in the fight to protect freedom of thought and expression against intolerance, fanaticism and hatred.
Relations with Russia
MEPs called on the EU to review its policy towards Russia in the light of the Russian-Georgian conflict in 2008. Moreover, on several occasions they expressed their serious concerns as regards the respect for human rights in Russia.
Despite better EU-China relations, critics of human rights abuses
Despite its cautious optimism over the improvement of EU-China relations, the EP remained critical of China's human rights record as well as its repression of demonstrations in Tibet. Parliament awarded the 2008 Sakharov Prize to Chinese dissident and human rights activist Hu Jia.
Middle East conflict: MEPs in favour of the two-State solution
The EP repeatedly argued that the two-state solution, with an Israeli and a Palestinian state living side-by-side in peace and security, is a key condition for a peaceful and lasting settlement in the Middle East.
Guantánamo Bay: EP called on the US to close its detention facility
MEPs welcomed the decision by President Barack Obama to close the detention centre at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba. During this legislative period, the EP called repeatedly on the US Administration to close this facility. MEPs also called on the Member States to be prepared to accept Guantánamo inmates in the EU in case the US asks so.
Co-operation with the Mediterranean partners
Parliament supported the launching of the Union for the Mediterranean, to improve cooperation with the EU's southern neighbours. MEPs expressed concern for human rights and the situation of women in the region.
EP's support to Ukraine's path towards democracy
Shortly after the rigged presidential elections, in 2004, the EP supported the so-called Orange Revolution. In 2007 it supported the EU's association agreement with Ukraine, which could open the possibility of Ukraine eventually becoming a Member State of the European Union.
EP response to natural disasters around the world
In response to various natural disasters such as the cyclone in Burma, the earthquake in China and the tsunami in South East Asia, the EP provided financial support to reconstruction and expressed solidarity to the victims.
Money for external actions

Institutional decisions and enlargement
During this mandate, Parliament approved the new European Commission and the enlargement of the Union to Romania and Bulgaria. It also gave the green light to starting membership negotiations with Turkey and Croatia. In the first half of the legislature, institutional reform dominated the agenda. MEPs gave broad support to the proposed Constitution and, later, to the Treaty of Lisbon.
Parliament approves the European Commission
Parliament approved the appointment of José Manuel Barroso as the new President of the Commission. Because MEPs raised objections to some of the candidates for the other 26 commissioner posts, both before and after EP committee hearings, President Barroso had to propose alternative candidates and a reshuffle of portfolios to make sure the EP approved the whole Commission.
Vote on president of the Commission: 22 July 2004 (413 votes in favour and 251 against)
Vote on new Commission: 18 November 2004 (449 votes in favour to 149 against with 82 abstentions)
Bulgaria and Romania, new Members of the Union
In April 2005 a large majority in Parliament gave the green light to EU-accession for Bulgaria and Romania. MEPs stressed, however, that both countries still needed to consolidate the reform of their judicial systems and to continue the fight against corruption. On 1 January 2007, Parliament welcomed 18 Bulgarian and 35 Romanian MEPs, temporarily raising the number of MEPs to 785 until the European elections of 2009.
EP vote: 13 April 2005 - Accession of Bulgaria: 522 votes in favour, 70 against, 69 abstentions. Accession of Romania: 497 votes in favour, 93 against, 71 abstentions
Debates on enlargement and negotiations with candidates
MEPs debated candidate countries' preparedness to join the EU on several occasions. In 2005, they gave the green light to starting membership negotiations with Turkey and with Croatia. MEPs also supported the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia becoming a candidate for EU accession, though negotiations have not yet started. In a July 2008 resolution on the enlargement process, MEPs called for the preparedness of candidates and the capacity of absorption of the Union to be taken into account. EP resolutions also stressed that no further enlargement was possible under the Treaty of Nice
New eurozone countries
Parliament gave also the green light to enlarging the eurozone to include Slovenia, from 1 January 2007, Cyprus and Malta, from 1 January 2008, and Slovakia, from 1 January 2009. Now, 16 member states of the EU have adopted the euro as their currency.
EP vote on euro adoption by Slovenia: 15 June 2006 (490 votes in favour to 13 against with 63 abstentions)
EP vote on euro adoption by Cyprus: 20 June 2007 (585 votes in favour to 14 against with 90 abstentions)

EP vote on euro adoption by Slovakia: 17 June 2008 (579 votes in favour to 17 against with 86 abstentions)
Support for a Constitution for Europe
Parliament endorsed the proposed EU Constitution as a good compromise and improvement on the existing treaties. A majority of MEPs believed it would be beneficial for citizens because it would bring them more rights and improve the clarity, effectiveness and democratic accountability of the EU.
EP vote: 12 January 2005 (500 votes in favour to 137 against with 40 abstentions)
Lisbon Treaty backed up by Parliament
A majority in Parliament also approved the draft Treaty signed in Lisbon on 13 December 2007 and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The resolution adopted argued that the Treaty would raise the EU's democratic profile, improve the decision making efficiency and increase the European Parliament's powers. It also asserted that the Treaty would bring greater accountability and more rights and clarity for citizens. But it deplored the abandonment of the constitutional approach and the EU symbols, as well as the derogations brought in to the Charter of Fundamental rights. The Irish "no" to the Treaty after a referendum reopened the EU institutional debate.
EP vote 20 February 2008 (525 votes in favour to 115 against with 29 abstentions)
UK Presidency of the EU
From July-December 2005, the UK held the six-month rotating presidency of the EU. This meant Tony Blair, as Prime Minister, addressed the European Parliament to present the UK's plans at the start of the Presidency and to review the six months at Parliament's session in December. Throughout the six months of the Presidency, UK government ministers appeared before parliamentary committees and the full Parliament, from the Home Secretary on counter-terrorism, to the Secretary of State for Transport on aviation safety. 22.07.2004 - MEPs approve José Manuel Barroso as Commission President 18.11.2004 - Final statements before the vote on the Commission 13.04.2005 - Parliament gives green light to Romania and Bulgaria 13.04.2004 - Resolutions adopted on Bulgaria and Romania 28.09.2005 - Adopted resolution on Opening of negotiations with Turkey 29.09.2005 - European Parliament postpones vote on protocol to Ankara Agreement 10.07.2005 - Adopted resolution on the Commission's 2007 enlargement strategy paper 14.07.2008 - Public support, good neighbourhood policy and greater institutional efficiency needed for continued success in EU enlargement 15.06.2008 - Adoption by Slovenia of the single currency 20.06.2007 - Adoption by Cyprus of the single currency on 1 January 2008 20.06.2007 - Adoption by Malta of the single currency on 1 January 2008 17.06.2008 - Adoption by Slovakia of the single currency on 1 January 2009 1.01.2005 - European Parliament resolution on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe 12.01.2005 - A clear "yes" to the Constitution 20.02.2008 - Resolution on the Treaty of Lisbon 20.02.2008 - Ratify the Lisbon Treaty this year says the European Parliament
