MEPs debate the financial and economic crisis post G20 summit
Debating the financial and economic crisis post the G20 summit in Washington, many European Parliament political group leaders stressed the need for regulatory reform, in particular credit rating agencies, private equity and hedge funds as well as the importance of boosting lending to small business. Other groups criticised speculators and the European Commission for its role in inciting the crisis by concentrating too much on industry's concerns.
"Where words end, violence begins": British Chief Rabbi Sir Jonathan Sacks addresses MEPs
Dialogue lies at the roots of European civilisation but is not enough on its own. We also need closer social bonds in the form of "covenantal relationships", according to Sir Jonathan Sacks , Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the British Commonwealth, who addressed a formal sitting of the House on Wednesday (19 November).
Challenges ahead after 10 years of Economic and Monetary Union
The report, drawn up by Pervenche Berès (PES, FR, Chair of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee) and Werner Langen (EPP-ED, DE), adopted on Tuesday (18 November) by 545 votes in favour to 86 against with 37 abstentions, stressed that while the euro has helped economic stability, more needs to be done to get the most from the Economic and Monetary Union, including coordinated economic reforms as set out in the Lisbon Strategy - this would also help in recovering from the current financial crisis.
MEPs aim to keep duty free shopping at land borders and regional airports
Parliament says duty free shopping at regional airports and at EU-external land borders should still be possible. This position was part of a vote on Commission plans to update the rules on excise duties. Other amendments set out when can travellers have access to duty free shops, and whether there should there be guidelines for the amount of alcohol and tobacco citizens can take across borders.
Raising the ceiling on financial assistance for non-euro Member States
MEPs have backed Commission plans to raise the ceiling for financial assistance to non-euro area Member States facing balance of payments difficulties from €12 to 25bn. They rejected, however, the idea of giving the Commission the power to decide on further changes to the ceiling without new legislation. An EU law from 2002 established a facility providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States balances of payments, replacing previous rules from 1969. This facility is provided for in the Treaty (Article 119), whereby the EU can grant mutual assistance to a Member State "in difficulties or seriously threatened with difficulties as regards its balance of payments either as a result of an overall disequilibrium in its balance of payments or as a result of the type of currency at its disposal", provided this Member State does not belong to the euro area.
MEPs support the European "Blue Card" proposal for highly-skilled immigrants
MEPs backed the EU's "Blue Card" scheme to attract highly-skilled immigrants to take jobs in EU economic sectors suffering from skill shortages, modelled on the US "Green Card" system. However, they propose a clearer frame, more precise definitions, and to ensure more flexibility for Member States, whilst urging them to avoid a brain drain from third countries. They also say that Blue Card workers should not have priority on EU nationals on the labour market.
More fruit and veg for children at school say MEPs
The European Parliament adopted a report which urges an expansion in the EU programme for distributing fruit and vegetables in schools. The aim is to encourage healthier eating habits in children and combat the obesity epidemic. MEPs would like to see more funding for the programme and they also suggest giving priority to local seasonal produce. The report was adopted with 586 votes in favour, 47 against and 41 abstentions.
CAP health check: finding the right balance
Parliament adopted its position on the Common Agricultural Policy health check just before EU agriculture ministers decide on the final shape of this legislation. MEPs call for a smaller cut in farm aid and a limited increase in milk quotas as well as special aid for milk producers and livestock farmers. The House also argues that, for certain sensitive sectors, intervention schemes and the link between subsidies and production should be preserved.
Plight of bees threatens food production say MEPs
Immediate action is required to tackle the drastic decline in bee colonies throughout Europe and the rest of the world, say MEPs. The decline in the number of bees poses a threat not just to honey production but to the pollination of plants and hence to food production. Parliament adopted a resolution on Thursday pressing the Commission to take action. The resolution, adopted by 485 votes in favour to 13 votes against with 5 abstentions, calls on the Commission to use the CAP Health Check to put in place measures encouraging the creation of ecological recovery zones in parts of fields that are difficult to cultivate.
Tackling the pay gap between men and women
Parliament adopted a legislative initiative report recommending a revision of existing legislation on equal pay. In the European Union, women earn on average 15% less and up to 25 % less in the private sector. In spite of the legislation in force for more than thirty years, the pay gap between women and men has been persistent, still varying between 4 and 25 % among the Member States with no narrowing trend, states the report adopted by 590 votes four, 23 against and 46 abstentions.
Carbon capture and storage technology needs prompt and direct financial commitment say MEPs
The European Parliament adopted an own-initiative report supporting early demonstration of sustainable power generation from fossil fuels, but warns that the measures unveiled by the Commission are "not sufficient to provide the desired incentives". The House calls for a direct financial commitment to ensure that 12 demonstration projects testing the permanent underground storage of CO2 are constructed by 2015.
Protecting the consumer: improving consumer education and awareness on credit and finance
MEPs adopted an own-initiative report on protecting the consumer: improving consumer education and awareness on credit and finance. Overall, the report welcomes the Commission initiatives to educate consumers on finance and credit because "empowered and educated consumers help to foster competition, quality and innovation within the banking and financial services industries". The recently set up Expert Group on Financial Education and the proposed online database of financial education schemes and research in the EU are particularly welcome, it says.
European Parliament promotes early diagnosis and early care of HIV/AIDS
In the resolution entitled "HIV/AIDS: early diagnosis and early care", MEPs call on the Council and the Commission to formulate a strategy on HIV to promote early diagnosis. They ask for a reduction of barriers to anonymous testing and want the two authorities to communicate on the benefits of earlier care. The resolution was adopted with 480 votes in favour, 4 against and 10 abstentions.
DR Congo: MEPs say the UN must act as a matter of urgency
In adopting a resolution on the EU response to the deteriorating situation in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the House calls on the UN Security Council, as a matter of urgency, to take all measures capable of genuinely preventing any further attacks on the civilian population of the eastern provinces of the DRC.
Environmental inspections will damage the environment, say MEPs
The Commission's conclusion that full implementation of environmental legislation in the EU cannot be ensured will lead to "continuing damage to the environment" and to "distortions of competition", say MEPs. Information submitted by Member States showed that only a few have achieved full implementation and that there are still large gaps in the way environmental inspections are carried out.
MEPs voice serious criticism at EU PNR scheme
The European Parliament stands against a plan to collect air passenger records for law enforcement purposes that could pose a threat to privacy. MEPs say the measure is not justified legally, as well as in terms of effectiveness in the fight against terrorism. They ask for evidence that such a system would be useful at EU level, and could not vote on the text until their many concerns have been addressed.
The future of social security systems and pensions
Social security systems under pressure: The ageing population is expected to lead to increases in public spending, most of it for pensions, health care and long-term care, in most Member States by 2050 if current policies are pursued. It will also put serious pressure on the active work force, stated the report by Gabriele Stauner (EPP-ED, DE). MEPs recall that the core of European social models is the principle of solidarity between generations and that it is primarily financed by work-related earnings.
Regulation on investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)
The European Parliament adopted a report introducing 92 amendments to a Commission proposal, which proposes changes to regulation on investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF). To strengthen the efficiency of the European Anti-Fraud Office and to clarify the legal framework of its mission, the report asks the Commission to progress without any further delays on a consolidation of the legal texts on Community administrative investigations.
EU space policy contributes strongly to a European identity
MEPs adopted (443 in favour 65 against and 16 abstentions) a resolution on European space policy: how to bring space down to earth, which stresses the importance of developing a space-related industrial policy as a means of ensuring Europe's political, technological and operational autonomy. MEPs welcome the Council commitment to the development of a European space policy (ESP) as if the draft Lisbon Treaty was in force because it "contributes strongly to a European identity".
Sign, ratify and implement cluster bomb ban, say MEPs
In a resolution on the Convention of Cluster Munitions (CCM) adopted at the end of this week's plenary session, MEPs call on all EU members to "sign, ratify and implement the CCM at the earliest opportunity", and to take steps towards implementation "even before it is signed and ratified". The resolution was adopted with 471 votes in favour, 6 against and 21 abstentions.
Somalia, death penalty in Nigeria and the case of the al-Kurd family
The stoning to death of a 13-year old rape victim in Somalia, an appeal to the Nigerian authorities to scrap the death penalty and the eviction of the al-Kurd family from their house in East Jerusalem were the subjects of the human rights resolutions adopted by Parliament at the end of this week's Strasbourg session. 20081117BRI42139 Texts adopted 18-20 November 2008 Final draft agenda Brussels plenary 3-4 December will be available here

MEPs debate the financial and economic crisis post G20 summit
2008-11-21 - 12:39
Parliament debated the financial and economic crisis in the light of the Washington G20 summit. Many European Parliament political group leaders stressed the need for regulatory reform, in particular credit rating agencies, private equity and hedge funds as well as the importance of boosting lending to small business. Other groups criticised speculators and the European Commission for its role in inciting the crisis by concentrating too much on industry's concerns. Council
For the Council, France's European Affairs Minister Jean-Pierre JOUYET said that the effects of crisis on economy were now showing clearly, with many countries having entered recession. Public authorities were working to help reduce the impact of the financial tensions on households and businesses, he said.
Facing a slowdown that was "quite exceptional since 1929," the French Presidency had made it a priority to agree a recovery package: Member States had provided interbank loan guarantees and recapitalised banks. Effective joint action had also been seen at the G20 summit with Commission President Barroso and Council President Sarkozy working closely together.
Accountability and responsibility in global financial system
The conclusions of the summit focussed, as the EU had proposed, on accountability and responsibility as key factors for the world financial system, continued Mr Jouyet. The leaders had adopted principles like reform of credit rating agencies, the regulation of all those involved in financial industry and considering the link between remuneration policies and avoiding excessive risk.
"Most of main players in the major world economies have provided a strong lead which finance ministries will be putting into place over the next weeks. You can count on French presidency to promote unity in Europe and take forward our common ambitions. And you can also count on Czech presidency to continue this work," said the Council President-in-office.
The EU, he said, needed to continue to take a strong lead for tangible results. It must also shoulder responsibilities for European legislation: "I know I can count on Parliament to be fully involved." United action could inspire the Union and its Member States to react to affects on economy of financial crisis, he said.
Member States "cannot help growth if they do not work together"
"Member States cannot help growth if they do not work together," he continued. The G20 summit had sent a clear signal of the need to use all possible macro elements to stop the economy slowing down for an extended period of time. Mr Jouyet welcomed the ECB rate cuts and said the Council had supported their other initiatives at earlier stages. On fiscal matters, Member States had said that any freedom of movement within the Stability and Growth Pact should be used to try to reverse the downturn in the economy. The Council would be working closely with the Commission to do everything possible to ensure national initiatives are closely harmonised and work in conjunction with one another.
"We also need to ensure the single market functions well and that the flexibility in state aid rules can be used to the full so Member States can help support threatened sectors." Mr Jouyet specifically mentioned the car industry as being one that needed supportive action by the EU as part of a wider package of measures.
Europe "shoulders its responsibilities"
"The European Union has shouldered its responsibilities in face of unprecedented destabilisation of world economy. We have taken urgent measures in the face of immediate danger, but now we need to keep Europe together as a unit, acting as one alongside our partners for a more thoroughgoing review of regulatory system and return to the normal economic cycle. I am certain we can regain control of our destiny and act, as Europeans expect, as a global player."
European Commission
Commission President José Manuel BARROSO reminded Members that the political initiative for global reform of the financial system came from Europe. "It is my personal feeling that the first meeting of G20 heads of state and government marked a new era in collective steering of the global economic crisis and has made people realise that we need a global approach." He added, however, that it would be obscene to discuss solutions to the financial crisis while ignoring those who still do not have access to food or drinking water.
"In Washington, everyone understood that all economies are interdependent so we in Europe have to accept that and come up with responses," he said. Our response now needs to be 'timely, targeted and temporary' and should include for example measures to help adapt some sectors of our economies to fight against climate change so that this fight is not seen as running counter to economic growth.
Referring to the 2009 legislative programme, Mr Barroso stressed that the focus of action needed to be on preventing damage from lack of growth and employment while, at the same time, looking at reforms to prepare for the post-crisis period. A recovery programme would, therefore, be tabled by the European Commission on 26 November. He urged the European Parliament to adopt quickly the recently tabled proposals on bank guarantees and credit rating agencies.
In conclusion, he said that it was time for Europe to make its mark and he remained optimistic that the G20 in Washington had shown a level of open-mindedness which did not exist a few months ago.
Political group speakers
On behalf of the EPP-ED group, Joseph DAUL (FR) said the financial and economic crisis did not represent "a defeat of capitalism" but was a result of poor regulation, a lack of market transparency and the lack of proper financial supervisory bodies. He stressed that the centre-right parties were not in favour of "an unfettered financial system" but of a social market economy. He called for more attention to be focused on the plight of small businesses, "who take risks to create jobs". They need a market "that is clear, fair and transparent", he said.
The financial crisis had highlighted "the value of Europe", but he wondered why "we in Europe did not pre-empt the crisis better". In the wake of the crisis, world governance had taken a step forward but he still felt the need to warn against protectionism. Lastly Mr Daul emphasised that "as a united Europe, with the institutions working together, we are strong".
Socialist group leader Martin SCHULZ (DE), referring to the G20 meeting, said the fact that it had met did represent progress, but he felt the time had come for swift action, notably on "credit rating agencies, financial supervision, private equity and hedge funds, and executives' salaries".
"We are at a crossroads", said Mr Schulz and he called for stricter monitoring and "a legal ban on certain forms of speculation". There must be no return to "business as usual". He was also critical of any idea of taking money from the real economy to pay for the financial crisis, saying that instead we should be "investing in the real economy". He looked to the Commission to come forward with proposals as early as December.
Even Adam Smith believed that unbridled free markets have their limits, said Graham WATSON (UK), speaking for the ALDE group. Nevertheless, the Liberal leader stressed the need to support open markets, saying that after 1929 countries had mistakenly tried for "individual salvation" whereas "now we recognise that salvation has to come collectively".
Mr Watson's main point, however, was that this was not a time to abandon the drive for sustainable economic growth: the fight against climate change must be maintained. Although coming from a different angle from Martin Schulz, Mr Watson too believed that "never again can we have business as before".
Brian CROWLEY (UEN, IE) believed that the bottom line in the crisis was that the EU, US, India and China must work together to ensure common rules and standards to govern the global financial markets for the future. There should, he said, be no excuses for those who indulged in the reckless lending and dubious practices which caused the crisis. The biggest danger today, he said, is that banks are not lending to small and medium-sized enterprises to allow them to grow and to take opportunities. For the future, we must invest in research and development to find new ways to solve our problems. We must give hope and encouragement to people. We must not put a block on the creativity and innovation of the people of Europe.
Monica FRASSONI (Greens/EFA, IT) argued that Mr Barroso and his Commission were among those responsible for the current crisis and that they had sided with the Member States and industry rather than the European Parliament and consumers in arguments over lack of transparency and deregulation. She emphasised the Green New Deal which means a genuine long-term economic strategy focussing on issues such as energy efficiency. It meant not giving a blank cheque to industries such as the car industry unless they reform and modernise.
Roberto MUSACCHIO (GUE/NGL, IT) reminded the Parliament that President Sarkozy had spoken about the need for a structural overhaul of capitalism rather than the need to imagine a new future: a transition to a social economy based on fairness and co-operation. But the scant result of the G20 did not include such an overhaul. No one, he said, is asking what is at the heart of the current crisis so we cannot tackle the real problems which are: the devaluing of work in recent years through the policies of liberalisation which have led to suffering and injustice and secondly the serious ecological and energy situation. Mr Musacchio questioned how can those who have created the problems be the ones to solve them? We need strong words from the Left, he concluded.
Hanne DAHL (IND/DEM, DK) asserted that the problems had arisen because enterprise had become "a bubble in the whirlpool of speculation". The European Commission's proposal for tackling the financial crisis was "beating about the bush," she said, adding that the 'four freedoms' do not make things any easier. She asked the European Commission whether the proposal on credit rating agencies would mean that new agencies are to be set up because, she said, the existing ones have been "inadequate and unreliable". She was concerned about future employment insecurity and the price wage earners might have to pay as a result of the financial crisis. "Wages should not be seen just as a cost factor," she said. "But also as a key influence on levels of demand, which can stimulate the economy."
Jana BOBOŠÍKOVÁ (NI, CZ) was pleased that the Washington summit had respected the freedom of the market and had rejected the protectionism proposed by President Sarkozy. She said it was not capitalism that had brought about the crisis, but the greed of banks. And this was why a simple injection of money to the banks would amount to stealing from our citizens. "We must make sure the banks use the funds to provide loans to businesses and we need proper supervision over how the money is used."
Council response to group leaders
In his response to the group leaders' comments, Mr JOUYET said the G20 summit had been a historic and innovative event, including in terms of initiatives taken in Europe, and Europe's impact on the international stage. "We are at a crossroads, and we cannot go back to 'normal.' We will need to use our imagination to find answers to the crisis. It is important to be ready to act quickly. We also need to be ready to act against the negative impact of crisis on small businesses and in terms of social dimension. We need to take account of Keynesian aspects that may be able to be employed with climate change measures. The distinction between public and private sectors is important, and we should not just focus on financial issues, but also look at helping the most vulnerable members of society," he said.
British and Irish speakers
The Commission legislative work programme, Diana WALLIS (ALDE, UK) said, should in a sense be our response to the world financial crisis. We, she said, should be able to give a strong and collective response in order to give confidence to those whom we represent - Europe’s citizens. "The financial and other challenges that face us need us to act together in solidarity, not just with an eye to national protectionism if we are to emerge unscathed as a continent." Her group, she said, intends to respond to the work programme with a positive and progressive resolution, emphasising above all an open Europe, a green Europe, an entrepreneurial Europe and a safe Europe.
Kathy SINNOTT (IND/DEM, IE) said that while the crisis has hit different countries around Europe in different ways, one thing is certain: the financial institutions in all countries to some degree or another have bought toxic US mortgage debts based on subprime lending. It seemed to Mrs Sinnott that there must have been wholesale misrepresentation of the quality of the debt by these agencies for such a huge amount of it to have been sold so easily.
Mrs Sinnott questioned if the facts about the claims made when selling these devices have been examined yet by the Commission and, if so, to what extent is it thought to have been misrepresented? If this is the case, she would also like to know if the Commission thinks that there is any recourse in law against the rating agencies for those who have suffered from their negligence or worse, since, at this stage, the whole financial structure has been attacked by them.
Giles CHICHESTER (EPP-ED, UK) said that Europe is presented with a big challenge because while most measures of fiscal policy need to be taken at national level, the EU has a crucial role of coordination. The magnitude of the challenges facing us makes that particularly important, he said.
In the field of energy, he said that allowing lower VAT for improvements in the energy efficiency of buildings and launching an information campaign to encourage a change in people's behaviour are two specific ways to help the situation. He suggested that "there will never be a better time to set up one of the EU's famous groups of wise people – and in this case I suggest it should be wise men and women – to reflect on the challenge we face and come up with original solutions beyond the short-term remedy of throwing money at tax giveaways. I hope that Council and Commission will give this idea a fair wind."
Andrew DUFF (ALDE, UK) said that the crisis is going to have a dramatic effect on the future of the euro. Denmark and Sweden should, he said, become members before they expected and, in Britain too, it is time for the debate to begin.
In 1997, he said, Mr Brown established five famous so-called tests before we could adjudge sterling's accession to the single currency. Suddenly, in this crisis, all these five are met. The pound has fallen to a competitive exchange-rate level, labour markets are flexible, the City, once so proud, now risks being pushed aside by stronger supervision and regulation inside the euro zone, and the economic cycles of Britain and the euro zone are now completely in sync as we plunge into recession at the same time. Concluding, he appealed Mr Brown to now change the terms of the debate inside the United Kingdom. "If he fails to achieve that, the pound will be like a permanent ping-pong ball, bouncing in an uncontrolled manner between the big footballs of the euro and the dollar."
Malcolm HARBOUR (EPP-ED, UK) said that small businesses are going to be the engines of job recreation. The Commission, he said, should be looking at the real priorities for bringing in some of the things that we have worked on that will actually help the real economy. "That is where your priorities lie. I do not get any sense that this is a real response to the crisis at all." We need, he said, real action on the things that are going to make real differences to jobs out there now and in the future.
He noted that next week the Council will have the opportunity to sign off a common position on the Telecoms package. That will pave the way for that investment, he said. It is crucial for the future of the European economy that this package is approved by the Council next Friday, he concluded.
Robert STURDY (EPP-ED, UK) said that at a time when the world is seeing the most important financial crisis that has ever hit us, we are looking at a failure so far on the Doha Round. The financial crisis has to be underlined, he stressed, as has the need to deepen Europe’s relationships with its key partners, including the new US Administration, but "probably more importantly when the Director General, Pascal Lamy, is up for so called re-election – we will see whether or not he gets the post, but there is a good chance that he will."
The EU, he said, must not be Dickensian in its approach to trade. "We must open our barriers. We must not put in place trade defence instruments. Reform is only going to be successful on the grounds of a free market principle. That includes, as I say, open trade and investment. " Noting that Pascal Lamy met with the G20 to work with a proposal that will see a possibility of a settlement coming up in the short term, he hoped to see something even before Christmas. The EU, he said, has led for the first time in the trade negotiations and must be congratulated.
Philip BUSHILL-MATTHEWS (EPP-ED, UK) was delighted that Commission President Barroso made many remarks about SMEs in his opening comments. However, he expressed concern that we have not seen enough action. Referring to the heading ‘better regulation – delivery on promises’, if there is one word that you remember for this legislative programme, that word must be ‘delivery’, he said.
Mr Bushill-Matthews recognised that changing culture takes time and also, speaking as the coordinator for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for the EPP-ED Group, that committee is not always the greatest ally in the cause of better and simplified regulation. He extended an invitation to the Commission President to come and address his committee - "maybe that would help make our committee help your work, and we could then become part of the solution."
John PURVIS (EPP-ED, UK) expressed concern at the grave danger of rushing to excessive misguided regulation and to unintended consequences. An example in the new capital requirements directive, he said, is the proposed 5% retention of securitisation proceeds. "This will only clog up credit creation. Lack of securitisation possibilities is the principal reason that credit has dried up now. We need the banks to lend but no, this misguided principle, which lacks an impact assessment, will prevent a restart of securitisation and the credit which our business and industry so badly needs. Ask the motor car industry how it will prosper if securitisation is snuffed out. That is only one example. If we suspend true and fair accounting, if we go out of our way to kill hedge funds and private equity and incentives to innovators, risk takers and even bankers, as Mr Schulz and the Socialists require, we will only delay and kill altogether that recovery."
Proinsias DE ROSSA (PES, IE) said that this crisis was allowed to develop because governments everywhere abandoned their responsibility to sufficiently govern the economy, including banks. "Most of those in power have ignored history and accepted the ideological mumbo jumbo which we have just heard now from the last three speakers that the market is a self-balancing natural phenomenon and government has no role in interfering with it. The fact is that Adam Smith's invisible hand is a pickpocket. The pockets that are being picked are the pockets of working people, who are losing their jobs, families who are losing their homes and, indeed, those who are poor already, who are losing their savings and pensions. It is not bankers and right-wing politicians who are losing. It will happen again unless we clearly define a new economic framework which enables us to ensure that banks and industries serve society and enable governments to govern in the public interest."
Mairead McGUINNESS (EPP-ED, IE) was inclined to the view that excessive regulation is as bad as none whatsoever. So we need to be very balanced in this, she warned. "But whatever we do, there are people now in business, on farms and in households who cannot get small amounts of credit to keep themselves going. I was on a farm in Ireland recently. They could not renew their EUR 25000 overdraft. This is a really serious problem and we really need to address it."
On the work programme, it will be a very busy year, she said, what with the budget review, the implementation of the health check and review of fisheries.

"Where words end, violence begins": British Chief Rabbi Sir Jonathan Sacks addresses MEPs
2008-11-21 - 12:39
Dialogue lies at the roots of European civilisation but is not enough on its own. We also need closer social bonds in the form of "covenantal relationships", according to Sir Jonathan Sacks, Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the British Commonwealth, who addressed a formal sitting of the House on Wednesday (19 November). Introducing Dr Sacks , European Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering stated that with the Chief Rabbi's address the EP had now welcomed representatives of the Judaic, Christian and Islamic religions, each of which, along with humanism and the Enlightenment, had made their contribution to today's European society. Mr Pöttering saluted the positive contribution of religion to society, notably in "the development of our ethical awareness and our values", and then, referring to Sir Jonathan's book "The Dignity of Difference", said "you have grasped the key issue of our time: can we all live together in peace and if so, how?". Sir Jonathan Sacks: dialogue at the root of European civilisation After opening his speech with a short blessing, and recalling that "European civilisation was born 2000 years ago in dialogue" when the worlds of ancient Greece and Biblical Israel were "brought together by Christianity", the Chief Rabbi spoke of three of the "great moments" in the intervening period, which he said were "the result of dialogue". The culture of al-Andalus in Spain in the 10th to 13th centuries had produced a cross-fertilisation of Islam, Judaism and Christian thinkers. At the start of the Italian Renaissance, Pico della Mirandola, author of the Oration on the Dignity of Man - seen by some as the manifesto of the Renaissance - had had a Jewish teacher, Rabbi Elijah ben Moses Delmedigo. Most poignant of all to us, according to Dr Sacks, was the Jewish/Christian dialogue after the Holocaust, notably the teachings of the Jewish philosopher Martin Buber and the Second Vatican Council's publication of Nostra Aetate (a declaration on the relation of the Church with non-Christian religions). Thankfully, he concluded, "today Jews and Christians meet in mutual respect as friends". The Chief Rabbi also cited several passages from the Hebrew Bible to illustrate his views on identity and dialogue, including the story of Cain and Abel, where "dialogue failed", proving that "where words end, violence begins". Underlining the value of dialogue, he said "if we were completely different there could be no communication but if we were totally the same we would have nothing to say". Today's society needs more "covenants" rather than contracts And yet, Sir Jonathan continued, "dialogue may not be enough" since "dialogue can't always keep us together if other forces drive us apart". Here he moved on to the other key message of his speech. In his view, we also need "covenants", evoking Biblical covenants such as the one by which the 12 tribes of Israel agreed to form one nation. A covenant, he pointed out, is not a contract. In a contract, each side is seeking its own advantage, whereas "in a covenant, two parties come together to achieve what they can't achieve alone". In other words, "a contract is a deal, a covenant is a marriage". More precisely, "a contract deals with 'arenas of competition' while a covenant deals with 'arenas of cooperation' ". "This vital distinction not always clear enough in European politics", he argued. "You can have a society without a state but can you have a state without a society?" A key element of this view is that we need to "focus not just on rights but also on responsibilities" since "rights without responsibilities are the subprime mortgages of the modern world". By contrast, "covenants lead us to think about reciprocity". Dr Sacks contended that "Europe needs a new covenant and the time to begin is now", in the midst of the economic crisis. He also told the House that last Thursday, he and other British religious leaders had visited Auschwitz, where they had felt keenly "what happens when people lose mutual respect". Concluding, the Chief Rabbi said: "God has given us many languages but only one world to live in" and he expressed the hope that we may, in our diversity, "write a new European covenant of hope".

Economic and monetary union
Challenges ahead after 10 years of Economic and Monetary Union
2008-11-21 - 12:39
MEPs have set out their views on how the Economic and Monetary Union could be developed in the years to come. They adopted a report focusing on the ECB, the Lisbon Strategy, the Stability and Growth Pact, external representation for the eurozone and financial services supervision, among other issues, all seen in the light of the current economic downturn.
The report, drawn up by Pervenche Berès (PES, FR, Chair of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee) and Werner Langen (EPP-ED, DE), adopted on Tuesday by 545 votes in favour to 86 against with 37 abstentions, stresses that euro has helped economic stability, but that more needs to be done to get most from the Economic and Monetary Union, including coordinated economic reforms as set out in the Lisbon Strategy - this would also help in recovering from the current financial crisis.
Parliament stresses the need to stick closely to the Stability and Growth Pact, and argue for more budgetary consolidation - but also efficient public spending. MEPs say budgetary policy should draw fully on the degree of flexibility permitted by the revised Pact.
Price stability and inflation targeting
MEPs say wage moderation should not be seen as the exclusive way to achieve price stability – in fact, real wages should rise in line with productivity levels.
They strongly back the independence of the European Central Bank. When it comes to its definition of price stability, MEPs suggest the ECB should move towards a direct inflation targeting regime, where a point inflation target is supplemented by a range of permitted fluctuations around the target rate – this would be similar to the targets set for the Bank of England in Britain. This should not, say MEPs, preclude focussing on the dynamics of monetary aggregates in order to avoid new asset bubbles.
Parliament repeats is calls for the ECB executive board to be made up of peoples with a variety of economic, financial and monetary backgrounds. It says that, in future, the board should have nine members, and be exclusively responsible for setting interest rates.
Parliament is calling for the EU to play a leading role in international efforts to reform regulatory system for financial markets.
Euro area enlargement
MEPs stress the need for equal treatment for euro Member States and those seeking to join. They also insist that joining the euro requires full adherence to all the Maastricht criteria. They argue that the Commission should Commission should undertake intensive information campaign in new MS to prepare citizens for euro.
Governance and international representation of the euro area
Parliament says it regrets the lack of progress in improving euro area international representation and that ultimately, the area should have single seat in international financial institutions. In the meantime, the MEPs encourage the idea that common EU positions could be represented by Eurogroup chair, Commission and ECB President in international bodies.
The report identifies a wide range of areas where the economic governance of the euro area could be improved. Among the proposals is the idea that the Eurogroup should have formations consisting of competitiveness, environment, employment and education ministers as well as the current Eurogroup of finance ministers. MEPs also want to see a world monetary conference for global consultations – and perhaps also a monetary dispute settlement mechanism under the IMF.

MEPs aim to keep duty free shopping at land borders and regional airports
2008-11-21 - 12:39
Parliament says duty free shopping at regional airports and at EU-external land borders should still be possible. This position was part of a vote on Commission plans to update the rules on excise duties. Other amendments set out when can travellers have access to duty free shops, and whether there should there be guidelines for the amount of alcohol and tobacco citizens can take across borders. MEPs adopted their report by a small majority - 328 in favour to 319 against with 34 abstentions - after some fairly close votes on the issue of distance selling. Duty free shopping in regional airports - and on land borders. The Commission’s original proposal suggested that air and sea travellers should have access to duty free purchases only when their immediate destination was outside the EU. Parliament says those with a final destination outside the EU can also take advantage of such shopping (so if you are flying from Manchester to Shanghai via Paris, you will still be able to buy, for example, duty free whisky in Manchester, and not have to wait to make your purchase in Paris). The Commission’s proposal has the effect of abolishing duty free shops on external land borders, but MEPs voted to keep them. Guidelines on personal tobacco and alcohol imports Individuals are allowed to buy alcohol and tobacco duty paid in one Member State and transport it to another without paying further duty if it is for your own personal use. The current EU legislation sets out indicative guidelines for what quantities could be considered for personal use. Some Member States’ tax authorities have on occasion apparently acted to enforce the guidelines as absolute limits – for example, the Commission took action against the United Kingdom on this point. The case did not come to court as the UK amended its practice in the meantime. To avoid such possible misinterpretation, the Commission is proposing to delete all reference to guideline amounts. Parliament however, feels that this may create more confusion, and says the indicative guidelines should remain. Regarding fuel duty, MEPs added a provision that when fuel bought duty-paid in another Member State is transported in “atypical” containers (e.g. not in the tank of a car or a normal spare fuel container), the receiving Member State can choose to impose its own duties. Distance selling rules MEPs backed the Commission's proposal that where excisable goods are purchased in a country other than that of the buyer and then sent on (e.g. using internet shopping) excise duty will be paid in the country of destination - and the vendor will have to make the necessary arrangements to ensure this takes place. The rapporteur, Mrs Lulling, had proposed the opposite arrangement, with duty paid in the country of sale. As a result of this vote, she called for MEPs to vote against the report as a whole, but in the end, it was approved with small majority . Clarifications on rules concerning goods in transit Parliament also adopted a series of amendments to clarify how the rules apply to goods lost, stolen or destroyed in commercial transit and on issues surrounding the transport of goods with duty suspended: for example between tax warehouses, before the goods are put out for retail sale. As usual with tax policy, Parliament’s position is only consultative and the final decision is taken by unanimity in the Council.

Raising the ceiling on financial assistance for non-euro Member States
2008-11-21 - 12:39
MEPs have backed Commission plans to raise the ceiling for financial assistance to non-euro area Member States facing balance of payments difficulties from €12 to 25bn. They rejected, however, the idea of giving the Commission the power to decide on further changes to the ceiling without new legislation. An EU law from 2002 established a facility providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States balances of payments, replacing previous rules from 1969. This facility is provided for in the Treaty (Article 119), whereby the EU can grant mutual assistance to a Member State "in difficulties or seriously threatened with difficulties as regards its balance of payments either as a result of an overall disequilibrium in its balance of payments or as a result of the type of currency at its disposal", provided this Member State does not belong to the euro area. Support of €6.5 billion – more than half the total currently available under this scheme – has recently been proposed for Hungary. The 2002 regulation lowered the ceiling on such funding to €12 billion, from €16 billion, as at the time there were only three Member States outside the euro area. Recent events suggest this may not be enough, should several Member States need significant support. The Commission is therefore proposing to raise this ceiling to €25 billion - and Parliament today gave its backing to this change. MEPs willing to act quickly, but not to give Commission power to act alone The Commission also proposed that it be granted the power to decide a further revision of the ceiling in urgent cases. Parliament did not support this, but included a statement indicating its willingness to act quickly on such decisions that might be necessary in the future. It also said that the Commission should as a matter of course review the ceiling for support every two years. Parliamentary procedure In a resolution also adopted today, MEPs say non-euro EU countries who need such support should first look to the EU before approaching international bodies. They argue that the current situation demonstrates the protective effect of the euro, and encourage all non-euro Member States to adopt the euro as soon as they meet the criteria. MEPs also want the Commission to examine how the behaviour of individual banks moving assets from Hungary after other Member States announced banking rescue plans has affected Hungary's balance of payments and to study the impact of speculative attacks on national currencies of new Member States and what might be done to prevent a drastic erosion of confidence in their banking systems in such circumstances. The resolution was adopted with 491 votes in favour, 13 against and 24 abstentions. Medium-term financial assistance for Member States' balances of payment (amend. Regulation (EC) No 332/2002) Text, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 20 November)

Immigration
MEPs support the European "Blue Card" proposal for highly-skilled immigrants
2008-11-21 - 12:39
MEPs backed the EU's "Blue Card" scheme to attract highly-skilled immigrants to take jobs in EU economic sectors suffering from skill shortages, modelled on the US "Green Card" system. However, they propose a clearer frame, more precise definitions, and to ensure more flexibility for Member States, whilst urging them to avoid a brain drain from third countries. They also say that Blue Card workers should not have priority on EU nationals on the labour market. Who should be eligible for a Blue Card? In a consultation report drafted by Ewa Klamt (EPP-ED, DE) adopted in plenary with 388 votes in favour, 56 against and 124 abstentions, MEPs sought to clarify blue card eligibility requirements: an applicant must have found a job in the EU, and have at least five years' experience in the sector concerned or a university qualification recognised by the Member State. The applicant's contract must guarantee an income of at least 1.7 times the average gross salary in the Member State of residence, add MEPs, who stipulate that this salary must not be lower than that of a comparable worker in the host country. It must also be possible to grant the card to third country nationals already legally staying in the Union under other regimes, but it should not be granted to asylum applicants or third country nationals admitted to the Union as seasonal workers, as the latter are covered by a specific proposal for a directive, say MEPs. Access to social protection The Blue Card will also entitle its holder to family reunification within six months - his or her spouse would also be able to seek a job in the Union - and to social welfare coverage in the Member State concerned. A holder who loses his or her job should have six months to find another, rather than three as proposed by the Commission, say MEPs. What about Community preference ? MEPs consider that Member States should be able to decide how many Blue Cards they wish to grant each year. The card should not be viewed as a "right" for migrants, and may be refused even where they meet the criteria. National authorities must also be able to reject holders of Blue Cards granted by other Member States in favour of a national or Community solution. MEPs also agree that preference may be given to EU citizens as well as to unemployed third country nationals who reside legally, for reasons of labour market policy. Members also ask member states not to allow Blue Cards in sectors where access to new member states' workers is still restricted. The "brain drain" concern MEPs also say that Member States should not actively encourage the "brain draining" of third countries through the Blue Card in sectors where these countries suffer from labour shortages, particularly in the areas of health and education. New Member States Parliament also says that Member States shall reject an application for an EU Blue Card in labour market sectors to which access by workers from other Member States is restricted on the basis of transitional arrangements set out in the Acts of Accession of 16 April 2003 and 25 April 2005. Background The Blue Card, proposed by the European Commission, is designed to attract highly-qualified workers from third countries by giving them access to the 27 Member States. This card would not replace existing national systems, but would provide an additional channel of attraction, with a common grant procedure. By issuing a Blue Card, the member state commits itself to issuing all the necessary documents and visas needed by the immigrant. Most highly-skilled migrants prefer destinations such as the USA, Australia or Canada to the EU, due to the fragmentation of EU labour markets. The "blue card" would enable holders who have spent three years in a first EU country of residence to access other Member States thereafter. The card would therefore normally be valid for three years, renewable for a further two years. If a worker's contract is for a shorter duration, then the card should be granted for the duration of the contract plus six months, say MEPs. British and Irish government decided not to opt-in to the Blue Card scheme In January 2008, the UK decided not to participate in the adoption and application of the Legal Migration Directives including the Blue Card. One of the main reasons for this decision being that it is at odds with the UK's Points Based System and with managing migration on the basis of a national assessment of labour market needs. The Irish government has also decided not to opt-in to the Blue Card. Single application procedure could have been more ambitious The directive on a single application procedure and common set of rights for third-country nationals wishing to legally reside and work in the EU could have been "more ambitious", says the EP, but it does complement the Blue Card directive, the EU plan to model the US "Green Card" system. While the House generally welcomes the proposal, it regrets that "it was not more ambitious" and that "it does not cover the entry conditions for all third-country nationals wishing to pursue an economic activity in the EU". However, Member States’ reluctance with regard to such a proposal is understandable, it says. Member States rights not affected MEPs consider it important to make clear that "the content of this directive does not affect the Member States’ right to determine the entry conditions nor the number of migrants they wish to admit to their territory". In addition, "the period of validity of the single permit is to be determined by each Member State," says the report adopted with 442 votes in favour 77 against and 42 abstentions. "The procedure in no way interferes with the Member States’ competence as far as the processing of requests is concerned, only as regards the time limit which needs to be complied with". The directive complements the EU's Blue Card plan The single application procedure is meant to complement the EU's Blue Card plan, which seeks to attract skilled workers. Adopting the two simultaneously would therefore avoid a "twin-speed immigration policy", which favours highly-skilled workers and refuses access to those who are less skilled, the report emphasises. The single procedure The proposal for a Directive seeks to put in place a single application procedure leading to the issuing of a single residence and work permit. The report claims there are several advantages to this, including simplified administration and less bureaucratic procedures. The common set of rights Currently in the EU there are major differences among the Member States regarding the treatment of migrant workers. Equal treatment of third-country nationals in Member States, particularly in areas connected with employment "must be guaranteed", says the House, and granting these rights "is a minimum requirement". Finally, Member States, say MEPs, should ratify the United Nations International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families Migration policy: highly qualified employment Text, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 20 November)

More fruit and veg for children at school say MEPs
2008-11-21 - 12:39
The European Parliament adopted a report which urges an expansion in the EU programme for distributing fruit and vegetables in schools. The aim is to encourage healthier eating habits in children and combat the obesity epidemic. MEPs would like to see more funding for the programme and they also suggest giving priority to local seasonal produce. The report was adopted with 586 votes in favour, 47 against and 41 abstentions. In the European Union around 22 million children are overweight and more than 5 million are obese, mainly owing to excessive consumption of fatty, sweet or salty food. The World Health Organisation recommends consumption of at least 400g of fruit and vegetables per day for children under the age of 11. Parliament has already - on 25 September - adopted an own-initiative report on the fight against obesity, in which it called for fruit and vegetables to be stocked in vending machines in schools and for school curricula to include information on balanced diets. How much funding is needed? When the fruit and vegetable sector of the CAP was reformed last year, the European Parliament and the Member States called for a programme to be set up for distributing fruit and vegetables in schools to encourage children to eat more healthily. The European Commission has proposed a budget of €90 million for this programme for the school year 2009-2010. This budget is not enough, argue MEPs: it is equivalent to giving every child aged 6 to 10 one piece of fruit a week for 30 weeks. The report calls for the Community contribution to be increased to €500 million for the year in question. Preference for produce grown in Europe The report also calls for the practical arrangements for the programme to be clarified. MEPs say it should cover only fruit and vegetables produced within the EU. The fruit and vegetables should meet the highest quality standards and should preferably be seasonal varieties, grown locally. Priority should be given to sustainable production. The report also suggests that the programme not only be restricted to school children in the 6-10 age group but should also be available to pre-school children. In addition, MEPs want the fruit to be accompanied by health and dietary advice in an appropriate style for children.

CAP health check: finding the right balance
2008-11-21 - 12:39
Parliament adopted its position on the Common Agricultural Policy health check just before EU agriculture ministers decide on the final shape of this legislation. MEPs call for a smaller cut in farm aid and a limited increase in milk quotas as well as special aid for milk producers and livestock farmers. The House also argues that, for certain sensitive sectors, intervention schemes and the link between subsidies and production should be preserved. The four reports, drafted by Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos (PES, PT), strike a balance between the various proposals put forward by MEPs during debates on the health check and also reflect the variety of situations facing farmers in the European Union. Speaking in the plenary debate in Strasbourg on 18 November, Neil Parish (EPP-ED, UK), Chairman of the EP Agriculture Committee said: "Agriculture and the rural environment are one and the same and we have to move to make sure that we deal with climate change and the management of water, that we look at biofuels and biogas and that we really put Europe in a good position. We must not go backwards, because we are in a good position when it comes to the WTO. Let us go forward and actually reform the agricultural policy." In agriculture policy, the Parliament's opinions currently have only consultative status. If the Lisbon Treaty enters into force, MEPs - who are directly elected by the voters - will have joint decision-making power with the Council of agriculture ministers. However, because of the importance of the CAP health check, which will make the last major changes to this policy area before the negotiations on the EU's next multiannual budget framework (which starts in 2013), the French presidency of the Council has promised to cooperate closely with MEPs, thereby enabling the two institutions to find common ground on most key issues. MEPs call for smaller shift towards rural development An important feature of the last CAP reform was a decision to shift part of EU agriculture spending away from direct farm income support towards national rural development programmes, so as to support activities such as rural tourism (a policy known as "modulation"). This decision was linked to the need to comply with WTO rules on farm subsidies. As part of the health check, the Commission has proposed speeding up the process of switching funds towards rural development. This subject was hotly debated in the EP, which in the end adopted a compromise calling for the transfer of funding to proceed more gradually so as not to hit farmers too hard. MEPs want the current 5% transfer rate applicable to farmers receiving more than €10,000 in EU subsidy to rise to only 7% by 2013, rather than the 13% proposed by the Commission. MEPs agreed to a higher rate for farms that receive over €100,000 from the EU, but not nearly as high as the rate proposed by the Commission (1 percentage point extra between €100,000 and €199,999 rather than 3 points, 2 points between €200,000 and €299,999 rather than 6, and 3 points beyond €300,000 rather than 9). In addition, MEPs contend that the extra funding released by the increase in modulation should be used to finance more "challenges" than the four identified by the Commission (climate change, renewable energy, water management and biodiversity) and that this Community money should not have to be co-financed by national budgets as is currently the case for rural development programmes. MEPs are also calling for the link between certain types of aid and production volumes to be kept for livestock farmers, given the current climate of high feed prices, and for small producers (of fodder, protein and flax etc.). One amendment adopted by the House calls for an increase in compulsory modulation to be balanced by a decrease in voluntary modulation so that farmers are not discriminated against because of national government policy. Supplementary modulation on the biggest farms is opposed by some Member States, including the United Kingdom. Dairy sector: review in 2010 The Commission's proposal to increase Member States' milk quotas by 1% per year until 2013, in order to pave the way for the complete abolition of ceilings in 2015, also exposed differing views within the House. Dairy farmers in several Member States where sale prices are already low face difficulties, while in other Member States farmers want to increase production to take advantage of new opportunities on world markets. The House finally opted for an increase in quotas by 1% in 2009 and 2010 but asked the Commission to review the situation in 2010 before making proposals for later years. MEPs also want to allow Member States to increase their quotas temporarily if the quotas of other Member States are under-used. They call for the creation of a milk fund to help restructure the sector. Support for hard-hit sectors, insurance and market intervention Other compromises adopted by MEPs would allow Member States to use up to 15% of the Community funding they receive to support hard-hit sectors such as livestock and dairy farming and to contribute to insurance and mutual schemes (Article 68 support), to broaden insurance coverage, notably for all types of climate damage and for major losses caused by animal or plant disease, and to increase Community co-financing of these insurance schemes and mutual funds. MEPs also adopted a number of amendments calling for the retention of market intervention or management instruments in the grain, meat and dairy sectors. Tobacco: continued support to 2012 The European Parliament also says that f or the harvest years 2010, 2011 and 2012, aid may be granted to farmers producing raw tobacco. Tobacco producers include Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Portugal, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Poland.

Plight of bees threatens food production say MEPs
2008-11-21 - 12:39
Immediate action is required to tackle the drastic decline in bee colonies throughout Europe and the rest of the world, say MEPs. The decline in the number of bees poses a threat not just to honey production but to the pollination of plants and hence to food production. Parliament adopted a resolution on Thursday pressing the Commission to take action. The resolution, adopted by 485 votes in favour to 13 votes against with 5 abstentions, calls on the Commission to use the CAP Health Check to put in place measures encouraging the creation of ecological recovery zones in parts of fields that are difficult to cultivate. Extensive research needed MEPs c all on the Commission to immediately step up further research into the parasites and diseases , as well as other potential causes such as erosion of genetic diversity and cultivation of genetically modified crops , decimating the bee population, while making additional budgetary resources available for this research. Research is also needed to establish whether there is a link between the use of pesticides, such as thiamethoxam, imidacloprid, clothianidin and fipronil, on bee mortality, say MEPs. Finance package for beekeepers in difficulty Parliament urges the Commission to propose a financial aid mechanism should also be provided for beekeepers in difficulty, and ask that Member States bring forward "immediate support" for the beekeeping sector. Action on imported apiculture products In response to apiculture products imported into the EU, MEPs consider that action should be taken to tackle unfair competition from products originating in third countries and that imported honey should be analysed to detect the possible presence of American foulbrood bacteria, a disease that affects honey bees. Future legislation on bees The House calls on the Commission and the Council to give due consideration to the health of bees, the possibilities for marketing bee products and the economic impact on the beekeeping sector in all discussions and future legislative steps concerning the cultivation of genetically modified crops in the European Union. Worrying facts A report in National Geographic published a few years ago stated that bee numbers had dropped by up to 50%. Three quarters of food production (76%) is dependent on bees and 84% of vegetables grown in Europe depend on pollination. The threat to bees comes partly from the use of modified and treated seed, which has led to a reduction in pollen and nectar, and partly from the reduction in agricultural set-aside land.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Tackling the pay gap between men and women
2008-11-21 - 12:39
The European Parliament adopted a legislative initiative report recommending a revision of existing legislation on equal pay. In the European Union, women earn on average 15% less and up to 25 % less in the private sector. In spite of the legislation in force for more than thirty years, the pay gap between women and men has been persistent, still varying between 4 and 25 % among the Member States with no narrowing trend, states the report adopted by 590 votes four, 23 against and 46 abstentions. EP sends strong signal to Commission
The report was adopted under a special procedure (Rule 39 of the Rules of Procedure) where the European Parliament calls on the Commission to bring forward a legislative proposal and where the report must obtain an absolute majority to be adopted). MEPs requested the Commission to submit to Parliament by 31 December 2009, a legislative proposal on the revision of the existing legislation, following different recommendations.
More transparency
The report suggests the introduction of obligatory regular pay audits for enterprises and the publication of their results. Recommendations also include a clear definition of concepts such as gender pay gap and direct and indirect discrimination as well as establishing job evaluations complying with the principle of equality between men and women available for all stakeholders.
Applying existing legislation and sanctions
The whole problem of pay gap could not be solved by legislation alone and the Commission and Member States should reinforce the existing legislation with appropriate types of sanctions, underlines the report.
MEPs propose to conduct a study on the possibility and effectiveness of launching possible sanctions such as penalties including the compensation of victims, administrative fines, disqualification from benefits and subsidies for employers and the publication of offenders.
Equality bodies should also play a special role by influencing more effectively and more independently the application of gender equality legislation. Rule 39 : Initiative pursuant to Article 192 of the EC Treaty
1. Parliament may request the Commission, pursuant to Article 192, second paragraph, of the EC Treaty, to submit to it any appropriate proposal for the adoption of a new act or the amendment of an existing act, by adopting a resolution on the basis of an own-initiative report from the committee responsible. The resolution shall be adopted by a majority of the component Members of Parliament. Parliament may, at the same time, fix a deadline for the submission of such a proposal.

Carbon capture and storage technology needs prompt and direct financial commitment say MEPs
2008-11-21 - 12:39
The European Parliament adopted an own-initiative report supporting early demonstration of sustainable power generation from fossil fuels, but warns that the measures unveiled by the Commission are "not sufficient to provide the desired incentives". The House calls for a direct financial commitment to ensure that 12 demonstration projects testing the permanent underground storage of CO2 are constructed by 2015. "The time delay between the potential support from emissions trading from 2013, and the necessary planning and construction phase of demonstration facilities, can be overcome by making financial resources available." Support for financing via EU Emission Trading System from 2013 Funding for the new carbon capture and storage technology (CCS) could be supplemented by providing allowances to operators of CCS technology from the EU's Emission Trading System, the report says. "Incentives for CCS technology production should be increased, by allocating, within the EU ETS, allowances for anticipated CCS technology production with an increase of at least 25 % from 2013." Similarly, it supports the proposal to award up to 500 million trading allowances to large-scale commercial demonstration projects in the EU. Additional funding from the Seventh Research Framework Programme MEPs propose to use the EUR 500 million of the Risk Sharing Finance Facility (RSFF) which was held back until the mid-term review of the Seventh Research Framework Programme. According to the rapporteur, this amount could be supplemented with other funds in cooperation with the European Investment Bank. Selection criteria for projects When it comes to selecting storage sites, "binding and strict criteria should be set for long-term safety", says European Parliament. It cites the example of "storage under the seabed, which can, in the event of an accident, endanger marine ecosystems". This could have implications for the UK, which would have the option of storing large quantities of CO² under the North Sea. The report also strongly recommends that the 12 demonstration projects have a minimum output of 180 Mega Watts, and that the facilities be sited over a maximum geographical spread across the EU. The report was adopted with 474 votes in favour, 66 against and 20 abstentions.

Protecting the consumer: improving consumer education and awareness on credit and finance
2008-11-21 - 12:39
MEPs adopted an own-initiative report on protecting the consumer: improving consumer education and awareness on credit and finance. Overall, the report welcomes the Commission initiatives to educate consumers on finance and credit because "empowered and educated consumers help to foster competition, quality and innovation within the banking and financial services industries". The recently set up Expert Group on Financial Education and the proposed online database of financial education schemes and research in the EU are particularly welcome, it says. Finance education in schools The House calls on the Commission to develop educational programmes relating to personal finance, which can be adapted to the specific needs of each Member State, and encourages Member States to include financial education in primary and secondary schools. Training programmes should also be set up in Member States for social workers who deal with persons at risk of poverty or excessive debt, the report says. Quality information over quantity The rapporteur states that "effective, clear and comprehensible information, particularly in advertisements for financial products, is necessary". "Financial institutions should provide sufficient information before contracts are concluded and should strictly apply the rules laid down in Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on markets in financial instruments (Mifid) and Directive 2008/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2008 on credit agreements for consumers." However, the report acknowledges that "overloading" the consumer with information would be counterproductive, stressing the need for "quality over quantity".

European Parliament promotes early diagnosis and early care of HIV/AIDS
2008-11-21 - 12:39
In the resolution entitled "HIV/AIDS: early diagnosis and early care", MEPs call on the Council and the Commission to formulate a strategy on HIV to promote early diagnosis. They ask for a reduction of barriers to anonymous testing and want the two authorities to communicate on the benefits of earlier care. The resolution was adopted with 480 votes in favour, 4 against and 10 abstentions. The European Parliament asks for monitoring and surveillance by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. The deputies insist on more precise estimates of the undiagnosed population. Indeed, EuroHIV and UNAIDS report that the estimated number of people infected with HIV in some countries is almost three times higher than the official number. MEPs call on the Member States to enact discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS, including restrictions that impact on their freedom of movement. They also ask them to step up information and education campaigns on the prevention, testing and treatment of HIV/AIDS as 11% of all new HIV infections affect young people under the age of 25 in the European Union, according to the EuroHIV end-year report 2006.

DR Congo: MEPs say the UN must act as a matter of urgency
2008-11-21 - 12:39
In adopting a resolution on the EU response to the deteriorating situation in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the House calls on the UN Security Council, as a matter of urgency, to take all measures capable of genuinely preventing any further attacks on the civilian population of the eastern provinces of the DRC. MEPs are extremely concerned at the increase in clashes in North Kivu and the consequences for the population of the east of the DRC and the region as a whole, particularly humanitarian consequences as a result of the recent offensive by the CNDP, displacing and killing large numbers of people in North Kivu.
The European Parliament expresses its deep outrage at the massacres, crimes against humanity and acts of sexual violence against women and girls in the eastern provinces of the DRC and calls on all relevant national and international authorities systematically to bring the perpetrators to justice.
The House urges Laurent Nkunda to respect his own declaration supporting the peace process for the east of the DRC after talks with the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the former President of the Republic of Olusegun Obasanjo. The House calls in this regard on the CNDP to rejoin the Amani peace process without delay. Parliament reaffirms its support for the Congolese authorities in the search for a political solution to the crisis and welcomes the plan put forward by the Congolese parliamentarians, which calls for a general mobilisation in favour of military, political and diplomatic dialogue.
European special forces
The Parliament reaffirms its support for MONUC, in the present dramatic circumstances in which, despite its shortcomings, its presence remains indispensable, and calls for every effort to be made to allow it to carry out its mandate in full and use the force of arms to protect those under threat; in this respect, it calls on the Council, and in particular, Belgium, France, Italy and the United Kingdom, to play a leading role in ensuring that the United Nations Security Council supports MONUC by strengthening its operational capacities in terms of appropriate equipment and manpower , and especially by contributing European special forces .
Role of International Community
MEPs call on the African Union, the UN Security Council and key international players, including the EU, US and China, to increase pressure on all parties to push forward with the peace process, finding a solution to the problem of control of the mineral resources and aiming for a broad peace agreement rather than only a ceasefire, and further calls on these actors to put pressure on Rwanda and Uganda to give a commitment to end the free movement and operations of Nkunda's troops on their territory.
Minerals
MEPs call on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that European companies do not trade in, handle or import products derived from minerals that have been sourced in a manner that benefits armed groups in the DRC, and hold accountable any that persist in such practices.
The House calls for zero tolerance of the sexual violence against girls and women which is used as a weapon of war and for severe criminal penalties to be imposed on the perpetrators of these crimes. MEPs draw attention to the importance of access to health services in conflict situations and refugee camps, especially in the light of the recent outbreaks of cholera, whooping cough and measles.
MEPs call on the Council to work with international and regional mediators to address the economic agendas of the warring parties explicitly in the context of current mediation efforts and call on the Council and Commission to closely follow the humanitarian and security situation in the east of the DRC, with a view to determining in more detail the different lines of action that may be envisaged in the light of circumstances.

Environment
Environmental inspections will damage the environment, say MEPs
2008-11-21 - 12:39
The Commission's conclusion that full implementation of environmental legislation in the EU cannot be ensured will lead to "continuing damage to the environment" and to "distortions of competition", say MEPs. Information submitted by Member States showed that only a few have achieved full implementation and that there are still large gaps in the way environmental inspections are carried out. The resolution, adopted Thursday by 390 votes in favour to 8 against with 11 abstentions, opposes the Commission's intention of dealing with disparate environmental inspections through a non-binding recommendation and through the insertion of specific legally binding requirements in sectoral legislation. Parliament emphasises that good and even enforcement of environmental law is essential, and that anything less "falls short of public expectations and undermines the reputation of the EU as an effective guardian of the environment". Actions to be taken by the Commission According to the Commission the situation of incomplete implementation is partially due to differing interpretations by Member States of the definitions and criteria of the recommendation and of the reporting requirements. The Commission also recognises that the scope of the recommendation is inadequate and does not include many important activities, such as Natura 2000, the control of illegal waste shipments, the registration and authorisation of chemicals (REACH), the restriction of certain hazardous substances in products (e.g. the RoHS Directive), trade in endangered species as well as activities related to genetically modified organisms and producer responsibility systems. In light of this, MEPs urge the Commission to draw up a proposal for a directive, defining and extending the scope of environmental inspections. They also call on the Commission to establish a Community inspection force and to report on possible ways of strengthening the European Union Network for the Implementation and Enforcement of Environmental Law (IMPEL) - all before the end of 2009. Support for environmental education Parliament proposes that greater emphasis be placed on supporting environmental education and information provision, the specific content of which would be determined at local, regional or national level.

Justice and home affairs
MEPs voice serious criticism at EU PNR scheme
2008-11-21 - 12:39
The European Parliament stands against a plan to collect air passenger records for law enforcement purposes that could pose a threat to privacy. MEPs say the measure is not justified legally, as well as in terms of effectiveness in the fight against terrorism. They ask for evidence that such a system would be useful at EU level, and could not vote on the text until their many concerns have been addressed. By adopting a resolution drafted by Sophie In't Veld (ADLE, NL) by 512 votes in favour, 5 against and 19 abstentions, the European Parliament criticised the European commission proposal for a framework resolution on the use of PNR (Passenger Name Record) data for law enforcement purposes.
The text, tabled in November 2007, proposes that air carriers would make PNR data for flights coming to or leaving the EU (in and outbound EU flights) available to specialized national units carrying out risk assessments and law enforcement and counter terrorism missions.
UK system
The preliminary conclusions from the UK system for the use of PNR data provides no evidence of the usefulness of the mass collection and use of PNR data for counter terrorism purposes (it does provide evidence of its usefulness for other purposes, as well as the value of using PNR on a case-by-case basis in the context of ongoing investigations, on the basis of a warrant and with due cause) say MEPs.
MEPs say that the proposal, having a considerable impact on the personal life sphere of European citizens, is not justified clearly enough, in its compatibility with fundamental rights as well as concerning its legal basis.- They remind that the European Court of Justice already challenged the EU-US PNR agreement on this ground. They therefore decide to reserve their formal opinion on the framework-decision once their concerns have been addressed.
MEPs question the conditions which could make this new EU intervention necessary and underline that "same or better results could be obtained by improving the mutual legal assistance between law enforcements authorities" instead of introducing an EU-wide PNR scheme.
They say the new legislation should include a sunset clause and estimate that the need for action at the community level has not been sufficiently demonstrated, nor the proportionality of the measure : MEPs are concerned that the proposal would give authorities warrantless access to all data while their added value for law enforcements purposes has not been proved as there is no evidence that PNR data are useful for massive profiling or data mining in order to seek potential terrorists.
On the ground of data protection, MEPs say the adoption of an adequate framework is a precondition for any EU PNR scheme. They recall that sensitive data should be used only on a case by case basis, in the context of a regular investigation.
MEPs also say the proposal should create a burden for air carriers, and that they should not be required to collect additional data or be made responsible to verify the records. Text, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 20 November)

Social policy
The future of social security systems
2008-11-21 - 12:39
The increasing ageing population will affect social security systems. In this own-initiative report, MEPs express their preoccupation with maintaining the core of European social models. Encouraging higher employment rates are among the recommendations of the report. Key points Social security systems under pressure: The ageing population is expected to lead to increases in public spending, most of it for pensions, health care and long-term care, in most Member States by 2050 if current policies are pursued. It will also put serious pressure on the active work force, stated the report by Gabriele Stauner (EPP-ED, DE). MEPs recall that the core of European social models is the principle of solidarity between generations and that it is primarily financed by work-related earnings. The trend towards individualisation could also enable people, especially women and other vulnerable groups, to have more freedom of choices and be able to build up their own, additional pension rights, stresses the report. New ways of taxation and/or other alternatives could be also be considered to improve the financial sustainability of social pending. - Higher employment rates: A decreasing work force will lead to a decrease in the total number of hours worked. In order to reverse this trend, measures could be taken to reduce the unemployment rate and increase recruitment by combining training and retraining. Higher employment rates are heavily dependent on the necessity to keep all groups active. That is why MEPs stress the need to fight discrimination on the labour market. They also call on the Member States to create financial and social incentives in order to encourage employees voluntarily to continue to work even after reaching the statutory age limit. Pensions Public pension systems strengthen social solidarity and are the responsibility of Member States and safeguarding these systems should be a political priority, MEPs say. They believe that a greater use of alternatives to state-funded pensions, such as supplementary schemes, could also be a viable alternative and that pension systems need to adapt to "patchwork biographies" becoming increasingly common. Healthcare It is important to preserve the values and principles underpinning all health care systems of the European Union, which comprise universal coverage, solidarity in financing, equity of access and the provision of high quality health care, MEPs insist. By improving the organisation and provision of services in accordance with the principles of subsidiarity, a potential exists for both better quality and financial efficiency of health services, they underline.

Budgetary control
Regulation on investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)
2008-11-21 - 12:39
The European Parliament adopted a report introducing 92 amendments to a Commission proposal, which proposes changes to regulation on investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF). To strengthen the efficiency of the European Anti-Fraud Office and to clarify the legal framework of its mission, the report asks the Commission to progress without any further delays on a consolidation of the legal texts on Community administrative investigations. OLAF staff should work in full independence The report also proposes that a human resources management be established, which is more adapted to the operational needs of OLAF, so as to ensure that staff can execute the mission of OLAF in full independence. Similarly, in order to reinforce complete independence, the Director General should be appointed for a term of five years, renewable once. "The Director General shall neither seek nor take instructions from any government or any institution, body, office or agency in the performance of his duties with regard to the opening and carrying out of external and internal investigations or to the drafting of reports following such investigations," the report says. Member States and EU institutions should report regularly to OLAF To improve the operational, legal and administrative framework for combating fraud, the European Parliament says that the competent authorities of Member States and the European institutions, bodies, offices and agencies should be required to report regularly to OLAF on progress made as regards action taken in response to the final investigation report issued by OLAF. Freedom of the press to be guaranteed To make it possible to provide objective information to European taxpayers and in order to guarantee freedom of the press, the report asks that "all EU bodies involved in the investigation respect the principle of protecting journalists' sources in accordance with national legislation". This amendment is made with reference to the "Tillack Affair", in which judicial abuses were committed against a German journalist who had revealed corruption in the operations of an EU agency. Respect for people's rights The report mentions the fundamental rights of the persons concerned by investigations, stating that they "should be respected at all times, particularly when providing information. There is a need to clarify the basic principles of OLAF's information policy. Fight against fraud: investigations by the European Anti-Fraud Offfice OLAF, defence rights, independent review of proceedings and of their duration, confidentiality(amend. regul. 1073/1999/EC) Text, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 20 November)

EU space policy contributes strongly to a European identity
2008-11-21 - 12:39
MEPs adopted (443 in favour 65 against and 16 abstentions) a resolution on European space policy: how to bring space down to earth, which stresses the importance of developing a space-related industrial policy as a means of ensuring Europe's political, technological and operational autonomy. MEPs welcome the Council commitment to the development of a European space policy (ESP) as if the draft Lisbon Treaty was in force because it "contributes strongly to a European identity". MEPs agree that current priorities are the timely implementation of the Galileo and EGNOS and GMES or Copernicus programmes.
Regulatory framework a crucial element of the ESP
A crucial element of the ESP policy is "the regulatory framework and the standardisation programme which contributes to the emergence of new European downstream markets", says the resolution. It also recalls that the Galileo Regulation sets a benchmark for the involvement of SMEs.
Parliament asks that the Commission and the Council set a precise calendar for the creation of an efficient governance structure regarding the GMES/Copernicus programme and to clearly establish a roadmap for this programme with the aim of improving its efficiency and specifying its budget allocation.
Financing ESP
In order to reflect the strong commitment of the EU towards the ESP, Parliament urges that consideration be given to a possible new specific budget line for the ESP in the EU budget and to increase the clarity and transparency of this policy, should the provisions of the Lisbon Treaty relating to space policy enter into force.
MEPs also call on the Commission and EU members to promote investments in space-related science and technology.
Synergies between civilian and security developments in the field of space should be encouraged since the European security capabilities depend on, among other things, the availability of satellite-based systems. Access to these is crucial for the European Union, say MEPs.

With regard to space tourism, Parliament calls on the Commission to produce a study on both the impact of this activity and on a relevant safety, security and regulatory framework. Similarly, necessary measures must be taken to avoid pollution of outer space.
Space exploration inspires young Europeans
MEPs consider that Europe should develop a common vision and long-term strategic planning for human and robotic space exploration, including the possibility of a human expedition to Mars.
The resolution concludes by stressing the value of space exploration for inspiring young Europeans to choose a career in science and technology and for strengthening research capabilities in Europe. Text, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 20 November)

Security and defence
Sign, ratify and implement cluster bomb ban, say MEPs
2008-11-21 - 12:39
In a resolution on the Convention of Cluster Munitions (CCM) adopted at the end of this week's plenary session, MEPs call on all EU members to "sign, ratify and implement the CCM at the earliest opportunity", and to take steps towards implementation "even before it is signed and ratified". The resolution was adopted with 471 votes in favour, 6 against and 21 abstentions. Parliament requests that Member States not use, invest in, stockpile, produce, transfer or export cluster munitions until the CCM has entered into force. Users of cluster munitions to provide support Member States which have used cluster munitions are called on to provide assistance to affected populations and to provide technical and financial assistance for the clearance and destruction of cluster munitions remnants. Cluster bombs scatter over a wide area when dropped from the air or used in artillery shells. Many do not explode and it is often children who pick them up - with devastating consequences. The charity Handicap International estimates that 98% of the victims of cluster bombs are civilians of whom 27% are children. MEPs urge the Commission to increase financial assistance through all available instruments to communities and individuals affected by unexploded cluster munitions. Member States not to jeopardise the CCM Member States are also requested to refrain from taking action "which might circumvent or jeopardise the CCM and its provisions". In particular, Parliament calls on all EU members "not to adopt, endorse or subsequently ratify a possible Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW) Protocol allowing for the use of cluster munitions which would not be compatible with the prohibition of such munitions pursuant to Articles 1 and 2 of the CCM".

Human rights
Human rights: stoning in Somalia, death penalty in Nigeria, eviction of al-Kurd family
2008-11-21 - 12:39
The stoning to death of a 13-year old rape victim in Somalia, an appeal to the Nigerian authorities to scrap the death penalty and the eviction of the al-Kurd family from their house in East Jerusalem were the subjects of the human rights resolutions adopted by Parliament at the end of this week's Strasbourg session. Public stoning of a 13-year old rape victim in Somalia
Parliament is pressing the Somali Government to condemn the execution of Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow, a 13-year old rape victim who was publicly stoned to death, and to "take action to prevent such brutal executions in the future".
Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow, a 13-year-old girl, was stoned to death in Somalia on 27 October, 2008 for committing adultery in breach of Islamic law, although she was in fact a victim of rape by three men. The stoning was carried out by a group of 50 men in a stadium in the southern port of Kismayo in front of around 1,000 spectators.
Parliament "strongly condemns the stoning and execution of Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow and expresses its horror at such a barbaric act perpetrated against a 13-year-old rape victim".
Call for justice
The al-Shabab militia, who control Kismayo, detained and ordered the execution by stoning of Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow, and did not arrest or detain those accused of her rape.
The resolution, which was adopted unanimously, supports the legitimate Somali Government's attempts to assert its control over the port of Kismayo, and calls "for those accused of raping Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow to be brought to justice by due process". It also calls on the Somali Government to condemn the execution and prevent such acts in future, as well as "to issue documents and make statements to restore the honour of Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow posthumously".
Gross violations of human rights committed daily
Owing partly to widespread violence by some factions of the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia (the 'Islamic Courts'), which are trying to topple the legitimate government of Somalia, there are gross violations of human rights in Somalia on a daily basis.
These violations of human rights also include the kidnapping of two Italian Catholic nuns from Kenya currently being held in Somalia, and the increase in suicide attacks, which have killed at least 30 people in the north of the country in recent weeks. Parliament calls on both the Somali and Kenyan authorities to "make all possible efforts and take all possible political and diplomatic initiatives to secure the release of the two Italian Catholic nuns".
EU should back present Somali government and help establish lasting democracy
Turning to longer term solutions, MEPs urge the EU to "provide all necessary support in order to create a lasting democratic government in Somalia and to further aid the Government of Somalia to assert its control over the whole country and establish the rule of law in a manner compatible with its international human rights obligations, which would prevent such executions in the future."

Call to abolish death penalty in Nigeria
Noting that more than 720 men and 11 women are under sentence of death in Nigeria's prisons, the European Parliament calls on the Federal Government of Nigeria and the state governments to abolish the death penalty and, pending abolition, "declare an immediate moratorium on all executions as provided for by UN General Assembly resolution 62/149".
Although Nigeria has not officially reported any executions since 2002, Islamic Sharia courts, which have jurisdiction over criminal cases in 12 of Nigeria's 36 states, continue to hand down death sentences as well as sentences of flogging and amputation.
Right to a fair trial
The Nigerian criminal justice system is riddled with corruption and negligence and over half the country's 40,000 prison inmates have not been tried or sentenced. Moreover, according to Nigerian sources, inmates on death row are almost exclusively poor and without legal representation.
In the light of these problems, Parliament's resolution - adopted unanimously - calls on the Federal Government of Nigeria and the state governments to "ensure that in capital cases the most rigorous internationally recognised and constitutional standards for fair trial are respected, especially in the areas of inadequate legal representation of poorer prisoners, of confessions or evidence obtained through violence, coercion or torture, of inordinately long trial and appeal periods, and of conviction of minors".
Death penalty for child offenders
International law prohibits the use of the death penalty against child offenders. The resolution states that at least 40 death row prisoners were aged between 13 and 17 at the time of their alleged offence. It urges the Nigerian governing bodies to "remove all provisions in both federal and state legislation which provide for the death penalty for people who were under the age of 18 at the time of the alleged crime".
EU urged to help Nigerian authorities
Looking to the long term, the EP calls on the Council, the Commission and the Member States to provide technical support to the Nigerian authorities with a view to reviewing the legislation which provides for the death penalty, abolishing the death penalty, and improving the investigation procedures of the Nigerian police.

Eviction of the al-Kurd family in East Jerusalem
In a resolution on the case of the al-Kurd family, who have been evicted from their home in East Jerusalem by the Israeli authorities, Parliament voices deep concern at this and other operations and points to the possible consequences for the peace process.
The al-Kurd family were forcibly removed from their home in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood of East Jerusalem by members of the Israeli police and armed forces on the night of Sunday 9 November 2008. Immediately after the eviction, settlers were allowed to enter the house, in which the family had lived for more than 50 years.
According to the resolution, which was adopted by an overwhelming majority, the eviction of the al-Kurd family and the recent destruction of the houses of Palestinian families by the Israeli authorities in several areas of East Jerusalem may have serious consequences.
However, as the result of an amendment tabled by the EPP-ED group and adopted by a majority of Members present, a paragraph calling "for the al-Kurd family's property to be returned to it immediately" was deleted from the text of the resolution.
Chances of peace agreement between Palestine and Israeli can only be damaged
The resolution emphasises that "these operations, which seriously affect the lives of the residents of these areas, contravene international law" and it calls on the Israeli authorities to put an end to such acts as soon as possible. MEPs point to the fact that "under international law East Jerusalem is not subject to the jurisdiction of Israeli courts".
The EP presses Israel to "refrain from all unilateral measures that may pre-empt the result of the final status negotiations, particularly in Jerusalem", stressing that "such actions can only damage the chances of reaching a peace agreement between Palestinians and Israelis." It also reiterates its call to the Israeli authorities "immediately to halt any expansion of settlements and the building of the security fence beyond Israel’s 1967 borders".
International community asked to support Palestinian residents
Finally, Parliament calls on the Council, the Commission and the international community, including the Quartet, to "make all possible efforts to protect Palestinian residents in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood and other areas of East Jerusalem" and urges the Quartet to play a more active role in this direction.
