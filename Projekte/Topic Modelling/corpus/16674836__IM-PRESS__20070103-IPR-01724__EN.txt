35 Romanians and 18 Bulgarians became Members of the European Parliament on 1 January 2007 as their countries acceded to the European Union. They have been nominated by their respective national parliaments and will serve until elections to the European Parliament are held in the two countries later in 2007.
Since 26 September 2005, the same number of observers from each country had been sitting at the European Parliament. In many cases, the same people have been re-nominated as full Members. The full list of the new MEPs for each country is available via the links below.
The normal total number of Members of the European Parliament is now 785. After the next European elections in 2009, this will fall to 736, of which 33 will be from Romania and 17 from Bulgaria.
