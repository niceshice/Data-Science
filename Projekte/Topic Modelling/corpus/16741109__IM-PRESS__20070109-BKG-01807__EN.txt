Parliament at odds with Council on the Community's railways

On 17 January 2007, the European Parliament took its second reading plenary vote on the so-called "third rail package" of three reports, on opening up rail networks to competition, minimum rights for passengers and a European licence for train drivers respectively. Competition will now be introduced for international rail services but not for domestic ones. On the other issues, the EP and the Council still differ widely, and the proposals may well undergo conciliation before July 2007.
The European Parliament is involved via the co-decision procedure in elaborating proposals for:
- the development of the Community's railways (A6-0475/2006, rapporteur Georg Jarzembowski, EPP-ED, DE);
- passenger rights and obligations (A6-0479/2006, rapporteur Dirk Sterckx, ALDE, BE), and
- the certification of train crews (A6-0480/2006, rapporteur Gilles Savary, PES, FR).
In the December 2006 Transport Committee debate on these proposals, many MEPs had expressed dismay that the Council of Transport Ministers had not met Parliament's first reading demands on liberalisation deadlines, basic passenger rights or even certificates for railway staff other than engine drivers.

Developing the Community's railways
The EP Transport Committee's December 2006 call for domestic railways to be opened up to competition by 1 January 2017 (plus up to five years for Member States that joined the EU on or after 1 May 2004) did not win sufficient backing in the January 2007 plenary vote, so liberalisation is unlikely in the foreseeable future .
For competition on international railways , Parliament voted to accept the 2010 deadline proposed in the Council's common position.
The report on the development of the Community's railways (A6-0475/2006, rapporteur Georg Jarzembowski, EPP-ED, DE), had been adopted in committee in December 2006, by 30 votes in favour, 10 against and 5 abstentions.
Legislation is already in force to open up the market for freight services from 1 January 2007.

Rail passenger's rights and obligations at national level, too
In a report by Dirk Sterckx (ALDE, BE) on minimum rights for rail passengers, the House voted to extend proposals on international passengers' rights and obligations to domestic rail traffic , arguing that " ordinary rail passengers should not be left out in the cold ". This demand conflicts with the Council's position. Mr Sterckx said that there was no point in drawing up a regulation which applied only to the 5% rail passengers who use international train services.
The House believes that European citizens should, in the event of problems, be entitled to certain minimum rights, including information for passengers, liability in the event of death or injury and assistance to persons with reduced mobility. It also favours a system of compensation for delays: 25% of the fare for a delay of 60 minutes or more and 50% for a delay of 120 minutes or more, but only if the operator can be held responsible for the delay.
Furthermore, said Parliament, rail operators must ensure that stations, platforms and means of transport are accessible, by eliminating all obstacles to boarding, disembarkation and remaining on board. And in future all trains should provide a specially designated area of the train for baby carriages, bicycles and sports equipment.
MEPs point out that European legislation on air travel does not draw any distinction between national and international flights when it comes to protecting passenger rights and establishing liability for accidents and delays. Furthermore, the scope of the regulation as proposed by the Council is so complex as to be unworkable, and would please no-one but lawyers, Members say.
The report on passenger rights and obligations (A6-0479/2006, rapporteur Dirk Sterckx, ALDE, BE) had been adopted in committee in December 2006 by 44 votes in favour and one against. Passengers' rights and obligations report: EP procedure file
Towards a European licence for train drivers
At the January plenary, Parliament also adopted a report on certification of train drivers, drafted by Gilles Savary (PES, FR). Whereas the Council wishes only train drivers to be covered by the directive, Parliament says that other crew members performing safety-related tasks should be in possession of a certificate attesting that they meet minimum requirements relating to medical fitness, basic education and general professional skills.

Next steps
Parliament expects the Council to deal with these proposals as a package, and also to put forward a common position on the issue of public service requirements - i.e. the revision of Regulation 1191/69 - rapporteur Erik Meijer (GUE/NGL, NL). The Council accepted these terms, but since there is still disagreement on the substance of the proposals, the conciliation procedure is likely to be the next - and final - stage of the process.
