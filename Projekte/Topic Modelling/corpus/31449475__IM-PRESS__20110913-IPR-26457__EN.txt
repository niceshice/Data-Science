The draft text called for a full assessment of the costs, effectiveness and impact on civil liberties of counter-terrorism policies.
“It would seem that positions have shifted and controversy has risen around this report”, said rapporteur Sophie in’t Veld (ALDE, NL), asking for more time to build a stronger European Parliament position on this issue.
The decision to postpone the vote was taken by 400 votes to 268, with 6 abstentions. The draft resolution will now be re-examined by the Civil Liberties Committee.
The draft text called on the European Commission to “fully assess” the cost, effectiveness, and impact on civil liberties of post 9/11 counter-terrorism measures taken in the EU.
