Lidköping - Sweden - Mr Kjell Hedvall Deputy Mayor of Vila Nova de Gaia- Portugal -Mr Marco António Costa Lassee- Austria -Mr Karl Grammanitsch Trezzano sul Naviglio - Italy -Ms Liana Scundi: Deputy Mayor of Bielsko-Biala - Poland - Mr Zbigniew Michniowski Ptolemaida - Greece - Mr Grigorios Tsioumaris Mataró - Spain - Mr Joan Antoni Baron: Over 350 cities across Europe have made a green pledge to make a 20% cut in CO2 emissions by 2020. The "Covenant of Mayors" pledge was made Tuesday 10 February at the European Parliament. Each city will now draw up a sustainable energy action plan over the next 12 months. At the ceremony we asked a number of Mayors their views.
So far cities from 23 EU members have signed up including Paris, Brussels, Rome, Stuttgart, Barcelona and Nottingham. Non EU signatories have also joined including Zurich in Switzerland, Tuzla-Istanbul in Turkey, Banja Luka in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Lviv in the Ukraine.
The network of green cities is an initiative of the European Commission and will strive to promote low carbon environments for their citizens whilst encouraging viable alternatives to polluting practices. Participating countries will have to declare 12 month energy plans and then give the Commission and their citizens updates every 2 years on their progress.
Over 350 Mayors have pledged their cities to the covenant. These Mayors were invited to the Parliament 10 February for the official signing of the covenant in the hope that they can act as inspiration for further European cities to join.
We asked a number of Mayors: What steps have you taken to make your city green?
