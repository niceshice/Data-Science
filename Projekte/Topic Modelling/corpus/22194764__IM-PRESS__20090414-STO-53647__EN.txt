The Malta-Gozo ferry. A new European code of conduct could mean compensation for delayed ferry, bus and coach passengers ©Belga/A Marchi If you are fed up with delays and cancellations when travelling by bus or ferry then good news could be around the corner. Next Wednesday sees MEPs discuss a new series of rights for passengers who travel by sea and bus. Compensation and arranging alternative ways of travelling are just two steps envisaged. The proposed rules also protect the right of disabled passengers to board ships and buses.
Using Europe's ferries
The report drafted by French Socialist Michel Teychenné covers transport by sea and offers compensation for any delays and cancellations. Specifically passengers will be entitled to;
- 25% of the ticket price back for a delay of 120 to 179 minutes
- 50% of the ticket price for a delay of 180 minutes or more
- 100% of the ticket price if no other transport means are available
The rules would not apply however if Mother Nature intervenes in the form of strong tides, gale force winds and ice flows. Speaking to us Mr Teychenné singled out "compensation, an obligation to inform and assist passengers in the event of delay and a clear indication that a passenger cannot be refused transport if handicapped" as particularly relevant.
He also said he had been passed "despite the efforts of the Christian Democrat EPP-ED group to weaken the proposal".
Bus and coach travel
For bus and coach travel Italian Christian Democrat Gabriele Albertini has also drafted a report which says that if people are delayed by 2 hours for a journey that should take at least 3 hours they are entitled to another form of transport. If this is not available they would be entitled to their money back and plus 50% of the price by means of compensation. The report stresses that meals and if necessary accommodation should also be made available.
Mr Albertini commented that the proposed measures would "provide a stronger legislative tool and come to the defence of passengers' rights". He went on to say: "it could have a remarkable impact on bus transport as it applies to national and international road transport services."
Access for disabled guaranteed
Both reports stated that people with reduced mobility may not be refused the right to board a ship, bus or coach except where their safety would be endangered. MEPs ensured that the disability of a passenger cannot be used as a reason for denying them the right to board.
However, the Committee wants to give more time for the coach building industry to adapt the buses so it envisages that the rules would only come into force two years after they had been formerly passed.
You can watch the debate live on 22 April from the European Parliament in Strasbourg.
