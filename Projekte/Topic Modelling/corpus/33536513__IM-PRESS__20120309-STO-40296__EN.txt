Interparliamentary meeting: how to tackle the gender pay gap
Women's rights/Equal opportunities
2012-03-09 - 13:01
The European Parliament highlighted the theme of "equal pay for equal work" as part of its celebrations for International Women's day 2012 on March 8. For the last special event MEPs discussed with citizens and their counterparts from the national parliaments how to best tackle the continuing gender pay gap as women in the EU are still paid on average 17% less than men.
Martin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, opened the debate. He called the question of pay equality "one of the central challenges we are facing today". He said that although female students represent almost 60% of all university graduates, women are still underrepresented in company board rooms.
Also attending the conference were: Viviane Reding, European Commission vice-president responsible for justice, fundamental rights and citizenship; Edit Bauer, member of the EP's women's rights committee; and Egemen Bagis, the Turkish minister for EU Affairs and chief negotiator.
We asked eight women who attended the conference: "What can the EP do to eliminate the gender pay gap?" Click on the slideshow to see what they said.
