MEPs began acting on their new Lisbon Treaty power to co-decide fisheries policy with Member States on 1 December - the day the treaty took effect - with a Fisheries Committee indicative vote on three legislative proposals: a long-term management plan for Bay of Biscay anchovy, a multi-annual management plan for Atlantic horse mackerel and control and enforcement measures in the North-East Atlantic fisheries.
The committee vote still needs to be confirmed by the committee, but it enables MEPs to start informal negotiations with the Council, before technical adjustments are made to adapt the reports to the Lisbon Treaty.
Bay of Biscay anchovies: more certainty for fishermen
The Bay of Biscay anchovy fishery has been closed since stocks collapsed in 2005, directly affecting more than 2,500 families. The proposed long-term plan should ensure that stocks are managed sustainably, when the fishery is re-opened, and hence remove uncertainty for fishermen. The plan is based on a rule for setting total annual catches (TACs) and quotas, based on scientific advice.
MEPs welcomed the plan as a whole, but inserted amendments to ensure that the measures are proportionate and do not undermine the stability of the sector. I n cases when the scientific authority cannot provide reliable estimates but nonetheless advises reducing catches to "the lowest possible level" , the reduction should be less drastic, according to the majority of committee members (10% in contrast to 25% proposed by the Commission).
Sustainable management of Atlantic horse mackerel
Voting on a proposal to establish a multi-annual management plan for horse mackerel in the eastern Atlantic, MEPs called for a fairer methodology for estimating the proportion of discards and for more flexible port access rules, to enable vessels fishing in one area to land the catch in another.
Whilst the task of setting annual TACs and quotas will remain in the hands of the Council, MEPs also want to ensure that any essential changes to the values used to fix biological references should be approved via the ordinary legislative procedure, fully involving the Parliament.
MEPs also clarified a number of provisions in a proposal that updates the rules governing North-East Atlantic fisheries. This regulation transposes into the EU law the updated control and enforcement measures to which the EU is committed under the international Convention on future multilateral co-operation in the North-East Atlantic fisheries (NEAFC).

With the Lisbon Treaty, in force as of 1 December 2009, the European Parliament has important new lawmaking powers. Virtually all EU legislation is now decided by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers together - including agriculture, fisheries, immigration, energy and the EU budget. As the only directly elected EU institution, Parliament's position in making sure the EU is accountable to its citizens is also strengthened, for example by MEPs having a bigger say in appointments to many of the EU's top jobs. 20091130IPR65555 Committee on Fisheries Izaskun Bilbao Barandica Pat The Cope Gallagher Carmen FRAGA ESTÉVEZ Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament - Rule 70 : Interinstitutional negotiations in legislative procedures
