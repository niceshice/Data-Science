On the eve of a European Council set to adopt the Pact for the Euro and a permanent bailout fund, MEPs held a debate in plenary with Commission President Barroso and Hungarian Minister of State for EU Affairs Eniko Gyori. The majority of members stressed that the heart of the EU's future economic governance would have to be located at the EU level rather than at an intergovernmental level.
Both Mr Barroso and Ms Gyori confirmed to Parliament their commitment to give pride of place to an economic governance model based on EU laws. "This will be the cornerstone of all our efforts", Mr Barroso said. They also argued however that the decisions expected to be taken on Friday by the European Council were also important pieces in the wider jigsaw puzzle to be developed to fully address the Eurozone crisis.
Members also focused on the developing situation in Libya, and also other parts of the Middle East.
