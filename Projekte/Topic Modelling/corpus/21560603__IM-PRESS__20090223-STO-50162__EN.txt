That is the decision MEPs on the Environment Committee have taken on a proposed new pan-European piece of legislation to outlaw wasteful bulbs which will disappear from shops between 2009 and 2012. Supporters of the move say it will save on average between €25 and €50 a year on household electricity bills.
The humble light bulb (the incandescent light bulb) has lit up homes and offices for decades and is a ubiquitous presence in our lives. However, traditional bulbs are chronically wasteful of energy with just 5% of the electricity going to the light and the other 95% producing heat.
Given the pressing issue of climate change and the European Union's stated goal of a 20% cut in CO2 emissions by 2020, energy wasteful bulbs are considered a luxury. In fact figures compiled by the European Commission show the staggering amount of energy that could be saved if we all used energy efficient bulbs.
It is estimated that it would amount to the energy equivalent of 11 million European homes or the yearly output of 10 500-megawat power stations. It would also reduce the amount of CO2 emissions by 15 millions tonnes.
Poll backs phase out of inefficient bulb
In a recent, admittedly very unscientific, online poll we conducted, over half of the 1393 respondents were in favour of the complete phasing out of traditional, non energy efficient light bulbs. A quarter favoured a voluntary approach whereas just under a fifth wanted to keep them.
Prominent Green MEP Satu Hassi strongly supports efforts to phase out energy inefficient light bulbs as soon as possible. "In many homes lighting is the biggest electricity consumer. This decision brings easy savings in the electricity bill of families and it is also an easy way to protect the climate," said the Finnish Member.
A new "Age of Enlightenment?"
If you are worried about the prospect of being "kept in the dark" so to speak, then you stop now as there will be many alternatives around. As the staple 100-watt light bulbs are phased out you will still be able to buy the compact fluorescent lamps ("energy saving lamps"), which consume 75% less energy. Halogen lamps with 25-50% efficiency savings will also be on the market.
The move to gradually replace incandescent light bulbs was proposed by the European Commission in December 2008 and was approved by energy experts from all EU members and by the Parliament's Environment Committee on 17 February. Some EU countries have already phased out the traditional light bulb.
