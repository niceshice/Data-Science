However, political instability and civil war have blighted life for its 22 million people since independence. On 28 October it held its fourth Presidential and Parliamentary elections since multi-party democracy took hold in the 1990's. A group of MEPs took part in the EU's Election Observation Mission and found the election to be fair despite some logistical problems.
Cristian Preda of the centre-right EPP group is the Romanian Member who led the Parliament's mission. He said that "the elections have shown the political maturity of the Mozambican people".
He went on to praise the "professionalism" of the election officers in Mozambique and the "significant participation of women" who not only voted but also who worked in the polling stations and as election tellers. According to the results the incumbent President Armando Guebuza of the Frelimo movement won a landslide victory with 80% of the vote with estimated turnout of 41%.
"Millions of Mozambicans came to the polling station"
Members of the European Parliament formed part of the overall EU Election Observation Mission which was headed by British Liberal Member Fiona Hall. Commenting on the election campaign and the poll itself she said "the elections were on the whole very well managed; the campaigning by the candidates was done in a fair way, the tone of the media was also positive. Millions of Mozambicans came to the polling stations in a calm and orderly manner, despite of often long queues".
Despite this Ms Hall noted that there still existed some confusion and a lack of transparency due to a recent change in the electoral law.
Prior to the poll Members met with all the Presidential candidates, including the contender Daviz Simangos of the MDM movement and a representative of the Renamo party. They also held talks with observers from the African Union and the Commonwealth.
Over 100 elections monitored worldwide
Since the first election observation mission in El Salvador in 1984 the European Parliament has sent observers to over 100 elections worldwide.
The Parliament's "Election Coordination Group" was established in 2001 and consists of ten MEPs. The delegations should consist of at least three MEPs (usually 5-7) and are appointed by the political groups. It examines all general questions related to planning, organisation, evaluation and follow-up of Parliament's election observation missions.
A full debriefing on the mission will take place on 9 November in the Parliament's Development Committee.
In addition to Mr Preda and Ms Hall the mission consisted of José Manuel Fernandes (EPP, Portugal), Sebastian Valentin Bodu (EPP, Romania), Patrice Tirolien (Socialists & Democrats, France), Vital Moreira (Socialists & Democrats, Portugal), Luis Alves (Socialists & Democrats, Portugal) and Miguel Portas (GUE/NGL, Portugal).
