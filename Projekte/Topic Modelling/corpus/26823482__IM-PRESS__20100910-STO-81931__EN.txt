As national security is an extremely delicate issue, an international arms deal may raise eyebrows in a few others. Last week some MEPs suggested in a debate that countries improve an EU-wide consultation mechanism on military transfers to States outside the European Union.
The debate came in response to a Parliamentary Question tabled by the centre right European People's Party followed by a cross party debate. They are concerned about European countries selling arms internationally without consulting each other.
At present the decision to transfer military technologies and equipment remains for governments to decide. In other words sovereignty is not affected. European Union member states are however also obliged to publish annual reports on their exports of military technology. In addition countries that grant authorisation for a transfer which has been refused in the last three years by another country has to consult that State and justify its decision.
International recipients must respect human rights
Many MEPs who participated in the discussion underlined the importance of defence industry and called for more solidarity. They asked to improve the consultation mechanism and referred to the Lisbon treaty and Council position stating that a recipient’s compliance with international commitments, respect for human rights, and the preservation of regional peace, security and stability should be taken into account before any sale goes through.
Some MEPs brought up the sale of military equipment to Russia by France and concerns about its use following the 2008 war in Georgia. Speaking for the Belgian EU Presidency the European Affairs Minister Olivier Chastel told the House that "the European Union has the most complete international system of arms exports control in the world".
He said that in 2009 EU member states were consulted on sales to 14 destination countries and notified why export authorizations to these destinations had been granted or refused.
