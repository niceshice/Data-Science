Parliament adopted an own-initiative report by 610 votes in favour to 23 against and 13 abstentions on sustainable agriculture and biogas: a need for a review of EU legislation. The report stresses that, in the long term, renewable energy sources such as biogas and biofuels, together with solar power and wind energy, subject to further intensified research efforts, can bring about a higher degree of independence from fossil-fuel energy sources.
The House recognises that biogas is a vital energy resource that contributes to sustainable economic, agricultural and rural development and environmental protection.
MEPs promote the comprehensive inclusion of the promotion of biogas in the framework of the proposed Renewable Energy Directive with special emphasis on the following elements:
a) Annual statistics and reports on agricultural biogas production in order to be able to follow up on the targets,
b) Measures for the construction and promotion of biogas-installations based on a national or regional impact assessment, promoting those installations that, nationally and/or regionally, are most beneficial to the environment and which are economically sustainable; measures for the dissemination and promotion of results gained from prior experiences or demonstration projects need to be included in all plans; if regional and rural development regulations do not allow funding of such measures, they must be amended,
c) EU Member States should engage in national and regional planning in order to limit legal and administrative impediments, for instance natural gas or other fossil fuels should not be preferred in areas in which it is feasible to sell heat from biogas to local heating providers.
Environmental guarantees
The European Parliament stresses that animal manure, municipal sewage and agro-industrial waste can contain substances (bacteria, viruses, parasites, heavy metals, harmful organic substances) that can potentially be a threat to public health or the environment.
Parliament asks the Commission to present proposals for legislation on the use of residues from biogas installations; asks the Commission to ensure that only organic material that allows residues to be used without endangering the environment may be used in biogas installations.
Banning growth enhancers
MEPs ask the Commission to consider banning growth enhancers in animal feed containing heavy metals if this should prove to be a Europe-wide problem for subsequent use of biogas residues in fields.
