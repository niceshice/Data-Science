Equitable Life Committee in London to gather evidence
On Monday 16 October, the European Parliament's committee of inquiry into the Equitable Life crisis visited London, where MEPs had talks with Equitable policyholders, financial services regulators and Ed Balls, Economic Secretary to the UK Treasury. They also met Ann Abraham, the Parliamentary Ombudsman, Walter Merricks of the Financial Ombudsman's Service and John McFall MP, chair of the Commons Treasury Committee.
Irish MEP Mair√©ad McGuinness (EPP-ED, IE), who chairs the committee, said at the end of the day's proceedings: "Coming only days after the committee's visit to Dublin, today's meetings have helped to complete the jigsaw of what happened over Equitable Life. We do not come here with a pot of gold, but we hope our inquiry will help explain what happened at Equitable Life and give pointers to where legislative changes may be necessary or systems improved to assist policyholders in gaining redress within the financial services market. "
Ms McGuinness added, "As the committee continues to gather evidence, we are identifying gaps in the roles and remits of the various national regulators involved and gaps in the understanding of members of the public on who to turn to for assistance."
British Liberal Democrat MEP Diana Wallis , who is drafting the committee's report, said "Our job is to look at the implementation of the relevant European directives in various EU Member States and to assess the types of regulation in the UK and other Member States involved."
"No mobility without liability, is becoming our catchphrase", she added: "If the single market in financial services is to be effective - and it is clear that there has been a welcome increase in cross-border trading - we need the mechanisms in place to ensure that consumers can have access to justice and to redress where things go wrong."
"Equitable Life has shown us what can go wrong. This European Parliament inquiry gives us a unique opportunity to assess the impact of a specific piece of EU legislation on people's daily lives, to look at what has happened and to make recommendations which we hope will help to ensure that such a crisis is never repeated."
The Equitable Life Assurance Society began selling policies in Europe in the 1950s. In the 1990s, the company began to experience difficulties brought on by falls in interest rates and inflation. In July 2001, having closed its doors to new business, the Society announced its intention to reduce the value of its policies, eventually reaching agreement with policyholders which involved them relinquishing certain rights. Over one million policyholders have been affected in the United Kingdom as well as 6 500 in Ireland and 7 500 elsewhere in Europe (notably Germany).
The committee is expected to produce its final report in the spring of 2007.
