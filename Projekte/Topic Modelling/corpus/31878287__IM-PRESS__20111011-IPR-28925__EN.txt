John SCHRANZ BXL (+32) 2 28 44264 STR (+33) 3 881 74076 PORT (+32) 498 98 14 02 EMAIL econ-press@europarl.europa.eu A sense of urgency pervaded Wednesday's plenary debate between MEPs, the Commission and Council ahead of the crucial forthcoming European Council. Commission President Jos√© Manuel Barroso presented a comprehensive "road map to stability and growth", providing inter alia for EU-wide bank recapitalisations and further economic governance measures. Some welcomed the plan's holistic nature, others felt that it lacked ambition. Several questioned the planned recapitalisation process.
Joseph Daul (EPP, FR): "I salute the Barroso proposals. We must now stop working drop by drop and approach the problems more ambitiously".
Martin Schulz (S&D, DE): "We knew what we needed to do about banks three years ago and yet we did nothing. If taxpayers are going to bail out banks then banks must be subordinate to the states"
Guy Verhofstadt (ALDE, BE): "The bank recapitalisation must take place according to a European plan and not national ones. We also need Eurobonds as soon as possible and need to remove the unanimity rule linked to the bailout fund".
Rebecca Harms (Greens, DE): "Before we go recapitalising banks let's first see what the cost will be. If we do recapitalise them, then their pay practices and bonuses have to stop".
Jan Zahradil (ECR, CZ): "The solution is not more Europe and recapitalisation but orderly bankruptcy and allowing defaults".
Lothar Bisky (GUE/NGL, DE): "The problem is that we will struggle to implement the proposals Barroso is presenting to us. Moreover the measures we have in place are affecting citizens and not those who caused the crisis."
Nigel Farrage (EFD, UK): "The attempt to save the Euro is a gigantic Ponzi scheme"
