The main issues will be the EU's relations with its strategic partners and the state of play of the task force on economic governance chaired by Mr Van Rompuy.
Financial supervision: the final vote On Wednesday in Strasbourg
MEPs will be asked to approve a deal with Council on the EU's financial supervision package, which will reshape the financial regulation landscape in Europe. MEPs press for more flexibility on 2007-2013 budget rules Parliament's Budgets Committee wants the EU to have more flexible budget rules so that it can respond better to new responsibilities generated by the Lisbon Treaty such as the new External Action Service or unforeseen events like the current financial crisis.
Joint EU response to future gas supply crises
Gas supply crises in Europe are expected to be better managed and disruption in household gas supplies avoided, thanks to a new law on better EU-wide co-ordination of supplies and gas interconnection plans.
Independence of air accident inquiries to be reinforced
As air traffic volumes grow, accident prevention measures need to improve too. A new EU law to ensure the independence of air accident inquiries will be scrutinised by MEPs in Strasbourg.
Better monitoring of medicines to ensure greater safety
People with medical conditions are set to be better protected and informed about the use and any undesirable side effects of medicines, under an EU law that comes before Parliament for approval in Strasbourg.

Report & debate to highlight Europe's biodiversity in crisis
Almost half of Europe's birds and mammals facing extinction People unaware of scale of crisis says Dutch MEP's report Almost half of all mammals in Europe are threatening with extinction and the situation is similar with birds. This stark situation is outlined in a report by Dutch MEP Christian Democrat Esther de Lange. She quotes the Poet Lucebert (1924-1994) who wrote that "all things of value are defenceless". The findings will be debated by the European Parliament Monday just head of a UN conference on biological diversity. It comes in the international Year of biodiversity.
The biodiversity loss is projected to accelerate ten-fold by 2050. Across Europe 42% of mammals, 43% of birds, 45% of butterflies, 30% of amphibians, 45% of reptiles and 52% of freshwater fish are threatened with extinction. An example is the L ynx (pictured) which saw its numbers shrink from an estimated 1 00,000 in 1900 to barely 150 by 2002. A combination of urban development, hunting and disease has threatened the Lynx and other creatures.
In addition animals such as the lynx in the Iberian Peninsula or the Bavarian pine vole in Germany are now thought to be nearly extinct, and the European mink - once found all over Central and Eastern Europe - is now one of the most endangered.
People unaware of crisis
According to a Eurobarometer survey in April of this year only 38% of Europeans knew the meaning of the term "biodiversity", while 28% knew the word but not its meaning. In addition only 17% of respondents believe that they are already touched by biodiversity decline, which is why an EU-wide information campaign is sorely needed according to Ms Lange's report.
The main EU-level instrument for safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystems is Natura 2000, a network of nature protection areas under the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive.
What can be done?
The EU Financial Instrument for the Environment (LIFE) has traditionally played a major role in funding biodiversity conservation within the EU, but Ms de Lange believes alternative funding should also be considered, namely through the following policies taking account of biodiversity.
Notably she wants the European Union's Agriculture and Fisheries Policies to be centre stage in the fight to save biodiversity. In addition regional development and research policies (such as the 7th framework programme) can play an important role according to Ms de Lange.
You can watch the debate live form the European Parliament in Strasbourg after 18.00 CET Monday 20 September.

Gas security & supply: Gas firms must ensure supplies to homes - Vidal-Quadras MEP
Alejo Vidal-Quadras believes this regulation will keep the light of an energy community alive Security & supply key to new energy community Essential services would be guaranteed if supply disrupted The disruption of supplies in the "gas war" between Russia and Ukraine in winter 2008 left millions of people in 17 European countries shivering in their homes. Now, MEPs will debate a package of new measures that aim to create a gas community in Europe to provide support between countries. In addition they want to define priorities for supply such as hospitals, schools and vulnerable people. We spoke to Spanish MEP Alejo Vidal-Quadras (EPP) who is guiding the regulation through Parliament.
In the case of a gas crisis, your report suggests securing gas supplies to vulnerable households and essential services like schools & hospitals. How will this be possible?
AVQ: The regulation lays down that Member States should make sure that gas companies guarantee the supply to protected customers (including homes and essential services) for at least 30 days in the event of a crisis. It is true that some countries, due to their particular situation (e.g. those dependent on a single supplier) would have more difficulties. That is why the rules allow supply to be assured by gas reserves in another European Union country. Solidarity is key in this respect.
With respect to priorities, it is clear that the first duty of any public authority is to guarantee supply to its citizens. Member States would have to identify the priorities in their preventive and emergency plans depending on their national situation.
In case of a serious disruption of gas supplies, emergency mechanisms are foreseen to improve cooperation and solidarity between Member States. Can you explain these?
AVQ: A key point is the obligation, for every Member State, to prepare prevention and emergency plans in consultation with other States and then send them to the European Commission to get the green light (for the preventive ones), or for consultation (emergency ones). The Parliament has insisted very much on this.
When the Commission receives all the national plans, it will be able to evaluate them from a global perspective, identifying possible inconsistencies between them. So it will be able to detect any measures incompatible with the internal market or endangering solidarity and ask countries to modify their plans.
More than being about extinguishing the fire, this is about avoiding it. But this does not mean that we can avoid every fire. That is why emergency mechanisms are essential in the event of a crisis.
Is solidarity between Member States a first step toward a European Energy Community and joint EU purchase of energy?
AVQ: This regulation is a historical step in European integration, as for the first time Member States accept that security of supply can only be reached by working together. The people who have been closely following the evolution of European energy policy have seen the transition from a vision purely based on national interest to a European perspective.
The energy community already exists. The 3 fundamental axes of the common energy policy - competitiveness, sustainability and security of supply- were established years ago. But as the first two have developed over the years, the third has always been behind, until this regulation was approved.
Nowadays we see the phenomenon of "energy poverty" (people who can't afford to turn on the heating). What can be done to help them to "energy security"?
AVQ: Each day more European citizens suffer the problem of energy poverty. There is no legal definition of it at a European level, but with the third energy package the EP managed to get the problem formally recognised and each Member States has to define it in its national laws.
I think that it is a problem which should be addressed through social policies and national governments, as well as the EU, should not wait. They should give it as much importance as to other problems such as housing or marginalisation.

MEPs will debate the new regulation on Tuesday (21 September) from 0900 CET. You can watch the debate live online here.

More Europe for safer savings: MEPs give European supervisors more powers
The financial supervision package marks a landmark in regulating Europe's markets ©BELGA Landmark financial supervision package Should ensure the stability of the EU's financial system The financial and ensuing economic crises have exposed European citizens to risks that were unimaginable at the time when the economy was booming. Financial institutions have gambled with other people's money, and as a result many have not just lost their jobs, but their savings as well. Therefore, the European Parliament has decided, overcoming opposition from some member states, to rein in the markets, giving European supervisors more powers to police banks and other financial firms.
After difficult, intensive negotiations between the European parliament and the member states in the Council of the EU, MEPs will vote on Wednesday (22 September) on a landmark financial supervision package that is set to change the way European and national regulators work to ensure the stability of the EU's financial system. The aim is for it t o be put in place with the beginning of 2011.
The crisis: Causes and remedies
Financial markets in the EU are tightly integrated : it's no problem for a bank to have subsidiaries in more than one EU member; it's no problem to trade in shares and bonds in Frankfurt and London at the same time; it's no problem to invest your savings in funds out of your country
Currently the supervision of banks and markets largely falls to national supervisors : they focus on banks, markets, funds that have seat in their country; they apply common rules, but in a manner that's not uniform across EU; they consult, but in a manner that does not necessarily lead to common decision how to address cross-border issues .
The crisis has exposed the problem of having a single, European financial market without a European supervisory regime : national supervisors focused on national markets, so European-wide risks were ignored; national regulators had not sufficient insight into risks of firms that operated Europe-wide and whose failure could trigger financial meltdown
The solution (as first proposed by Larosiere report on the issue from February 2009, the basis for the Commission's proposals and the final compromise to be voted upon):
It involves plans to establish a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) that will focus on Europe-wide risks: e.g. too much cheap money and lax lending standards across the board.
Secondly it will establish three European supervisory authorities (ESAs) that will supervise banks (European Banking Authority), markets (European Securities and Markets Authority), and insurance (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority).
Finally it will ensure that ESAs are at the centre of a tightly bound network of national supervisors to ensure smooth flow of information on risks and consistent implementation of European financial market rules.
Council vs Parliament
There is nothing radically new about this two-pillar structure (ESRB for systemic risk, ESAs for risks to particular markets). T he real question : should European supervisory bodies be given more powers than they had before the crisis?
The negotiations (from December 2009 Council position to September 2010 trialogue compromise) saw the EP demanding more powers for European supervisors as the only way to ensure the financial supervision system in the EU overcomes its weaknesses. The Council , especially those MS with large financial sectors, wanted to keep European supervisors at bay, not interfering unduly with the work of national regulators.
What EP has achieved in negotiations (i.e. where it substantially revised the Council's position, giving European supervisory bodies more powers): Namely it gave powers to ESAs to keep national supervisors in line: investigating breaches of application of EU law, mediating in disputes between national supervisors, issuing binding decisions to them. It also allowed the ESAs to issue decisions to more financials institutions than Council wanted.
It also entrusted ESAs with scrutinizing financial products and practices and assessing their impact on markets, even banning them in extreme cases and put investors and depositor protection at the heart of the tasks of EBA.
It also allowed EBA to investigate systemically important financial institutions, practices and products, design stress tests to evaluate the stability of banks and gave ESMA direct supervision powers over credit rating agencies.
There is also a review clause: Commission to examine every three years whether further responsibilities are to be given to the ESAs, particularly for direct supervision on institutions with pan-European reach
The power to declare the existence of a crisis situation will be in the hands of Member States although the ESRB's will have a number of tools at its disposal to warn about emerging emergencies.
The Parliament's rapporteurs on the dossier were French Liberal Sylvie Goulard for the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), British Member Peter Skinner (S&D for the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), Spanish MEP Jose-Manuel Garcia Margallo Y Marfil (EPP) for the European Banking Authority (EBA) and Sven Giegold (Greens/EFA) for the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).

New rules for safer medicines
Rows of pills on black background ©BELGA_ImageSource 5% of deaths from adverse drug reaction New pharmocovigilence risk assessment committee Perfectly legal and properly used medicines sometimes have unexpected and serious side effects, that are only discovered after the medicine has entered the market and is widely disseminated. "Pharmacovigilance" - monitoring all drugs on the market to identify previously undetected side effects - is therefore vital and Parliament is set to approve an extensive update to EU rules, improving the early detection of rogue side effects to enhance patient safety.
All new or updated drugs will come with specific warnings for still undetected side-effects, while doctors and patients will be encouraged to report any serious incidents, in a new step in the ongoing battle to prevent a tragedy like the one with Thalidomide, which caused serious birth defects in many babies in the 60s.
Why pharmacovigilance?
Drugs may seem safe and effective in clinical trials, but may reveal side effects when they become available to a much wider population.
According to the European Commission 5% of all hospital admissions are due to serious side effects from medicines and many more cases may be unreported. Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) is the fifth most common cause of death, accounting for around 200,000 deaths a year, at a cost to society of almost €80 billion.
What is being done?
The aim is to update existing EU rules to improve data collection, treatment and dissemination and better inform the public and doctors. The main changes are:
All new or updated medicines to be intensely monitored for five years. Doctors and patients to be informed and encouraged to report all problems.
A new EU "Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Advisory Committee" to be created within the EMEA (European Medicines Agency).
Stricter, but simpler rules on monitoring and reporting by drug companies.
A European network of national reporting websites and an EU database, Eudravigilance, with all relevant information and guidelines.
Greater transparency through public hearings for ADR related medicines.
Greater coordination in case of emergency and better PILs (Patient Information Leaflets).
MEPs will debate the new rules on pharmacovigilance Tuesday and vote on them Wednesday. UK Socialist Linda McAvan is steering the proposals through the EP.

Security of gas supplies: joint EU response for future disruptions
MEPs believe this measure has turned up the heat on an energy community in Europe Households will be protected first during a crisis. €1.4 billion for infrastructure projects European households can expect not to have their gas cut off in any future gas supply crisis, thanks to EU-wide co-ordination and interconnection arrangements laid down in legislation approved by the European Parliament on Tuesday. The legislation also aims to improve the general management of such crises.
The new rules on the security of gas supply are intended to reduce vulnerability to future disruptions and boost infrastructure development at national and EU level. Market mechanisms remain the first course of action, but households will be protected first during a crisis.
Within two years Member States will have to design prevention plans and the Commission will have an increased role in coordinating emergency measure and ensuring that national plans do not endanger the security of supply to other Member States in crisis.
Parliament adopted the draft regulation by 601 votes to 27, with 23 abstentions. Spanish MEP Alejo Vidal Quadras (EPP) who was responsible for steering the draft legislation through the House, emphasised in the final debate on Tuesday morning that the regulation is a "genuinely powerful instrument" to improve security of gas supplies and a "milestone regarding this issue in the EU" adding that "if applied speedily and effectively it will be a powerful message to our gas suppliers that Europe stands all for one and one for all in the crises".
Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger welcomed the end of the legislative process and announced that the Commission had set aside €1.4 billion for infrastructure projects such as reverse flows. Implementation of the rules will be reviewed in the next 2 to 3 years.
Household heating guaranteed
In the event of extremely low temperatures European gas companies would be required to ensure supplies to householders in the following cases:
- extreme temperatures during a seven-day peak period;
- any period of at least 30 days of exceptionally high demand;
- at least 30 days in the event of infrastructure disruption under average winter conditions.
Preventive measures
Member States will need to ensure that even if their biggest source of gas or a large part of the network fails, the remaining network is capable of meeting total daily gas demand on a day of "exceptionally high demand" (which, statistically, happens once every 20 years).
National authorities will have four years to comply with this supply standard but cross-border interconnections among EU countries will have to be in place within three years of the legislation's entry into force.
Emergency response
If, despite these preventive measures, an emergency happens due to serious disruption or exceptionally high demand, the Member State concerned will activate a national emergency response plan.
The three main crisis levels are "early warning", "alert" and "emergency". In an emergency, the plans must ensure that cross-border access to storage facilities and the flow of gas across borders are maintained.
The European Commission would have to declare a "Union emergency" or a regional emergency at the request of at least two Member States who have declared national emergencies. During a Union emergency, the Commission would ensure a smooth flow of information as well as coordinating national measures and any joint action with non-EU countries.

Air accident investigation: Parliament lays down strict criteria
The tail of the crashed Spainair aircraft crashed on take off from Barajas Airport, Madrid, 20 August 2008. ©BELGA Final accident report made public A European Network of Civil Aviation Safety Investigation Authorities will be set up A new EU law to ensure the independence of air accident inquiries was approved by the European Parliament on Tuesday. The law also requires airlines to produce a list of those on board the plane within two hours of an accident. Before a flight, passengers will be entitled to name a person to be informed in the event of an accident.
The new EU regulation will ensure that a safety investigation into an accident is conducted free of pressure from regulatory or other authorities. Any statements taken from individuals by a safety investigator, as well as voice and image recordings inside cockpits and air traffic control units, will be used only for safety investigation, unless there is an overriding reason for disclosure to the judiciary. This will ensure that people can testify without fear to the safety investigators, whose purpose is not to attribute blame but to establish the facts.
As is the case at present, the safety investigation authority will be obliged to make public the final accident report "in the shortest possible time and if possible within twelve months of the date of the accident or serious incident".
Each Member State must set up a civil aviation accident emergency plan and ensure that all airlines based on its territory have a plan to assist victims of accidents and their relatives.
Informing victims' families
EU airlines, as well as non-EU airlines departing from an EU airport, will be obliged to produce a list of all those on board an aircraft "as soon as possible, and at the latest within two hours of the notification of the occurrence of an accident to the aircraft". Their names can only be made public after the families or close relatives of the passengers have been informed by the authorities and only if they do not object. Furthermore, a list of any dangerous goods on board the aircraft will have to be released by the airline immediately after the accident.
Airlines will also be required to provide passengers with the means to indicate a contact person in case of an accident. "This information may be used by the airlines only in the event of an accident and shall not be communicated to third parties or used for commercial purposes" says the new law.
European air safety arrangements
A European Network of Civil Aviation Safety Investigation Authorities will be set up to advise the EU institutions, make Europe-wide air safety recommendations, promote best investigation practices and strengthen national safety investigation authorities.
By the end of 2011 the Commission must draft an update of the air safety occurrence reporting directive. The Cologne-based European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) will have access to the safety occurrence reports produced by Member States and may be invited to advise in accident investigations.
This new law, which was approved by MEPs today by 604 votes to 11, with 26 abstentions, was guided through Parliament by Christine De Veyrac (EPP, FR). It has already been agreed with the Member States in the Council and will enter into force 20 days after it is published.
European "trust mark" for e-traders
A European "trust mark" to guarantee the reliability and quality of goods is among proposals that MEPs believe would boost confidence and thereby unlock the growth potential of this sector. ©BELGA A European "trust mark" for websites that guarantee reliability Should be implemented in cooperation with existing trust mark labels The internet is the fastest growing channel for retail sales, yet only one in three consumers would consider shopping online from another EU-country. The European Parliament on Tuesday backed proposals to encourage cross-border e-trading and build consumer confidence.
A European "trust mark" for websites that guarantee the reliability and quality of goods sold online across borders is just one of the non-binding proposals made today by MEPs to boost consumer confidence and so unlock the growth potential of e-trading for Europe. The new mark, they say, should be based on EU law and be supervised by the Commission. But it should be implemented in cooperation with existing trust mark labels in Member States and backed up by standards enforcement mechanisms at national level.
Ending discrimination against cross-border customers
Online sales are often hindered by foreign traders refusing to accept orders from consumers living in another EU country. MEPs regret that the Services Directive has still not been fully transposed into the laws of some Member States. They call on the Commission and Member States to ensure this is done, thereby putting an end to discrimination against consumers on the basis of their electronic address or residence, and to see that the non-discrimination rule is properly enforced.
Transparency and privacy
MEPs emphasise the need to make e-trading more transparent by ensuring that the consumer always knows the identity and contact details of the supplier. They also call on the Commission to strengthen consumers' data privacy, stress the importance of supporting the most secure technologies for electronic payment systems and call for a European early-warning system, including a database to combat fraud in the digital market.
Lastly, Parliament calls for a degree of harmonisation of some aspects of consumer contract law, especially regarding the handling of certain types of warranty claims.
Next steps
Today's resolution on "completing the internal market for e-commerce" is Parliament's response to the Commission's March 2010 working paper on barriers holding back consumers and businesses in digital trading.
"E-commerce is a tool with great potential to reshape and improve the competitiveness of the EU economy and the European internal market, and can provide great value and opportunities to European citizens and businesses at this time of financial strain", said Parliament's rapporteur Pablo Arias Echeverria (EPP, Spain) ahead of the vote. He added "It is vital that European Union leaders implement the necessary measures to overcome remaining barriers in e-commerce, and create trust and transparency so that both citizens and businesses can fully exploit its benefits".
A new directive on consumers' rights is in the pipeline. In addition, the Commission has committed itself to issuing a Code of EU Online Rights by 2012.
Protecting patients: EU to upgrade medicine safety monitoring
Knowing what is in medicines and how to use them properly is a cause for concern for many MEPs. ©BELGA MEPs amended the EU pharmacovigilance regulation and medicines code directive EU and national web portals be set up to give information on medicinal products and their proven side effects Patients will be better informed on how to use medicines, and enabled to report their adverse effects directly to national authorities, thanks to updates of EU laws agreed with the Council and endorsed by Parliament on Wednesday. The EU and Member States will set up pharmacovigilance web sites, and medicines that need special monitoring after being placed on the market will be marked with a black symbol.
MEP Linda McAvan (S&D, UK), who steered the draft legislation through Parliament, said during the debate that "it is very clear that we need to work together. With a pool of 500 million people, it is much easier and quicker to pick up an adverse reaction than when working alone at national level".
Pharmaceutical web portals and reporting by patients
MEPs amended the EU pharmacovigilance regulation and medicines code directive to require that EU and national web portals be set up to give information on medicinal products and their proven side effects. National web portals, to be linked to the EU one, will include assessment reports, summaries of product characteristics and patient information leaflets. The portals and patient information leaflets will also tell patients how to report any suspected adverse reactions, using national web portals or other means.
Additional monitoring of new medicines
Some medicinal products (e.g. those with a new active substance) will be authorized subject to additional monitoring after they are placed on the market. These will be identified by a black symbol with the statement “This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring”, together with an explanatory sentence. They will also be listed on the EU web site and national web portals.
EU single point of receipt for all pharmacovigilance information
The EU "Eudravigilance" database will be the single point of receipt for all pharmacovigilance information from marketing authorisation holders and national authorities. It will be fully accessible to the Member States, the EU Medicines Agency and the Commission, and also accessible, "to an appropriate extent", to marketing authorisation holders, health-care professionals and the public. Personal data protection will be guaranteed.
Possible review of patient information leaflet and environmental impact
Furthermore, amendments to the EU pharmacovigilance regulation and medicines code directive require the European Commission to report back within two years on how to improve the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet. If appropriate, the Commission may also present proposals to improve the readability, layout and content of these documents.
The Commission is also asked to report back on the environmental effects of medicinal products, such as pollution of soil or water by pharmaceutical residues, and to assess whether amendments to EU legislation are needed to remedy them.
The regulation was approved with 559 votes in favour, 7 against and 12 abstentions.
The directive was approved with 569 votes in favour, 8 against and 15 abstentions.
Next steps
The new EU pharmacovigilance legislation must be put into effect within 18 months of its publication in the EU Official Journal.
EU budget: MEPs want more flexibility and policy debate
Under the Lisbon Treaty Parliament has greater control of the EU budget ©PHOTOPQR MEPs want new Lisbon areas like external action & climate change taken account of Call on Commission and EU governments to come up with budget review Parliament wants more flexibility within the EU budget to meet current and future needs. In a resolution passed on Wednesday, it urges the Council to enter into policy negotiations on its budget proposal for 2007-2013. The current (March 2010) proposal is deemed too rigid to provide sufficient funding to meet new challenges, including those arising out of the Lisbon Treaty.
The Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) sets annual ceilings for commitments and payments by category of expenditure. It had to be revised to bring it into line with the Lisbon Treaty, but a draft interim report by German MEP Reimer Böge (EPP, DE), approved today, criticises the Council proposal as "purely technical", and "insufficient for Parliament to give its consent."
"The Council proposal does not add the resources necessary to deliver initiatives that were not foreseen when the current MFF was adopted in 2006. The most obvious ones are the new priorities included in the Lisbon Treaty, like the external action service, climate change, energy, civil protection, sports and space. But even before the addition of these new priorities, the annual budgets could only be agreed by exhausting the existing margins", said Mr Böge, adding that "for the coming years, the remaining margins under the ceilings of the framework are estimated to be negligible."
To meet current and future needs, Parliament would like to see wider margins and reserves built into the framework. This means more flexibility to make changes within and between budget headings.
Parliament also calls on the Council and the Commission to consider rejigging the budget by establishing "positive" and "negative" priorities, bearing in mind the EU's added value. Commission and Council should finally come up with the long-awaited mid-term review (due in 2009), of all the aspects of EU spending and resources, so that a real policy debate can be held on future priorities.
The Böge report was approved with 445 votes in favour, 39 against and 18 abstentions.

Parliament gives green light to new financial supervision architecture
Press conference with the rapporteurs of the law that set down a rigorous new framework for the supervision of financial markets in the EU Three European supervisory authorities (ESAs) will be established MEPs successfully pushed for consumer protection to be at the very heart of the ESAs' work Having fought for more than a year in favour of a radical reform of European financial supervision, the European Parliament on Wednesday gave the final seal of approval to a package of reforms which will see a fundamental shift in the way banks, stock markets and insurance companies are policed as of 2011.
Three European supervisory authorities (ESAs) will be established to replace the current supervisory committees. Their powers will stretch much further than the advisory nature of the current system and their potential to gain further competences will be considerable thanks to a strong review clause. A European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) will also be established with the task of monitoring and warning about the general build-up of risk in the EU economy.
This new system should be able to provide better protection from events such as the Fortis bank crisis weekend, Germany's unilateral naked short-selling ban and the losses faced by life insurance policyholders in the UK, Ireland and Germany with the collapse of Equitable Life. It should at the same time strengthen the EU single market for financial services and provide much better investor protection.
Cosmetic or root and branch reform
A number of Member States, particularly those with large financial centres, favoured the limited reform approach. This led to a significant reduction in the scope of the Commission proposals, themselves considered by the EP as not going far enough. Parliament's rapporteurs from the beginning argued that the system needed serious reform so that risk would be better understood, primarily through much improved communication between national supervisors.
The final deal sees the transformation of advisory committees into watchdogs with a bite. The ESAs are set to get tough new powers to settle disputes among national financial supervisors and to impose temporary bans on risky financial products and activities. If national supervisors fail to act, then the authorities may also impose decisions directly on financial institutions, such as banks, so as to remedy breaches of EU law. The daily work of the ESAs will see them drive coordination within the current system of colleges of national supervisors set up to watch over cross-border financial institutions.
ESA firefighting powers
In the event of disagreements between national supervisors, ESAs will be able to impose legally-binding mediation and, if no agreement can be reached within the relevant college of supervisors, to impose supervisory decisions on the financial institution concerned ESAs will be able to intervene as mediators at their own discretion, rather than only at the request of one of the national supervisors.
The ESAs will be able to monitor how national supervisors implement their obligations under EU law. If these obligations are implemented incorrectly, the ESAs may issue instructions to the national supervisor concerned and, if these go unheeded, directly instruct the financial institution to remedy any breach of EU law.
Consumer protection a central goal
In response to the ever more complex world of financial services, MEPs successfully pushed for consumer protection to be at the very heart of the ESAs' work. ESAs will have the power to investigate specific types of financial institution, or financial products such as "toxic" products, or financial activities such as naked short selling, to assess what risks they pose to a financial market and issue warnings where necessary. Where specific financial legislation so provides, ESAs may temporarily prohibit or restrict harmful financial activities or products and may also ask the Commission to introduce legislative acts to prohibit such activities or products permanently.
ESRB: faster and better warning about risk
MEPs inserted provisions to enable the ESRB to communicate rapidly and clearly. The ESRB will develop a common set of indicators to permit uniform ratings of the riskiness of specific cross-border financial institutions and make it easier to identify the types of risks they carry. The ESRB will also be responsible for establishing colour-coded grades to reflect different risk levels. When making warnings or recommendations on risk build-up, the ESRB is to use the colour-grade to indicate the level of risk.
To enhance the ESRB's ability to predict risk build-up, a broader range of skills and experience, including academics, will be represented on its Advisory Scientific Committee. Finally, to improve visibility and credibility from the outset, the ECB President will preside over the ESRB for the first five years.
Powers that may grow
Both the ESAs and the ESRB will be able to grow as events require. Particularly for the ESAs, MEPs ensured that the Commission will report back every three years on whether it is desirable to combine the separate supervision of banking, securities, and insurance on the benefits of having all the ESAs headquartered in one city and on whether the ESAs should be entrusted with further supervisory powers, notably over financial institutions with pan-European reach.
Role of the European Parliament
MEPs also succeeded in improving democratic oversight of the whole supervisory system. The EP will be able to veto the appointment of ESA chairpersons and will have a say in the development of the technical standards and implementing measures. Moreover, the ESRB President will keep the chair and vice-chairs of the EP's Economic Affairs Committee updated on ESRB activities through confidential discussions.
The legislative texts empower the Commission, the ESAs and the ESRB to ask the Council to declare an emergency. But the Parliament will also be able to ask the Council to declare an emergency through resolutions and questions, in the same way as it has a right to make requests to the Council and the Commission in any other matter.

MEPs urge to dismantle remaining barriers in EU-Turkey trade

In a resolution they also urged Turkey to stop discrimination against foreign firms in public procurement, fight counterfeiting and open its airports and harbours to all EU Members, including Cyprus.
A recent Constitutional referendum in Turkey passed reform measures to the political and judicial organisation of the country.
Non-legislative resolution based on report drafted by Bulgarian Liberal Metin Kazak was approved on 21 of September. The Parliament also welcomed the outcome of referendum on constitutional reform and underlines the importance of the Nabucco gas pipeline project of EU energy security.
Removing trade barriers on both sides
In the resolution MEPs called for steps to reduce certification and inspections, ("burdensome import procedures") and remaining import licences.
MEPs also noted Ankara's failure to implement the additional protocol to the EC-Turkey Association Agreement - (which guarantees access to Turkish airports and harbours for all EU member states, including Cyprus) and noted that this may "seriously affect" the negotiating process for EU accession, say MEPs.
The resolution also noted that visa restrictions for Turkish businessmen and lorry drivers impede their movement into the EU and that if they are reduced then it could boost trade.
Mr Kazak told us that "custom Union so far reflects the deepest economic integration reached with any candidate country and can be determined as a success story for the EU-Turkey relations".
He called for mutual political will to eliminate outstanding issues in the functioning of Customs Union and he expects constitutional change to boost democratisation, modernisation and reform process in the country with young and dynamic population.

Safer pest control products
The EU and Member States will set up pharmacovigilance web sites. ©BELGA update EU rules that govern products ranging from insect repellents to water treatment chemicals Agricultural pesticides are covered by separate legislation "Biocides" to control pests and germs are set to become safer and more environmentally-friendly thanks to EU legislation, on which Parliament voted at first reading on Wednesday. New biocides will also be authorised more swiftly for EU-wide sale than at present.
Parliament's report on the legislation was drafted by German MEP Christa Klass (EPP) and approved in plenary today with 550 votes in favour, 22 against and 80 abstentions.
Ms Klass commented: "We need biocides to maintain high hygiene standards and prevent disease. I am confident that this legislation will ensure we can reap the benefits of these products, while protecting against the dangers."
The broad aim of the draft regulation is to update EU rules that govern products ranging from insect repellents to water treatment chemicals. (Agricultural pesticides are covered by separate legislation.) For the first time, materials treated with biocides will also be regulated.
Parliament adopted a number of amendments to the draft legislation that will now have to be considered by the Council of Ministers.
New EU-level approvals for pest control products will streamline the application process for companies, but Parliament believes this approach should be phased in gradually.
Banning the most toxic chemicals
Parliament voted to ban the most toxic chemicals - especially those that are carcinogenic, harmful to fertility or interfere with genes or hormones. It also tightened up requirements to gradually replace other hazardous substances with less harmful alternatives.
Exceptions in exceptional cases
Regrettably, even highly toxic substances may at times be needed to protect human health, other animals or the environment - for example to control rodents in the absence of effective alternatives. MEPs had considered recommending new restrictions on the commonly-used rat poison 'difenacoum', but a narrow majority rejected this proposal.
EU authorisation
MEPs want a centralised, EU-level approval of biocides to be phased in gradually. The European Chemicals Agency, they say, should be tasked with assessing applications for new and "low-risk" products from 2013 and most other biocides from 2017. But Member States should continue to decide on products that potentially pose the biggest health risks and should also retain the right to impose extra controls on the use of products approved at EU level.
Minimising animal testing
Parliament also decided that, as in EU "REACH" rules for chemicals, companies should be obliged to share data from the tests they conduct on animals (in return for reasonable compensation) in order to prevent duplication of experiments.
Special attention to nanomaterials
Lastly, with doubts remaining over the possible long-term health effects of nanomaterials, MEPs insisted on the need for separate assessment of such particles in biocidal products.
Van Rompuy reports to MEPs on European summit
The President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy debated the outcome of the last EU Summit with MEPs. 22 September, 2010 Foreign affairs dominated Summit Task Force on economic governance report in October Foreign affairs, economic governance and the situation of Roma people in Europe were the main issues raised in Wednesday's debate on the outcome of the EU Summit of 16 September. It was the first time President of the Council Herman Van Rompuy has reported back to MEPs in Strasbourg after a meeting of the European Council.
He said the main focus of the Council was external relations and the preparation of upcoming international summits and on the relations with strategic partners.
Referring to the Task Force on economic governance which he heads, he said it had made progress on the development of a new macro-surveillance framework, and the strengthening of national fiscal frameworks. He said it will produce its final report for the October Council with the Commission due to present legislation proposals at the end of September.
Speaking of the Roma and the controversy over their expulsion from France, Mr Van Rompuy said that the key message is that a Member State has the right to uphold the rule of law within their territory, while the Commission has the right and the duty to conduct investigations to ensure application of European law.
Joseph Daul, leader of the Parliament's largest group - the centre right European People's Party (EPP), said he respected the Commission’s right to check that European law is implemented correctly, but regretted the language used during the discussions on the Roma. He underlined the importance and duty of member states to try to integrate minorities and the minorities' duty to show the will to be integrated. On foreign policy he said "the only way to achieve respect and understanding around the world was through a coordinated and strong foreign policy".
Socialist Martin Schulz said that when we talk about international diplomacy and international trade, it can work only if it fits in with the domestic policies back home. That is what is going on in EU at the moment.
He said the Parliament is calling for the community method in terms of resolving problems. He said his group wanted it to be done at EU level in a community way and that the task of EP is to get the community method through. Regarding Roma, he called for it to be resolved and called human dignity an inviolable issue. He also stressed that European law has to be accepted and enforced by Member States.
The Liberal leader Guy Verhofstadt said the Commission has acted in the right way regarding the Roma and that values are as important as market rules. He went on to stress that it is important that everybody sees that the EC is treating every State equally, no matter how big or small.
"On economic governance we have no time to waste" he said. "We need, as fast as possible, a package on the table". He went on to say that "to be credible, the package needs to fulfil some conditions", such as "effective sanctions -progressive, combining political and economic, voting rights suspended of those breaking the rules".
Rebecca Harms of the Greens said that "we're living in completely different galaxies". The President of the European Council and the Task Force should have the responsibility to "move the EU out of the crisis". she was satisfied that the Commission will make proposals on economic governance, but "it shouldn't focus only on sanctions".
On the Roma she regretted the missed opportunity for the Council to support action against France and worried that "populist leaders in Europe focus on "domestic problems with xenophobic policies, and fomenting insecurity".
Timothy Kirkhope for the European Conservatives and Reformists said that the Commission's recent attack on France was not really helpful for European unity. He urged all actors to parts to be constructive with their input in the Roma discussion. He also welcomed the EU´s assistance to Pakistan and underlined that the only way to ensure long term development in Pakistan is through trade and economic ties.
Patrick Le Hyaric for the leftist GUE/NGL group attacked the conclusions of European Council and asked for concrete and specific actions to be taken in the case of the Roma and in combating poverty, unemployment, famine and climate change.
Niki Tzavela of the Europe of Freedom and Democracy group mentioned China saying it has reserves amounting to 2.4 trillion US dollars, and is looking to invest in Europe. She asked if in the upcoming Council Summit would discuss setting aside the obstacles which the EU has in terms of its relations with China, in particular on human rights and Iran.

End impunity in DRC
Tantini Kahindu, 16, sits on September 4, 2010 in her house in the village of Luvungi that was attacked on July 30 by Hutu rebels of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) and local militias, who raped more than 280 women and minors as punishment for the villagers' alleged support for the Congolese Defense Forces (FARDC). Country ravaged by poverty & war Culture of impunity persists The culture of impunity, atrocities and violence against civilians and the plundering of natural resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo must come to an end, MEPs said in a debate on Wednesday, 22 September. Parliament held discussions in light of a recent UN draft report (to be made public on 1 October) that documents the worst human rights violations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) between 1993 and 2003.
Africa's "World war" 1998-2003: over 5,4 million dead in the conflict. Violence continues in Eastern DRC.
Rape has become a weapon of war used by rebels, members of the Congolese army and civilian. The UN estimates that over 200,000 women have been raped since war began in the DRC more than a decade ago. Despite its wealth of natural resources including minerals and forests, DRC is one of the poorest countries in the world – 80 % of its population live in poverty and it is struggling to recover from years of conflict.
In the debate MEPs highlighted that perpetrators go free and called for an end to the impunity. Several MEPs also mentioned the role and passive nature of UN troops.
Belgian Socialist MEP Veronique De Keyser warned that a culture of immunity still remains despite the efforts of the international community.
Filip Kaczmarek (EPP), a Polish MEP, cited the French charity MSF saying that "55 % of all rapes committed in the world have been committed in Eastern Congo". He said the problem on such a scale that UN is doing very little to put an end. "This culture of impunity must be finished once and for all!" Green MEP Isabelle Durant also stressed that the pillage of the DRC was continuing with impunity.
Speaking for the Council and representing EU foreign Affairs Chief Catherine Ashton Olivier Chastel noted that impunity for those who commit crimes was a major problem.-
Charles Goerens (ALDE) said that any response must come from the African Union, the UN and the International Community.
Marie-Christine Vergiat (GUE/NGL) noted that it took the gang rape of scores of people this summer to force the international community to act.
Charles Tannock (ECR) told the House that "the Kimberley Process to be extended to cover other key natural resources in Africa. Human rights abuses in Africa, which are all too common regrettably, are often linked to competition for the control of mineral resources. The Kimberley Process has been hugely successful in curtailing the trade in conflict or blood diamonds".
Dutch MEP Bastiaan Belder (EFD) said "the crimes are taking place exactly where we find Congo's biggest economic richness. Following recent sources, the economic potential of mines in that country is 24 billion."
