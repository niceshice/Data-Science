Logo of the Rio+20 summit The Rio+20 summit on 20-22 June faces the challenge of how to push sustainable development at a time when the economic crisis causes many governments to water down ambitious policy proposals to protect the environment. To ensure the United Nations summit will have a genuine impact, MEPs will discuss preparations for it with their counterparts from national parliaments during a meeting of the environment committee on Wednesday 21 March, which will be streamed live on the EP website.
During the meeting they will mainly focus on the framework for sustainable development , the promotion of a green economy together with poverty eradication.
