Brussels plenary session 23-24 March 2011
EP President Jerzy Buzek opened the session Preparations for the European Council: MEPs to vote on stability mechanism Single permit equal rights and treatment for foreign workers Consumer rights: greater consumer confidence and a boost for business: New rules on consumer protection will be put to the vote in Strasbourg on Thursday. The aim is to increase the confidence of shoppers and provide transparency for businesses so as to unleash the potential for growth in cross-border commerce within the EU.
Preparing for European Council: MEPs to vote on stability mechanism: On Wednesday MEPs will debate with the Council and Commission the issues on the agenda for the EU summit of 24-25 March. They will vote the same day on the European Council's proposal to create a permanent stability mechanism for the eurozone. Member States are expected to adopt the stability mechanism at the summit, together with the Pact for the Euro.
Single permit equal rights and treatment for foreign workers: Non-EU workers should have the same rights on working time, leave and social security as EU nationals, says the Employment Committee in its amendments to the "single permit" directive which comes before Parliament for a vote this Thursday.
Parliament stakes out its position on EU budget for 2012: Sufficient resources for the EU 2020 strategy and improved coordination between European and national budgets are key demands of the draft resolution on the EU general budget for 2012 on which Parliament votes on Thursday following a debate on Wednesday.
Executive Directors for new EU financial watchdogs: On Thursday MEPs will give their opinion on the candidates for the posts of executive director in the three new EU financial watchdogs. The vote will be to confirm or reject a recommendation by the EP's Economic Affairs Committee, to be adopted two days before, on Tuesday.
MEPs give verdict on Belgian candidate for ECB board: Parliament's plenary is expected to give the green light for Peter Praet, the governor of Belgium's Central Bank, to take a seat on the European Central Bank's executive board. Thursday's vote comes after a hearing last week with the EP Economic Affairs Committee, which gave a positive recommendation.
A joint EU resettlement programme for refugees: The need to establish a joint EU resettlement programme for refugees from outside the EU will be the subject of a debate with the Council on Wednesday. Currently only 10 Member States resettle refugees on a regular basis, with little coordination among them on the priorities.
Wikileaks, US subpoenas and data privacy: US court orders slapped on Twitter, and possibly Google and Facebook, requiring the handover of personal data, messages and communications of individuals allegedly linked to Wikileaks (including EU citizens) will be the focus of a debate with Council and Commission on Wednesday.
Also on the agenda:
Increased imports of duty-free wine from Moldova
EU-US Open Skies: wider market access for airlines on the horizon
System of preferences for developing countries to be prolonged
Stronger economic and diplomatic ties with the six Arab Gulf states
Mandate of EU cyber security agency to run until September 2013 Agenda Facebook
Opening of session: Middle East, MEP corruption claims, Week against Racism
An MEP walks past the seating plan of the Parliament At the start of Wednesday's plenary session in Brussels, EP President Jerzy Buzek commented on the situations in Bahrain, Syria and Yemen, last Sunday's article in a British newspaper alleging corrupt behaviour by certain MEPs and the Week of Solidarity with People Struggling Against Racism and Discrimination.
First of all, Mr Buzek extended a warm welcome to an eminent visitor, Maria Romana De Gasperi, daughter of the late Alcide de Gasperi, a former Italian prime minister, President of the European Parliament and one of the founding fathers of the European Union.
He then spoke of the "disturbing news" from Bahrain, Syria and Yemen concerning the suppression of demonstrations by people seeking democratic change. "When governments turn their guns on their own people, they lose all legitimacy", said the president. "The violence must be stopped and the perpetrators brought to justice".
This week the international community marks the Week of Solidarity with People Struggling Against Racism and Discrimination. "Much has been done to eliminate racism but much remains to be done", stressed the EP president.
Bribery allegations against MEPs
Lastly, Mr Buzek spoke at length on the situation following the allegations in last weekend's Sunday Times about MEPs prepared to take payments from lobbyists. "One of our colleagues, Mr Thaler, has given up his seat", the president informed the House. "A second colleague, Mr Strasser, has announced his intention of standing down in the next few days." A third, Mr Severin, had left his political group, the Socialists and Democrats, and joined the group of Non-attached Members.
"These resignations are the result of serious allegations which appeared in the press of irregular behaviour by some Members of this House", said Mr Buzek. He announced that the senior MEPs making up Parliament's Bureau had discussed the situation this morning and would continue their discussions this evening.
The president continued: "Speaking on behalf of the Bureau and, I think, the majority of my colleagues sitting in this room, we are determined to practise zero tolerance of the kind of actions that led to the resignation of our colleagues". "As president, I am determined to uphold the integrity of this House and all its Members".
"Parliament wants the facts to come to light", he added, and would cooperate fully with all competent authorities. In addition, Parliament must "strengthen its code of conduct" for such cases and introduce "a legally binding code of conduct for lobbying in EU institutions".
He promised to keep the House abreast of developments.
Changes to the agenda
The House adopted the following changes to this week's plenary agenda.
A debate on the situation in Japan, including the nuclear power plant alerts, will be held this afternoon (Wednesday) following Council and Commission statements. A "solidarity" resolution will be put to the vote on Thursday. The debate on the review of the European Neighbourhood Policy is postponed to April.
The Balzani report on preparations for the 2012 budget is moved to Thursday, after the joint debate on air agreements.
An oral question by the Environment Committee to the Commission on implementation of the Fuel Quality Directive, including an EU default value for tar sands and oil shale, is added to the agenda. No resolution will be put to the vote.
The Chichester report on the European Network and Information Security Agency will be taken without debate and included directly in voting time on Thursday.
The Simpson report on European statistics on tourism, the Moreira report on macro-financial assistance for Georgia and the resolutions on the fisheries agreement with Mauritania are postponed to the April session.
New Members
Lastly, the president also announced that as of tomorrow, 24 March, Brice Hortefeux (EPP, FR) replaces Catherine Soulli√© (EPP, FR), who has resigned.

Parliament approves Treaty change to allow stability mechanism
(Top) Parliament's two co-rapporteurs, Roberto Gualtieri (S&D, Italy) and Elmar Brok (EPP, Germany). (Below) The Parliament in session, 23 March 2011. Parliament backed a limited Treaty change to allow the establishment of the European Stability Mechanism in a vote on Wednesday, one day before the summit where EU Member States are expected to endorse this new tool. MEPs were satisfied with the "positive signals" given by the Member States on bringing the intergovernmental mechanism closer to the EU framework.
MEPs have been criticising the original European Council proposal on the Treaty change as regards both the method used and the content, since neither one respects the "EU method" but is essentially intergovernmental. The two co-rapporteurs, Elmar Brok (EPP, DE) and Roberto Gualtieri (S&D, IT) have kept negotiating with the other institutions with a view to enabling Parliament to give a positive opinion on the issue.
"In the last few days our objectives have been achieved", said Elmar Brok at a committee meeting on Tuesday, adding "we made a contribution to ensure the Commission is involved". He emphasised that Parliament will also be involved in the process, as the Council and Commission will consult it regularly.
Co-rapporteur Roberto Gualtieri said: "Parliament will present an opinion that is well-balanced and covers the essentials", describing the future stability mechanism as an "intergovernmental wagon in an institutional train".
Key achievements
Parliament acknowledged the "positive signals" perceived in letters from the Presidents of the European Council and of the Euro Group as well as the Commissioner for monetary policy. In their letters, the two institutions note that the Commission will propose a regulation that will clarify the procedures under the mechanism and ensure consistency with the EU multilateral surveillance framework.
Furthermore, the role of the Commission is now clearly defined in the running operations of the mechanism, as requested by MEPs. The Commission will play a central role within the mechanism in assessing and analysing, as well as in making proposals and monitoring. Parliament will be regularly informed.
Reservation
While endorsing the European Council proposal on the Treaty change by 494 votes in favour, 100 against and 9 abstentions, Parliament reiterated that "it would have been preferable" to comply with the Union method, a point also stressed in the opinion of the European Central Bank.
Background
EU Member States leaders agreed at their December 2010 summit on a limited Treaty change to allow the establishment of a permanent mechanism to safeguard the stability of the euro zone. This "revision of Article 136" of the Treaty required consultation of Parliament, Commission and the European Central Bank.
Member States are expected to adopt the change formally at the Spring European Council of 24‚Äì25 March. Thereafter, the change still needs to be ratified by all 27 Member States. The target date for the stability mechanism's entry into force is 1 January 2013.

MEPs debate Japan disaster and nuclear fallout
(Speakers from top left):: Enik≈ë Gy≈ëri Council Member, G√ºnther Oettinger Commission, Elmar Brok EPP, Marita Ulvskog S&D, Lena Ek ALDE , Giles Chichester ECR, Rebecca Harms Greens, Bairbre de Br√∫n GUE/NGL, Fiorello Provera EFD. The Earthquake and tsunami in Japan caused thousands of deaths and a serious accident at the Fukushima power plant resulting in radioactive emissions. This catastrophe has raised questions about the security of power plants in Europe. Wednesday saw a debate on the Japan disaster and a resolution adopted Thursday (24 March) and the lessons for Europe. MEPs expressed their solidarity with the Japanese people.
All speakers expressed their condolences, solidarity and sympathy for the victims. They also paid tribute to those that had battled against the consequences of the earthquake - notably the nuclear crisis.
Marita Ulvskog (S&D, Sweden) also stressed that "the vulnerability of all societies could happen even here".
Enik≈ë Gy≈ëri (State Secretary for European Affairs in Hungary, for the Council) said that the nuclear accident had no consequences for EU citizens for the moment.
EU response to Japan and lesson for Europe
G√ºnther Oettinger (Europe's Energy Commissioner) said that humanitarian aid from 13 countries will be sent to Japan Thursday with Commissioner Georgieva coordinating it. He told the House Japan had not asked for nuclear expertise so far.
Mr Oettinger said that stress tests will be proposed in the EU to assess the resilience of the nuclear power plants.
Elmar Brok (EPP, Germany) said the stress tests should be done in a common way in Europe as "there are no borders in nuclear issues".
Some MEPs questioned the use of nuclear energy. Marita Ulvskog said: "We should have a long term view and reduce our dependence on nuclear energy. We are mortgaging our future".
Bairbre De Br√∫n (GUE/NGL) from Northern Ireland stressed that it's "important to move to a non-nuclear Europe".
German Green MEP Rebecca Harms noted that stress-tests were ok if their goal is to step down from this "high-risk technology". She gave several examples of malfunctions in European nuclear power plants.
Different groups called for a quiet and calm debate on the issues. Swedish Liberal Lena Ek said: "When we evaluate the consequences of the disaster we should base our discussion on information and knowledge. We have to reform our energy production to rely on safe and renewable energy and we have to do it now!"
Italian Fiorello Provera (EFD) told MEPs: "To forget would be a mistake. We should grab (the problem) in a scientific manner - we should be pragmatic".
British MEP Giles Chichester (ECR) asked for a comparison between the deaths in oil and hydroelectric energy sectors to the deaths in the nuclear arena.
***
A full debate on nuclear safety, including power plants in the EU, is expected to take place at the next plenary session, 4-7 April, in Strasbourg.

EP demands personal data protection in US WikiLeaks investigation
"EU data protection not applicable in criminal investigations" - Commissioner Reding On 23 March MEPs asked the Commission and the Council about the implications for EU citizens of a US court order obliging Twitter to hand over personal data, messages and communications of users considered to be related to WikiLeaks. What personal data protection rights do EU-based Twitter users have in such cases?
In January 2011, Twitter made public a subpoena (threat of legal punishment) from the US Department of Justice that asked for the handover of personal data of persons suspected of having a connection to WikiLeaks. Amongst them was an Icelandic MP and a Dutch citizen.
The subpoena was followed by a US court order issued to Twitter to reveal data such as the source and destination of e-mails and IP addresses. That could include the data of over 800,000 Twitter users who follow WikiLeaks.
A group of MEPs asked the Commission and Council to explain if this act could constitute a violation of European data protection laws, and if the US authorities have the jurisdiction to impose the lifting of EU citizen`s privacy rights.
Most speakers said US judicial procedures should be respected, but an update the European legal framework to ensure protection of European citizens is needed.
For the Hungarian EU Council Presidency, Enik≈ë Gy≈ëri said there is no evidence that US judicial action would have violated EU data protection laws. "It‚Äôs up to national authorities to ensure adequate data protection."
Commissioner for Justice Viviane Reding sees no legal breaches: "The Commission has no competence over how a third country applies its judicial procedure in investigating suspected criminal activities". "When European citizens use Twitter, they consent to Twitter's privacy policy...EU data protection legislation is not applicable in criminal investigations."
German Christian Democrat Axel Voss said "We are obliged to respect American law, but must upgrade data protection regulations and should fully clarify rules on transfers of personal data by updating transatlantic agreements on data protection."
British Labour MEP Claude Moraes warned that "EU citizens that are innocently accessing the internet could be targets" and "those who signed up to updates from WikiLeaks are ironically left vulnerable to the collection of their personal data". He called for "strong high-level EU legislation", extending protection measures to judicial and police co-operation.
Dutch Liberal Sophie in 't Veld explained, "The US court argues that once you use Twitter, you no longer have a legitimate expectation of privacy, and that means that EU citizens no longer have any legal protection, because Twitter is US-based". That is "a problem that must be addressed in the review of the data protection" directive, she said.

MEP to decide on crucial e-shopping directive on consumers rights
Cross-border shopping of increasing importance @Getty Image A two week period to say "no" when they receive a faulty product and wider payment choices were just two things in a consumer rights directive on e-commerce that was approved Thursday (24 March). The directive obligesl traders to tell people if they don't ship to certain EU countries. Parliament's rapportuer Andreas Schwab (EPP) believes that the directive will be of "significant importance" for the Europe's internal market.
The directive will mean that consumers will have a right to withdrawal from the purchase for 14 calendar days after the goods were delivered. If the trader fails to inform the consumer about the right to withdrawal - the withdrawal period will be prolonged to one year.
This right will be also valid for purchases in a digital format (i.e. a film). But the rights should only apply until the moment the consumer starts to download the content.
Ahead of the vote Mr Schwab noted that "cross-border online shopping has a significant importance for the Internal Market and is constantly growing".
He went on to say that "today, many online shops are not willing to sell to consumers from every EU country, which means that Internet transactions are often interrupted when it becomes apparent that the consumer resides outside a particular market."
Next steps
MEPs on the Internal Market Committee have endorsed the proposed legislation. There are some differences between the EP and the Council (on the scope of the directive - the Council wants it to be focused on off-premises contracts only, namely on-line and on the phone, while the EP wants a broader law).
Mr Schwab said that "Thursday's vote should be a good starting point for the negotiations with the Council which could and should start soon". He thinks that the final vote, allowing the directive to enter into law, could take place in May.
On-line shopping
In 2010 nearly 60% of consumers purchased goods or services on the internet.
8% of it was cross-border e-commerce.
.
51% of European retailers sell via the internet, but only 21% are currently conducting cross-border transactions.
Consumers from UK, Denmark, Germany and the Netherland are the most interested in e-commerce, the least interested are consumers from Bulgaria, Romania, Estonia, Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Portugal

Equal treatment for foreign workers under new EU single permit
EuroparlTV video Non EU-workers are set to enjoy the same rights regarding working conditions as EU nationals, under the proposed 'single permit' law directive adopted by Parliament on Thursday. This draft law seeks to simplify procedures for both migrants and their employers via a combined permit for residence and work.
The "single permit" directive, as amended by Parliament at first reading today by 311 votes to 216, with 81 abstentions, would cut red tape and simplify procedures for immigrants applying to live and work in an EU Member State.
National authorities of each country will still have the power to decide whether to admit non-EU workers and how many to admit. But now they will issue residence permits that include information on permission to work. To avoid confusion, they must issue no additional documents.
Who will be covered?
The new rules will apply to non-EU nationals seeking to reside and work in a Member State or who already reside legally in an EU country.
The rules will not apply to:
long-term residents and refugees, who are already covered by other EU rules;
seasonal workers and employees of multinational firms coming to work in their company's EU offices, who will be covered by other new EU directives;
In addition, the directive will not apply to migrant workers covered by the 'posted workers' directive. But for example, a Chinese citizen working for a Chinese company hired to build a road in Germany, and who is not covered by the 'posted workers' directive, would be granted the rights conferred by the 'single permit' rules. Foreign workers' rights would thus be protected in all circumstances.
This directive should not apply to foreign workers while posted, MEPs agree. This should not prevent immigrants who are legally resident and lawfully employed in an EU country and posted to another Member State from "continuing to enjoy equal treatment with respect to nationals of the Member State of origin for the duration of their posting", says an EP amendment by way of clarification.
Equal treatment with fewer restrictions
Non-EU workers will enjoy a set of rights comparable to those of EU citizens, such as pay, health and safety at work, working time, leave and access to social security.
Member States may decide to limit access to social security, except for individuals who are currently in employment or have worked for at least six months and are already registered as unemployed.
Member States may also decide to grant family benefits only to those who have been authorised to work for more than six months.
Non-EU workers would be able to claim tax benefits. However, their families could only receive these if they lived in the Member State of employment.
Non-EU workers would be able to receive their pensions when moving back to their home country under the same conditions and at the same rates as EU nationals.
Member States may decide that only workers who are in employment should have access to public services and goods, such as public housing.
The right to vocational training and education may be limited to non-EU workers who are in employment or who have been employed. Individuals living in the EU to study could thus be excluded, while workers who would like to get a qualification not directly linked to their jobs may be required to demonstrate language proficiency.
Next steps
The amendments adopted by MEPs will now be considered by the EU Justice and Home Affairs ministers. Under the Lisbon Treaty, Parliament and Council legislate on an equal footing on matters to do with legal immigration.
The UK and Ireland have opted out of this directive. Denmark is also not taking part.

Better protection for online shoppers
EuroparlTV New rules on consumer rights to protect online shoppers and boost consumer confidence in buying in other Member States were backed by Parliament on Thursday. MEPs approved changes to the draft law but decided to postpone their final position with a view to reaching an agreement with the Council.
MEPs' strong backing for Parliament's proposed changes to the law, led by rapporteur Andreas Schwab (EPP, DE), will be the basis on which MEPs will try to reach an agreement with Member States.
The new EU law should cover almost all sales, whether made in a shop, by phone, by post or online, says Parliament. It will update existing rules to take account of growth in internet sales and provide better protection for online shoppers.
The rules, as backed by Parliament today, would significantly strengthen consumer rights especially as regards information, delivery and withdrawal from contracts, whilst also clarifying rules on digital downloads and cutting red tape for small and medium-sized enterprises.
The right to make informed choices
It should be clear to consumers from whom they are buying, exactly what they are buying and how much it will cost when shopping online or ordering from a catalogue. The identity and address of the seller must always be clear, say MEPs.
The new information rights will also put an end to hidden charges, such as those associated with the "pre-ticked boxes" sometimes used in internet sales. In addition, the buyer will have to knowingly accept the total price before a sale is concluded.
Delivery and responsibility for the parcel
Delivery is where many consumers experience disappointment. Under the new rules, any good or service ordered at distance, must be delivered to the buyer within 30 days, otherwise the consumer will have the right to cancel the purchase. The trader is responsible for any damage or loss of the good during delivery.
14 days to change your mind
The new rules will stipulate a 14-day EU-wide withdrawal period for distance and off-premises sales (where the consumer cannot see the good before buying it) during which consumers may change their minds. If they regret the purchase, for whatever reason, they can send it back. Where the price of the good is more than ‚Ç¨40, the trader must pay the return postage. All expenses must be refunded to the consumer within 14 days after withdrawal. However, consumers must be able to prove that they have returned the good, states an amendment adopted by Parliament.
If the seller fails to inform the consumer about a withdrawal right, the period for withdrawal must automatically be extended, to three months, says the Council, or to one year, says Parliament.
The new rules also aim to close a gap in existing EU legislation, by extending the consumer's right of withdrawal to home party sales and on-line auctions. However, auction purchases may be returned only if they were bought from a professional seller, not from a private person.
Digital goods, such as music, films or software programmes, will be exempted from the right of withdrawal. The sale will be regarded as concluded from the moment downloading begins.
No extra red tape for small firms
To avoid creating administrative burdens for the local grocer or the workman doing home repairs, Parliament voted to exempt "day-to-day transactions", where the good is delivered "immediately", from the information rules. For "mixed contracts", involving both goods and services, such as a glazier replacing a broken window with a new pane, at a cost of less than ‚Ç¨200, the information need not be in writing, but can be delivered orally, says a Parliament amendment.
For urgent repairs, such as a burst water pipe, the 14-day right of withdrawal will be unnecessary and should not apply, Parliament says.

Goal of 2012 EU budget: to help revitalise Europe's economy
Francesca Balzani (S&D, Italy) is leading Parliament's work on next year's budget. Next year's EU budget should be one of the main tools for helping Europe's economy to recover after the crisis, by focusing on employment, economic governance and growth, say MEPs in a resolution setting out their recommendations to the Commission, which is currently preparing the EU's draft budget for next year.
The resolution, adopted on Thursday by show of hands, is Parliament's way of sending an early signal to the Commission about MEPs' wishes and priorities for next year's budget.
"Today's resolution is above all a strategic document looking at the new role that the European budget must play in the context of greater economic governance... The budgets of the Member States should be brought into line with the major goals of the European budget. And the major European objectives can only be those laid down in the Europe 2020 strategy", said Francesca Balzani (S&D, IT), who is leading Parliament's work on next year's budget.
The 2012 budget should focus on the five targets of the EU 2020 strategy: employment, innovation, research and development, climate change and energy, education and social inclusion, says the resolution. MEPs therefore oppose any attempt to limit or cut budget funds linked to delivery of the Europe 2020 strategy's headline targets.
Parliament also stresses that the ongoing European Semester must be used, as intended, to improve the coordination, consistency and synergies between European and national public investments, so as to achieve the EU‚Äôs overall policy objectives more effectively.
Support for north African countries
Parliament warns that the Council's wish to underfund parts of the budget, especially those for cohesion, citizenship and foreign affairs, could put existing measures at risk, if unforeseen events such as those in several north African countries, or new political priorities, arise. The EU has a key role to play in supporting Arab countries at this historic point of their democratic development, say MEPs.
Increased payments to be expected
The EU budget is to a large extent an investment budget, including projects running over several years, such as research and infrastructure programmes. 2012 is the sixth year of the current financial perspective (2007-2013) and projects have now reached cruising speed. This requires higher levels of payments as the real work is now being done, so MEPs believe an increase in payments in 2012 is "foreseeable". Budgets Commissioner Janusz Lewandowski also announced recently that he expects payments to increase by ‚Ç¨6 billion to ‚Ç¨7 billion in 2012 as compared to this year.
The payments (money actually paid out) are a direct consequence of commitments (funding that is promised) and often appear with a time-lag compared to the commitments. Since all legal commitments have to be fulfilled, the most important political decisions are taken when the commitments are established. Traditionally, MEPs rely on the Commission, as the competent institution, to calculate the level of payments, while they themselves are deeply involved in the discussions on commitments.
The Commission is set to present its formal proposal for the 2012 budget on 20 April. The budget of Parliament and the other EU institutions, except the Commission, was dealt with in a separate report, by Jos√© Manuel Fernandes (EPP, PT), adopted on 9 March.
