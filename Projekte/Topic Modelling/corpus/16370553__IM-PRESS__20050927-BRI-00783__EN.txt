This was followed by a debate on Europe's Autumn Agenda.
Parliament postponed approval of the Protocol extending Turkey's customs union with the EU to all its new Members.

Parliament debates Europe's Autumn agenda
2005-10-03 - 17:48
Welcoming the Bulgarian and Romanian observers to the European Parliament, President Josep BORRELL gave his views on the state of the European Union, including the challenges of ratifying the Constitution and managing a Europe of 27 Member States. This was followed by the political group leaders setting out their positions.
President Josep BORRELL welcomed the new observers from Bulgaria and Romania. Their presence, he said, was a reminder that the 5th enlargement of the EU in May last year had been incomplete. Parliament had already given its assent to the accession of both countries: " We all expect them to accede as planned on 1 January 2007. We and they will all work to make that a reality ."
He said this was a difficult moment for the EU - while its institutions were functioning normally in terms of day to day business, " There is a crisis of identity in the European integration project ," he said. " Some say we just need to improve the functioning of our markets and continue enlarging, but the problem is much more profound. The political spirit and the geographical dimension are obstructed - this Parliament must contribute to getting out of the impasse ."
Looking back to the goals set out in his speech one year earlier, President Borrell pointed out that Parliament had met the challenge of working with colleagues from 25 political cultures and in 20 languages. He recalled the agreement on the MEPs' statute, finally reached under the Luxembourg presidency, resolving a situation which had undermined Parliament's public image for many years. The regulation on parliamentary assistance and reform of the EU's Financial Regulation remained to be achieved. In the case of the latter, he hoped new more efficient financial procedures could be in place by January 2007.
" The investiture of the Commission was a turbulent session, but Parliament emerged more mature, more credible and more visible to the public ." Relations with the new Commission had been set on a strong footing by the new framework agreement between the two institutions. An example would be the presence of Jos√© Manuel BARROSO at this week's Conference of Presidents meeting.
" Last year, our proceedings were thrown into gloom by news of hostage taking. Terrorist barbarism continues now, in London in July and daily in Iraq. The threat of terrorism puts our societies to the test of facing up to it in full respect of our democratic values ," he said. He also called for Europe to combat terrorism in alliance with its neighbours in the Islamic world, something which could be supported through the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, which the EP currently chairs, while avoiding Islamophobia, which would be a victory for the terrorists.
On the Financial Perspective, Mr Borrell pointed out that agreement within the Council was a necessary condition for adopting a financial framework for 2007-13, but not a sufficient one. " There is no point in the Council agreeing something which cannot be taken on board by
Parliament. I urge the Council to reach agreement during the UK presidency - afterwards it will become much more difficult ." If no agreement was reached before work had to begin on the 2007 budget, Parliament would meet its responsibilities under the treaty to ensure there would be a proper budget in place for 2007.
Turning to the Constitution, the EP President said the "period of reflection " had not been intended to be just a pause. While there was no legal vacuum at present, the problems the constitution had been intended to solve were still there. " We need a properly designed constitution that lets our institutions work efficiently ," he said. " There is no plan 'B', but there is a plan 'D' - for democracy and debate, the essence of a parliament ." He called for Heads of State or Government with " significant " results in the ratification process to come to Parliament.
Looking at the legislative work ahead, he said this was an opportunity to show the EU's " added value " on topics such as REACH, services, air safety, railways, security and justice and Turkey. "The European Parliament is indispensable in striking the balance between freedom and security in combating terrorism ."
Regarding the quality and relevance of European legislation, he noted that " better regulation " was nothing new - each successive Commission entered office promising to simplify the acquis communautaire . "When it comes to withdrawing legislative proposals, the Commission has an obligation to inform Parliament, in a substantial way, not just as a formality ." On the substance, there were no doubt many opportunities to simplify legislation, evaluate its impact and improve its transposition into national law.
The EP President said the October summit in the UK would be a chance to discuss the European Social Model - a debate which really concerned how Europe should respond to the challenges of economic globalisation.
He concluded with a quote from Alexis de Tocqueville: " Nations, like men, only reach a greater destiny through dialogue and debate ."
Political group speakers
EPP-ED group leader Hans-Gert POETTERING (DE) welcomed the Bulgarian and Romanian observers, before turning to the issue of Europe's " crisis of identity ." This could only be resolved if we were able to bring our values, held in common across the political spectrum, into constitutional law. The " no " votes in France and the Netherlands should not be the last word, he said. Parliament should request Heads of State or Government to come to the chamber to set out their view on the way forward. While he agreed with the Commission's aim of better legislation, he asked the Commission to properly respect the consultation of Parliament on these issues. He also called for a full role for Parliament in creating legislation aimed at combating terrorism.
Martin SCHULZ (DE), leader of the Socialist Group gave his welcome to the new observers, before strongly calling for the Commission to announce its plans to Parliament, not through the press. " The EP has a right to know ," he said. He criticised the Commission President Barroso for telling the press there was no point concentrating on the Constitution, when " it is his job to defend and fight for the Constitution. What message does this send to those who have ratified or are doing so?" He also attacked the Commission for not " raising an outc ry" at the failure of the Council to reach a proper agreement on the Financial Perspective.
For the ALDE group, their leader Graham WATSON (UK) added another welcome for the observers. Europe, he said, was in the doldrums, and it was time to challenge the Member States to drive things forward. " Will Germany reform? Will Italy reign in its deficit? Will the UK back its fine words with action? Will Paris and The Hague give a lead to their peoples ?" He too criticised the Commission for not respecting Parliament's rights regarding withdrawal of legislation, telling Commission Vice-President Margot Wallstrom, " Our involvement is your accountability, our approval is your legitimacy ." He directly called for the French President and Dutch Prime Minister to come to the Chamber and say how they planned to move forward on the Constitution. " Let us not be too quick to read the burial rites ," he said.
Daniel COHN-BENDIT (DE) for the Greens/EFA group welcomed the Bulgarian and Romanian observers and stated that they had arrived at a " bizarre " time in EU history. He criticised the UK presidency of the Council as " presiding over nothing" and not making enough progress. As to the Commission withdrawing proposals, Mr Cohn-Bendit said that the Parliament was not yet fully aware of which proposals the Commission wished to withdraw and was therefore too early to judge. Nevertheless, he criticised the proposal from Commissioner REDING on the introduction of " euro TV " and said that such a proposal would never get a majority in the Parliament.
Francis WURTZ (FR) for the GUE/NGL group also welcomed the Bulgarian and Romanian observers stating that " Europe has to take up its responsibilities as Europe was facing a crisis of identity ". Europe needed to adapt to the challenges from globalisation and the European Parliament would be judged on how it legislated on issues including the services directive, the directive on port services, the working time directive and the position it takes on WTO negotiations.
Nigel FARAGE (UK) for the IND/DEM group was another speaker to welcome the new observers but stated that they would be joining a club where generous daily allowances are allocated, and where dinners and breakfasts would be offered. The observers, he said, would then be asked to go back to their respective countries to tell their constituents " how well everything is ". Mr Farage stated that the Commission was treating Dutch and French voters with " contempt " with their wish to push the Constitution forward. He also criticised the monthly trip to Strasbourg as ‚Ç¨200 million wasted. He called for the Romanian and Bulgarian people to have a say on accession through a referendum.
Brian CROWLEY (IE) for the UEN group also welcomed the observers, but stated that the EU had recognised the problems but had not offered the rights solutions. People often saw Europe as distant, unrepresentative, interfering, burdensome and sometimes uncaring. It was right that the Commission was in the process of examining the quantity of proposed legislation, and advocated codification to reduce the overall number of directives on the statute books. On the financial perspective, Mr Crowley said that it was mistake to link the reform of the CAP with an overall agreement.
Jean-Marie LE PEN (NI, FR) welcomed the Bulgarian and Romanian observers as they would give the French language a boost following previous enlargements. Mr Le Pen welcomed Mr Barroso's recent statements on the Constitution as well as the decision to withdraw a number of proposals. As to the financial perspective 2007-2013, he stated that the French-British debate should not spoil what the countries of Central and Eastern Europe expected from the EU. He strongly criticised the services directive as well as the impending decision to open negotiations with Turkey.
In her response to the debate, the Vice-President of the Commission Margot WALLSTROM formally welcomed the Romanian and Bulgarian observers. She expressed the Commission's solidarity to those who had suffered because of the recent flooding in these two countries. Commissioner Wallstrom pointed out that the Commission still strongly supported the Constitution and it had played an active role in the Convention and pushing the Constitution forward. Mrs Wallstrom said also that the Constitution would not be ratified by all 25 Member States in the " foreseeable future " given the French and Dutch rejections. She welcomed the Council's decision to engage in a " period of reflection ". There was no plan B but the Commission had come up with plan D for democracy, dialogue and debate. The Commission would work with the Parliament to establish concrete proposals on how to better engage with citizens in the Member States. The best way to convince European of the value of Europe, she said, was to make Europe relevant. Europe's objectives of more and better jobs and sustainable development were still very relevant, she said.
As to the question of better regulation, Mrs Wallstrom said that Commissioner VERHEUGEN had informed the Parliament on this issue at least ten times. The Commission would take a three pillar approach, namely screening proposed legislation, simplification and upgrading existing methods of examining the need for the legislation including improved impact assessments. The Commission would put forward a list, expected to be about one-third of the Commission's 183 pending proposals, and the full proposal would be presented to the European Parliament

Parliament postpones vote on Protocol to Ankara Agreement
2005-10-03 - 17:48
Parliament postponed voting on approval of the Protocol extending Turkey's Association Agreement with the EU to the ten new Member States. MEPs feared that the Turkish declaration that the protocol does not mean any form of recognition of Cyprus would form part of the ratification process in the Turkish Parliament and thus gain legal force.
Nevertheless, in a political resolution voted afterwards, Parliament noted "the Commission and the Council take the view that Turkey has formally fulfilled the last conditions for starting the accession negotiations on 3 October 2005."
At the request of the EPP-ED group, Parliament voted 311 votes in favour, 285 against and 63 abstentions to postpone the vote on Parliament's approval of the protocol extending Turkey's customs union with the EU to all its new members, including Cyprus. The vote to postpone has no legal consequences in terms of the starting date for accession negotiations. Stumbling blocks were the Turkish declaration that the signing of the protocol to the Ankara Agreement does not mean any form of recognition of Cyprus and the Turkish refusal to admit vessels and airplanes from Cyprus. A majority of MEPs first wanted guarantees from the Turkish authorities that the declaration was not going to be part of the ratification in the Turkish parliament, fearing that it would then have legal implications.
Nevertheless, in a political resolution adopted afterwards by 356 votes in favour, 181 against and 125 abstentions, Parliament noted the Commission's and Council's view that accession negotiations with Turkey can start on 3 October. But by the end of 2006, the Commission must assess if Turkey has fully implemented the protocol. If not, this could lead to halting the accession negotiations. During the negotiations, which are open-ended and will not automatically lead to Turkish EU membership, Turkey should be kept under permanent scrutiny and pressure to ensure that it maintains " the pace of the necessary reforms ".
Parliament also said it considered Turkish recognition of " the Armenian genocide ... to be a prerequisite for accession ".
MEPs deplore that the Annan plan for a settlement of the Cyprus question has been rejected by the Greek Cypriot community and hopes that Turkey will maintain its constructive attitude in finding an equitable solution. Meanwhile, the Council should keep its promise and reach an agreement on the financial aid and trade package for northern Cyprus.
On other issues, MEPs voiced their concern about the criminal proceedings against Turkish author Orhan Pamuk, about article 305 of the penal code which criminalises "acts against the fundamental national interest", about the restrictions on foreign funding for associations, and about the "Law on Foundations" concerning religious communities.
Parliament wants each negotiation session at ministerial level to be preceded by an assessment of the fulfilment of the political criteria, both in theory and in practice, "thus exerting permanent pressure on the Turkish authorities to maintain the pace of the necessary reforms". Also, a full programme of clear targets, timeframe and deadlines should be fixed for the fulfilment of the political criteria. The Commission and the Council should report annually to the European Parliament and the national parliaments on the progress made by Turkey in this respect. MEPs reiterate that the accession negotiations are an open-ended process and will not automatically lead to Turkey joining the EU, even if the objective is Turkish EU membership. Finally, Parliament underlines that the EU's capacity to absorb Turkey is an important consideration as well, and needs to be monitored by the Commission during the negotiations.
Debate on opening of accession negotiations with Turkey
Speaking on behalf of the Council, Britain's Minister for Europe, Douglas ALEXANDER said the strategic case for opening negotiations with Turkey was convincing, but it was necessary to be scrupulous in ensuring all the requirements were met before Turkey could join.
Turkey had met the two conditions laid down by the Council in December, and its declaration stating that it had not recognised the government of Cyprus had no legal effect. The negotiations would be the most rigorous yet, and Turkey would not accede imminently. The Turkey which would join would be a different Turkey, and the EU might also be different by then too. Progress so far had been encouraging, and the conditions for opening talks had been met, he said.
Enlargement Commissioner Oli REHN agreed that the formal conditions set out by the Council for opening negotiations had been met. He also stressed that the talks would be the most rigorous yet undertaken. There were good signs - such as the Turkish government's recognition that there was a Kurdish issue and that the conference on the Armenian question would finally go ahead - but also bad signs - such as the uneven implementation of freedom of expression rights. " Both Europeans and Turks should work to build a relationship based on mutual trust , " he said, pointing out that the common goal would be accession but that by their very nature the talks were open as to the result they would achieve.
British Speakers during the debate
Roger KNAPMAN (IND/DEM,UK) said that he opposed political union with Turkey as much as he opposed it with France, Germany or Italy. " But what of the euro-fanatics whose ardour suddenly cools when they reach the Bosphorus? It is not hypocrisy, but fear, fear that public support for the whole EU project will collapse if Turkish membership were seriously pursued ." For this reason, he said, he was happy to see the EU plough ahead with negotiations, destroying itself in the process.
Andrew DUFF (ALDE, UK) said " It is extraordinary that those who have profited so much from EU integration in terms of prosperity, security and liberal democracy should not refuse to extend these prizes to Turkey ." He said the EU's absorption capacity was a real issue, with the need for a settlement of the constitution ahead of Turkish or Croatian entry. He also argued that the Cyprus issue and instability in the Balkans could not be resolved if the EU refuses membership to Turkey, and called for a stepping up of trade relations with northern Cyprus.
Roger HELMER (NI, UK) said there were powerful reasons in favour and against Turkey's accession to the EU. The key condition, he said, should be " democratic accountability ", Mr Helmer felt that Turkey's accession would " dilute the influence " of his constituents in terms of self-determination and he therefore opposed Turkish membership of the EU. Mr Helmer welcomed the proposal from Angela Merkel on privileged partnership for Turkey as it would incur fewer costs for Turkey. Mr Helmer wished the option of privileged partnership could also be made available to the United Kingdom.
Geoffrey Van ORDEN (EPP-ED, UK) stated that " last Christmas the Council voted for Turkey ". The conditions laid out at that time had been met and Turkey was therefore ready to start negotiations. Mr Van Orden warned against the separatist dissidents still at large in Turkey that risked undermining Turkish secularism and unity. He stated that Turkey should be treated in the same way as all other candidates for accession. Mr Van Orden stated that the Cyprus question should be treated separately from the accession negotiations. However, he recalled that the people of Northern Cyprus had voted in favour of the Annan plan on reunification and that Greek Cyprus had rejected. He said the EU had done little to support Northern Cyprus. Mr Van Orden welcomed the imminent opening of negotiations and recognised that the talks would last many years.

Minimum EU standards for granting refugee status
2005-10-03 - 17:48
The European Parliament called for stricter minimum standards in the EU Member States for granting or refusing refugee status. MEPs adopted over a hundred amendments to a Commission draft directive with the aim of anchoring refugees' rights more firmly and they stressed that the directive must respect the Geneva Convention at all stages. The final vote was very tight (305 in favour, 302 against and 33 abstentions) due to the opposition of the EPP-ED and UEN groups on some key amendments.
The main point at issue between the Parliament and the Council (whose position is already known as it has been agreed by national governments) is the concept of "super safe countries", by which EU states would be allowed to draw up a list of third countries which are deemed definitely safe so they can deny refugee status to all applicants from these countries. MEPs rejected this provision saying it is unfair to citizens of those countries as it does not require an individual assessment and goes against the Geneva Convention's non-refoulement principle (by which governments may not turn refugees away without hearing their case). The EPP-ED and UEN groups were the only ones to support this initiative.
Another proposal disliked by MEPs was the idea of allowing each Member State to create a national list of "safe third countries" to which it can send back a refugee if his/her country of origin is on the list and is willing to take the individual back. MEPs amended this proposal to give applicants the right to "rebut the presumption of safety". Any assessment of how serious the risk of living in the country of origin is and whether a person deserves refugee status should always be conducted on an individual basis, rather than on a general presumption concerning the country in question, say MEPs. In addition, there should be only one common EU list of "safe third countries", which could be revised by the European Parliament and the Council if necessary
Reception centres
Regarding the detention of immigrants and asylum seekers in reception centres such as one set up by the Italian government in Lampedusa (Italy), MEPs state that ‚Äúin principle, Member States shall not hold asylum seekers in a closed reception centre. Alternatives to detention and non-custodial measures must always be considered before‚Äù. Detentions should only be carried ‚Äúif it is necessary, lawful and justified‚Äù, in facilities clearly separated from prisons. The amendment which limited these detentions to a maximum period of 6 months was rejected by 333 votes in favour, 337 against and 3 abstentions.
Finally, in further amendments, MEPs say the rights of potential refugees must be fully respected at all stages of the application procedure. They must have the right to appeal if refused, and must always be allowed to stay in the Member State until the appeal procedure ends. Applicants should also be entitled to request a personal interview with the authorities, to be legally represented and to receive full information about the procedure in a language they understand. Cases of "inadmissible applications" can be evaluated by a Member State only in accordance with the Geneva Convention. When dealing with refugees, the rights of children under 18 - even if married - must always take priority.
As this legislation comes under the consultation procedure, Parliament's amendments are not binding on the Council. However, once this legislation is adopted Parliament will have co-decision powers with the Council on refugee and asylum measures. A6-0222/2005 Report by Wolfgang KREISSL- D√ñRFLER (PES, DE)

EP rejects initiative on data retention
2005-10-03 - 17:48
Parliament rejected a plan to retain data on the traffic of calls, short message services and e-mails processed by telecommunication providers to investigate and prosecute terrorists. MEPs feel the proposal from the UK, France, Ireland and Sweden to keep data about who is contacting whom and from where, for up to three years, is a threat to citizens' privacy.
MEPs want the rules to be proportional to any threat and for the Parliament to have an equal say with national government in this area.
MEPs welcomed instead an alternative proposal on data retention launched by the Commission last week, in which the Parliament will have codecision power to ensure that MEPs' demands are respected.

Parliament adopts Basel II directives
2005-10-03 - 17:48
The European Parliament has given a first reading to two directives aiming to update EU rules on capital requirements for banks and credit institutions, in line with the Basel II agreement. In approving a report from Alexander Radwan (EPP-ED, DE), MEPs adopted hundreds of amendments to the Commission's draft directive. These were the results of discussions with the Commission and Council - the new directives should now enter force at this first reading stage.
The overall aim is to create a more sophisticated and risk sensitive approach to capital requirements used by banking regulators, better reflecting the complexity and diversity of today's financial markets. This should ensure a better regulatory underpinning for the stability of the financial system and a more efficient use of capital. During Monday's debate in plenary, Commissioner Charlie McCREEVY told MEPs " A recent study estimated that banks would have reduced capital requirements of about ‚Ç¨80 to 120 billion as a result of the proposed directive. It is also said that this directive will reduce the capital requirements for loans to SMEs by more than 50%. This Parliament has tabled amendments to our proposals that improve the rules for retail and SME lending still further ."
Changes made by Parliament make clear that Member States may apply capital requirements on a solo and consolidated basis and allow , under certain conditions , zero risk weighting for internal group lending to be extended to banks operating in an institutional protection scheme. Banks will have to explain their rating decisions to SMEs and other corporate applicants for loans - an amendment adopted by Parliament says that if voluntary agreements do not achieve this, national measures should be adopted.
A series of amendments tabled in plenary made it possible also to incorporate revised rules dealing with capital requirements for banks' trading-related activities.
The issue of " comitology " - the system which grants the Commission authority to decide on the detailed implementation of an EU law - had threatened to delay the final adoption of this legislation. The proposed constitution would have given Parliament an explicit right to revoke such implementing decisions, but with the prospects for the constitution in doubt, MEPs want to ensure this right is enshrined in an inter-institutional agreement. As far as these directives are concerned, a last minute compromise between Commission, Council and Parliament means the old comitology system - which largely excludes Parliament - can be used to implement and update the directives for a maximum of two years or until 1 April 2008 at the latest, after which these powers could be renewed only with the agreement of the three institutions . In the meantime they will review the system used for such implementing provisions. A6-0257/2005 Report by Alexander Radwan (EPP/ED, DE) on

No to compulsory auditing committees
2005-10-03 - 17:48
European auditors and audit firms will be required to prove their independence from the management of the audited company. MEPs backed on Wednesday the Commission's proposal to broaden current EU auditing legislation by setting up a system for public oversight and by enhancing cooperation between Member States' authorities. The new legislative text also requires the application of the International Auditing Standards (IAS) in European auditing.
By approving the first-reading report by Bert DOORN ( EPP-ED, NL), Parliament sought to increase auditing quality and regain public trust in the auditing profession, in response to past financial scandals. MEPs adopted a more flexible approach than the Commission and gave Member States more room to adapt the directive to their national standards. During the debate on Monday, Mr Doorn said: "Corporate governance should be negotiated in the Member States and there is no need for a single EU rule ".
Particularly, the Parliament criticised the Commission proposal that all publicly listed companies must have a separate audit committee to supervise financial reporting procedures. MEPs claimed the provision could charge companies with excessive financial and administrative burden. The approved amendments give Member States the possibility to determine the way in which firms are to supervise their internal audit reporting.
Another controversial issue was the obligation for a public interest company to change auditors every five years and audit firm every seven, the so-called rotation. The approved amendment requires rotation, every seven years, only for key audit partner/statutory auditor, and not for the audit firms. The compulsory rotation of audit firms was criticised by the rapporteur as not necessary.
Finally, a compromise was reached on the issue of auditors' liability. The approved text asks the Commission to present an impact study on current national liability rules and an analysis on the possible limitations of the financial liability in the auditing profession.
The approved text was the result of informal negotiations between the rapporteur, the Commission and the Council in the view of a first reading adoption. Member States will have two years to implement the provisions, after the entry into force of the directive. A6-0224/2005 Report by Bert Doorn (EPP-ED, NL)

Energy
Time for action on energy efficiency and supply diversity
2005-10-03 - 17:48
MEPs are calling for Europe to diversify its energy sources and to promote energy conservation and renewable energy, given the continuous increase in the price of oil and its effects on both businesses and the public. They want the EU to be the least fossil-fuel dependent and most energy-efficient economy in the world by 2020.
This call comes in a resolution adopted on Thursday which also says energy saving and efficiency and the use of alternative energy sources needs to be tackled on global basis, both with high energy consumers like the USA and China and with developing countries, by integrating sustainable energy provision into the EU's development cooperation policy. Dialogue, say MEPs, is needed with all European energy partners to promote security of supply, market transparency and further investment.
Parliament says the most logical response to higher oil prices is to switch to alternative energy sources. It strongly endorses the need to promote research and development and use of renewable energies to help achieve a less fossil-fuel dependent economy.
MEPs recognise that high fuel costs for consumers are partly the result of taxation, but they support the view of EU Finance Ministers that changes in taxes that might cause distortion and prevent the necessary adjustments should be avoided. They call for proposals from the Commission on how windfall profits in the oil industry could be used to fund energy saving programmes and related R&D.
Parliament says that fully implementing existing and forthcoming legislation could achieve energy savings of 23 per cent should be achieved by 2020. Since the transport sector accounts for 70 per cent of total EU oil consumption, MEPs call on the Commission to come up with measures, amongst others, to encourage more fuel efficient engines and conversion to alternative propulsion technologies. They also want to encourage production of raw material for biofuels, as well as the development of hydrogen fuel cells.
MEPs therefore call for the Commission to bring forward the European Action Plan on energy efficiency, increase pressure for full implementation of the Buildings Directive, push for agreement on the Energy Services Directive, improve collection and aggregation of information on oil markets, press Member States to fulfil their renewable energy targets, put forward proposals for car manufacturers to develop cleaner vehicles, work towards greater use of environmentally-friendly coal-based energy and counter the risk of social exclusion resulting from higher oil prices.
Background: Oil prices have risen 44% in the last year, with reasons including rapid economic growth in China, instability in Iraq and too few oil refineries. Hurricanes "Katrina" and "Rita" have made the situation worse. OPEC, the oil exporter's cartel, has responded by increasing output from 30 to 32 million barrels a day - but just for three months.

MEPs ask for mandatory EU target for renewable energies
2005-10-03 - 17:48
The European Parliament adopted a report by Claude TURMES (Greens/EFA, LU) which outlines a strategic overview on where renewable policies stand in Europe and proposes concrete actions to increase the share of renewable energy in the EU.
MEPs recognise the potential of a wide diversity of 21 different renewable energy technologies and point out that the EU is a world leader in most renewable energy technologies. Nevertheless, new EU-wide initiatives and directives are necessary, according to the MEPs.
MEPs recall that, last year, the European Parliament called for a 20 % target for renewable energies in overall energy consumption in the EU by 2020. They point out that new studies show that a more ambitious target is feasible. The Commission is asked to draw up an EU medium-term renewable energy strategy for the period after 2010. Mandatory targets should be set, but the EU target should be broken down into both sector and national targets, say MEPs.
Renewable energies, MEPs emphasise, along with energy efficiency and conservation, not only help to overcome health and environmental degradation, ensure sustainable development but also they contribute to innovation and to regional as well as national development, fair trade and create jobs in line with the Lisbon strategy. Parliament calls for tax cuts as incentives for promoting renewable energies as well as for fair and free access to the grid and non-discriminatory tariffs, which currently prevent the development of renewable sources of electricity in several Member States.
Furthermore, MEPs call on the Commission to come up with new legislative initiatives in order to put an end to huge market distortions which penalise renewable energy production. Market distortions include: insufficient ownership, unbundling requirements, ineffective wholesale markets, increased market concentration and direct and indirect subsidies.
MEPs also adopted a number of proposals concerning the use of biomass which they consider to have many advantages compared to conventional energy sources and compared to some other renewable energy sources. The Commission and Member States are asked to use the structural and cohesion funds to promote the use of biomass. Member States should also examine their tax systems and abolish all unnecessary tax burdens for users of biomass.
In order to finance concrete actions, MEPs suggested that the upcoming 7th framework program for research, technological development and health (FP7) must include increased funding for renewable sources of energy and energy efficiency.
Last but not least, MEPs want the European Institutions to become flagships for renewable energies. They should set positive and visible examples to European citizens by the use of renewable energies in their own buildings and modes of transportation. Parliament's Bureau is asked to develop a long-term commitment to the gradual phasing in of renewable energies in the electricity, heating, cooling and transportation needs of the Parliament and to combine this effort with measures to increase energy efficiency in the operation of the European Parliament.

Transport
Community railways
2005-10-03 - 17:48
MEPs are pushing for compensation for train travellers, but gave a thumbs down to fines for delayed goods deliveries. They want cash refunds for delayed national and international passengers, but feel fines for the freight sector would increase costs and distort competition. Instead, easier access for new companies would provide a boost, they said. To facilitate mobility in the sector, they also want a European licence for train drivers.
More competition on international AND national railway networks
Parliament gave the green light to more competition on international and national railway networks. MEPs demanded that international passenger services be opened up to competition by 1 January 2008 and national passenger services by 1 January 2012. The Commission had proposed 2010 for international services only. More competition on railway networks in order to improve services is a long-standing demand of a majority in the House. The report on more competition in railway services had been tabled by Georg JARZEMBOWSKI (EPP-ED, DE ) had argued that compensation should not only apply to international rail passengers, as the Commission had proposed, but also to national ones. Parliament adopted an amendment proposing the following minimum compensation to be paid to passengers for delays:
- 25% of the fare for a delay of 60 minutes or more;
- 50% for a delay of 120 minutes or more and
- 75% for a delay of 180 minutes or more.
This compensation should be paid no later than one month after the application has been made. MEPs also called for passengers who hold a season ticket and encounter repeated delays or cancellations to receive compensation in the form of free journeys, price reductions or an extension of the period of validity of a season ticket. In adopting a range of amendments, Parliament took the view that the right of persons with a reduced mobility should be fundamentally guaranteed. Therefore railway operators must guarantee accessibility of stations, platforms and means of transport by eliminating all obstacles to boarding, disembarkation and remaining on board.
Certificates for train crews
A less controversial part of the third railway package was the report by Gilles SAVARY (PES, FR) on a system of certificates for train drivers and other onboard crews and their harmonisation at Community level in order to meet professional, medical and linguistic standards. This report was adopted with an overwhelming majority.
Rail freight compensation system rejected
Finally, Parliament rejected the Commission's proposal for a regulation for rail freight compensation. Adopting the report drafted by Roberts ZILE (UEN, LV), MEPs said that a compensation system would not improve standards in the industry. They also argued that existing international legislation was already imposing strict enough rules on rail transport. Rather than imposing more regulations and fines, the emphasis should be on easier market access for new rail companies so as to increase competitiveness.
The Council of Transport Ministers will now consider the amended third railway package and come forward with a common position. Text adopted at September II plenary

Halving the number of road accidents by 2010
2005-10-03 - 17:48
Parliament expressed its deep concern on the low levels of road safety in some Member States, especially in many of the ten new Member States. In adopting the report by Ari VATANEN (EPP-ED, FR) with 453 votes in favour, 69 against with 14 abstentions, MEPs set out many recommendations aiming at one crucial target: halving the number of road accidents in the EU by 2010.
At present, more than 40,000 deaths are caused by road accidents in the EU, and, in addition to the unacceptable human suffering, there are the related direct and indirect costs, estimated at ‚Ç¨180 billion or 2% of the EU's GNP. Consequently, MEPs felt that the time was ripe for a far-reaching European Road Safety Action Programme.
Parliament is particularly worried about the safety of vulnerable road users, including young people, for whom the death rate is particularly high. The risk of death in motorcycle or moped travel was 17 times higher than in car travel and walking or cycling on EU roads was up to nine times riskier. MEPs, however, pointed out that only enforcing compliance with existing road traffic rules would dramatically improve road safety.
Given the fact that cross-border enforcement of road traffic laws remains very unsatisfactory owing to the lack of any uniform system by which national authorities were able to prosecute offenders from other Member States, the Commission was urged to outline a proposal for a workable Community-wide approach to enable Member states to follow up offences and penalties imposed.
MEPs also demanded a better harmonisation of road signs across Europe. They urged the Commission to investigate the problem of the over-abundance of road signs. Parliament also regrets that the common emergency number " 112 " is not known to all EU citizens. The Commission is therefore called on to evaluate current awareness of the single European emergency call number on the part of the European public and the quality of the services provided to citizens in distress via this number.
Finally, MEPs took the view that out of the huge selection of technologies should receive particular attention: seat belt reminders and advanced systems; electronic stability control, speed limitation systems, alcolocks and eCall (emergency calls). Other important issues in the Vatanen report include the promoting of the use of cost efficiency analyses and the strengthening of the European Road Safety Charter.

US-EU Wine Agreement not to MEPs' taste
2005-10-03 - 17:48
On 15 September, the European Union and the United States reached a first phase agreement on trade in wine, which will protect EU wine designations and secure access to the crucial American market for European wines.
Addressing MEPs in plenary, Agriculture Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel welcomed the agreement, saying it " may facilitate a non-polemical and substantial dialogue with the members of the New World Wine Group ." The Parliament, however, passed a resolution critical of the accord's many shortcomings.
Under the accord, EU wine exports will be exempted from the new US certification requirements adopted in 2004. In addition, the US administration agreed to press Congress to change the status of 17 EU wine designations (such as Burgundy, Champagne, Chianti, Sherry and Tokay) currently considered " semi-generic " terms, and limit their use in the US. Once this legal protection is in place, the EU has pledged to recognise American wine-making practices.
Furthermore, both sides agreed to start second-phase negotiations 90 days after the date of entry into force of the agreement, covering the use of names of origin, geographical indications, traditional expressions and the creation of a joint committee on wine issues. The two sides also agreed to settle future disputes in a bilateral framework, instead of taking disagreements to the WTO.
Parliament's resolution insists that the agreement constitutes only an " initial, insufficient and inadequate step towards international recognition of the EU's protected traditional names ." The resolution (proposed jointly by the EPP-ED, PES, ALDE, Greens/ALE, UEN and GUE/NGL groups) expresses MEPs' worries that traditional models of wine production could be endangered by the agreement, and that the EU's position in agricultural negotiations of the WTO could also be negatively affected.
It calls on the Commission to sign a final compromise within the next two years, guaranteeing the protection of EU wine designations in the US. Parliament also requested that the Commission continue international negotiations to establish a binding definition of wine and a register of internationally recognized geographical indications.

European Parliament wants a strong UN
2005-10-03 - 17:48
In adopting a joint resolution on the reform of the UN, MEPs reaffirmed their commitment to a strong UN, reiterating that genuine multilateralism is the most appropriate tool for solving the challenges, problems and threats faced by the international community.
Parliament hopes that the Summit outcome will be an important milestone towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 and the necessary reform which must be completed successfully in order to ensure that the UN continues to play a leading role in today's international system. Parliament takes note of the commitments stated in the Outcome Document and considers this document to be the working basis for further improvements by the 60th General Assembly of the UN in the various areas at stake.
MEPs deeply regret that the Summit has not issued a further appeal to those donor countries which have not yet formally committed themselves to the goal of allocating 0.7% of their GNI to Official Development Assistance (ODA) by 2015. The House commends the EU for its leading role on this issue and invites it to maintain pressure on all donors to set timetables, which should be monitored. Parliament also welcomes the agreement to provide immediate support for quick impact initiatives (quick wins) to support anti-malaria efforts, education and health care
The House commends the decision to create a Peace-Building Commission to help countries make the transition from war to peace, and recognises that peace-building requires an entirely different set of skills to peace-keeping. MEPs consider that there is a need for regional and global peace-building commissions to develop the necessary skills and capabilities, backed by a support office and a standing fund, thereby raising the UN's profile in crisis and post-conflict areas. Parliament calls on the 60th General Assembly to swiftly implement these provisions. Parliament greatly welcomes the inclusion of the concept of human security in the official UN framework-
MEPs also welcome the recognition of the international community's responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, as well as the clear responsibility of each individual state to protect their own citizens from these crimes, including through the prevention of such crimes. The House further underlines the importance of the International Criminal Court as an essential body in the task of prosecuting the perpetrators of any of these crimes.
The House fully endorses the clear condemnation of terrorism by the Summit. Parliament regards as a serious failure, however, the lack of agreement on a comprehensive definition of terrorism and urges the UN member states to rectify this without delay. Finally MEPs deeply regret the Summit's failure to reach agreement on measures for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, and insists that work and efforts to make progress on these issues must considerably intensify, first of all ensuring full respect for the existing Treaties, especially the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).

European Parliament condemns the Belarus regime
2005-10-03 - 17:48
Parliament strongly condemned the Belarus's regime's "indiscriminate attacks" against any perceived opponents.
The joint resolution condemns in particular the actions against the Union of Poles in Belarus and the continuous persecution of Polish minority activists, the complete marginalisation of the Roma minority, the ban against the Reformed Evangelical Church, the ban on foreign financing of conferences or other meetings and the refusal to admit a delegation of MEPs on a fact-finding mission in August 2005.
Parliament calls on the Council and Commission to raise the situation in Belarus with the Russian authorities. The House also calls for expanding the visa-ban list should the freedom of speech, assembly and religion not improve in Belarus. MEPs welcome the launch, by the European Commission, of independent broadcasting to Belarus, but calls for more resources. European political parties and groups in the Parliament are encourage to increase their contacts with and support for the Belarus opposition. Text adopted at September II plenary

Parliament calls for closer EU-India relations
2005-10-03 - 17:48
Parliament is calling for far greater cooperation between the EU and India. MEPs adopted a report by Emilio MEN√âNDEZ DE VALLE (PES, ES) , which champions the Commission's plans for a new strategic partnership. They are calling for extra funding for its implementation.
Parliament notes that the USA has aspirations for a strategic alliance with India and that China and India are also expanding their relations. It makes a number of specific recommendations to strengthen the ties with India, but also raises a number of issues of concern.
The report calls on the EU and India to jointly tackle aspects of industrial, environmental and development cooperation, trade, investment and good governance. It voices alarm at UNICEF reports that seventeen and a half million children are working in India, "mostly in subhuman conditions". More generally, MEPs urge India to update its labour laws to prevent the exploitation of workers. The EU should work together with the Indian government to improve the situation of underprivileged people, in particular women, children and disadvantaged groups, e.g. Dalits and Adivasis.
Another cause for concern is the increasing environmental destruction and MEPs urge India to show greater sensitivity to the question of global warming, while pursuing its development needs. The "alarming drop in the number of tigers" merits special mention. The resolution notes that twenty years after the Union Carbide disaster in Bhopal, the site has still not been cleaned up and calls on the Indian authorities and on Dow Chemicals to clean up the toxic waste immediately. MEPs also urge India to allow derogations from restrictions on the manufacture of generic drugs for medicines such as those against AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, hepatitis and cancer.
Parliament recommends systematic EU-India consultation in advance of international meetings or conferences and establishing permanent links to secure "balanced and mutually beneficial progress on the main points of the Doha Develoment Agenda". MEPs also call on the Indian government to take firm action against the dumping of trade goods on the EU.

Human rights
Human rights in Nepal, Tunisia and Vojvodina
2005-10-03 - 17:48
As is customary, the plenary session ended with debates on human rights. Resolutions were adopted on Tunisia, Nepal and Vojvodina.
Tunisia
In its resolution on Tunisia, Parliament welcomes the significant economic and social progress made in Tunisia, including in the areas of education and training, health and social security, and expresses its hope that this progress will be accompanied by similar advances in the areas of the strengthening of democracy, the rule of law, human rights, in particular freedom of expression and association, and judicial independence, which are part of the Barcelona Process acquis. It also hopes that the political dialogue conducted between the EU and Tunisia in the context of the association agreement will continue to play a key role in promoting and improving human rights.
MEPs express their concern at the case of Ma√Ætre Abbou and call for his immediate release. They also call on the Tunisian authorities to provide all the requisite explanations concerning the case of the Zarsis Internet-users and to allow the Tunisian Human Rights League (LTDH), the Union of Tunisian Journalists (SJT) and the Association of Tunisian Magistrates (AMT) to carry on their activities freely and to hold their congresses.
Parliament expresses its concern at the lack of progress towards the release of EU funding intended to provide financial support for the projects undertaken by the Tunisian Human Rights League (LTDH) and the IMED\AFTURD project on positive action for women's rights of citizenship and equal opportunities in the Maghreb, the project undertaken by Sant√© Sud and the modernisation plan for the justice system. It calls on the Tunisian Government to take immediate action to release the EU funding intended for the above-mentioned projects and rapidly to reach agreement on the modernisation plan for the justice system.
MEPs call on the Council and Commission to work to improve the management of projects under the MEDA programme and EIDHR and urges the Commission to draw up the measures which will have to be taken if no progress is made towards the release of blocked funds. They also urge the Council and Commission to step up their political dialogue with Tunisia, which is based on mutual understanding and respect and has the aim of encouraging democracy, respect for human rights, the rule of law and good governance, by calling for the establishment of a fully operational EU-Tunisia Human Rights Subcommittee to discuss the overall human rights situation and, in particular, individual cases.
Nepal
In the resolution on Nepal, Parliament welcomes the ceasefire declaration by the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) and the first steps by the seven-party alliance to start a political process to resolve the armed conflict. It calls for an indefinite extension of the Maoist ceasefire and for King Gyanendra to reciprocate the ceasefire and engage in constructive talks with political groups, which should include the Maoist rebels, with a view to restoring democratic processes in Nepal.
It call for urgent action by the Nepalese authorities with a view to the upcoming Troika visit and asks them to cooperate at these meetings to enable a fruitful discussion to take place, with a view to furthering the peace process and reinstating democracy, with the guidance and encouragement of the international community. MEPs call on King Gyanendra to guarantee the full sovereignty of parliamentary democratic authorities. They ask for the international community to establish a Contact Group, made up of Nepal‚Äôs key partners and international organisations (the EU, the US, India and the UN), to provide coordinated international action with regard to Nepal. They also propose that the European Parliament appoint a special rapporteur to monitor the situation.
Parliament welcomes the UN initiative of deploying a Special Rapporteur and a UN Office of Human Rights in Nepal, which will carefully monitor the human rights situation and calls for a follow-up to the 2002 London International Conference, to be organised by the Contact Group of key partners, which should set out the principles and values needed to underpin a peace process in Nepal and bring together all major players from the international community, as well as King Gyanendra, the Maoist rebel groups and the main political parties.
MEPs call on the Council and the Member States for suspension of military aid to continue. They ask that all aid to Nepal be monitored and that smart sanctions be imposed in order to maintain pressure on the royal government to restore democratic governance and explore all avenues to peace talks. They call on the Commission and the Member States to scrutinise closely all development assistance to Nepal and to make sure that it serves its prime purpose of poverty alleviation and addresses the underlying causes of conflict in the country.
MEPs note that municipal elections are to be held in April 2006. The House calls for parliamentary elections to be held at the same time. Parliament calls for the EU to send an election observation mission to monitor these elections, MEPs calls for all political parties to be able to participate fully in the elections. They strongly condemn violence in all forms and by all parties. They stress that basic human rights and freedoms must be upheld in Nepal, and therefore ask that both the King and the Maoists sign human rights accords to curb abuses. They note the release of some political prisoners, but remain deeply concerned that other political leaders, students and human rights activists are still being detained in prison.
Parliament stresses that any restrictions on media freedom should be lifted immediately and that all political prisoners in detention should be either released or charged. It asks the King to provide rehabilitation for the 30 000 Kapilvastu villagers displaced by violent conflict.
Finally, Parliament calls firmly once again on the Nepalese Government to re-establish the Tibetan Refugee Welfare Office (TRWO) in Kathmandu and to allow the representative office of the Dalai Lama to resume operations in providing relief services to Tibetan refugees as an implementing partner of the UNHCR.
Vojvodina
In its resolution on Vojvodina, adopted with 88 votes in favour, none against and 2 abstentions, Parliament expresses its deep concern at the repeated breaches of human rights and the lack of law and order in that province. It calls on the authorities in the Republic of Serbia and the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro to acknowledge these violent acts as criminal acts according to the legislation in force, and insists on the importance of immediate and effective action, so that similar events are not left unremedied and are prevented in the future. Parliament intends to continue its monitoring of the situation in Vojvodina, in particular with regard to the content and principles of the Stability and Association Agreement, requesting regular consultations with the Commission and Council during this procedure.
MEPs support the initiative taken by its Inter-parliamentary Delegation for relations with the countries of South-East Europe for a public hearing on the minority and political situation in Vojvodina. They reaffirm their willingness to use their budgetary powers both to assist and to bring pressure to bear on Serbia-Montenegro, in order to encourage respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms, including minority rights.
Parliament calls on the authorities in the Republic of Serbia and the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro to reinstate the autonomy Vojvodina enjoyed until 1990 and to reinstate the real powers of the regional parliament of Vojvodina in the field of education and the media, so as to enable the regional parliament to develop adequate policies in this multi-ethnic region.
They urge the Commission, the Council and the High Representative to monitor closely developments in Vojvodina, paying closer attention to the high security risk which the harassment of minorities in Vojvodina represents and calls, therefore, for EU monitors (EUMM) to be sent to the province.
Parliament finally reminds the Government of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro and the Government of Serbia that the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, the founding elements of the Stabilisation and Association process and the rule of law are prerequisites for the European Parliament's assent to the conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and any future partnership with the European Union in general.
