Enthusiastic Poles take the helm © European Union After the debate on Wednesday we know the priorities of the Polish presidency, but what about its style and how will it deal with problems? Enthusiastic, optimistic, creative, calm and peaceful, suggest Polish MEPs with whom we talked just after the six-month presidency began.
EP president Jerzy Buzek is sure that Polish qualities will boost humour in the EU. "Poland's enthusiasm and creativity are especially needed to overcome the atmosphere of caution and doubt that has gathered in some corners of the EU as a result of the sovereign debt crisis," he said. "I hope that the zeal and passion of the Poles will prove contagious and improve the mood in the EU."
"The EU will certainly benefit from the Polish optimism and support for the European project," EPP member Jacek Saryusz Wolski (EPP) said. Poles are motivated and hardworking, he added. "Poland has the ambition to preside over the Council of the EU in an efficient and constructive manner."
ECR member Tadeusz Cymański hoped the presidency will be calm and peaceful. "We saw during the debate that the Polish PM was open to criticism. It's better to hear out your opponents than argue with everybody. We're also more reflective, we don't forget about the past and we know how important it is to be aware of your heritage."
Socialist Joanna Senyszyn explained why Poles are more happy than citizens of "old Europe". "When we joined the EU, Polish people were very happy about it. They now want to transmit this happiness, this enthusiasm at a European level. According to the Eurobarometer, Poland is one of the most enthusiastic countries towards the EU," she said.
The only issue that might disturb the presidency is elections to the Polish Parliament in October, some MEPs said. Mr. Tusk explained that he didn't and couldn't choose the date himself because elections are held within a constitutional deadline. "I hope that it will not be a big problem but a danger exists," Ms Senyszyn said.
The MEPs expect the presidency to improve the image of Poles in the EU and say it should be used as an opportunity . One of the tools that could be used in image-building is Polish cuisine, like the famous Polish sour cucumber, Mr Cymański said.
