The members of the Committee of Inquiry into the Equitable Life case held their constituent meeting on Thursday and formally appointed, by acclamation, the members of the committee's bureau. The committee Chair will be Mairead McGuinness (EPP-ED, IE), with Manuel Medina Ortega (PES, ES) as first Vice-Chair and Jean-Paul Gauz√®s (EPP-ED, FR) as second Vice-Chair. Diana Wallis (ALDE, UK) was appointed rapporteur.
Ms McGuinness said: "We have a serious job of work to do. All eyes are upon us. We should take some time to consider how we are going to carry out our work - and we should avoid building up unreasonable expectations. We have twelve months of work before us and we will not draw conclusions until our work is over. We will deliver to our mandate, but cannot go beyond that." She suggested the committee should also aim to draw conclusions that would be useful for MEPs in their future legislative work.
Ms Wallis said: "Our work is of tremendous importance to European citizens. They need a system whose laws are implemented properly, where regulation applies across borders - and where, if necessary, citizens should be able to gain redress."
The members agreed that their next meeting would be on Tuesday 21 February 2006 at 9am, at which time a decision on dates of further meetings would be taken, alongside a discussion on the working methods of the committee.
