"Ploiesti Refineries" Â© Michail Moscholios www.michail.f2b.be Thanks to all of you who sent us your photos about the pressing issue of pollution. After much head scratching and deliberation we opted for the haunting "Ploiesti Refineries" by Brussels based amateur photographer Michael Moscholios. The shot, taken in Romania, clearly shows the damage pollution can bring. All the photos sent to us can be found in the Flickr site below. "Multicultural Europe" is the next topic we want your photos on, the deadline for that is 26 April. Good shooting!
Describing the way he takes photos Michael Moscholios says: "I use the camera in an intuitive manner, trying to capture impressions spontaneously rather than to impose a composition on them. My subjects are continually revisited and reinterpreted."
Influenced by Robert Frank
For "Ploiesti Refineries" the 49 year old he says that the colour of the sky and the "planting" of the girl symbolises ways in which pollution should be dealt with.
He says his inspiration has been the work of Henri Cartier-Bresson, Garry Winogrand, Robert Frank and other photographers of the American "school of street photography".
The photo shows, in the background, the beauty of a sunset and the dark silhouette of an industrial area and, in the foreground, an illuminated woman in white.
