Ombudsman
Election of new European Ombudsman
2010-01-14 - 18:29
MEPs will elect the new European Ombudsman, whose mandate runs until the end of the current parliamentary term (2014). In a secret plenary vote, MEPs will choose among three candidates: Vittorio Bottoli (IT), Nikiforos Diamandouros and Pierre-Yves Monette (BE). The European Ombudsman investigates citizens' complaints of maladministration by EU institutions. The three candidates for the Ombudsman post answered MEPs' questions at a Petitions Committee hearing on 30 November 2009. MEPs asked about ways to improve EU institutions' transparency, co-operation between Parliament and the Ombudsman's office, and how to communicate better on the Ombudsman's work.
The Ombudsman election procedure is supervised by the Petitions Committee, which checks that applications are admissible and that candidates fulfil all the conditions required for the post. EU rules establish, inter alia, that the Ombudsman must "offer every guarantee of independence". The Ombudsman is elected by Parliament in a secret vote at the start of each parliamentary term.
The role of the Ombudsman, established in 1995, is to investigate cases of maladministration by the EU institutions, including lack of transparency and refusal to provide information or documents.
Current European Ombudsman Nikiforos Diamandouros, was elected in January 2003 for the remainder 1999-2004 legislative term, following the retirement of the first Ombudsman, Jacob Söderman. Vote: 20.01.2010 MEPs quiz candidates for EU Ombudsman position (EP press release) Three candidates will compete for the post of European Ombudsman (EP press release) Election of the European Ombudsman's web site (candidates CVs and other information) European Ombudsman's web site Rules of Procedure.

Democratisation in Turkey
2010-01-14 - 18:29
MEPs will debate the Turkish democratisation process with the EU High Representative following the recent banning of the pro-Kurdish political party Democratic Society Party (DTP) by the Turkish Constitutional Court in December. The DTP was banned due to alleged links with the PKK. Leyla Zana, who was awarded the Sakharov Prize in 1995, was a member of the DTP for a short period. She has been banned from politics for five years, along with 30 other Kurdish politicians, following the Constitutional Court decision.
The Foreign Affairs Committee will adopt its assessment of Turkey's progress in the accession negotiations on 26 January. The plenary vote on that report is scheduled for 25 February. Debate : 20.01.2010

Situation in Iran
2010-01-14 - 18:29
Developments in Iran, including protests following its controversial June 2009 presidential election and the progress of its uranium enrichment programme, will be debated on Tuesday, with a vote on a resolution to follow in February. MEPs are also likely to put to the EU High Representative their concerns about the cancellation of their visit to Tehran, which was to have taken place early in January. The European Parliament delegation for relations with Iran was to have visited Tehran on 8-11 January for official exchanges with representatives of the Majlis (the Iranian Parliament), the Foreign Ministry, and a wide range of meetings with the political opposition and representatives of civil society.
Delegation chair Barbara Lochbihler (Greens/EFA, DE) said the cancellation was "another sad illustration of how much the Iranian leadership opposes any discussion of the major unresolved problems in the country". Mrs Lochbihler added that "political developments in Iran" would remain "at the top of the European agenda".

Outcome of Copenhagen summit on climate change
2010-01-14 - 18:29
MEPs will debate the outcome of the December Copenhagen climate change summit with the Council and Commission. Parliament's delegation saw the agreement reached there as weak and a huge disappointment. It says the negotiating procedure and outcome point to an urgent need to reform UN working methods. MEPs will vote on a resolution in February. MEPs deplored the fact that the "Copenhagen Accord" is not legally binding and merely "recognises" the need to keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius. They said developed countries should commit to a goal of mobilising $100bn a year by 2020 to help developing countries cope with the impact of climate change. The agreement also includes a method for verifying industrialised nations' emission reductions. Debate : 3pm, 20.01.2010

EU Strategy for the Danube Region
2010-01-14 - 18:29
Linking six Member States over its 3,000 km course from the Black Forest to the Black Sea, the river Danube has seen many international co-operation projects, but an overall EU strategy for them is still lacking. Following the example of the EU strategy for the Baltic Sea Region, MEPs are asking the Commission to steer a programme promoting inter-territorial co-operation around the Danube, for the development of transport connections and sustainable tourism, social and economic progress and environmental protection. A resolution will be put to the vote. Procedure: Oral question with resolution

Revised framework for relations with ACP countries
2010-01-14 - 18:29
Negotiations for the second revision of the Cotonou Agreement, which defines the terms for relations between the EU and the African, Caribbean and Pacific States, are likely to be finalised in March 2010. Parliament will debate and vote on a resolution assessing the ongoing negotiations and propose improvements to the Cotonou framework in the light of current global challenges: the financial crisis, climate change, soaring food and energy prices, and land-grabbing, mostly on the African continent.
The agreement is based on three pillars: political dialogue, commercial relations and development cooperation. Because of the new institutions created by the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), MEPs are concerned that increased regionalisation of ACP-EU relations may be a threat to the coherence and strength of the ACP group and may hinder the functioning of the existing joint ACP-EU institutions.

Regional policy
No customs duties on goods imported to Madeira and the Azores
2010-01-14 - 18:29
Parliament will give its formal opinion on a decision to suspend Common Customs tariff duties applicable to imports into the Portuguese autonomous regions of Madeira and the Azores of finished goods for agricultural, commercial or industrial use, from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2019.
According to the regional governments, who have requested such a suspension, it would encourage local SMEs and farmers to invest and generate jobs in these outermost regions of the Union. To ensure that the goods imported do not distort competition, they will be subject to controls ensuring their use by local companies for at least two years before they can be sold freely to companies situated in other parts of the Union.
The EP Committee Regional Development supports the adoption of the proposal. A similar arrangement already exists for the Canary Islands (Spain). Procedure: consultation
Vote (without debate): Wednesday, 20.01.2010 Draft report - Madeira and Azores: temporarily suspending autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on imports of certain industrial products

Passenger name records and SWIFT
2010-01-14 - 18:29
The Council will make a statement on a number of international agreements that must be submitted in the near future to Parliament for its consent, including transfers of bank data to the USA (SWIFT) and several passenger name record agreements (PNR) that are already being applied. EU ministers have signed the accords but they require Parliament's approval, without which they will have no legal force. The international agreements relate to judicial and police cooperation in criminal law matters. Formerly part of the "third pillar", they can now be approved or rejected by MEPs. The European Parliament acquired this new power under the Lisbon Treaty and it applies to agreements that were signed but not formally concluded by 1 December 2009.
Several of the accords - eight in total - have been applied provisionally but not yet formally ratified. They include the agreement on bank data exchanges via the SWIFT network in connection with the US Terrorism Finance Tracking Programme (TFTP) and the transfer of passenger name records (PNR) with the US and Australia.
