Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán put the economy at the top of the agenda for Hungary's six-month presidency of the Council of Ministers when he outlined his priorities to MEPs on Wednesday morning. The Viktor Orbán / Hungarian presidency press conference in the EP press room was full to capacity with many questions on Budapest's new Media Law. MEPs on Wednesday approved a new EU law setting out patients' rights to seek medical care in another EU country. French MEP Françoise Grossetête (EPP), who led discussions in Parliament, commented: "Patients will no longer be left to their own devices when they seek cross border healthcare and reimbursement". Falconers were at the European Parliament to push their case for falconry to be listed by UNESCO as part of global heritage. Jerzy Buzek and leading MEPs meet some of the relatives of the victims of terrorism who are asking for the extradition of Cesare Battisti. Members from across party lines and different nationalities held a candle lit vigil and a moment's silence on Wednesday evening for the victims of recent attacks on Christians in the Middle East. Turmoil in Tunisia debate Hungarian Presidency priorities laid out by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán EP adopted a resolution expressing concerns about the rise of homophobia in Lithuania A precocious spring was in the air when MEPs gathered in Strasbourg for the New Year's first plenary. Hungary took over the running of the EU Council from Belgium and presented its 6-month programme. Hungary's controversial media law, which Mr Orbán promised to amend if necessary, provided for some hot paprika for the start of the country's 1st ever EU Presidency.
Tunisia: On Monday President Buzek opened the session with a remark to the recent events in Tunisia. He said: "We have followed the recent events, which have been unfolding in Tunisia, with great concern, but equally with hope. Peaceful demonstrations in defence of legitimate grievances were turned into violent clashes: we deplore the fact that Tunisian authorities failed to understand that their first and foremost duty is to serve the good of their citizens." Leaders of the political groups and representatives of the Commission supported his statement.
Hungarian Presidency – The economy will be at the top of the agenda for Hungary's six-month presidency of the Council of ministers among other issues such as the plight of the Roma and creating a strategy for the Danube river, said Hungarian Premier Viktor Orbán, who came to Strasbourg to present his plans to MEPs. The debate became quite heated at times with some MEPs taping over their mouths and holding placards as Mr Orbán came in for criticism over Hungary's controversial media law, a law which he undertook to amend if found to be incompatible with the EU legal framework.
Lithuanian anti gay law: EP adopted a resolution expressing concerns about the rise of homophobia in Lithuania and the legislative moves the government took to punish "public promotion of homosexual relations". The EP asked the Commission to present a plan to combat homophobia and to put pressure on Lithuania to abandon the draft law.
Patients' cross-border health care: On Wednesday MEPs approved a new law setting out patients' rights to seek medical care in another EU country. The legislation clarifies the rules for advance authorisation and reimbursement in cross border healthcare. MEPs want patients to be properly informed about their rights to be treated in another Member State. Now the Council must also give its formal approval to the text. Once signed into law, Member States have 30 months to make respective changes to their national legislation.
Serbia can count on closer relations with the European Union as MEPs approve a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the country. Although the Parliament praised the reforms undertaken by Serbia, it warned that full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) remains a fundamental condition for the country to progress on the path to EU membership.
One year after the earthquake, Haiti is still in chaos: the rebuilding has barely begun in spite of the best efforts by NGOs, MEPs say in a resolution adopted on Wednesday. They identify the weak capacity of the Haitian state and the risk of a political crisis as the biggest obstacles on the road to recovery.
Do you remember? Every year 1.4 million Europeans develop some type of dementia and, with the ageing population, this figures is expected to rise dramatically in the next 20 years. Therefore MEPs asked to make combating Alzheimer's and other types of dementias a top EU priority. They'd like Member states to cooperate more in research, care and prevention and asked for a European Year of mental health.
Ensuring children's right to a family life. Every child has a right to have a family life, MEPs stated in a resolution encouraging international adoption within the EU. If no adoption is possible in the country of origin of the children, then international adoption should be seriously considered. Placing children in orphanages should always be the very last option.
A light for Christians under attack. On Wednesday evening President Jerzy Buzek lighted a candle in memory of the Christians that were targeted by attacks in the Middle East. "Fire stands for internal life and hope" he said. Christian victims' memory was honoured by one minute of silence. The House debate the attacks on Christians Wednesday and there was strong support for them in a resolution adopted Thursday.
What do asylum seekers' applications cost for countries? Disparity in procedures, disparity in protection? MEPs questioned Council and Commission representatives on Wednesday evening on the cost of examining asylum seekers' applications in the 27 Member States. Negotiations on a common EU asylum system have been stalled, partly for financial costs (interpreters, legal assistance) and the overall burden sharing. MEPs called for information on the cost of processing asylum requests and the update of procedures.
