No red lines in Strasbourg debates
The new reform treaty and the Lisbon summit will form the "Key Debate" of the October session on Tuesday. In Strasbourg MEPs will debate and vote on a number of reports on pesticides and one on CO2 car emissions. The EU's 2008 budget is also on the agenda as well as relations with Russia, Serbia and Afghanistan. The winners of two prizes will be announced this week; the 2007 Sakharov prize for freedom of thought and the "Lux" European cinema prize.
Monday 22 October The session starts with a debate on three reports to modernise EU law on pesticides. The chemicals industry, farmers, health professionals, environmentalists and the general public will be watching to see if the plenary endorses the amendments adopted by the EP Environment Committee. Later on Monday evening, Parliament will debate a report on conventional energy sources and energy technology and a proposal that carbon dioxide emissions from passenger cars should be capped at an average of 120g/km from 2012.
Tuesday 23 October At 1000 CET Tuesday MEPs will discuss the outcome of the informal summit in Lisbon 18-19 October with Portuguese Prime Minister José Sócrates and Commission President José Manuel Barroso giving their view. Tuesday afternoon is dedicated to the first reading of the EU 2008 budget. The Budget Committee proposes shifting funding on foreign policy with increased aid for Kosovo and Palestine. It also proposes more money for Galileo and the European Institute of Technology. If the plenary approves these proposals, some hard bargaining with the Council is in store. On Tuesday evening wide-ranging restrictions on smoking in public places and rules to make it harder for underage people to buy cigarettes will come under the spotlight.
