Food aid: EP call to strengthen programme for Europe's poorest people

The EU food distribution programme for the most deprived people in Europe must continue within the CAP, be fully funded by the EU and consist purely of food products of Community origin, says the European Parliament. Since the programme came into being in 1987, millions of needy Europeans have received food from CAP intervention stocks, distributed via charities and social services. The resolution was adopted with 425 votes in favour to 71 with 62 abstentions.
In the mid-1990s, the rules were changed to allow food to be bought on the open market, in certain circumstances, to supplement this source.
Keep the programme within the CAP
The consultation report by Czesław Adam Siekierski (EPP-ED, PL) adopted on Thursday by the Parliament approves the European Commission's proposal to allow more buying of food on the market for this purpose, given the declining food stocks following successive reforms of the CAP and the increased need for food aid in the wake of successive EU enlargements and the economic crisis.
Already at the agriculture committee stage, MEPs had rejected a series of amendments seeking a change in the proposal's legal basis, on the ground that the programme would lose its "agricultural dimension" because increasing buying on the market would make it a social policy measure instead. This position was confirmed by the plenary assembly with a large majority.
Full Community funding
MEPs also approved an expansion in the range of products to be made available, to promote a more balanced diet, as well as longer-term distribution plans from 2010 so that the funding can be used more efficiently.
However, because of the economic difficulties faced by many Member States, MEPs oppose the idea that national governments should help pay for the scheme, calling instead for full Community funding to be preserved. The Commission had proposed that the Community budget should contribute 75% for 2010/2012 (85% in Member States that receive Cohesion Fund money) and that these rates be subsequently reduced to 50% and 75% respectively from 2013/2015.
Moreover, they stress that EU money should also cover storage costs and not only administrative and transport costs, as proposed by the Commission.
Only European products to be used
Among other amendments adopted, Parliament wants the programme to distribute only products of Community origin, preferably fresh and local ones.
Background
In the 27-member EU, 80 million people (16% of the population) live below the poverty threshold, according to Eurostat, a figure expected to rise considerably because of the economic crisis.
In April 2006 the European Parliament asked the Commission and the Member States to continue this programme, which it said had become vital for millions of Europeans. And in May 2008, in a resolution on food price rises, MEPs described the right to food as a basic right.
At an initial round table meeting with Council of Agriculture Ministers in November 2008, seven Member States forming a blocking minority (Germany, UK, Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Czech Republic and Latvia) opposed the Commission proposal, arguing that the distribution of food should be funded via national social programmes rather than the CAP budget (and therefore calling for a change in the legal basis).
According to the Commission, over 13 million people benefit from the programme, whose budget has been raised from slightly under €100 million in 1987 to €305 million in 2008 and €500 million in 2009. Participation in the programme is voluntary (in 2008, 19 Member States took part, the non-participants being Germany, UK, Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Austria, Cyprus and Slovakia).
