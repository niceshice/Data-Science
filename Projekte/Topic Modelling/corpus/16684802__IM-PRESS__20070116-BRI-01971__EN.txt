EP to debate and vote on resolution on a moratorium on the death penalty
2007-01-25 - 13:56
MEPs will debate the moratorium on the death penalty after hearing statements from the Council and the Commission. The House is also due to vote on a resolution on this subject. During the last plenary session in Strasbourg, MEPs adopted a resolution condemning the verdict of the Criminal Court in Libya on 19 December 2006, convicting, in a re-trial, and sentencing to death five Bulgarian nurses, Kristiana Vulcheva, Nasya Nenova, Valentina Siropulo, Valya Chervenyashka and Snezhana Dimitrova, and one Palestinian doctor, Ashraf al-Haiui, who have already spent eight years in prison in connection with the 1999 HIV/AIDS case at the Benghazi hospital.
The recent execution of Saddam Hussein and others in Iraq, and the existence of the death penalty in countries outside of the EU are likely to be debated. The EU consistently promotes abolition of the death penalty under guidelines established in 1998. Last December, the EU presented a statement on the death penalty in the UN General Assembly, which was signed by 85 countries from all geographical groups. In February it will actively participate in the third world congress against the death penalty in Paris.
In October 2003, (under the last legislature), the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the initiative in favour of a universal moratorium on the death penalty in the context of the UN. The House urged the EU institutions and the Member States to make every endeavour in the political and diplomatic spheres to ensure the most appropriate support for this resolution within the UN General Assembly.

Human rights situation of the Dalits in India
2007-01-25 - 13:56
Parliament will vote on a resolution from the Development Committee on the human rights situation of the Dalits in India. The committee welcomes the various provisions in the Constitution of India for the protection and promotion of the rights of Dalits. The National Human Rights Commission of India has reported that the implementation of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act remains very unsatisfactory, and whereas it has published numerous recommendations to address this problem
The resolution notes however that, in spite of these provisions, implementation of laws protecting the rights of Dalits remains grossly inadequate, and that atrocities, untouchability, illiteracy, inequality of opportunity, manual scavenging, underpayment of wages, bonded labour, child labour and landlessness continue to blight the lives of India’s Dalits.
The Development Committee expresses its concern at the low rate of conviction for the perpetrators of such crimes and calls on the Government of India to improve its criminal justice system in order to facilitate registration of charges against perpetrators of crimes against Dalits, to increase the conviction rate for such perpetrators, to significantly reduce the duration of court procedures; and to take special measures for the protection of Dalit women.
The committee calls on the Government of India to take urgent steps to ensure equal access for Dalits to police stations and all other public institutions and facilities, including those related to its democratic structure such as panchayat buildings and polling booths.
MEPs in the committee urge the Government of India to engage further with relevant UN human rights bodies on the effective elimination of caste-based discrimination, including the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the UN Special Rapporteurs assigned to develop Principles and Guidelines for the Elimination of Discrimination based on Work and Descent. MEPs in the committee call on the Government of India to ratify the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and to take preventive measures to reduce the risk of Dalits facing torture, to take legal measures to criminalise torture in India, to take punitive measures to prosecute police who commit torture, to consistently provide rehabilitation and compensation for torture victims and to put in place an independent complaints mechanism for victims of torture that is accessible to Dalits. The Development Committee notes with concern the lack of substantive EU engagement with the Indian Government, notably within the EU-India Summits, on the vast problem of caste-based discrimination. The committee urges the Council and the Commission to raise the issue of caste-based discrimination during EU-India Summits and other meetings as part of all political, human rights, civil society, development and trade dialogues and to inform the committees concerned of the progress and outcome of such dialogues.
Lastly, the committee urges the European members of the Joint Action Committee to develop dialogue on the problem of caste-based discrimination in terms of its discussions on democracy and human rights, social and employment policy and development cooperation.

Climate change - MEPs to debate the global challenge
2007-01-25 - 13:56
The House will debate the topic of climate change after hearing statements from the Council and the Commission. MEPs will vote on a resolution on this subject during the February plenary in Strasbourg (12-15 February) In July 2006, the European Parliament adopted an own-initiative report drafted by Caroline LUCAS (Greens/EFA, UK) which proposes the EU take a leadership position in global aviation in order to reduce the climate change impact of aviation. Parliament advocates an aviation scheme as well as its inclusion in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) It felt that the EU should show leadership in the fight against climate change.
The EU is taking serious steps to address its own greenhouse gas emissions. In March 2000 the Commission launched the European Climate Change Programme (ECCP). The ECCP led to the adoption of a range of new policies and measures, among which the EU's emissions trading scheme, which started its operation on 1 January 2005 plays a key role. Monitoring data indicates that the 15 European Union members before 2004 (EU-15) will reach their Kyoto Protocol target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions.
It is widely agreed that climate change is one of the greatest environmental, social and economic threats facing the planet. During the last century, the Earth's average surface temperature rose by around 0.6°C. Evidence is getting stronger that most of the global warming that has occurred over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities. In its Third Assessment Report, published in 2001, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects that global average surface temperatures will rise by a further 1.4 to 5.8°C by the end of this century. This global temperature increase is likely to trigger serious consequences for humanity and other life forms alike, including a rise in sea levels of an estimated 9 to 88 cm by the end of this century, which will endanger coastal areas and small islands, and a greater frequency and severity of extreme weather events.
Human activities that contribute to climate change include in particular the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, both of which cause emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the main gas responsible for climate change, as well as other 'greenhouse' gases. In order to bring climate change to a halt, global greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced significantly. Council and Commission statements

Justice and home affairs
Data protection and war on terror
2007-01-25 - 13:56
In a joint debate MEPs will quiz Council and Commission on two high-profile issues relating to data protection: the transfer to the USA of passenger name records (PNR) of transatlantic travellers and the provision by the SWIFT banking system of personal data to the US authorities. Both these forms of data transfer are seen by the USA as important in the war on terror.
Passenger name records
The USA has been seeking to screen air passengers before they arrive on American soil and, as part of this strategy, it has concluded a PNR agreement with the EU, by which personal data on up to 34 topics is forwarded to the USA by air carriers 15 minutes before departure. The Commission first reached a deal with the Americans on this subject without consulting Parliament. MEPs then successfully demanded the right to scrutinise the deal, a demand which was accepted by the Commission. A new agreement, approved by Parliament, was then concluded in October 2006 but it expires in July 2007.
In December 2006 the Commission sent a letter to the US authorities raising concerns that the USA's Automatic Targeting System (ATS), a computerised system for assessing risk on international travellers, might be accessing the PNR data and using it in ways not allowed October's agreement.
Now MEPs will be looking to hear the latest developments from the Commission and Council.
SWIFT
In June 2006, media reports in the United States revealed that the American authorities had, since 2001, issued subpoenas to SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, obliging the Belgian-based company to provide details it held of financial transfers, about which it sends information between banks.
At a hearing organised by Parliament's Civil Liberties Committee and Economic Affairs Committee last October, it emerged that European data protection authorities were not informed of SWIFT’s compliance with this order from the US authorities.
On 22 November, the Article 29 Working Party, which is the independent EU Advisory Body on Data Protection and Privacy, adopted an opinion concluding that the EU Data Protection Directive had not been respected and calling for measures to be taken in order to remedy the currently illegal state of affairs without delay.
Now, in oral questions submitted by the two EP committees, the Council and Commission will be asked to update MEPs on the matter. Among other things, the two institutions are asked whether they knew that the data collected by SWIFT are fed into the US Automatic Targeting System.

Public health
Prevention of overweight, obesity and chronic diseases
2007-01-25 - 13:56
Frédérique RIES (ALDE, BE) will be tabling an own-initiative on the prevention of overweight, obesity and chronic diseases. The committee welcomes the Commission's commitment to healthy eating (in quantative and qualitative terms) and physical activity, and the fight against obesity and major diet related diseases and calls for this to be regarded henceforth as a political priority of the European Union and its Member States. A report prepared by the United Kingdom’s National Audit Office in 2001 estimated that obesity in England alone accounted for 18 million days of sickness absence and 30,000 premature deaths, corresponding to an annual direct health care cost of at least GBP 500 million. The wider costs to the economy, which include lower productivity and lost output, were estimated at a further GBP 2 billion per year. The 2004 report from the United Kingdom’s Chief Medical Officer on the impact of physical activity and its relationship to health estimated the cost of physical inactivity at GBP 8.2 billion annually (including both the health care cost and the wider cost to the economy, such as days lost from work). In Ireland, the direct cost of treating obesity was estimated at some €70 million in 2002.
The committee advises all the Member States to recognise obesity officially as a chronic disease in order to prevent obese people from being stigmatised and discriminated in any way; and to ensure that they have access to appropriate treatment under their national health systems.
Schools are key
The committee points out that school is the place where children spend most of their time and that the school environment and, especially school canteens, must therefore encourage young children to develop their tastes, to promote regular physical activity and a healthy lifestyle, particularly in order to deal with the decreasing time allocated to physical education in schools in the EU. The report calls therefore on the Commission to develop mechanisms to promote best practice in schools which take account of the most effective initiatives educating children about healthy eating and, providing food based on high nutritional standards.
MEPs in the committee call on Member States to provide sufficient funds for school catering in order to allow schools to serve freshly produced meals, preferably from organic or regional agriculture and to encourage healthy dietary habits from an early age.
The committee takes a strong interest in the food signposting systems put in place in several Member States by food companies, retailers or public bodies in order to simplify nutrition messages, recognises the value of such signposting systems as well as healthy-choice logos when they are favoured by consumers and easy to use. MEPs in the committee recall that research confirms that schemes which indicate levels of nutrients via an interpretative element are the most helpful to consumers in choosing healthier options. The committee calls on the Commission to draw on this experience and research to develop and introduce an EU-wide front-of-pack nutrition labelling scheme and points out that a consistent message to consumers demand a certain degree of harmonisation in this area and that such messages must be scientifically based.
Concern over decline in nutritional value of fruit and vegetables
The committee is concerned about reports that the nutritional content of fruit and vegetables produced in Europe has fallen over the last decades and calls on Commission and Council to take the necessary steps in the 2008 Common Agricultural Policy review in order to consider food nutritive value an important criterion and to enhance quality food production and healthy nutrition incentives in the framework of rural development policies.
The committee believes that product reformulation is a powerful tool for reducing the intake of fat, sugar and salt in our diets and welcomes the steps taken by a few manufacturers and retailers to move in this direction. The committee calls on the Commission, Member States, manufacturers, retailers and caterers to step up efforts to ensure reduced fat, sugar and salt levels in foods. Finally, MEPs in the committee call on manufacturers to use product reformulation not just to launch new, sometimes more expensive brands, but to prioritise cutting fat, sugar and salt in existing everyday brands.

Industry
European Statute for smaller firms needed
2007-01-25 - 13:56
The Legal Affairs committee will be asking the plenary to endorse its call for the European Commission to draft a European Private Company (EPC) statute to help Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to do business across borders. In a report by Klaus-Heiner LEHNE (EPP-ED, DE), the Legal Affairs Committee suggests that the Commission should draft legislation to establish a European Private Company (EPC) statute, in accordance with detailed recommendations laid down by the committee. The existing European Company (SE) statute is designed for large limited companies; an EPC statute would make it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with a minimum capital of €10 000, to operate across borders too.
Under an EPC statute, an SME would only have to register in the country where its head office is located, rather than in each EU Member State. This would cut consultancy and legal costs, since an EPC would need to comply only with a single, EU-wide set of rules. In this connection MEPs also suggest that the EPC statute be based, as far as possible, on EU legislation, avoiding references to national laws, which would increase costs.
MEPs are keen to ensure that workers' rights are protected. If a European SME becomes an EPC, says the committee, employees should keep their rights to information and consultation. The committee's text also includes provisions on the organisation of the EPC, the liability of executive directors to the company and insolvency procedures.
This report must be adopted in plenary by an absolute majority of MEPs (i.e. at least 393 votes in favour). This is required under Article 192 of the EC Treaty when Parliament formally asks the Commission to come forward with a legislative proposal.

Development and cooperation
EU relations with Pacific Islands
2007-01-25 - 13:56
Nirj DEVA (EPP-ED, UK) will be tabling an own-initiative report for the Development Committee on EU relations with the Pacific Islands. The committee welcomes the initiative of the Commission to develop the first EU strategy for the Pacific after 30 years of cooperation, following on from the signature of the first Lomé Convention in 1975 and the Cotonou Agreement in June 2000; MEPs in the committee emphasise that, as a major donor to the region, the EU has an opportunity to create a strategy that will support the island countries of the Pacific in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The committee also emphasises the heterogeneity of the region and therefore calls for flexibility in the Commission strategy to ensure that development assistance is channelled according to national and regional priorities, thereby achieving maximum benefit for both the more developed and less developed countries of the Pacific.
The committee recommends that more developed Pacific island countries continue to develop local processing, thereby creating more employment, and explore the possibility of European Investment Bank soft loan lending to small and medium-sized enterprises owned by Pacific island interests so as to increase processing capacity in order to bring increased revenues to the region.
Tourism
The committee draws attention to the economic importance that tourism has for the region, given that one of the main assets of the Pacific islands is their idyllic setting. The report also stresses that any encouragement of tourism in the region must go hand in hand with increased local ownership of tourist services, to ensure the sustainability of the tourist sector and to maximise the benefits to the local economy. MEPs in the committee recognise the benefits that the setting up of low-cost airlines servicing the region has brought to the Pacific island economies, and call for impediments to "open skies" policies to be eliminated while developing air transport rationally so as to minimise emissions and other environmental impacts of increased air travel. The committee stresses that in the majority of cases only the richer countries with more developed infrastructure and more frequent air connections attract significant numbers of tourists each year; emphasises that in these cases development assistance must continue to be used to finance infrastructure and to encourage sustainable tourism.
The committee draws attention to the four countries affected by malaria in the region, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Timor-Leste. The committee urges the Commission to develop programmes to tackle this problem, ensuring that there is adequate protection from malaria, for example, through the supply to affected countries of anti-malarial bed nets;
Among other points in the report, MEPs in the committee stress that, in order to ensure the efficient delivery of aid, the promotion of good governance throughout the Pacific region is vital so as to prevent corruption, one of the key obstacles to meeting the MDGs, as well as to achieve sustainable development.

External/international trade
Government Procurement Agreement
2007-01-25 - 13:56
Daniel VARELA SUANZES-CARPEGNA (EPP-ED, ES), on behalf of the Committee on International Trade ,will be asking the Commission the following questions on the Renegotiation of the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA): The plurilateral Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) negotiated in the framework of the WTO took effect on 1 January 1996. Although limited both in its scope and number of participants (36), this Agreement plays an essential role in opening as much as possible of public procurement business (goods, services and construction contracts) to foreign competition and ensuring transparent, fair and non-discriminatory conditions for private bidders.
The GPA has been subject to renegotiation for a number of years with a view to improving its provisions and achieving the greatest possible extension of its coverage among all parties on the basis of mutual reciprocity. In this context, amendments to the agreement are currently being considered and a request-offer process is taking place in Geneva with a view to reaching a conclusion towards the beginning of 2007.
Could the Commission explain what have been the main priorities of the EU in this renegotiation and whether it is confident that these objectives will be achieved?
Could the Commission indicate what kind of offers it has submitted to its negotiating partners on behalf of the EU and the extent to which a further opening of EU public procurement markets to foreign competition could take place as a result of this renegotiation?
Could the Commission indicate what kind of requests it has submitted to its negotiating partners on behalf of the EU and the extent to which a further opening of the public procurement markets of the countries concerned could take place as a result of this renegotiation?
Does the Commission consider that the GPA is a balanced agreement and that EU companies enjoy in foreign public procurement markets, especially those of our main trading partners, a degree of access which is commensurate to the opening of EU public procurement markets to foreign competition?
Could the Commission indicate whether any specific steps have been taken in the ongoing renegotiation of the GPA to ensure better access to public procurement markets for European small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)?
Could the Commission indicate how the recent orientations set up in the Communication 'Global Europe' will impact the current negotiations? (nota bene: This Communication notably envisages targeting discriminatory practices in order to ensure a level playing field).
Could the Commission indicate when and under what conditions China could become a contracting party to the GPA and, more generally, what are the prospects of a geographical extension of this agreement to other countries?
Could the Commission indicate what steps it is taking to ensure that a renegotiated GPA will fully respect the interests of developing countries if they wish to participate in the GPA?

Judicial cooperation
Limitation periods for crossborder disputes over accidents - harmonisation needed
2007-01-25 - 13:56
Parliament will be asked to back a suggestion by its Legal Affairs Committee that the Commission should draft legislation harmonising national rules on limitation periods governing crossborder disputes over fatal accidents and injuries. In a report by Diana Wallis (ALDE, UK), the committee proposes a general limitation period of four years. Crossborder disputes between EU citizens over such accidents and injuries are currently subject to differing "limitation periods", or cut-off points, in each Member State. The current differences in national legislations regarding limitation periods, and particularly the starting date, the possibility of interrupting or stopping the running of time and the date of expiration, may have undesirable consequences for accident victims.
The Legal Affairs Committee argues that the general limitation period for all crossborder proceedings involving injuries and fatal accidents should be four years, except where the proper law of the claim provides for a longer period. The committee also proposes a limitation period of ten years for enforcing a damages claim established by a final judgment or arbitral award.
In addition, say MEPs, Member States should be required to set up national information centres for keeping a register of all criminal investigations involving foreign victims and for providing written answers to requests made by victims.
To be adopted, this report needs an absolute majority of MEPs in plenary (i.e. at least 393 votes in favour). This is required under Article 192 of the EC Treaty governing formal requests by Parliament for the Commission to draft a legislative proposal.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Educational discrimination against young women and girls
2007-01-25 - 13:56
"Education and training of girls and women is a human right and an essential element for the full enjoyment of all other social, economic, cultural and political rights", says the Women's Rights Committee in an own-initiative report drafted by Vera Flasarová (GUE/NGL, CZ). The committee believes a range of measures are needed to tackle educational discrimination between men and women in Europe. In the European Union women make less progress overall than men through the education system, including life-long learning, on account of diverse gender-related restrictions, say MEPs. The rapporteur lists a number of barriers: economic factors in socially disadvantaged families; gender-based prejudices in the choice of field of study; gender-based reasons hindering the completion of studies and preventing young women from improving their existing qualifications; prejudice against educated women; religious prejudice preventing women from fulfilling their potential in society in certain countries; difficulty of access to education for girls and young women from immigrant or minority backgrounds.
Among its recommendations, the committee suggests that policy in the area of equal access to education should involve an assessment of gender-differentiated statistics. It also recommends that Member States create and monitor national educational policies designed to enable all girls to complete compulsory schooling.
Vulnerable groups
Special policies are needed for national, ethnic and cultural minorities, especially the Roma minority, including pre-school and zero grade programmes, with a multicultural approach to combat double discrimination. Action is also urged to protect the rights of immigrant women and girls and combat the discrimination they face in their communities of origin by rejecting all forms of cultural and religious relativism which could violate women's fundamental rights.
Flexibility needed
Member States should devise more flexible adult education and lifelong learning programmes so that working women and mothers are able to continue their education in programmes that fit in with their schedules.
Pay gap
The pay gap between women and men remains high: on average women earn 15% less than men, which is the result both of non-compliance with equal pay legislation and structural inequalities such as labour market segregation, differences in work patterns, access to education and training, biased evaluation and pay systems and stereotypes.
Member States are urged to encourage access by women to positions of responsibility and decision-making in public and private undertakings. Particular attention should be paid to academic positions: in education and research, women outnumber men as graduates (59%), yet their presence decreases consistently as they progress on the career ladder, from 43% of PhDs down to only 15% of full professors.

Fisheries
EC-Gabon Fisheries Partnership
2007-01-25 - 13:56
Stavros ARNAOUTAKIS (PES, GR) for the Fisheries Committee will be tabling a non-binding report on the EC-Gabon Fisheries agreement. On 28 October 2005 the Community and the Gabonese Republic negotiated and initialled a Fisheries Partnership Agreement which offers Community fishermen fishing opportunities in the Gabonese fishing zone. This Agreement repeals and replaces the Agreement between the European Community and the Gabonese Republic on fishing off the Gabonese coast, which entered into force on 3 December 1998. The Regulation consists of firstly the Agreement itself and secondly, a new Protocol in which the fishing opportunities are laid out. The new Protocol covers the period 3 December 2005 to 2 December 2011, although it will only enter into force once all the Parties have notified each other of the completion procedures necessary for that purpose. The main objective of the new FPA is to strengthen co-operation between the European Community and the Gabonese Republic in a bid to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and the sound exploitation of fishery resources in the Gabonese fishing zone.
The Fisheries Committee says that the new Agreement offers, in a number of important respects, significant improvements over the old one and should therefore be approved. However, the committee would like to stress that the Commission would have gained much if the Parliament had been fully involved during the initial preparation phase and throughout the negotiations. At the very least the EP should have been informed on time about the initialling of the Agreement. It took almost 1 year from the day that the two sides initialled the Agreement for the text to be transmitted to the European Parliament.
This, according to the committee, is not acceptable and it is to be hoped that the new inter-institutional understanding now in place with regard to third country fisheries agreements, will prevent the reoccurrence of such events and will lead to an improved working relationship in the future.
