Launch of European Maritime Day MEPs backed criminal sanctions for those who pollute when they met in Strasbourg from 19-22 May. The week also saw the launch of the first European maritime day - which aims among other issues to protect Europe's seas and coastline. Members also debated the recent natural catastrophes in Burma and China - praising the latter's openness to outside help and condemning Burma's generals.
Roma rights and the effectiveness of European Union aid were also under the spotlight. The House wants better implementation by EU members of existing legislation that guarantees equal rights for Europe's Roma community. The week also saw MEPs debate the possible scrapping of bans on working hour restrictions for coach drivers. At issue was whether they would be allowed to work for 12 consecutive days. A day by day round-up of the session is available in the following pages.

Monday's plenary: polluter pays, making e-shopping safer
The cost of pollution in Western France 2008. MEPs want tougher penalties A one minute silence for a Spanish Civil Guard officer killed in a recent ETA bomb attack opened the May session of the European Parliament. First up Monday was punishment for polluters, notably criminal sanctions - up to and including imprisonment - for environmental lawbreakers. In the evening Members debated a consumer strategy for Europe and ways that e-shopping can be made safer - a move that could benefit small businesses.
Calling for a minute's silence for the murdered Guardia Civil officer, the victim of the ETA car bomb attack at the police barracks of Legutiano (Alava) in northern Spain last Wednesday, Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering said "parliament condemns the disgraceful act in its most determined terms. On behalf of the EP I would like to express our solidarity with the people of Spain." Polluter pays principle getting tougher The possible introduction of EU wide criminal sanctions for polluters seriously damaging the environment was the first item tackled by MEPs. Under the proposed measures, polluters could face hefty financial sanctions or jail if they commit deliberate or negligent acts that cause injury to people, air, soil, water, plants or animals. Parliament's rapporteur, German Christian Democrat Hartmut Nassauer, said in future offences against the environment should be punished in the name of the EU, noting that this is a far-reaching and remarkable step, as the Union does not have such powers under existing criminal law. A vote on the report will take place on Wednesday. Online retail - more security will help small business, says report According to the report on EU consumer strategy (2007-2013), by Finnish Socialist Lasse Lehtinen, one of the greatest obstacles to a fully operational internal market in retailing is lack of consumer confidence when shopping outside their home country or on the Internet. It calls for measures to make citizens feel equally safe when shopping via the internet or at the local corner shop in any EU Member State. The report suggests simple rules to make life simpler for small and medium-sized enterprises. It also wants strong, independent consumer organisations to be the basis of a consumer policy. Another of its proposals is for the establishment of a special European Consumer Ombudsman in the European Ombudsman's office. The report also underlines the need for adequate funding for such organisations by the Commission and EU countries. Speaking in the debate, Mr Lehtinen said, "this continent will not be able to compete in the global market if the constituent countries are not able to compete among themselves in the internal market".

Tuesday: discrimination, Roma, seas, coaches
The EU has 77,000 km of coast Tuesday saw three EU presidents launch the first European Maritime Day. The ceremony came after a wide-ranging debate in the House on European maritime policy. In the course of a varied day, MEPs also discussed employment, a long-running scam, combating discrimination, road transport and, in a debate held against the background of recent shocking events in Naples, the situation of Roma in Europe.
Combating discrimination In the morning, the House discussed a report on the progress made in equal opportunities and non-discrimination in the EU. Rapporteur British Liberal Liz Lynne called for a comprehensive anti-discrimination directive to combat any discrimination on grounds of disability, age, religion or belief and sexual orientation. The report also demands effective sanctions and support for victims, in particular in seeking legal redress. Not all members concurred with the comprehensive approach sought by Ms Lynne, but ultimately it was endorsed by the House as a whole. (See our interview with Ms Lynne and detailed report on the vote). Guidelines for employment policies MEPs also debated and adopted a report by Belgian Socialist Anne Van Lancker <Titre> on guidelines for the employment policies in the European Union. The rapporteur stressed the need for more security for workers, better jobs and equal opportunities. Her report states that it is extremely important to fight against discrimination, to promote access to employment for women as well as integration of migrants and minorities. Roma - a better deal In an animated debate, added to the agenda on Monday, MEPs also discussed the situation of the Roma. Passions ran high as attention focused on Italy, following recent attacks on a Roma camp in the Naples area. MEPs called on EU members to enforce respect for fundamental rights and to facilitate the inclusion of the Roma in society. Europe's Social Affairs Commissioner Vladimír Špidla said “it is the very meaning of European Union to overcome racist hatred, pogroms and destruction by fire". A Roma camp in Naples was attacked this week by locals incensed by the alleged attempt by a Roma girl to kidnap a baby. European Maritime Day is launched On the first European Maritime Day, the European Parliament adopted a report by German Socialist Willi Piecyk on an integrated maritime policy aimed at answering the new challenges of climate change, international piracy and better protection of workers. European Maritme Day was officially launched by Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering , Council President Janez Janša and Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso. Question on a pan-European listing “scam” Internal Market Committee chair Arlene McCarthy asked the Council what it would do to prevent sharp practices by 'Directory companies', such as 'European City Guides', who extract money from small businesses across the continent for unsolicited directory listings. Members across the House cited mailbags overflowing with letters from constituents on this subject and demanded action. Transport In a debate on three proposals aimed at modernising the rules on the road transport market, the question of whether to undo some former regulation was posed. Emblematic was the so called 12 day rule for international coach trips. This envisages the reintroduction of the rule for round trips by coach, whereby drivers are permitted to work for a period of 12 consecutive days, making feasible long international travel for tourists with lower incomes. Equality rapporteur Liz Lynne reviews progress so far MEPs call for comprehensive legislation to combat discrimination Violence against the Roma goes beyond Italy, say MEPs EU maritime policy: A European vision for the oceans and seas
Wednesday: Turkey, crisis in Burma, China
China - the people of Beichuan mourn Turkey's EU aspirations were debated by MEPs on Wednesday morning. Parliament's rapporteur on Turkey, Ria Oomen-Ruijten (EPP-ED), called for 2008 to be "a year of reforms". Later the House voted to support criminal sanctions for offences against the environment. MEPs also debated recent natural disasters in Burma and China - deploring the obstruction of Rangoon and praising the reaction and transparency of China. A treaty to ban uranium shells was also on the agenda.
Turkey progress in 2007 - "We have a mixed picture" Speaking about Turkey's 2007 progress towards EU accession, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, said that only the new Turkish constitution will guarantee the separation between the state and religion and safeguard the protection of religious and ethnic minorities - namely Kurds. "We have a mixed picture, a lot more needs to be done, in order for Turkey to keep their promises to the EU and to their own people." Women's and children's rights, trades unions and cultural and linguistic freedoms were quoted in the report as among the areas where Turkish authorities still have serious backlogs. In addition, so-called "honour killings" and a failure by Ankara to acknowledge the Armenian genocide as well as bans on political parties were all matters cited by members in the debate as indicators of Turkey's continued need to reform. The adopted report says recent changes to the controversial Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code is a "first step towards a fundamental reform of that article as well as other articles of the Penal Code, and looks forward to further moves in this respect." Parliament adds that in its view "the repeal of Article 301 and other legal provisions representing an illegitimate restriction on freedom of expression as guaranteed by international law would be the best solution." In her speech Ms Oomen-Ruijten welcomed the fact that in 2007 the country stood up to the military and said she wanted Turkey to remain a "lay state". Criminal measures to protect the environment In adopting a report by German Christian Democrat Hartmut Nassauer, MEPs agreed on the principle that governments should apply criminal measures to punish any illegal behaviour likely to seriously injure people or damage the environment. The entry into force of this legislation would oblige national government to apply "effective, proportionate and dissuasive" criminal penalties to specific cases. Burma cyclone and its generals - "dialogue of the deaf" As the situation continues to deteriorate in Burma following dramatically cyclone Nargis, MEPs were united in denouncing the ruling military Junta for its reluctance to accept international aid and in urging, the international community to work through the UN to pressurise Burma's Generals. Speakers from the Socialist, Liberal, Green and Union of Nation's groups said the Burmese military's behaviour was a "crime against humanity" and said the Generals should face international justice. The speaker for the largest group in parliament, the EPP-ED group, said they wanted other Asian countries to put more pressure on the regime in Rangoon. Earlier EU Aid Commissioner Louis Michel called his fact-finding trip to Burma a "dialogue of the deaf" with Burmese officials. He said epidemics such as diarrhoea and malnutrition affected hundreds of thousand of people. China quake - Beijing praised for openness to help In contrast, China was praised for way it had reacted to the 12 May quake in Sichuan province and its willingness to accept international aid. Many MEPs expressed condolences to Chinese people. Speaking for the Slovene Presidency Janez Lenarčič told MEPs that 10 million had been affected and that 50,000 were dead. Louis Michel said the EU has funded Red Cross blankets, tents, food and drinking water. All groups praised the transparency of Beijing and the willingness to allow media access. The Speaker for the Socialist group said that the EU should help China with reconstruction The EPP-ED and Green speakers voiced concerns over construction of buildings, especially schools. Depleted uranium weapons A group of MEPs tabled oral questions to the Commission and the Council on the Global treaty to ban uranium weapons. In November 2006, the Parliament called for a moratorium on uranium weapons in a resolution on ‘biological weapons and inhumane conventional weapons. The oral question urges Commission and The Council to follow up the document. In December 2007, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution highlighting concerns over the military use of uranium that urges UN member states to re-examine the health hazards posed by the use of uranium weapons. Dutch Green Eli de Groen said that of EU/NATO members only Germany, Italy and Ireland supported the UN resolution. "World storage of depleted uranium weapons is estimated at 1.3 million tons, while far less then one microgram of the material in the body can be fatal to humans," she told fellow MEPs. Italian MEP Stefano Zappalà (EPP-ED) underlined that uranium "pollutes water, soil and agricultural crops". Turkey's 2007 progress report Current mitigation efforts on climate change “insufficient”, say MEPs in interim report Oral question to Council - Uranium
Thursday: European Training Foundation, aid effectiveness
MEPs push for more effective rules on development aid MEPs agreed Thursday proposals to extend the scope of the Turin-based European Training Foundation (ETF) to new areas. They also looked at simplifying aid procedures to developing countries, to make aid more effective, step up the fight against corruption and to take into account the recipients' priorities and timetables. They also voted on a new animal health strategy for the EU 2007-2013 and resolutions on Burma, China, Lebanon and Belarus.
European Training Foundation The ETF was set up in 1990 to help develop vocational training systems in neighbouring countries. Since then EU policies on education and training and on external relations have changed, meaning it's time to take another look at the aims of the ETF. MEPs adopted a report by French Liberal Bernard Lehideux, including proposals allowing the ETF to operate in all partner countries and extending its scope to include human resource development, particularly education and training with a view to lifelong learning. "The new regulation will allow the ETF to operate in all of the EU's partner countries, including outside the framework of the neighbourhood policy or the pre-accession programmes," Mr Lehideux said. Aid effectiveness MEPs also debated a report by Belgian Liberal Johan Van Hecke on aid effectiveness. It calls on the Commission to strengthen parliamentary scrutiny in the countries receiving development aid and promote cross-country policy dialogue between European donors to tackle the problem of orphan countries and sectors. During the debate, Mr Van Hecke said aid remains too "donor-oriented" and not sufficiently "demand-driven." He added, "for the first time since 2000 the percentage used for official aid has decreased from 0.41% of GNP in 2006 to 0.38% in 2007. In order to achieve the Millennium Goals a dramatic change of course is necessary." EU countries have spent €1.8 billion less than promised on aid and MEPs warned against "donor fatigue". Some drew a direct link between the deficiencies of CAP and poverty in Africa, an argument rejected by Development Commissioner Louis Michel. The report says:
aid procedures should be simplified
better donor coordination is needed
practical measures are needed to fight corruption
aid should be disbursed according to the partners' priorities and timelines. Joint resolutions voted Thursday :
global treaty to ban uranium weapons
natural disaster in China
tragic situation in Burma
negotiations between the EU and the US on visa exemptions
rising food prices
the arrest of political opponents in Belarus Follow-up to the 2005 Paris Declaration on aid effectiveness ETF report Votes of the day
