External Parliamentary Activities
South Sudan. A delegation from the Development Committee will be in Juba to assess the EU’s response to the humanitarian and development needs of the new country (Monday to Friday).
The week is otherwise set aside for MEPs to work in their constituencies, so there are no official meetings of parliamentary bodies in Brussels.
