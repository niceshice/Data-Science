A Standard Missile 3 (SM-3) Block 1A launches from the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyer JS Kirishima (DD 174) Oct. 30, 2010. The test was conducted as part of a U.S. and Japanese exercise with participation from the U.S. Navy Aegis-class guided missile cruisers USS Lake Erie (CG 70) and USS Russell (DDG 59).Â©BELGA The long running issue of missile defence was discussed by the European Parliament's Security and Defence Sub Committee on 30 November. At a recent NATO summit Washington's missile defence shield plans were cautiously adopted. Representatives of the Alliance and US diplomats debated with MEPs the implications of the shield for Europe's defence and its relations with its neighbours.
The US plans for missile defence date back to the Reagan Administration and the still born "Star Wars" programme. The plans were revived as a missile defence shield under the George W. Bush's time in office. A recent NATO summit in Lisbon pledged the 28 member organisation to push ahead with a missile defense capability and invited Russia to take part.
The plans have aroused controversy as they involve deploying ship-based interceptors in the Mediterranean and land-based mobile interceptors in Romania and Poland. It is intended to protect all NATO members from attack although there are complications as only 21 of the 27 EU countries are in NATO. There are also questions about it will affect the development of European defence.
The delicate nature of the plans were confirmed by the Chair of the Security and Defence Sub Committee Arnaud Danjean. The French MEP noted that "it is very sensitive issue. There are those who see this capability is part of nuclear deterrence, others see the project is replacement of it" he noted.
Robert G. Bell from US mission to NATO told MEPs that "this project is not ideological construct, it is simple about prudence. Iranian missiles exist today that can reach targets in Europe."
Russia invited to join
Russia 's attitude towards the whole scheme could prove crucial as many in the Kremlin originally believed believe the missiles are in fact targeted at them. The US is anxious to allay those fears and according to US planners Russia could be involved in the missile shield scheme. Dmitry Rogozin from Russia's representative to NATO told the Parliamentary hearing that "right now our relationships with NATO are particularly effective and positive" although Russia is thought to have reservations about who missile defence is supposed to be directed at.
According to vice-chair of the Committee Norica Nicolai (ALDE), the shield will benefit the EU. "It is our interest to have close cooperation with NATO. We can benefit from those NATO assets that are outside the scope of the EU Security and Defence Policy" she said.
Ms Nicolai later remarked that the European Parliament has an "important role of scrutinising all the advancements done in this field, asking for enhanced cooperation with NATO and providing a forum of dialogue with all partners involved in the missile project", she added.
Countries outside NATO
The issue of European Union countries not in NATO was also raised by Polish MEP Krzysztof Lisek (EPP). Robert G. Bell from US mission to NATO told MEPs said that we "expect consultations with countries like Sweden and Finland to make sure we understand how they see this development".
Ahead of a proposed EU-US summit Parliament recently adopted a resolution parts of which relate to security. In the resolution Parliament "emphasises the importance of NATO as the cornerstone of transatlantic security and calls for strategic cooperation between the US and the EU" and goes on to say "that it underlines the importance of the CSDP (Common Security and Defence Policy) and the value of an enhanced European defence capability in strengthening transatlantic security".
