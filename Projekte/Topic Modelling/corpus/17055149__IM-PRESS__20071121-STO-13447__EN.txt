Cocaine use continues to rise
Cocaine use is up, heroin is down and the use of cannabis is widespread. After over a decade of rising drug use, Europe may now be entering a more stable phase - albeit at historically high levels, according to the latest report from the Lisbon-based EU drugs agency. In presenting the annual report to MEPs on 21 November, concerns over high levels of drug-related deaths and an upward trend in cocaine use were highlighted.
Members of Parliament's Civil Liberties Committee heard that around 3 million may be using cannabis on a daily or almost daily basis. Nearly a quarter of all adults in the EU (around 70 million aged 15-64) have tried cannabis at some point in their lives, and around 7%, or 23 million, have used it in the last year. Although its popularity among young people is declining, use remains high among young males. An average of 13% of 13-34 year old Europeans used cannabis over the past year. The highest rates are 20% in Spain, 19.3% in the Czech Republic and around 16% in France, Italy and the UK.
During a Parliament press conference, Wolfgang GÃ¶tz, director of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) said: "I think we can be cautiously optimistic that the escalation of cannabis use that we have seen in Europe since the 1990s may now have reached its peak." The report also notes positive signs that heroin use and drug injection have become declined.
Cocaine Europe's stimulant drug of choice
Despite wide variations between countries, the latest data confirms cocaine's place as Europe's stimulant drug of choice and the second most commonly used illicit drug after cannabis and ahead of ecstasy and amphetamines.
EMCDDA estimates that around 4.5 million Europeans used cocaine in the last year, compared with 3.5 million in 2006 - although Mr Gotz explained that some of the rise can be explained by better reporting by EU countries.
Europe fails to reduce drug-related deaths
The report says that Europe is not making enough progress in reducing drug-related deaths. There are 7,000-8,000 deaths a year from overdoses; typically overdose victims are men in their late-20s to mid-30s.
Civil liberties committee vice-chairman Giusto Catania (an Italian MEP from the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left), who drafted the 2004 EP recommendation on EU drugs strategy (2005-2012), said that in his personal view figures show that the EU drug strategy does not work. "We have to change our strategy on how to combat drug use." He said a repressive prohibition policy is not the answer.
According to a Commission representative questioned by MEPs, the route of legalising certain drugs "is not on the political radar." As far as the European Commission is concerned, the preferred approach is to try to create an accurate, objective evidence based approach.
