MEPs adopted a legislative report on mutual assistance between the Member States for application of the law on customs and agricultural matters. Ahead of the vote, the rapporteur Bill NEWTON DUNN (ALDE, UK) said: "This is an important measure to counter cross-border crime in the light of technological developments and of enlargement of the Union. I am glad that objections about sovereignty by several member states in the Council have been overcome and we are able to agree on first-reading."
The goal of this regulation proposal is to bring the existing Council Regulation (EC) 515/97 of 13 March 1997 in line with the new Community powers in the area of customs cooperation, while at the same time strengthening the cooperation and data exchanges between Member States and between them and the Commission. The purpose of this proposal, is to roll out a new Anti-Fraud Information System, (AFIS) in a bid to improve its overall functionality.
The European Parliament says that the Commission should be authorised to provide all forms of technical assistance and training to the liaison officers of third countries and of European or international organisations and agencies, including Europol and Frontex.
The report also says that data exchanges with third countries governed by this Regulation should be subject to prior verification that data protection rules in the receiving country, particularly in relation to the processing of personal data, offer a degree of protection equivalent to that offered by EU rules.
The Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, must each year submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a report on the measures taken in implementation of this Regulation.
