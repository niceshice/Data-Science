EU institute of technology - MEPs prepare to voice their view

An example of European technology: German semi-conductors
The Massachusetts institute of technology is famous for its scientific research - but does Europe need an equivalent and would it be money well spent? A European institute of technology (EIT) was proposed in 2005 by Commission President Barroso to boost innovation and research. On 9 July MEPs on the Industry Committee consider a report on whether to support the regulation setting up the EIT. Whether the EIT represents added value or if it will undercut existing research projects is a key issue.
There are a number of indicators that have some commentators worried about the relative decline of the European science and innovation sector. A survey by "Newsweek" magazine last year placed only 3 European Universities in the world's top 20. More anecdotal evidence of this "decline" is that India is now producing more science graduates than Europe.
EIT could stimulate innovation and research
The basic aims of the EIT are to stimulate innovation, education and research through closer cooperation ("synergy") with business, higher education and research institutions. It will also help establish "best practices" in education. Preventing a "brain drain" of European talent to the US and other places abroad is another key aim.
Part of Mr Barroso's enthusiasm for the institute is his ambition to breathe life into the EU's "Lisbon strategy" of creating a "knowledge based economy" by 2010.
Parliament's rapporteur on the issue is Finnish Socialist Member Reino Paasilinna. He said that "Europe's Achilles' heel has been insufficient investment in research and development. The three pillars of the EIT will be research, education and innovation, and it is in particular innovation we are now going to tackle".
He stressed the need for Europe to play to its strengths rather than compete on labour costs: "Europe cannot compete on labour costs: that's why we need to focus on sectors that promote intelligence and knowledge. The EIT will help in particular SMEs to benefit from innovations".
"EIT Label" under consideration
The plans as they stand are for the EIT to be run by a governing board appointed by the Commission. In turn the board would select "Knowledge and Innovation Communities" (KICs) - basically partnerships of universities, research organisations and businesses. MEPs want the European Parliament involved in the appointment of the government board and in the selection of strategic priorities for the institute.
Also under current consideration is an additional "EIT label" for recognised diplomas awarded by universities and higher-education institutes participating in the KICs.
The level of funding for the institute has been estimated at â‚¬2.4 billion for the period 2008-2013. It is envisaged that this would come from a combination of EU, public and private sources. It has been acknowledged that if the EIT can bring in its own sources of revenue through research then this would make it a more viable entity.
Rapporteur favours "pilot project"
There has been some concern as to whether the EIT will overlap or undermine existing European and national research projects. There is also the danger that it could divert funding away from other sources.
Addressing this point Mr Paasilinna said that "the EIT is part of a process that also includes the establishment of the European Research Council. As the Institute it will have a very independent structure, there should be no fear of 'cannibalisation' of other projects or programmes such as....the 7th Research Framework Programme (FP7)".
Perhaps mindful of concerns about overlap the rapporteur's draft report states that "as for the EIT's added value in terms of innovation and competitiveness, this can only be established after a thorough review of a pilot project".
It goes on to say that "only then should it be decided whether the EIT should be established as a permanent body or if Europe would be better served by directing the funds to other innovation and R&D activities".
MEPs on Parliament's Industry will consider the issue on 9 July whilst the full Plenary is expected to consider it in late September.
