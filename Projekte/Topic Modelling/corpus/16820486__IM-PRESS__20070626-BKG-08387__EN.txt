Roaming made easy

The EU's mobile roaming regulation comes into force on 30 June 2007. Thanks to an agreement brokered by the European Parliament, this new law will cut the cost of making and receiving mobile telephone calls while abroad in the EU, for at least 140 million users. In fact, many operators, anticipating the regulation's entry into force, have already begun to reduce roaming call charges. Prices should fall even further by the summer holidays.
As some of the regulation's provisions come into force later than others, mobile users may be asking: how (and when) can I make the most of them? This note briefly describes how it will work.

What is the Eurotariff?
The roaming regulation will enable consumers to benefit from a so-called Eurotariff , a price cap for mobile telephone calls made (€0.49 per minute , excluding VAT) and for calls received (€0.24 per minute , excluding. VAT), when abroad. These price caps will be lowered further in 2008 (to € 0.46 and € 0.22) and 2009 (€ 0.43 and € 0.19). The intention of EU lawmakers is not to set prices at the level of the Eurotariff, but to set a ceiling beneath which mobile operators can compete by offering prices below – or even well below – the Eurotariff, and still earn a reasonable return.
When does it come into force? How can I best take advantage of it?
The roaming regulation becomes law in all EU Member States on Saturday, 30 June. This means that:
Your mobile operator will have until 30 July to offer you a Eurotariff rate (i.e. one equal to or lower than the Eurotariff price caps). Some operators have already pledged to do so as early as 1 July.
You yourself will have two months after such an offer is made to respond . Since your operator has up to a month following your response to activate the Eurotariff rates, the sooner you act the better.

If, for example, your operator offers you the Eurotariff price caps on 1 July (and if you accept the offer immediately), you will receive the Eurotariff at some point over the next 30 days – as soon as 1 July or, at the very latest, 1 August. This depends on your operator.

In any case – should you respond immediately to your operator’s offer – the absolute latest date by which you will benefit from the Eurotariff price caps is 30 August 2007 .
If you do not respond at all (and if you do not already have a specific roaming package), the Eurotariff price caps will come into effect automatically two months after the date of the operator’s offer – i.e. as soon as 30 August or as late as 30 September 2007.
If you already have a specific roaming contract , you will not receive a Eurotariff automatically. However, your operator should remind you of the existence of such a contract and you may still choose to switch into the Eurotariff system.
Switching tariff plans
Once you have been granted a Eurotariff rate, you may apply to switch out of it – and back into it – at any time, free of charge. The home provider may delay the switch until the previous roaming tariff has been effective for a minimum period of no more than three months.
