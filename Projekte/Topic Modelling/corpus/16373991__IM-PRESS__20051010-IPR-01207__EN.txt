EU funding to combat euro counterfeiting under the 'Pericles' programme should be available to all Member States and not just the twelve who have the euro as their currency. This is the substance of a proposal from the Council approved by MEPs on Thursday.
Parliament adopted a non-binding report from drawn up by Agustín DIAZ DE MERA GARCIA CONSUEGRA (EPP-ED, ES) which approved the decision without amendment.
