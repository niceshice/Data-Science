EU plans for protecting biological diversity
2010-10-06 - 15:42
What role can the EU play in efforts to stem the loss of biological diversity? This will be the focus of a parliamentary debate on Wednesday, when the EU's strategy for the upcoming COP 10 Convention on Biological Diversity, as well as the links between biodiversity and development, will be discussed with the Commission and Council. A resolution will be put to the vote on Thursday. Ahead of the COP 10 meeting on Biological Diversity, to be held in Nagoya (Japan) next 18-29 October, MEPs will discuss the European Union's key strategic objectives for the conference, which is taking place in UN International Year of Biodiversity.
In a resolution adopted by Parliament on 21 September, MEPs stressed that the EU delegation to the conference should be broad-based, well-prepared and coordinated, and that a strong EU position must set in advance. Parliament will be sending a 10-member delegation of its own to Nagoya.
Biodiversity and development
In the debate MEPs will ask Commission and Council about their policy plans to ensure that the protection of biodiversity can help reduce poverty and attain the Millennium Development Goals and that biodiversity is mainstreamed into other economic sector activities.

Visa-free regime for Albania and Bosnia-Herzegovina moves closer
2010-10-06 - 15:42
Citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Albania will be exempt from EU visa requirements by the end of this year if the full Parliament backs a recommendation by the Civil Liberties Committee. The European Commission indicated last May that the two countries meet all the security requirements and recommended that visa restrictions be lifted. On 30 November 2009 the EU decided to waive visa requirements for citizens of Serbia, Montenegro and the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, a decision which took effect on 19 December that year. Bosnia-Herzegovina and Albania did not meet all the criteria at the time (relating to illegal immigration, public policy and security).
Last May, however, the Commission decided that the two countries had made good progress and therefore recommended that Parliament and the Council give the go-ahead to abolish the visa requirements by the end of the year, for visits of less than three months. The Civil Liberties Committee's recommendation, drafted by Tanja Fajon (S&D, SL), backs the Commission's proposal. Only holders of biometric passports will be exempt from the visa rules.
Kosovo still "outside the process"
However, the draft recommendation regrets that Kosovo remains "the only part of the Western Balkans still totally outside the process of visa liberalisation" because of "the split between Member States over recognition of its independence".
The UK and Ireland have not opted in to this legislation.

President of Timor-Leste to address Parliament
2010-10-06 - 15:42
José Ramos-Horta, President of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste (East Timor) since 2007 and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996, is to address MEPs in a formal sitting on Wednesday 6 October. Timor-Leste, which became independent in May 2002, is a country where the EU has massively invested in the democratic process. The European Parliament sent observers to the 2007 presidential and parliamentary elections. Timor-Leste joined the group of African, Caribbean and Pacific countries in 2005. The 1999 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought was awarded to the current Prime Minister Xanana Gusmão. Timor-Leste's two official languages are Tetum and Portuguese.

10.10.10 - World Day against the Death Penalty
2010-10-06 - 15:42
MEPs will mark the 8th World Day against the Death Penalty by voting on a resolution on capital punishment. Parliament has repeatedly condemned the death penalty in all cases and all circumstances and has called for an unconditional worldwide moratorium on executions. According to Amnesty International, eighteen countries are known to have carried out executions in 2009, putting a total of at least 714 people to death; however, this figure does not include the thousands of executions that are likely to have taken place in China. Among countries with the highest number of executions besides China are Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, USA and Yemen.

Globalisation Fund: EU aid for redundant workers in Spain and Denmark
2010-10-06 - 15:42
The European Parliament will vote on proposals to provide nearly €12 million in EU aid to 1,649 workers in Spain and Denmark who became redundant following the closure of their companies. The total financial assistance envisaged is €11,951,544. The funding for Denmark will go to two machinery manufacturers in the Syddanmark region, Linak A.S. and the Danfoss Group. For Spain the funds will go to Galicia, where 82 companies in the textile and clothing industry had to lay off staff between 1 March and 30 June 2009. The EP Budgets Committee has backed the plans but the approval of the full Parliament and the Council of Ministers is still needed.
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was established to provide additional support for workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation or the financial crisis, and to help them rejoin the labour market.

Sexual violence in Congo: bringing the perpetrators to book
2010-10-06 - 15:42
. MEPs will vote on Thursday on a resolution on the serious lack of progress in terms of human rights in Congo, a country ravaged by conflict for decades, where sexual violence against women and children has been used as a weapon of war.
The draft resolution urges the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to fight impunity against these atrocities and calls for the rule of law in the DRC to be strengthened. The resolution, which is being tabled by EP political groups, may also propose the introduction of EU legislation, similar to the US conflict minerals act, to ensure better traceability of rare natural resources which are exploited, mainly illegally, in the DRC. This vote is a follow-up to the debate on human rights in Congo held in Strasbourg on 22 September.

Budget approval for European Police College set to be refused
2010-10-06 - 15:42
. The EP Budgetary Control Committee is recommending that Parliament refuse to sign off the budget of the European Police College (CEPOL) for the financial year 2008. Although Parliament has so far approved the budgetary management of all the other EU agencies, the committee finds it unacceptable that CEPOL, which was established as an agency in 2006 and is based in Bramshill, Hampshire , has yet to meet good administrative standards.
This unique and unanimous recommendation by the committee that the budget discharge be refused follows Parliament's May 2010 decision to postpone the CEPOL discharge and request an action plan and a list of specific remedial measures with an implementation timetable. The action plan was provided but the specific remedial measures were deemed insufficient by the Budgetary Control Committee.
Committee MEPs were also able to consult confidential documents providing information on the recovery status of money that had been used for private expenses, the management shortcomings attributable to CEPOL's previous director and the way in which the new board handled the situation. "It made the seriousness of the shortcomings crystal clear. We have had all the necessary information to make a political decision to refuse the discharge", said rapporteur Veronique Mathieu (EPP, FR).

Container losses at sea: preventive action needed
2010-10-06 - 15:42
. More than 2000 shipping containers are lost overboard in EU waters every year. On Wednesday the Transport Committee will urge the Commission to improve container lashing procedures and equipment and ensure that all containers are weighed in port and correctly stowed before vessels head to sea.
The use of automatically activated beacons to aid container location should be investigated and the legal compensation regime updated, suggests the Transport Committee in an oral question to the Commission drafted by its chair Brian Simpson (S&D, UK).
