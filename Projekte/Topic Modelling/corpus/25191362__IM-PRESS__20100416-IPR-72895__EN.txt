Plenary Session – Strasbourg
SWIFT/PNR. The transfer of data between Europe and, in particular, the USA, come under scrutiny, with MEPs set to adopt their latest positions on the SWIFT financial messaging system and the issue of airline passenger name records (debates Wednesday, votes Thursday).
Discharge 2008. MEPs will vote on whether to approve the EU institutions’ financial management in 2008, while making recommendations on how to improve the way EU funds are spent. The Budgetary Control Committee suggests granting discharge to all institutions and agencies apart from the Council and the European Police College (debate and vote Wednesday).
Commission work programme. José Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission, will present his institution’s legislative and work programme to Parliament and debate the plans with MEPs (Tuesday).
Energy efficiency. Parliament will hold what are likely to be the final votes on legislation to improve the energy efficiency of buildings (debate Wednesday, vote Thursday) and energy labelling of goods (vote Wednesday). In both cases, MEPs have reached agreement with the Council.
Airport security charges. Parliament will debate and vote on EU rules on airport security. The Transport Committee wants to insist that if Member States impose more stringent procedures than those agreed jointly at EU level, the additional costs should be paid from government budgets, rather than passed on to consumers (debate Monday, vote Tuesday).
Animal welfare. MEPs will vote on a call for more inspections and effective penalties to improve the protection of animals, notably those reared for food (debate Monday, vote Tuesday).
Jerzy Buzek visits United States. The EP President begins an official visit to the United States (Washington DC and New York) at the end of the week (Sunday).
