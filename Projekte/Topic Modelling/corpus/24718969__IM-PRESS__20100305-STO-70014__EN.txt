SOLVIT © European Commission - 2002 The EU's internal market will be under scrutiny Tuesday when a series of reports will be debated by MEPs in Strasbourg. Among the issues being discussed will be ways of resolving disputes without legal action and improving people's knowledge of the options open to them. The debate will be held Tuesday from 0900 CET and you can watch live online.
SOLVIT was created in 2002 to solve problems that arise for citizens and businesses due to the misapplication of internal market law. SOLVIT is an online problem-solving network in which member states work together to solve problems without going to court.
In terms of complaints non-recognition of professional qualifications gained in one EU state but not recognised in another is the major one.
Common website needed says MEP
A report by Romanian Liberal Cristian Silviu Buşoi calls for SOLVIT's capacity to be increased and concludes many citizens are not aware of it and therefore turn to the European Ombudsman with their problems.
He believes that member states should increase the awareness of SOLVIT. The report also asks for a common European institution website that will refer EU citizens directly to the institution or body competent to handle their complaint.
Covers safety of toys
A report from Swedish Social Democrat Anna Hedh calls for the strengthening of market surveillance so that products circulating meet high safety standards.
The report also calls on the Commission to monitor and periodically revise the guidelines used by the rapid alert system for dangerous non-food consumer goods (Rapex), in order to improve the functioning of the system. Rapex system applies to things like toys and Christmas lights.
Ms Hedh supports the Commission’s initiative to step up international cooperation on the safety of products and pursue formal agreements with enforcement authorities in third countries, in particular China, the US and Japan.
Annual gathering of all those concerned to discuss options
Polish MEP Róża Thun's (centre right European People's Party), report on the Internal Market Scoreboard calls on the Commission to organise an annual Internal Market Forum to establish a clearer commitment to the application and enforcement of internal market legislation.
It also wants EU states to step up their efforts in providing information to citizens and businesses about their rights in the internal market and says the Commission should streamline information, advice and problem-solving assistance services and makes them more accessible.
