The idea was to give the floor to the human rights activists - the people "who in their daily work make the ideals of the Universal Declaration a reality" (UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders Margaret Sekaggya)
Human rights defenders from all over the world (community leaders, lawyers, journalists, trade unionist, women and children's rights activists) and representatives of international human rights organisation came to the Parliament to share their experience and to discuss new ways of advancing human rights.
The conference praised the Human rights defenders
Justice Commissioner Jacques Barrot pointed to the availability of a special budget of €16 million earmarked for human rights defenders for 2007-2010, Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering described the 1948 Declaration as "a major victory of our civilisation" and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navanethem Pillay, stressing the "centrality" of the role of human rights defenders underscored in particular the role of defenders of women's rights and that of advocates for migrants' rights.
Apart from oral presentations, films on human rights were shown and two well-known cartoonists, Jean Plantu and Ali Dilem, drew illustrations for the occasion that were projected onto large screens. See some of their work during the hearing in our slideshow.
