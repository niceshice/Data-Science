Montage of Sakharov ceremony, money Â©Belga&Getty In a hectic six months, MEPs negotiated a 2012 budget that met EP concerns about growth, innovation and employment and got stuck into deciding how the EU long-term budget should look in future as well as the reform of farm policy. The EP marked the momentous events in the Arab world by awarding this year's Sakharov prize for freedom of thought to five Arab Spring activists.
Not surprisingly, a lot of the EP's work this year was focused on trying to get the EU through the economic crisis that is still ravaging Europe.

Also below you will find links to our Sakharov feature, including interviews with the laureates, a dossier on the 2012 budget as well as features on CAP reform and the long term budget.
