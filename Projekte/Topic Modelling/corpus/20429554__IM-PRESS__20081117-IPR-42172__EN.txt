MEPs adopted an own-initiative report on protecting the consumer: improving consumer education and awareness on credit and finance. Overall, the report welcomes the Commission initiatives to educate consumers on finance and credit because "empowered and educated consumers help to foster competition, quality and innovation within the banking and financial services industries".
The recently set up Expert Group on Financial Education and the proposed online database of financial education schemes and research in the EU are particularly welcome, it says.
Finance education in schools
The House calls on the Commission to develop educational programmes relating to personal finance, which can be adapted to the specific needs of each Member State, and encourages Member States to include financial education in primary and secondary schools.
Training programmes should also be set up in Member States for social workers who deal with persons at risk of poverty or excessive debt, the report says.
Quality information over quantity
The rapporteur states that "effective, clear and comprehensible information, particularly in advertisements for financial products, is necessary". "Financial institutions should provide sufficient information before contracts are concluded and should strictly apply the rules laid down in Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on markets in financial instruments (Mifid) and Directive 2008/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2008 on credit agreements for consumers."
However, the report acknowledges that "overloading" the consumer with information would be counterproductive, stressing the need for "quality over quantity".
