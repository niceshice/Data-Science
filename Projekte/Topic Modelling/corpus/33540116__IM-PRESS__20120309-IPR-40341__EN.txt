John SCHRANZ BXL (+32) 2 28 44264 STR (+33) 3 881 74076 PORT (+32) 498 98 14 02 EMAIL econ-press@europarl.europa.eu On Tuesday at 09.00h Parliament holds its regular post-European Council debriefing with Council President Herman Van Rompuy and Commission President Jos√© Manuel Barroso. The 1-2 March summit was hailed by EP President Martin Schulz as the first in two years not to have focused exclusively on crisis management, but many MEPs are likely to criticise its pledges to restore growth as too timid.
