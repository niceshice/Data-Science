MEPs to step up scrutiny of EU foreign and security policies
2010-03-04 - 17:08
MEPs believe the EU must enhance its strategic autonomy and conduct a strong and effective foreign, security and defence policy, and mean to use their budgetary power and democratic right to scrutinise these policies, including funding for the EU external action service, say two resolutions to be debated and put to the vote on 10 March. MEPs must have more say in the appointment and mandates of EU Special Representatives, says the draft resolution on the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) in 2008, drafted by Foreign Affairs Committee chair Gabriele Albertini (EPP, IT).
The other draft resolution, drawn up by Security and Defence Sub-Committee chair Arnaud Danjean (EPP, FR), looks at how the Lisbon Treaty will affect the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). MEPs say that the new US anti-missile system should take account of the EU approach and must be planned "in dialogue with Russia". They also call for faster deployment of EU operations.
The High Representative, Catherine Ashton, will be present for the debate. Procedure: own-initiative reports + oral questions
Joint debate: 9am, 10.03.2010
Vote: 10.03.2010 2008 annual report of the CFSP Implementation of the European Security Strategy and the Common Security and Defence Policy Link to oral questions on Non-Proliferation Treaty

Gaza conflict: implementing the Goldstone recommendations
2010-03-04 - 17:08
MEPs may call for credible, independent investigations of alleged human rights breaches in the Gaza conflict when they vote on the findings of the UN fact-finding mission there led by former South African judge Richard Goldstone. A resolution on following up the Goldstone report will be voted on Wednesday 10 March. In a 24 February debate, MEPs called on both parties to conduct independent and credible investigations into allegations that international human rights and humanitarian law were violated during the December 2008/January 2009 military operation in Gaza. They also asked for an international enquiry, complying with international standards, into these allegations.
A day later, on 26 February, the UN General Assembly voted a non-binding text also calling for "independent and credible" investigations led by the Israelis and Palestinians. Ninety-eight states were in favour, seven against and 31 abstained. However, among EU Member States, there was no consensus position on this UN resolution. Debate: 24.02.2010
Vote: 10.03.2010 EP resolution of 25 February 2010 on the 13th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council UN General Assembly Requests Secretary-General To Submit Further Report on Investigations into Violations During Gaza Conflict (26 February) UN Secretary General's report (4 February 2010) UN General Assembly resolution 64/10 (1 December 2009) Watch the recording of the EP's debate - 24 February 2010

Economic and monetary affairs
Reducing red tape for small firms
2010-03-04 - 17:08
Very small companies could be exempted from having to draw up annual accounts if MEPs approve changes to EU accounting rules in Strasbourg next week. It would be up to each Member State to grant such exemptions, depending on the impact the directive would have in that country. Companies would in any case still have to keep records of their business transactions and financial situation. About 7.2 million EU companies are subject to reporting rules under EU accounting directives. Some 5.4 million (around 75%) of these are "micro-entities". They are primarily engaged in business at local or regional level, with little or no cross-border activity. This proposal would allow Member States to simplify the business environment for micro-companies by waiving the usual reporting requirements, thus boosting their competitiveness and growth potential.
The exemption from having to draw up annual accounts would apply to companies that meet two of the following criteria: balance sheet total under €500,000, net turnover under €1,000,000 and/or average of 10 employees during the financial year.
How much could be saved?
A study cited in the Commission's impact assessment concluded that the average cost per company of complying with the requirements of the accounting directives is €1,558. Of this amount, the administrative burden (i.e. collecting and processing information purely to satisfy legal obligations, without a real business need) is €1,169.

Energy
Investing in low carbon technologies
2010-03-04 - 17:08
MEPs want EU governments to give more priority to investments in low carbon technologies. In a question to the Council of EU Ministers, the Industry Committee is urging EU governments to make the financing of low carbon technologies one of the priorities in the 2010-2020 roadmap. The Council and Commission will also be asked to find extra money for implementing the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (or SET Plan), which aims to promote investments in low-carbon technologies and to guarantee that money will start flowing from 2010, in advance of funds from the multi-annual EU research programme starting in 2013. Finally, MEPs will ask the Commission to give a detailed answer about additional EU budget resources available in mid-term to finance carbon storage technologies, ocean energies and the renewable heating and cooling platform.

Better protection for EU holidaymakers: revision of package travel law
2010-03-04 - 17:08
Parliament will hear the Commission's plans for revising the 1990 Package Travel Directive, which protects consumers' rights when they book a package holiday through a travel agency. Passenger compensation in the event of airline insolvency is also set to be included in the revised legislation, something MEPs have demanded repeatedly since the recent series of bankruptcies in the low-cost sector. Holidaymakers increasingly organise their own packages themselves online. In the past two years, one in four people made up their own package, choosing two or more services (flight and hotel, for instance) from different suppliers. The revised legislation aims to reflect new market realities by including these new kinds of package holidays in its scope. Revision of the "Package Travel Directive

Citizens' rights
Call for better use of funds for Roma emancipation
2010-03-04 - 17:08
The issue of Roma inclusion will be debated with the Council and Commission on Tuesday, ahead of the second European Roma summit to be hosted by the Spanish Presidency (Cordoba, 8 April). MEPs will vote on a resolution at the next plenary session in late March. The oral question, tabled by the S&D group, contends that EU funding appears to have "limited impact" on the socio-economic situation of Roma people. It asks the Commission how it will prompt local authorities to make better use of the funds. The oral question also states that "Roma face both explicit and implicit discrimination" and calls on the Commission to tackle both visible discrimination (racist violence, hate speech) and invisible discrimination (unequal access to services and social provision).

Globalisation adjustment fund aid to Germany and Lithuania
2010-03-04 - 17:08
Three thousand former car, refrigerator and construction workers in Germany and Lithuania are to get €7.6 million in EU globalisation adjustment fund aid for training, self-employment and professional orientation if Parliament approves it on Tuesday. If approved, the EU globalisation adjustment fund (EGF) aid would go to three groups of unemployed workers:
• 1,793 former employees of the Karmann car manufacturing group in Germany would benefit from an aid programme worth €9,537,449 of which EU aid would cover €6,199,341,
• 806 former construction workers at various companies in Lithuania would get aid costing a total of €1,721,374, of which the EGF would cover €1,118,893, and
• 480 former workers at the Lithuanian refrigerator manufacturer AB Snaigė or two of its suppliers, UAB Jugos kabeliai and UAB Hoda, would get support worth €397,175, of which the EGF would cover €258,163.
In all three cases, the aid would help people to find or create new jobs through job-search assistance, training, promoting entrepreneurship and developing personalised employment plans.
The approval of both Parliament and the Council of Ministers is necessary to mobilise the aid. The Council is expected to give its approval on Monday 8 March. Parliament's reports on the plans were drafted by Reimer Böge (EPP, DE). Procedure: Budgetary

Belarus: civil society and national minorities
2010-03-04 - 17:08
The political situation and the position of national minorities in Belarus will be the focus of a vote by MEPs in Strasbourg next week. Poland recently decided to close its borders to Belarusians implicated in the harassment of Poles living in Belarus. The EP will vote on a resolution on Wednesday at noon, as a follow-up to its debate of 24 February. Jerzy Buzek, Parliament's President, met Sakharov Prize winner and Belarus opposition leader Aliaksandr Milinkevich, along with Angelika Borys, leader of the Union of Poles in Belarus, two weeks ago in Brussels. Mr Milinkevich and Mrs Borys also discussed the country's situation with Parliament's delegation for relations with Belarus. Debate: 24.02.2010

Schengen
Long-stay visa holders to have greater freedom to move around the EU
2010-03-04 - 17:08
A non-EU national staying in one of the Member States on a long-stay visa will be allowed to travel to most other Member States for three months in any six-month period under the same conditions as the holder of a residence permit, under a new regulation to be put to the vote in Parliament on 9 March. If approved, the regulation will enter into force on 5 April 2010. The increased freedom of movement should not pose any extra security risk, thanks to a system of controls and alerts, but will in any case not apply to the UK, Ireland or Denmark as a result of their opt-outs.
Reasons for the new rules
Under present Community law, long-stay visa holders - for example students or schoolchildren wanting to go on a study or field trip in another Member State, scientists, family members of third-country nationals and EU citizens - are not allowed to travel to other Member States during their stay, nor pass through the other states when returning to their country of origin, as the Schengen Convention does not allow for this.
The fact that a student who is granted a visa to attend a course in Belgium cannot travel to a specialised library in the Netherlands to obtain information for the purposes of writing his thesis or to Barcelona for a weekend visit "is simply unacceptable", argues Carlos Coelho (EPP, PT), author of the report by the EP Civil Liberties Committee. "This is an example of how absurd situations can arise", he believes.
With the new legislation, a long-stay visa (for stays exceeding three months) will - as regards the Schengen area - have the same effect as a residence permit: a third-country national holding a "long-stay D visa" issued by a Member State could travel to the other Member States for three months in any half year, under the same conditions as the holder of a residence permit.
Long-stay visas will be valid for no more than one year. If a third-country national is allowed to stay for more than that time, the long-stay visa has to be replaced before it expires by a residence permit.
No extra security risks
To meet any security concerns, the regulation states that non-EU citizens will be able to move freely "on the basis of that permit and a valid travel document", and only if they "are not on the national list of alerts of the Member State concerned". Most EU states will be able to use the Schengen Information System (SIS) to consult such lists but the UK and Ireland are not members of the Schengen area and will not be bound by or subject to the regulation. Denmark has a period of six months after the date of adoption of the regulation to decide whether it will enact it in its national law. Procedure: Ordinary legislative - first reading

Pet passports: special health checks to be prolonged for UK, Ireland, Finland, Sweden and Malta
2010-03-04 - 17:08
Temporary national measures to prevent the spread of rabies, tapeworm and ticks to Finland, Ireland, Malta, Sweden, and the UK could be prolonged for the last time until December 2011, if MEPs vote in favour on Tuesday. Otherwise, they will expire in June 2010. These national measures apply in addition to EU-wide rules, which since 2003 have required cats, dogs and ferrets travelling between EU Member States to be identified by an electronic microchip or a clearly readable tattoo and accompanied by a passport giving proof of an anti-rabies vaccination.
To prevent the spread of echinococcus tapeworm and ticks, Finland, Ireland, Malta, Sweden, and the UK are also temporarily entitled to subject pets entering their territory to additional checks. Procedure: ordinary legislative - 1st reading

Competition
Rail liberalisation in the EU: state of play
2010-03-04 - 17:08
MEPs will question the Commission on the action it intends to take against Member States who have failed to open up their railway markets to competition, in line with the requirements of the EU's First Railway Package legislation adopted in 2001. The legislative package is due for revision this autumn but Belgium, Germany, France, Spain, Italy and 16 other EU countries still do not comply with the existing rules on free competition, independence of infrastructure managers in relation to railway operators, and the use of cross-border compatible safety technologies.

Taxation
The best design for a financial transaction tax
2010-03-04 - 17:08
MEPs will ask the Commission to do an impact assessment by June on its plans for a financial transaction tax and to show how such a tax could help stabilise financial markets and prevent another crisis, by discouraging speculative activity. Parliament will also vote on Wednesday on a resolution calling for a global financial transaction tax to discourage excessive risk-taking by financial institutions and ensure that the industry pays for the damage done by the financial crisis. The resolution is also likely to suggest that if a worldwide tax proves unachievable, the EU could consider going it alone. Oral question

Competition
EU competition policy debate and resolution
2010-03-04 - 17:08
In an EU competition policy debate on Monday, MEPs will probably focus on the need to evaluate the effectiveness of Member States' state-aid activities during the crisis, the possible need to update EU competition rules and the need to give Parliament more say in competition policy. Parliament is to vote on Wednesday on a resolution assessing the European Commission's 2008 report on competition policy. Issues will include the rise in nationalist and protectionist measures as a result of the economic crisis, the need to understand how well the EU rescue and recovery package performed and the importance of more democratic oversight by Parliament. Procedure: own-initiative

Consumers
Consumer confidence and functioning internal market both needed for economic growth
2010-03-04 - 17:08
There is no conflict between consumer rights and an economically efficient single market: they reinforce each other. Three reports that look at EU law on consumer protection, the internal market and the SOLVIT system for settling consumer disputes will be debated and put to the vote in Strasbourg next week. A properly functioning internal market is one where firms are not wary of creating new jobs and where consumers are not anxious about buying goods and services. Europe's growth and competitiveness depend on this: the spending of 499 million consumers represents half the wealth generated in the EU. But for this to happen, European law must be applied correctly and in good time by the Member States.
Two reports, one by Anna Hedh (S&D, SV) on consumer protection, the other by Róża Thun (EPP, PL) on the internal market scoreboard, look at the progress made in, and the standard of, implementation of EU law. A third report, by Cristian Silviu Buşoi (ALDE, RO), calls for the SOLVIT network to be strengthened and better promoted. SOLVIT was launched in 2002 to resolve problems encountered by consumers and companies because of poor application of internal market law. Procedure: Own-initiative

Human rights
Developments in Cuba
2010-03-04 - 17:08
Developments in Cuba will be debated on Wednesday afternoon, and also the subject of a resolution to be put to a vote on Thursday at noon. EP President Jerzy Buzek has deplored the death on 23 February of Orlando Zapata Tamayo, saying "This is a very sad moment when a young man dies because he wants to protest against government abuse. The European Parliament cannot remain silent while it receives numerous human rights appeals denouncing the repeated breaches. This does not help in building a good climate of relations and trust between the European Union and Cuba".
Mr Buzek added "We have to explain that our values: human rights, freedom and solidarity are values which must be respected at all times. The European Parliament will continue to remind the Cuban government about these important values". Debate: 10.03.2010 (afternoon)
Vote: 11.03.2010 Statement by EP President Jerzy Buzek on the death of a political prisoner in Cuba
