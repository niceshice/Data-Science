Hans-Gert Poettering
In becoming the 26th President of the Parliament since 1952, Hans-Gert Poettering reaches the culmination of a long political career. He is one of only 6 MEPs who have served since direct elections in 1979. In that time he has been a Christian Democrat Member for the Osnabrueck, Emsland and Ostfriesland region of Germany. He worked firstly on security and defence issues before concentrating on the enlargement of the EU. Since 1999 he has led the European People's Party and European Democrats.
Mr Poettering will lead the Parliament through to the 2009 European elections. During this period debates over Europe's energy resources, future enlargements of the Union and the EU Constitution are likely to figure prominently. Joseph Daul of France has already assumed the leadership of the EPP-ED - the largest bloc in the Parliament.
Human dignity a centre point
Born just after the end of the Second World War in September 1945, this experience of growing up in the immediate aftermath of a conflict which claimed a father he never knew moulded his views on the need for European cooperation. At University he studied law, politics and history before becoming a research assistant. From this he made the step into European politics. Throughout his career he has always believed that the goal and principle of all human activity should be the dignity of every single human being.
"Diversity" of Europe praised
This has gone side by side with his commitment to European integration. Last May in a speech he summed up his feelings about Europe: "I must say that, whenever I leave Europe and then return, I always have a profound feeling of gratitude to be back in Europe, because there is no other continent with as much diversity – including cultural diversity – as the continent of Europe and the European Union".
However, he warned that "this continent is also a difficult one – just think how many parties are represented here in the European Parliament and how we continually need to work to reach joint results".
He has two sons and enjoys reading, walking and skiing in his free time.
