The EP adopted a report which raises attention of the precarious situation of inshore fishing around the Union. Sean Ã“ Neachtain's (UEN, IE) own-initiative report on inshore fishing "stresses that inshore fisheries make a vital contribution not only to local economies but also to maintaining the social fabric of coastal communities."
For this reason, it calls for "minimum criteria which are acceptable to all" to be laid down as a way to a common definition of coastal fishing in the Union. The Parliament also calls for community financing of vessel modernisation measures, as well as "specific educational and training programmes" to encourage new entries to the sector.
The EP "believes that it is essential for inshore fishermen and dependent communities to be more directly involved in processing and trading," and that "any new inshore fisheries legislation must pay special attention to the need to establish and maintain a safety culture" which is traditionally very poor in this sector. MEPs also bring attention to the plight of women involved in coastal fishing, as they routinely experience very difficult working conditions without a legal work status and the protections that provides.
