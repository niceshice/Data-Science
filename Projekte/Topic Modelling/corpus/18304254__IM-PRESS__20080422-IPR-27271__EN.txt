In adopting a joint resolution on the Fifth EU-LAC Summit in Lima, the European Parliament reiterates its belief that action to combat terrorism must be carried out with full respect for human rights, civil liberties and the rule of law. The House demands the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages in Colombia, with priority being given to those who are sick.
Parliament considers that their release should be effected by unilateral decision of the FARC or any other organisation by which they are being held or, failing that, under an emergency humanitarian exchange agreement. The resolution was adopted with 542 votes in favour 12 against and 12 abstentions.
MEPs propose that in the economic and commercial field the creation of the Euro-Latin American global interregional partnership area should be based on a model which is compatible with both the WTO and regionalism, to be applied in two stages:
(a) a first stage involving the conclusion, at the earliest opportunity, of the negotiations on the EU-Mercosur, EU-Andean Community and EU-Central America Interregional Partnership Agreement and the deepening of the existing EU-Mexico and EU-Chile agreements;
(b) a second stage, to be completed in 2012, involving the conclusion of a global interregional partnership agreement ensuring legal and institutional support and full geographical coverage for the various strands of the strategic partnership and providing for the free movement of persons and biregional trade through a deepening of both the integration agreements within Latin America and the Union's partnership process with all countries and regional groupings.
Strengthening institutional promotion and forecast mechanisms
MEPs recommend:
(a) establishing a Euro-Latin American Foundation, of a public-private nature, for the promotion of dialogue between the partners on similar lines to those already existing for other geographical areas such as Asia or the Mediterranean; calls on the Commission to draw up a detailed proposal in this sense;
(b) establishing a Biregional Centre for Conflict Prevention, dedicated to the early detection of the causes of potential violent and armed conflicts and to seeking how best to prevent them and stop them from escalating;
(c) repeats its suggestion to create a Migration Observatory responsible for permanently and closely monitoring all issues in connection with migratory flows in Latin America.
Size of the Eurolat Assembly
MEP consider it essential to strengthen the parliamentary dimension of the strategic partnership and supports the Latin American request in which the number of Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly members required in order to facilitate the inclusion of the recently constituted Mercosur Parliament is put at 150.
Finally, the House considers it essential to strengthen the parliamentary dimension of the strategic partnership and ensure suitable inclusion of the recently constituted Mercosur Parliament in the Euro-Latin American Assembly.
