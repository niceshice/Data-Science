Supporters of presidential candidate Victor Yanukovych watch the latest news as they hold a rally in front of the Central Electoral Commission in Kyiv, 09 February 2010 ©Belga/S Chirikov With 99.94% of votes counted in Ukraine's Presidential election Viktor Yanukovych has a small majority over rival Yulia Tymoshenko. This overturns the results of the Orange revolution. Ahead of a debate in Parliament Wednesday afternoon we spoke to Polish MEP Paweł Kowal who headed Parliament's observation mission to the elections.
How would you describe the outcome of the elections?
We can now say that the EU has a partner in the East, a state where regular elections take place and can result in a change of ruler.
The turnout was 70% in spite of bad weather and poor transport conditions. That is more than in many European Union countries. Now the EU has to respond to these facts, it has to open itself to Ukraine.
What does this mean for Europe's energy security?
The pessimistic scenario would be that Victor Yanukovich sticks to the opinions he voiced before the elections. He preferred keeping a Russian middleman in the gas trade between Gazprom (Russia's gas supplier) and Ukraine and then consequently with the EU.
There is also a threat that Russia could adopt the Belarus option whereby it would trade political independence for cheap gas.
Alternatively, the new President could opt for serious energy cooperation with the EU with Ukraine being gradually connected to the EU's energy system. Let's see...
What will happen to the Ukraine-EU relationship?
The most important issue is the preparation and signing of the EU Association Agreement, especially the part regarding free trade, as well as the possible future abolition of the visa regime. Most of Ukrainian society supports joining the EU. This will, however, only be possible after many legal changes and sacrifices have been made on the Ukrainian side.
I´m deeply concerned that if we do not say clearly that the EU's door is open to Ukraine, we will lose an opportunity for change. The general security level of the countries to the East of the EU will deteriorate. If you want big changes in Ukraine you have to tell Ukrainians that their place won't always be in the European entrance hall.
What other issues do you expect to come up in the debate?
Our unequivocal declaration that the doors of the EU are open, knowing that it won't be easy and it won't happen tomorrow. Many concrete changes, projects and trust of the Ukrainians in the EU will depend on this declaration.
Otherwise the Ukrainians will consider the Russian offer more interesting. The reinforcement of Russian influence in Ukraine can only encourage the Kremlin's imperial tendencies, something that will subsequently worsen the Kremlin's relations with the EU. There is no other way, we must act in the spirit of the EU founding fathers here.
Do you think Yulia Tymoshenko will challenge the results and what will happen?
Yulia Tymoshenko achieved a good result. There is a tiny difference between her and Viktor Yanukovich, so it is natural that she will want to clear up all the doubts concerning the elections before the Courts. Similar procedures exist in many EU countries and in America, and the candidates are entitled to use them.
There is no sign today that any inconsistencies, which exist in almost all elections worldwide, would be significant enough to change the result. The best thing for Ukraine is for the new President to assume power in a proper way.
After the legal path is exhausted and all doubts clarified, all the candidates will have to accept the results in the name of the future of Ukraine. Otherwise the Ukrainians will see the elections as a mere game, because they don't produce an ordinary shift of power to the winner. The high turnout places a great obligation on all Ukrainian politicians.
A delegation of eight MEPs confirmed on Monday that both rounds of presidential election in Ukraine met most of the country's international commitments.
