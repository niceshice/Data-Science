Putting children at the heart of policy and funding efforts, tackling child poverty and focusing on health and education in order to achieve the Millennium Development goals were the key aims voiced at a panel discussion held by Development Committee on Monday, as part of the European Development Days being held in Brussels on 6 and 7 December.
"Children and adolescents comprise one third of the world population and more than half of the population in a significant number of developing countries. Unfortunately, their voice remains generally unheard in discussions and decision-making processes that affect their lives", said Development Committee chair Eva Joly (Greens/EFA, FR), at a press conference after the meeting.
Mainstreaming children's rights
"The EU attaches an increasing importance to children's rights. The proof is that, after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the protection of the rights of the child has become a specific objective, and is mentioned as such in the Treaty of Lisbon", said Gay Mitchell (EPP, IE), adding that integrating and mainstreaming children's rights issues in all policy is crucial and that "we should also listen to what our partners in the developing countries have to tell us about their concerns."
"The fight for children's rights is universal and not limited only to developing countries", said VÃ©ronique De Keyser (S&D, BE), adding that "we are also faced with problems such as children used in commercials, paedophilia etc".
0.7% of GDP by 2015
Despite the economic crisis, EU Member States must meet their commitments by delivering at least 0.7% of GDP in development aid by 2015, she continued, adding that Parliament must use its budgetary control powers to ensure that "this money supports good policy with targeted goals".
Equipping children to say no
Mauritius Ombudsman for the protection of the rights of the child Shirin Aumeeruddy-Cziffra said that "children must be equipped to say NO and to denounce any act of violence and this can be achieved only through awareness raising", adding that the press has a very special role to play as an active participant in campaigns to educate children about their rights.
