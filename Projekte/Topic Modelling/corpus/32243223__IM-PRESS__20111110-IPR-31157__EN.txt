Mr Caldeira was presenting the Court's annual report, which starts the discharge procedure for financial 2010.
Most of the error rate increase was in cohesion, energy and transport spending, where 7.7% of expenditure was affected by errors. By contrast, the management of farm spending and of funds managed directly by the Commission improved. For most other areas of EU spending, error rates remained relatively stable.
"Stable seems to be the main message, but stable is not good. Last year we were not happy so we cannot be happy this year", commented rapporteur for the 2010 discharge, Christofer Fjellner (EPP, SE), adding that the cohesion policy error rate of 7.7% "must be improved, rather than remain stable".
Reforms needed
According to the report Member States, who are responsible for managing 80% of payments from the EU budget, had sufficient information to detect and correct 58% of the transactions that were erroneous before certifying the cohesion expenditure to the Commission.
Audit Commissioner Algirdas Šemeta said these mistakes "should be identified at the first level of control in Member States", adding that "we try to improve things by training the weakest Member States, but it is difficult."
Spain, Italy and the Czech Republic singled out
Commissioner Šemeta noted that in 2010, two thirds of all errors in cohesion payments occurred in three Member States, namely Spain, Italy, and the Czech Republic (in total 16 countries were audited).
Jens Geier (S&D, DE), reiterated Parliament's demand for more political accountability in the Member States for money spent by their own authorities. "It is high time for them to issue national management declarations and take political responsibility. This should be reflected in the new financial regulations", he said.
Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy (ALDE, NL), was criticized the Council's failure to attend the presentation, given that the lion's share of errors was due to inadequate management by national authorities.
Looking ahead
Rapporteur Fjellner said he wanted to look closely into the effectiveness of supervisory control systems and "financial engineering instruments" such as revolving funds. He added that he wants to get a complete picture of the exposure of the EU budget to financial risk, since the EU budget guarantees loans in support of certain Member States "in difficulties".
Jorgo Chatzimarkakis (ALDE, DE) said that some Member States should take Poland where the cohesion spending error rate was 0%, as an example. He praised the Commission for stepping up its use of sanctions, such as suspending payments, in the event of poor performance by Member States.
Bart Staes (Greens, BE) was also unhappy with the results. "If I were a CEO and I had to present these results for the management of my divisions, saying "it is not good but stable", I would be unhappy", he said.
Mr Staes also criticised the Council for "not taking responsibility, whereas they could have remedied 58% of the mistakes in cohesion beforehand. Besides we know that one third of the mistakes are made in only three Member states", he said.
Background
The European Parliament is the EU budget discharge authority. Following the audit and finalisation of the annual accounts, Parliament will - on a recommendation by the Council of Ministers - decide whether or not to grant discharge to the Commission and other EU bodies for their spending in 2010.
The discharge for budget implementation is the decision by which the European Parliament "releases" the Commission from its responsibility for management of a given budget by marking the end of that budget's existence.
The Court of Auditors report for 2010 will be presented in the plenary session on Tuesday 15 November.
