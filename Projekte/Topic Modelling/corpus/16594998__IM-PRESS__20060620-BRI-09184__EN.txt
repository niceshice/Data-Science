European Council
Presentation of the Finnish Presidency
2006-06-30 - 10:47
Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen will present the priorities of the Finnish Presidency to the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Wednesday 5 July 2006.
Following Austria, Finland’s six-month Presidency of the Council of the European Union will begin on 1 July 2006. Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen set out the priorities for Finland's EU Presidency in his speech to the Finnish Parliament on 21 June 2006.
In his speech, he said: " The first priority is a general one, the future of the European Union. This priority covers the Constitutional Treaty as well as the enlargement discussion in general . Last Friday, the European Council decided, in line with Finland’s objectives, that with regard to the Constitutional Treaty it is time to move on from mere reflection to delivering concrete results and implementing projects. This twin-track approach is right: We will improve the way the Union functions on the basis of the existing Treaties at the same time as we bring the mere passive reflection period to a close and start discussing how to proceed with it. Finland will start work on these tasks during its Presidency.
The second crucial area during Finland’s Presidency is the competitiveness of the Union and its Member States as well as their performance in global competition . For Finland, this is a national as well as a Presidency mission. In both cases, it comes right at the top of the agenda. Although the situation is different for each Member State, I believe that, on the basis of our own experiences, Finland has something to offer the Union.
The third priority during Finland’s Presidency will be external relations . There is a link to the economy here, since the Union’s economic strength forms the basis for its external action. From being an attractive and interesting trading partner follows influence.
The fourth priority covers promoting citizens’ access to justice and strengthening the international justice system . Assessing The Hague programme will allow us to carry out a thorough political analysis of Justice and Home Affairs.
The fifth and last priority which I would particularly like to mention here is transparent and efficient procedures . Transparency will be increased in accordance with the European Council’s decision last week. In principle all Council deliberations under the co-decision procedure will be public. This decision is welcomed by Finland, which has consistently highlighted the need for transparency. I believe that transparency will also help us win citizens’ confidence and enhance EU’s legitimacy. Here we will apply common sense: transparency in the legislative process does not prevent ministers from holding confidential discussions when necessary ."

CIA accused of extraordinary renditions in Europe
2006-06-30 - 10:47
Parliament will be asked to vote on the draft interim report by the Temporary Committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners.
The committee's interim report - approved by 25 votes to 14 with 7 abstentions - sends out a clear message. It believes the CIA has organised extraordinary renditions and it criticises European states for inactivity or complicity in the face of this phenomenon.
According to the committee, the CIA has been " directly responsible " on several occasions for the extraordinary rendition, " illegal seizure, removal, abduction and detention of terrorist suspects on the territory of Member States, accession and candidate countries " - all of which constitute violations of fundamental rights under international law. MEPs say the CIA - using aircraft hired by front companies - has made use of such practices for the illegal transfer of terrorist suspects to countries which frequently use torture during interrogations. MEPs want extraordinary renditions to be " clearly prohibited " in international law.
Member States " may be held liable " for failure to comply with the European Convention of Human Rights, points out the committee. Under the case law of the EU Court of Justice, EU states have a positive obligation to prevent human rights violations on their territory.
Governments taken to task
It is " implausible ", say MEPs, " that certain European governments were not aware of the activities linked to extraordinary rendition taking place on their territory ". Such involvement or complicity, they argue, was likely on the part of Italian authorities in the 2003 abduction of Egyptian cleric Abu Omar by CIA agents in Milan, and in other cases cited by the committee.
In several EU countries, reads the report, rules governing the activities of secret services seem " inadequate ". Intelligence co-operation between EU countries and their allies, the report says, " should not be confused with the abandonment of sovereignty over European territory and airspace ".
Next steps
Having " shown the need to carry out further checks " - says the report - the committee aims to continue its work for the remainder of its twelve-month term. During this period, MEPs propose to invite the Secretary-General of NATO to a hearing to clarify the possible involvement of SFOR and KFOR forces in the illegal detention of the six Bosnians still in Guantánamo Bay. The committee calls again for the closure of Guantánamo, asking Member States to " take a proactive role " in finding a solution for the detainees.
Although the interim report -- unlike that of the Council of Europe -- makes no explicit mention of alleged detention centres in Poland and Romania, committee chair Carlos COELHO (EPP-ED, PT) remarked previously that " this in fact will be the priority of our committee for the next semester. " The text of the report itself stresses the need to " ascertain whether there is any evidence to confirm that secret prisons have been operating in some European countries ".

Strengthening cross-border police cooperation at international events in the EU
2006-06-30 - 10:47
Frieda BREPOELS (EPP-ED, BE), for the Civil Liberties Committee will be putting forward a non-binding report aimed at maintaining order and security and preventing criminal offences during international events attended by large numbers of people from more than one Member State, like for example the Olympic Games, the football World Cup and so on. The report supports the initiative proposed by the Netherlands to adopt a Council Decision on the matter.
So far international co-operation and communication between the police and security services of different countries during large international events is only based on bilateral agreements. The Netherlands’ initiative, supported by the committee, wishes to make cross-border assistance more effective via arrangements under which the Presidency of the Council is to draw up every year an overview of the international assistance expected to be required in the following calendar year. The rapporteur supports the initiative but tables an amendment to make sure that any unexpected or unanticipated big event can at any time be added to the list drawn up by the Council.

Transfer of funds - fighting money laundering
2006-06-30 - 10:47
Alexander ALVARO (ALDE, DE) for the Civil Liberties Committee will be tabling a legislative report on information on the payer accompanying transfers of funds.
The aim of this proposal is to assist the authorities responsible in combating money laundering and terrorist financing, i.e. to ensure that basic information on the payer is immediately available to them, by laying down rules on the information that must accompany transfers of funds. The full traceability of transfers of funds can be a particularly important and valuable tool in the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of money laundering and the financing of terrorism. It is therefore appropriate, in order to ensure the transmission of information on the payer throughout the payment chain, to provide for a system imposing the obligation on payment service providers for transfers of funds to be accompanied by accurate and meaningful information on the payer.
The committee makes it clear that flows of " dirty " money through transfers of funds can damage the stability and reputation of the financial sector and threaten the single market, and terrorism shakes the very foundations of our society. The soundness, integrity and stability of the system of transfers of funds and confidence in the financial system as a whole could be seriously jeopardised by the efforts of criminals and their associates either to disguise the origin of criminal proceeds or to transfer funds for terrorist purposes. Rapporteur Alexander ALVARO ALDE DE A6-0196/2006 Combating money laundering and terrorist financing: information on the payer accompanying transfers of funds, transposition of the Special Recommendation VII on “wire transfers” (SR VII) of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) into Community legislation Procedure : Codecision (1st reading)

Regional policy
€308bn Structural Funds 2007-13 - package to be approved
2006-06-30 - 10:47
The Structural Funds package for 2017 to 2013 is to be given the go-ahead by Parliament, with the adoption of five reports. Once they have also been approved by the July plenary session, around €308 billion - or 35.7 per cent of the total EU budget - will be available to spend, as scheduled, from 1 January 2007.
The five reports (three co-decision, two assent) define the objectives of Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, the criteria for Member States and regions to be eligible under those Funds, the financial resources available and the criteria for their allocation in an enlarged EU.
General Regulation
The first report lays down the general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), European Social Fund (ESF) and the Cohesion Fund.
Although the European Parliament only has assent powers over the general regulation (i.e. it can accept or reject the package but not amend it), the rapporteur Konstantinos HATZIDAKIS (EPP-ED, EL) and the committee successfully negotiated with the Austrian Presidency to have many of the MEPs' demands included in the Council’s position, including:
enhancement of the environmental aspect, in particular sustainable development, in the management of Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund and introduction of a new article which would ensure that this dimension is always taken into account in the implementation of the Funds;
a specific mention of the fact that Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund should support the improvement and promotion of accessibility for people with disabilities;
the strengthening of the partnership principle: namely that any other appropriate body representing civil society, environmental partners, non-governmental organisations and bodies responsible for promoting equality between men and women can take part in the structural funds partnership negotiations.
The Council rejected however the committee’s idea of a common declaration of Council, Commission and Parliament on a Community performance reserve which would have aimed to re-use unspent structural funds money instead of it returning to the general EU budget.
European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)
After negotiations with rapporteur Claudio FAVA (PES, IT) and the Regional Development Committee, the Council has taken on board the main concerns of the committee for the ERDF:
On VAT, the Commission had proposed to render eligible non-recoverable VAT only in the case of the European Social Fund. The European Council concluded that non-recoverable VAT would be eligible under the rules of the ERDF, ESF and the Cohesion Fund only for those Member States whose GDP does not exceed 85% of the average EU GDP. The Regional Development Committee requested that this should be extended to cover all Member States. The Council finally agreed to this request.
On housing, the Commission proposed to render housing ineligible. The European Council proposed to provide for the eligibility of housing in the ERDF Regulation for Member States whose GDP does not exceed 85% of the average EU GDP. The Council finally included in its common position a specific provision, taking into account amendments proposed by the European Parliament in its first reading, rendering eligible housing expenditure for the costs of social housing renovation aimed at saving energy and protecting the environment.
Cohesion Fund
On the Cohesion Fund, the committee and the rapporteur Alfonso ANDRIA (ALDE, IT) backed the increase from €18 billion (for the period 2000-2006) to €61.59 billion.
Following the Union’s enlargement on 1 May 2004, the Cohesion Fund applies to the 10 new Member States until the end of 2006, as well as to the three Member States eligible at the end of the 2000-2006 period (Greece, Portugal and Spain). To benefit from the Cohesion Fund, a Member State's per capita Gross National Income (GNI) must be less than 90% of the Community average National Income, which is the case for all the new Member States.
European territorial cooperation
This is a new objective proposed by the Commission, building on the experience of the Interreg initiative (interregional cooperation). It is aimed at furthering the balanced integration of the EU's territory by supporting cooperation between regions across land or sea frontiers. It will include actions to promote integrated territorial development and support for interregional cooperation and the exchange of experiences.
As part of the deal on the financial perspective, MEPs secured a further €300 million extra for territorial cohesion. The committee supports the idea that €200 million should be allocated to the trans-national area and the remaining €100 million should be given to inter-regional cooperation.
The Council decided to follow rapporteur Jan OLBRYCHT (EPP-ED, PL) and the Regional Development Committee’s suggestion of replacing the name of the instrument " European grouping of cross-border cooperation " with " European grouping of territorial cooperation ".
European Social Fund
José Silva PENEDA (EPP-ED, PT) for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs will be putting forward a co-decision report in second reading approving the Council Common Position concerning the regulation on the European Social Fund (ESF) for 2007 to 2013.
The rapporteur underlined that Council had incorporated a great number of the Parliament's first reading amendments in its Common Position. Parliament wanted to strengthen aspects like the fight against social exclusion, non-discrimination and gender equality, as well as the integration of disabled people and inactive people, especially long term unemployed young people.
The ESF regulation for 2007 to 2013 provides a focussed framework for ESF interventions throughout the EU. It lays down specific provisions concerning the type of activities which may be financed by the ESF.
The ESF is the major financial instrument of European social policy. It contributes to the economic and social cohesion objective set in article 158 of the EC Treaty, by supporting policies and priorities aimed to achieve progress towards full employment, improve quality and productivity at work and promote social inclusion and cohesion in line with the guidelines and recommendations under the European Employment Strategy (EES).
In order to achieve this objective, the ESF needs to address three major challenges: employment disparities, social inequalities, skills gaps and labour shortage in an enlarged Union; economic and social restructuring due to globalisation and the development of the knowledge-based economy; demographic changes which have resulted in a shrinking and ageing workforce.
What next?
The texts are due to be adopted during the July plenary in Strasbourg which means the funds can be used from 1 January 2007. Before the money can be finally allocated to the Member States, the Commission will draw up, most likely in late July, Community Strategic Guidelines, on which Parliament will vote (under the assent procedure) in September. These are the starting point for the national reference frameworks and operational plans to be negotiated between the Commission and individual Member States in the Autumn.

Accession to the Hague Conference on Private International Law
2006-06-30 - 10:47
Diana WALLIS (ALDE, UK), for the Legal Affairs Committee, will be recommending that Parliament grant its assent to the EC joining the Hague Conference on Private International Law.
The Council agreed to the text of a draft decision on the accession of the European Community to the Hague Conference on Private International Law (HCCH). At present, the Community enjoys only observer status in the HCCH. Full membership is necessary for two reasons. It would:
- grant the Community a status consistent with its new role as a major international player in the field of civil judicial cooperation;
- enable the Community to fully participate in the negotiation of conventions in areas of its competence by expressing its views and positions and ensuring consistency and coherence between its own rules and envisaged international instruments. Moreover, the Community as such rather than its Member States would be the subject of the rights and obligations stemming from Hague Conventions in areas of its competence.
The HCCH is a long-established international organisation with the objective of ensuring the progressive unification of the rules of private international law, mainly by negotiating and drafting international conventions.

Conciliation: batteries, accumulators and their waste
2006-06-30 - 10:47
Only six Member States currently have schemes for collecting spent portable batteries and accumulators. MEPs will debate and vote on a deal reached on 2 May in the Conciliation Committee which means a new EU directive will ensure that such schemes are set up throughout Europe by 2008. The aim: to protect nature and rubbish dumps from the often toxic substances contained in the tonnes of batteries discarded annually. In future used batteries will have to be collected and recycled.
" This is the sixth piece of legislation we have agreed under conciliation in this parliamentary term ", said Dagmar ROTH-BEHRENDT (PES, DE), who led the European Parliament delegation. " Once more Parliament has managed to improve the draft legislation a great deal. There was a constructive spirit of negotiation on both sides, in the Parliament and the Council. This new directive will help consumers to consume more intelligently and producers to reduce pollution, such as mercury, cadmium and lead, from the products they sell ".
Karl-Heinz FLORENZ (EPP-ED, DE), chair of Parliament's Environment Committee, pointed out that " there can be no recycling without collection. Collection schemes and the requirement for distributors to take back waste batteries are the key points of this directive, in my view. Another important point is the registration of producers using similar procedures in all Member States. That should prevent us having the same problems as those we now have with the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment ".
Target of 45%
In 2002 the collection rates of portable batteries in the six countries which have already set up schemes were: Belgium 59%, Sweden 55%, Austria 44%, Germany 39%, the Netherlands 32% and France 16%. The new directive lays down minimum collection rates to be reached by all Member States: 25% by 2012 and 45 % by 2016.
Everything will depend on the quality of the schemes set up, the information provided to consumers and the willingness of the latter to play their part. Things will be much easier now for consumers: labels will have to indicate the real capacity of the batteries and accumulators they buy.
In the view of Johannes BLOKLAND (IND/DEM, NL), who drafted Parliament's report on the directive, this represents important progress: " This provision was not in the original proposal but Parliament thought the consumer should be able to choose higher-performance and long-life batteries. Cheap batteries are not necessarily the best choice for the environment if they have a shorter life. As of 2009, labels on all batteries and accumulators must show their real capacity ."
Other points of the directive
Entry into force and transposition . The directive enters into force on the day it is published in the Official Journal (in the course of 2006) and the Member States have two years to transpose it into national law.
Bans . The directive bans the sale of batteries and accumulators containing more than 0.0005% of mercury and 0.002% of cadmium, except emergency and alarm systems, medical equipment and cordless power tools.
Collection schemes . Easily accessible collection points must be available to consumers in their own neighbourhood two years after the directive enters into force (2008). Thanks to Parliament, distributors will have to take back the spent portable batteries and accumulators at no cost to the consumer and regardless of when they were placed on the market. And they must inform consumers that this possibility exists.
Information . Producers must bear any net costs of information campaigns.
Registration. All producers must be registered and, at Parliament's insistence, this must be done under similar procedures in all Member States, to ensure producers cannot duck their responsibilities.
Exemptions . Parliament has sharply reduced the possible exemptions from the rules on collection and recycling that Member States wanted for small producers. These exemptions will be subject to strict conditions regarding compliance with competition rules.
Recycling rates . The targets laid down in the directive for recycling are 65% by average weight for lead-acid batteries and accumulators, 75% for nickel-cadmium and 50% for others.
Removability . At Parliament's insistence, manufacturers will have to design appliances in such a way that spent batteries and accumulators can be easily removed.
Research . The EP has added provisions to the directive to encourage research into better technologies for recycling and for manufacturing less polluting batteries. Rapporteur Johannes BLOKLAND IND/DEM NL A6-0231/2006 Batteries, accumulators and their waste Procedure : Codecision (3rd reading)

Environment
Conciliation: more transparency for an environmentally-friendly Europe
2006-06-30 - 10:47
MEPs are due to debate and vote on a conciliation agreement of MEPs which means Europe's citizens will in future have easier access to information on the environment and be able to play a more active role in EU decisions in this area. Under the new regulation agreed, the EU's institutions will be required to comply with the rules of the Aarhus Convention.
This convention, concluded in 1998 under the auspices of the UN, aims to involve Europe's citizens in environmental policies by entitling them to gain access to information and to participate in decision-making and, if these rights are not respected, to take legal action to enforce them. The new EU regulation, the remaining points of which were agreed, will apply these rules to the institutions and bodies of the European Union.
MEPs fight for the public's rights
" This regulation is a new step towards more openness and transparency in the European institutions. Much has already been done in this field but the public and environmental organisations will now have the best possible opportunity to obtain information and to participate fully in European affairs ", said Alejo VIDAL-QUADRAS ROCA (EPP-ED, ES), chair of the EP delegation to the Conciliation Committee.
Parliament took the negotiations to the final stage of the co-decision procedure - involving " conciliation " between representatives of the EP and the Member States - in order to defend the public's rights. Eija Riitta KORHOLA (EPP-ED, FI), who piloted the legislation through Parliament, said: " In these negotiations the EP has strongly supported the rights of citizens and made it easier for them to obtain better information and to do so more quickly. For example, we have introduced longer time-limits for citizens to take action and tougher requirements on the institutions to open their files ."
María SORNOSA MARTÍNEZ (PES, ES)who represented the Socialist group in the exploratory talks, said: "Everyone wins: this regulation will put pressure on the institutions to conduct policies which are more in line with the public's interests."
This was one of the points most frequently stressed by the Environment Committee: " We in the Environment Committee are extremely concerned about the management and implementation of Community policies. This regulation is to be welcomed as it will make the institutions more accountable ", was the satisfied reaction of Karl-Heinz FLORENZ (EPP-ED, DE), who chairs the committee.
The detail of the agreement
Access to information. Thanks to the EP, access to information will cover information held by subcontractors and include data not available in electronic format as well as information on the different steps in legal proceedings for infringements of Community law.
MEPs also succeeded in limiting some exceptions wanted by the Council, although not those relating to banking activities (notably the EIB). But, at Parliament's insistence, any other exceptions can only be interpreted in a restrictive manner. However, to ensure that any infringement cases launched by the Commission against the Member States proceed smoothly, information on any current cases will be confidential.
All information made available to the public will be provided free of charge
Public participation . A time-limit of at least eight weeks must be set for receiving comments from persons or organisations with an interest in EU environmental projects. When hearings or meetings are held, they must be announced at least four weeks in advance. And, in particular, Community institutions and bodies must take " due account " of this public-participation process. Parliament successfully pushed for this point to be made compulsory.
Internal review and access to justice . Who can request an internal review and take a case to court? The answer is: independent and accountable organisations which have demonstrated that their primary objective is to promote environmental protection. They must first lodge an application for internal review within six weeks after the administrative decision in question has been taken. Only then can they go to the Court of Justice of the European Communities.
Implementation . The Council and Commission were keen to have sufficient time to prepare for the new rules. Following pressure from Parliament, the institutions will have to adapt their internal rules swiftly to apply the new regulation. This should be done by mid-2007, nine months after the regulation is published in the Official Journal.

Transport
Reducing the climate change impact of civil aviation
2006-06-30 - 10:47
International aviation is neither subject to Kyoto or other commitments nor to fuel tax or VAT. In a report by Caroline LUCAS (Greens/EFA, UK), the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety proposes the EU to take a leadership position in global aviation in order to reduce the climate change impact of aviation. The committee advocates an aviation scheme as well as its inclusion in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS).
The scope of the aviation scheme
MEPs in the committee back the immediate introduction of kerosene taxes by requiring a tax on all domestic and intra-EU flights (with the possibility to exempt all carriers on routes on which non-EU carriers operate). They also call on the Commission to propose arrangements for their worldwide introduction. Furthermore, they agree that tax exemptions on air transport and other imbalances lead to very unfair competition between aviation and other transport sectors, and therefore ending the VAT exemption would further level the playing field, and bring fiscal as well as environmental benefits.
The committee says that a comprehensive package of measures is needed to address the impact of aviation on the climate, as well as applying the “ polluter pays ” principle. The committee emphasises the need for a method, which also properly reflects the sector's dynamic nature, and rewards past and future good performance.
On inclusion of aviation into the EU ETS
The committee recognises that emissions trading has the potential to play a role as part of a comprehensive package of measures to address the climate impact of aviation, provided it is appropriately designed. MEPs in the committee stress that the environmental effectiveness of any emissions trading scheme will depend on it having sufficiently broad geographical scope; a rigorous cap; full auctioning of initial allocation; the technological level and early actions taken into account in the allocation; and addressing full climate impact.
The committee shares the Commission's view that incorporating aviation into the EU ETS is the most appropriate approach; proposes, however, the introduction of a separate dedicated scheme for aviation emissions, recognising that, due to the lack of binding commitments for international aviation emissions under the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) and the Kyoto Protocol, the aviation sector would be unable to actually sell into the ETS.
The report stresses that, if aviation is to be eventually incorporated into the wider ETS, there should at least be a pilot phase of a separate scheme covering the period 2008-2012.
MEPs in the committee propose that, should aviation be eventually incorporated into a wider ETS, special conditions be applied to ensure it does not distort the market to the detriment of less protected sectors: a cap on the number of emission rights it is permitted to buy from the market, and a requirement to make a proportion of the necessary emissions reductions without trading, before being allowed to buy permits. The committee calls on the Commission to put forward other policy instruments to address the non-CO 2 impacts of aviation in parallel to the ETS.

Inland waterway vessels - technical requirements
2006-06-30 - 10:47
The Transport Committee recommends adoption, with one minor amendment, of the Council's common position on this draft directive on technical requirements for inland waterway shipping. The legislation covers areas from engine design and vessel manoeuvrability to crew safety and accommodation.
The aim is to align Community technical rules with the advanced standards governing navigation of the Rhine, so as to establish a single scheme for the entire European inland waterway network. The directive will create a level playing field in the single market for inland waterway transport, thereby increasing competition and promoting higher safety, environmental and social standards.
This is the final stage in a long process of revising the rules on inland waterway shipping which reached a standstill in Council because of a conflict of competences between the EC and the Central Commission for the Navigation on the Rhine. Under the new legislation, this conflict will be resolved by mutual recognition of certificates.

New EU rules on aircraft safety
2006-06-30 - 10:47
The Transport Committee is asking the full Parliament to approve a report on harmonised technical provisions for commercial aircraft. The regulation covers a whole range of matters, such as instruments and equipment, communication and navigation equipment, maintenance and transport of dangerous goods by air, and working hours for aircrews.
Flight and duty time limitations and rest periods
A major victory for Parliament at first reading was the introduction of a maximum basic daily Flight Duty Period (FDP). This will be 13 hours but can be extended by up to one hour. When an FDP starts at night (between 22:00h to 04:59h) it is limited to a maximum of 11.45 hours. The minimum rest at " home base " must be at least as long as the preceding duty period or at least 12 hours (" away from home ", the minimum rest is at least 10 hours).
At second reading, the Transport Committee decided that, within two years after entry into force of the regulation, the European Aviation Safety Agency must complete a scientific and medical evaluation of the provisions on FDPs. If necessary, the Commission must then submit a new proposal amending these provisions.
MEPs also introduced a clause stipulating that " under no circumstances " may the regulation be used to water down existing safety standards in the Member States. Labour agreements providing for better conditions on flight and duty periods can thus be retained.
Overnight express cargo - a special case
However, the Transport Committee regards overnight express cargo service providers as a special case. It says that where a roster system is based on staff becoming accustomed to nightshifts by limiting the number of dayshift/nightshift changes, any disruptions to rosters may have a negative impact on the level of safety of operating models. The committee therefore proposes that the Commission be asked to carry out an assessment and propose an adjustment of the provisions regarding flight and duty time limitations " to take account of these special operating models ".
Harmonisation of cabin crew training
Lastly the committee calls for cabin crew training to be harmonised to create high European standards. Mutual recognition of training qualifications, with the option of licensing cabin crews, would be a solution.
In view of the rapidly growing volume of air traffic, rapporteur Ulrich STOCKMANN (PES, DE)stresses the urgent need to establish, at EU level, " uniform high safety standards, which have not hitherto been provided for in some Member States ".

AIDS - Time to deliver
2006-06-30 - 10:47
Parliament will debate the issues surrounding HIV/AIDS after hearing a Commission statement. HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis continue to cause the deaths of some six million people each year, wipe out years of development efforts and achievements and constitute a serious long term concern due to their destabilising effects on society.
The European Union and its neighbouring countries now face the threat of a ‘ new epidemic’ . Parts of Europe have the fastest rate of new HIV/AIDS cases in the world. Latest figures released recently by UNAIDS confirmed that the numbers of new infections are increasing throughout the 25 EU Member States and in its east European neighbours. The transmission pattern is also changing. While sexually transmitted infections remain predominant in some parts of the European Continent many of the rapid rises in infections are due to intravenous drug users.
HIV infection continues to have a major public health impact. In Western and Central Europe more than 26 000 people were infected with HIV in 2005. In this region heterosexual intercourse has become the main mode of transmission, and harm reduction programmes have helped to reduce the spread of HIV among injecting drug users. The main challenge is to sustain this positive development and to prevent HIV transmission from infected injecting drug users to their sexual partners.
In order to save lives it is important to make sure that people do not to use drugs but it is equally important to work with injecting drug users and implement comprehensive harm reduction services as an essential component of a comprehensive HIV/AIDS programme.

Counterfeiting of medicinal products
2006-06-30 - 10:47
Thierry CORNILLET (ALDE, FR), on behalf of the ALDE Group, will be asking the Commission the following questions on the counterfeiting of medicinal product:
The counterfeiting of medicinal products is the most serious and the most amoral of all forms of such deception and it constitutes a growing scourge in many countries, causing the health and even the lives of millions of people to be put at risk.
In developing countries in particular, medicinal products are in circulation which are too strong or too weak, have no active ingredient or are even toxic. In those countries the medicinal products which are most often counterfeited are those used to treat potentially fatal diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS.
World trends in the counterfeiting of medicinal products are worrying. According to WHO estimates, 6% of drugs on the world market are counterfeit - the US Food and Drug Administration put the figure at 10%. Up to 70% of the anti-malaria drugs available in Cameroon are counterfeit. In 2003 the WHO corroborated this figure for six other African countries. Of the medicinal products consumed in poor countries, 25% are allegedly counterfeit.
The EU is a late entrant to the international fight against counterfeiting.
- What action (in addition to publishing the Commission Communication entitled 'Strategy for the enforcement of intellectual-property rights in third countries') has the EU taken and is it intending to take in order to combat the scourge of counterfeit medicines on its territory?
There are many reasons accounting for such a huge presence of counterfeit medicinal products in developing countries.
- What action does the EU intend to take in order to help poor countries to regulate and monitor the quality of medical products and equipment placed on the market?
- Should the EU not play an active role in the promotion of an International Convention designed to ensure that each country makes the counterfeiting of medicinal products (or the handling thereof) a specific crime or offence under its law?

Strategies and means for the integration of immigrants in the European Union
2006-06-30 - 10:47
The House will vote on a draft report on the integration of immigrants, which is partly a response to a Commission paper titled 'A Common Agenda for Integration - Framework for the Integration of Third-Country Nationals in the European Union'.
There are over 40 million immigrants in the European Union today and they might be seen as the 26th Member State, says the report. Integration of immigrants is not just a local matter but one of EU-wide importance, since successful integration will strengthen the Union’s economy. The EU should therefore make an effort to integrate this population equivalent to that it has made to integrate accession countries.
The committee essentially welcomes a Commission proposal to establish a European fund for the integration of third-country nationals for the period 2007-2013, while making some suggestions as to the fund's strategy.
It also calls for monitoring mechanisms to evaluate integration programmes in the Member States. It encourages the Commission to consult migrant communities in defining and implementing European aid and development policies in their home countries.
The report urges Member States " to establish transparent, humane, fast and reasonable procedures for the granting of long-term resident status, for family reunification and for the naturalisation of long-term resident immigrants and their children ". At the same time, the committee expresses approval for the integration programmes of certain Member States involving a mutual commitment by the host country and immigrants.

Proposal for a Council decision on the establishment of a mutual information procedure on Member States' measures in the areas of asylum and immigration
2006-06-30 - 10:47
MEPs will also be asked to adopt a consultation report on an EU mutual information and early warning system for asylum and immigration. The information will be exchanged via a secure and confidential Internet-type network managed by the Commission.
This project was conceived at the moment (in 2005) when Spain was about to embark on its large-scale regularisation of immigrants. Some Member States claimed they had not been informed of this measure and voiced concern about its impact on migration into their own territory.
The Civil Liberties Committee welcomes the draft decision, albeit with a number of non-binding amendments. It says asylum and immigration measures should be communicated no later than when they are submitted for adoption, as such measures have an immediate effect on other Member States' migration policies.
It also wants the information stored on the network to be open to the public. And it proposes that each Member State should submit a twice-yearly report explaining the most recent national measures and their likely impact at EU level.

Oral questions
2006-06-30 - 10:47
Two oral questions are also linked to the joint debate.
The first, by the PES group, notes that there are upwards of 3 million illegal immigrants in Europe and says a strategic approach is needed to this phenomenon. It puts a number of questions to the Commission on EU immigration policy, grouped under three headings: development cooperation and trade; legal immigration and the fight against illegal immigration; border management.
The second, by the EPP-ED group, identifies four areas: development and partnership with countries of origin; securing external borders and the fight against human trafficking; a robust returns policy; integration of migrants into their host society. It asks the Commission what measures exist at EU level to develop a more coordinated integration policy for migrants. Oral questions - European Union immigration policy

Situation in Palestine
2006-06-30 - 10:47
MEPs will debate the situation in Palestine after hearing statements from the Commission and the Council.
On 23 June 2006, the European Commission announced that it will make a contribution of €105 million to the Temporary International Mechanism for the Palestinians. This Mechanism, developed by the EU at the request of the “ Quartet ” (EU, US, UN and Russia) and endorsed by the European Council, will facilitate the direct delivery of assistance to the Palestinian people to meet basic needs, without the money passing to or through the PA government. The allocation covers all three “windows” of the Mechanism (health, utilities, social allowances) and technical assistance. It brings the total made available from the Community Budget so far this year to the Palestinian Territories to €259 million.
On 1 June 2006, the European Parliament adopted a text calling on the Council and Commission to strengthen their initiatives by taking account of the following recommendations:
- to act within the Quartet with the aim of urgently guaranteeing the flow of aid essential to the Palestinians through humanitarian agencies and NGOs and implementing the temporary international mechanism, as proposed by the Quartet, to guarantee direct aid to the Palestinian people, which should be funnelled by the World Bank or other international bodies;
- to invite the governments of the US and the other donor countries to ensure a broad and flexible scope for this mechanism and facilitate it by the direct involvement of the Palestinian Authority's President, and to ensure financial control and accountability of expenditure;
- to develop such a mechanism in order to avoid a major humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territories; calls on all the institutions involved in establishing such a temporary international financial mechanism to be as transparent as possible in order to prevent any fraud or deviation of funds;
- to call on the Israeli government to immediately resume the direct transfer of the withheld Palestinian tax and customs revenues which have been blocked since January 2006; notes that part of these funds have been transferred for payment of electricity supplies, complying with the 1994 Paris Protocol;
- to reinvigorate the institution-building process in Palestine, which has seen an important moment in the recent elections,
- to continue with the EU presence in Rafah and the implementation of the Agreement on Movement and Access,
- to make a comprehensive assessment of the situation, together with the High Representative for the CFSP, so as to guarantee coherence in both aid measures and political and diplomatic initiatives, in order to conduct a dialogue with the Palestinian Authority through its President;
- to ensure that all future assistance will be reviewed in the light of the Palestinian government's respect for these principles;
- to take full advantage of the Action Plan with the Palestinian Authority, within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy; the Commission, for its part, will have to guarantee the full implementation of the EU–Israel Action Plan, as far as Israel's obligations towards the Palestinian Authority are concerned.

Situation in Somalia
2006-06-30 - 10:47
MEPs will debate the situation in Somalia after hearing statements from the Commission and the Council. On 27 June 2006, the Council made a statement on the agreement reached between the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia and the Union of Islamic Courts.
The European Union (EU) welcomes the agreement reached in Khartoum, Sudan, on 22 June 2006 establishing a basis for negotiations between the Somali Transitional Federal Institutions and the Union of Islamic Courts, and congratulates both League of Arab States and the Sudanese government for facilitating the talks.
The EU urges the Transition Federal Institutions and the Union of Islamic Courts to sincerely and urgently implement this agreement by engaging in meaningful dialogue in pursuit of a political solution, so that peace and stability can return to Somalia, in the interest of the Somali civilian population.
The EU calls on all regional and international partners to create and maintain the conditions necessary for the dialogue and to continue to support the dialogue within the framework of the Transitional Federal Charter.
The EU reaffirms its readiness to provide political and material support to this process as necessary and appropriate. Debate: 05.07.2006 20 March 2006 - Council conclusions on Somalia

External relations
Financial instruments for external relations
2006-06-30 - 10:47
Parliament will vote next week on three "instruments" laying down the provisions for the financing of EU foreign policy under the financial perspective 2007-2013. In final negotiations between the three institutions this week, the Commission and the Council have agreed to Parliament's wish to have another, separate instrument for actions in the field of democracy and human rights.
The Commission adopted a proposal for such an instrument on Monday 26 June. Parliament insisted on a separate instrument to ensure adequate emphasis on human rights and democracy in the EU's foreign policy.
The negotiations over the past months concerned three foreign policy instruments and one financial instrument for development cooperation. On the latter, it was agreed on Monday that this should be split into three separate regulations, one for developing countries, one for industrialised countries and one for thematic programmes. Parliament will probably vote later on this in second reading.
The three foreign policy instruments to be voted next Wednesday are the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, the Instrument for pre-accession assistance (IPA) and the Instrument for Stability (IfS). At Parliament's insistence all programmes will expire at the end of the next FP period, i.e. in 2013; there will also be a mid-term review. Parliament also saw its wish honoured that the funds allocated under the different instruments have a geographic and thematic break-down. This means that Parliament can scrutinise more in detail where the money is going to and has strengthened the political contents of the programmes.
The ENPI regulation (rapporteur Konrad SZYMAŃSKI (UEN, PL) will lay down the provisions for foreign policy programmes relating to the neighbouring countries to the east and south of the EU, viz. Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Moldova, Morocco, Palestinian Authority, Russia, Syria, Tunisia and Ukraine. Parliament has co-decision powers here.
The second instrument is a regulation for pre-accession assistance (IPA). This framework regulation will replace Phare, Sapard, Ispa, Cards and other regulations. Beneficiary countries will be divided into two categories: candidate countries (Croatia, FYR of Macedonia and Turkey) and potential candidate countries (Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia). Potential candidate countries will receive help for institution building and democratisation, social and economic development, regional and cross-border cooperation. Candidate countries will additionally receive help in the preparation for the implementation of structural funds after accession. Parliament has consultation powers only here and the rapporteur is István SZENT-IVÁNYI (ALDE, HU).
Finally, there is the Instrument for Stability (IfS). This instrument is meant for providing peacekeeping actions, for helping other countries in the fight against organised crime, terrorism and other transnational threats and for helping other countries in a nuclear crisis or against the threat of weapons of mass destruction. Parliament has obtained co-decision powers here by taking out nuclear safety as a separate component. The rapporteur is Angelika BEER (Greens/EFA, DE).

Committee of Inquiry on the Crisis of the Equitable Life Assurance Society - interim report
2006-06-30 - 10:47
The committee is investigating the crisis at Equitable Life, which resulted in major financial losses to over a million policyholders, mainly in the UK but also in Ireland and Germany. MEPs have so far heard evidence from British, Irish and German policyholders' representatives, the CEO of Equitable Life and the UK and Irish regulatory bodies.
The House will vote on the committee's interim report, which requests a 3-month extension to its one-year mandate to enable it to take account of a report by the UK Parliamentary Ombudsman which is due for publication in November.

Development and cooperation
Migration and development
2006-06-30 - 10:47
MEPs will be asked to vote on a report which says "the European Union must play a major role to make migration a lever of development". The own-initiative report, drafted by Marie-Marie-Arlette CARLOTTI (PES, FR) for the Development Committee, seeks to influence the EU’s cooperation and development policy with the aim of maximising the benefit of migration for all parties.
At the beginning of the 21st century, there are 175 million migrants in the world (3% of the world population). This figure has virtually tripled in 40 years. Forty per cent of migrants live in developing countries.
Migrants' remittances
Remittances are the second most important source of external finance for developing countries and up to 20% of their total value is consumed by handling charges. The report calls for measures to ease the transfer of migrants’ funds, improve their access to financial services and channel their funds towards productive investment in their home countries.
Making the most of migrants' skills
The practice of "circular migration" or " commuting " between host countries and countries of origin can be beneficial to both sides. The report calls for programmes " to involve skilled people in the diasporas in the process of development by covering the costs of wage differentials for highly skilled migrants prepared to return to their countries or by setting up ‘dual post’ systems for public sector personnel in southern countries (teachers, researchers and doctors) ".
The committee welcomes measures proposed by the European Commission to combat the brain drain from poorer countries. It also calls for greater emphasis on the rights of migrant women.
In addition, the report demands that Member States grant an autonomous status and a work permit to the spouse and children of the principal legal status holder once a request for family reunification is accepted, to protect their rights fully and facilitate their social integration.
Europe cannot be a fortress, says President BORRELL
Speaking at the ACP-EU meeting in Vienna on 19 June, EP President Josep BORRELL alluded to the Carlotti report, saying " Europe cannot be a fortress. Those who believe that a new wall along our southern border will protect them are completely mistaken. If Europe does not go to the South, the South will come, illegally or clandestinely, to Europe ."
N.B. A separate debate on immigration takes place on Wednesday, based on two reports and two oral questions. Rapporteur Marie-Arlette CARLOTTI PES FR A6-0210/2006 Development and Migration Procedure : Own-initiative

Fair Trade and Development - call for the Commission to act
2006-06-30 - 10:47
Frithjof SCHMIDT (Greens/EFA, DE) for the Development Committee will be putting a forward an own-initiative report on fair trade development urging the Commission to issue a recommendation on Fair Trade, recognising that a non-binding legislative act is the appropriate form at this point in time and would not carry the risk of over-regulation.
The report stresses that the most significant part of the increase in Fair Trade sales has been achieved with respect to labelled products and that Fair Trade labelling initiatives have been developed in most European countries. The Development Committee calls on the Commission to undertake a study to examine how Fair Trade could develop into a model for sustainable trade policy which would be capable of stimulating balanced North-South trade, and identify the obstacles to trade which impact most seriously on the world's poor.
The committee calls on the Commission to recognise that there are also other credible schemes that, alongside the Fair Trade movement and under the umbrella of the International Social and Environmental Accreditation and Labelling Alliance (ISEAL), collaborate to define social and environmental standard-setting in third-party certification.
MEPs in the committee call on the Commission and Member States to take appropriate measures to ensure that consumers have access to all information they need in order to make informed choices. The committee believes that consumers must have the right to access quickly product information, which must be easily comprehensible and presented in a transparent way.
The Development Committee calls on the Commission to liaise with the international Fair Trade movement in supporting clear and widely-applicable criteria against which consumer assurance schemes can be assessed, underpinning consumer confidence in such schemes and consolidating the Fair Trade product sectors. The committee also calls on the Commission to launch specific "calls for proposals" with objectives targeted at Fair Trade in order to raise consumer awareness, support assurance schemes and labelling, as well as systematic data collection and assessment of effects across the EU.
The committee also urges the Commission to develop a coherent policy for the promotion and protection of small and marginalised producers, including Fair Trade, incorporating their views as well as the views of the producers of other independently monitored trading initiatives contributing to raising social and environmental standards, in bilateral, regional and multilateral trade negotiations, such as the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs). Finally, the report calls on the Commission to take the Fair Trade and other social and environmental trading approaches into account when formulating the EU trade policy.

Freeing up competition in freight shipping - but with guidelines
2006-06-30 - 10:47
MEPs are to vote on a report supporting Commission proposals to end an exemption to the normal competition rules for scheduled freight shipping services, subject to certain conditions, notably the establishment of EU guidelines to ensure legal certainty for the sector.
The Commission is proposing to repeal legislation from 1986 which allows scheduled shipping operators to operate “conferences” which fix freight charges and manage vessel capacities, arguing that the industry no longer needs this type of protection and that it does not encourage cost-saving.
In a report drawn up by Corien WORTMANN-KOOL (EPP-ED, NL), MEPs in the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee give their backing to the repeal, but they insist that before the old system is entirely phased out, the Commission should first publish guidelines on what sorts of cooperation between shipping operators is allowed, to ensure there is legal certainty for all involved. Rapporteur Corien WORTMANN-KOOL EPP-ED NL A6-0217/2006 Maritime transport: cabotage and international tramp services (repeal. regul. 4056/86/EEC, applic. of art. 85 and 86, amend. regul. 1/2003/EC) Procedure : Consultation

Cross-border bank mergers: how to remove obstacles while protecting consumers
2006-06-30 - 10:47
Parliament is set to debate a report which considers the implications of mergers and takeovers in the banking and financial services sector for consumers, companies, employees and regulators.
The own-initiative report, drawn up by Joseph MUSCAT (PES, MT), for the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, says that consolidation is one way, although not the only one, for the sector to respond to growing competition at EU and global level
Benefits of consolidation – and concerns
The aim should not be to reach a particular number of firms, and consolidation must be proportionate to competition While it is likely to have a positive effect on competitiveness, merger activity often brings with it a fear of job losses and MEPs in the committee want companies involved to take account of their social obligations
Consolidation is not, says the report, a political objective as such, but it should bring clear benefits to the economy by stimulating growth, encouraging innovation, ensuring competition, improving access to funding, allowing financial institutions to exploit synergies and cost efficiencies and by giving consumers a greater choice and better quality, while ensuring an adequate level of consumer protection.
Obstacles to a fully integrated EU financial services market
These potential benefits, says the committee, should not be hampered by unjustifiable obstacles, such as those created by tax barriers and differing supervisory regimes.
Different supervisory practices and standards, practices and reporting requirements can be costly and time consuming for companies trading across borders. MEPs in the committee welcome the progress made so far by the committees of national regulatory bodies (the ‘Level 3 committees’) and encourage them to go further in convergence of different approaches.
Among tax obstacles, the committee highlights issues regarding inter-group VAT and a lack of legal certainty regarding the VAT-treatment of financial services Another issue is that tax systems often favour domestic rather than EU dividends.
Supervisory issues as financial companies come together
On the other hand, increasing consolidation of the industry means that the supervisory framework will also have to evolve, with a clear definition of responsibilities between host and home country supervisors In the event of a crisis, cooperation and mutual trust would be crucial, so MEPs encourage the Commission and national authorities to develop joint proposals for effective crisis management.
Finally, the committee calls for a committee of “ wise men ” to be set up to analyse in detail the issue of supervision of EU financial markets as consolidation progresses, to report back by the end of 2006.

Cross-border shipments of radioactive waste
2006-06-30 - 10:47
The Industry Committee is asking the House to approve, with a few non-binding amendments, a draft directive laying down a Community system for monitoring crossborder shipments of radioactive waste and spent fuel.
The Commission proposal would amend the existing Directive 92/3 Euratom. It seeks to modify terms and definitions, address new situations and ensure consistency with other Community and international texts.
It does not significantly alter the existing prior authorisation system but clarifies procedures, for example for Member States to consent to, or refuse to allow, shipments of waste and fuel into their territory.
The committee's amendments seek to improve the new procedure for acknowledging receipt of applications for shipments. It wants to tackle the issue of liability for costs arising when the shipment cannot be completed. And it wishes to make it absolutely clear that any country has the right to ban imports both of radioactive waste for final treatment (except in the case of reshipment) and foreign spent fuel for final disposal.

Strengthening manufacturing industry in the EU
2006-06-30 - 10:47
Parliament will give its verdict on a draft report by the Industry Committee which supports plans by the Commission to strengthen the EU's manufacturing industry.
The own-initiative report, drafted by Joan CALABUIG RULL (PES, ES), welcomes a Commission paper which sets out a policy framework and an enhanced work programme for the EU's manufacturing industries as part of the Lisbon agenda.
An EU policy to face up to globalisation
It says the EU " must aspire to remain a major industrial power and not merely confine itself to developing the services sector ". A " coherent industrial policy at European level" is needed, in particular "to tackle the challenges of globalisation ".
The draft report is concerned at the preponderance in the EU of industries with medium-high technologies and low-to-intermediate labour skills. It says education and training are crucial and believes the Commission's paper does not pay enough attention to these areas. It urges the Member States to attract more young students into technical and scientific studies and it emphasises the " major potential of nano-sciences and nano-technologies ".
Imports to be monitored more rigorously
The Commission is urged to " focus on the area of market surveillance and the fight against unfair competition and counterfeiting ". MEPs also say it should " monitor and record the extent to which imported products comply with European environmental and consumer health protection legislation and affect the competitivity of European products ".
EU manufacturing industry provides around 20% of EU output and employs some 34 million people. Over 80% of EU private sector R&D expenditure takes place in this industry. Manufacturing generates new and innovative products that provide some 75% of EU exports. Manufacturing has a high proportion of SMEs: they account for over 99% of companies and 58% of manufacturing employment.

Budget
System of the EC's own resources
2006-06-30 - 10:47
Alain LAMASSOURE (EPP-ED, FR), for the Budgets Committee will be tabling a non-binding report on the EC's system of own resources (EU revenue).
Mr Lamassoure's report deals with a proposal for a Council Decision on the system of the European Communities’ own resources aiming at implementing the conclusions of the European Council of 15-16 December 2005 in the own resources area. The key amendment proposed deals with the implication of Parliament in the review set for 2008/09 which the Commission will present. This has been repeatedly flagged up in the past few months. This is motivated by the fact that Parliament, as yet, has no formal say in the review (it is entirely in the hands of Council).
The main elements of the proposal in the aftermath of the December summit's conclusions are the following:
- introduction of a fixed rate of call of VAT. The European Council concluded that the rate of call of VAT shall be fixed at 0.30 % of Member States’ capped VAT bases;
- introduction of temporarily reduced rates of call of VAT for specific Member States;
- introduction of temporary reductions in the GNI contributions for specific Member States.
In the coming seven years, the Netherlands and Sweden will benefit from gross annual reductions in their GNI contributions of €605m and €150m respectively expressed in 2004 prices. These gross reductions will be financed by all Member States.
-Adjustment of the UK correction to enlargement. The UK rebate shall remain in full except for enlargement-related expenditure. Expenditure in the new Member States, with the exception of CAP market expenditure, shall therefore be excluded from total allocated expenditure for the purpose of calculating the UK correction. This reduction of total allocated expenditure shall be progressively phased-in and shall cease to apply as from the 2013 correction to be budgeted for the first time in 2014.
The European Council also concluded that during the 2007–2013 period, the total adjustment of the amount of the UK correction resulting from this reduction of allocated expenditure shall not exceed €10.5 billion, in 2004 prices (to be adjusted upwards in case of any other enlargement than for Romania and Bulgaria before 2013).
This decision will enter into force in 2009. Rapporteur Alain LAMASSOURE EPP-ED FR A6-0223/2006 Union's budget: system of the European Communities' own resources, adjustment of the United Kingdom correction, financial framework 2007-2013 Procedure : Consultation

Research and innovation
More research and innovation in Europe
2006-06-30 - 10:47
In an own-initiative report, MEPs point out that Europe is still lagging behind the USA and Japan on growth, research and productivity. They propose ways to change this, including promoting entrepreneurship, providing adequate research funding and pooling existing knowledge.
Other demands of the report include: stronger support for European researchers, especially at the start of their careers, the creation of a single market for scientists, improved employment conditions for scientists, measures to stem the brain drain and to foster a culture which celebrates innovation, European prizes for innovation, regional zones of innovation and networking of zones in different regions and countries.
MEPs also call for sweeping reform of the EU's state aid rules, shifting subsidies from big, ailing companies to small and innovative businesses. And they propose the implementation of a tax credit system to encourage the service sector to take an interest in research findings and their utilisation.
The report was drafted by Pilar del CASTILLO VERA (EPP-ED, ES) and adopted by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy by 40 votes to 2.
