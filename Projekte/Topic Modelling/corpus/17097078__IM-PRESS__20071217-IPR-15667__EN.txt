Members of the EP Civil Liberties Committee gave the go-ahead on Tuesday for an extension of simplified controls at the external frontiers of Bulgaria and Romania. This system will enable these two new Member States to recognise unilaterally certain documents issued by Schengen zone countries for individuals making visits of less than five days.
Through two decisions adopted in 2006, the Community for the first time introduced common rules on the recognition of visas and residence permits. These rules allow Member States to simplify external border controls of non-EU nationals bearing certain documents issued by Member States of the Schengen zone. This recognition regime is unilateral, optional and is limited to transit visits of less than five days.
The EP Civil Liberties Committee today approved a report under the co-decision procedure by Michael Cashman (PES, UK) supporting the Commission's proposal to extend the simplified regime to Bulgaria and Romania. These countries were not part of the Union when the two decisions were adopted. Member States concerned are able either to apply the new instrument or to continue issuing national visas. If they opt to apply the common rules, Bulgaria and Romania will have to accept all documents of Member States which implement the full Schengen acquis.
Another co-decision report, by Panayiotis Demetriou (PPE-DE, EL), also adopted on Tuesday by the Civil Liberties Committee, aims to enable Bulgaria and Romania to recognise unilaterally certain residence documents issued by Switzerland and Liechtenstein, also for transit purposes.
