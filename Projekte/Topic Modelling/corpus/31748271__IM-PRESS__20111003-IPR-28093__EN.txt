Charlotte NILSSON BXL (+32) 2 28 34018 STR (+33) 3 881 72420 PORT (+32) 498 98 13 36 EMAIL cont-press@europarl.europa.eu The European Police College (CEPOL) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) should be granted a discharge (approval) for the way in which they managed their funding in financial 2009, but the Council of Ministers should not, said the Budgetary Control Committee on Monday. All other EU bodies have already been granted discharges for their 2009 budgets.
In May 2011, Parliament postponed its decision to grant a discharge to the Director of the Police College (Bramshill, UK), for the management of its 2009 budget. The committee's recommendation to grant one now reflects the facts that the Police College has since improved its procurement procedures and practices, its current Director is more open about the accounts, and it is progressing according to its set targets.
The Medicines Agency (London, UK) has taken action to remedy shortcomings in its management of the Agency's 2009 budget. Although the committee recommends granting the Agency’s Executive Director a discharge, some concerns remain. Parliament wants EMA staff members' impartiality and independence to be assessed thoroughly when they are appointed project team leaders for evaluating medicinal products. Furthermore, it calls on the EMA to improve procurement procedures and to keep the Parliament better informed of the results of actions requested.
The closure of accounts - the last formal step in the discharge procedure - for 2009 was also approved for both the Police College and the EMA.
Further info needed on Council spending
The committee was unable to recommend granting a discharge to the Council for financial 2009 because Parliament has not yet received all the documents and information required. MEPs maintain that they are entitled to take separate decisions on whether to grant budget discharges to EU institutions, including the Council - a view which is not currently accepted by the Council itself.
Background
The European Parliament is the EU's budget discharge authority. Once annual accounts are audited and finalised, Parliament decides - on a recommendation by the Council of Ministers - whether or not to grant a discharge to the Commission and other EU bodies for their spending in each financial year.
Next steps
The discharges will have to be approved by Parliament as a whole, in plenary session. The plenary votes are currently scheduled for 25 October.
In the chair: Jan Mulder (ALDE, NL)
