President Barroso and Commissioner McCreevy invited to appear before Parliament
Parliament voted 189 votes in favour, 157 against with 10 abstentions to invite both Commission President BARROSO and Commissioner Charlie McCREEVY to appear before Parliament this session. The request was put forward by the Socialist Group and supported by the Greens/EFA and EUL/NGL groups following alleged comments made by Commissioner McCreevy on the " compatibility of the Swedish social model with the European model ." The ALDE and UEN groups opposed the motion whereas the EPP-ED group would have favoured that only Mr McCreevy come before Parliament.
Minute of silence for victims of the earthquake in South Asia and Hurricane in Guatemala
EP Vice-President Alejo VIDAL-QUADRAS ROCA (EPP-ED, ES) underlined the grief felt due to the tragedies of the earthquake in Pakistan as well as hurricane Stan which hit Central America. The earthquake, he recalled, had caused thousands of deaths, in particular in Kashmir. He also recalled that Parliament's President Josep BORRELL immediately expressed the Parliament's solidarity to the authorities concerned. He underlined that the EU had responded quickly to both tragedies offering aid for reconstruction.
Minute of silence for the late Jürgen Zimmerling
Parliament also held one minute of silence for Jürgen Zimmerling who died on 8 October. Mr Zimmerling was a Member in both the previous and current Parliament and he served on the Committee on Development and on the Delegation for Relations with the Gulf States, including Yemen.
