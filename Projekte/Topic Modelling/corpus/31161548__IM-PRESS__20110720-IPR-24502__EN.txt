A delegation from the European Parliament, composed of Niccolò Rinaldi (ALDE, IT) and Patrice Tirolien (S&D, FR), head of the delegation, visited South Sudan from 19 to 21 July of 2011.The two members of the Committee on Development welcomed the allocation by the EU of 200 million Euros to support the implementation of the Government of South Sudan's forthcoming "2011-13 Development Plan" for projects related to education, health, agriculture, food security and democratic governance.
The MEPs also congratulated the population and the government of the new born country for its independence and welcomed the new Republic of South Sudan as the 193th member of the United Nations.
During the exchanges of views with the south Sudanese's authorities - notably the Speaker of the Parliament - and the donors' community, the EP delegation witnessed the efforts that the country and the international community are carrying out to promote the respect for democratic principles, the economic development of the country and the close cooperation with its neighbour Sudan.
"We are conscious that the country is facing great challenges and that the youngest state of the world will need all the support from the international community in order to become a prosperous, peaceful and secure country, capable of meeting the demands of its population" stated Mr Tirolien.
In order to have a better idea of the urgent needs of the country, the delegation travelled to Rumbek, in the State of Lacs, where it visited a water management project funded by the Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection Department (ECHO) of the European Commission.
"For the European Union, and particularly for the European Parliament, helping South Soudan to attain a development which is inclusive and democratic is paramount" stated Mr Rinaldi. The delegation welcomed the allocation by the EU of 200 million Euros to support the implementation of the Government of South Sudan's forthcoming "2011-13 Development Plan", especially for projects related to education, health, agriculture, food security and democratic governance.
A report of this mission will be presented and discussed in the Committee of Development after the summer recess.
