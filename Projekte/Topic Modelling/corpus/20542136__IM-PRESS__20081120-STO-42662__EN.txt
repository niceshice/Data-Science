Growing old gracefully- MEPs debate pension reform European citizens are getting older and greyer. By 2050 it is estimated that the average age in the European Union will be 49, up from 39 now. Coupled with a low birth rate, future generations will see more of their earnings going to support a geriatric Europe - funding pensions, healthcare and Cliff Richard albums.
A report by German Christian Democrat Gabriele Stauner, backed by the Employment and Social Affairs Committee, highlights the increased pressure on pensions and the extra strain on the healthcare system that an older population brings. It says healthcare spending will account for an extra 2% of GDP by 2050.
While spending is set to rise, the number of workers to fund it is falling. Today, there are 4 workers for every person over 65. By 2030 it is estimated that the ratio of active to inactive persons will be 2:1.
What's the solution?
Ms Stauner suggests that we should encourage people to work beyond the suggested retirement age, particularly since Europeans are now healthier and live longer.
However, a dwindling birth rate and potential lack of an employable young workforce is still an issue. Ms Stauner wants to get students into the workforce through training.
In addition, the proportion of students who are also parents is very low. The exception is Sweden with 41%, which has a range of social and economic measures to help students who are parents. A reform of social security spending across Europe could rectify this imbalance, according to the report.
Finally, Ms Stauner stressed the importance of immigration to boost the working population. The Blue Card scheme proposed by the Commission and backed by Parliament should help the movement of migrant workers around Europe. According to a recent Eurostat poll, if immigration remains steady around 2005 levels, the population will continue to grow until around 2030.
