Citizens' forums will test the political water this spring
The theory that "all politics is local" will be the theme when a series of citizens' forums are held across Europe in the coming months. As the European Union is going through a period of self-reflection after the rejection of the Constitutional Treaty by France and the Netherlands in 2005, the aim of these events is to take the debate over the future of Europe to regional towns and cities. The aim is to be "as local as possible" and to ensure that public opinion is heard by Europe's leaders.
Raising subjects that are of particular relevance to the region or country is a key part of the approach. The aim is to be as inclusive as possible - with the general public, members of the European Parliament, local politicians, national MPs, civil society groups and the media all being involved. Events are planned in five countries in the next three months - Germany, France, Greece Poland and Sweden. The timetable for the second half of the year will be released later. Conclusions from the first five events will be sent to the heads of the 25 EU governments for consideration at their June summit.
