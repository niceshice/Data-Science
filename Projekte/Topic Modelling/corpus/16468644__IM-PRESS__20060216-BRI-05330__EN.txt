MEPs gather for their March plenary session in Strasbourg, with an agenda ranging from the future of the Lisbon Strategy to the fight against forced prostitution. The session includes two formal sittings: Parliament will be addressed by both the Federal President of Germany and the President of the Palestinian National Authority.
The session opens on Monday begins with a debate on forced prostitution during major sporting events and on human trafficking. MEPs will then discuss the issue of industrial relocations and their impact on European regions. The day will end with a debate on the transition periods before labour markets in many of the EU15 Member States are fully opened to workers from the 10 countries which joined the EU in 2004.
On Tuesday, MEPs will focus on employment issues, before examining the legislation to create an European Institute for Gender Equality. At midday, Horst Köhler, Federal President of Germany, will make a formal address to the House. The afternoon sitting will be devoted to the state of the EU footwear sector, a year after restrictions on Chinese imports were lifted, and to the implementation of the European arrest warrant. The evening session includes debates on the Parliament's plans for its own budget in 2007 and on the report by Seán Ó Neachtain (UEN, IE) on environmentally friendly fishing methods.
Wednesday begins with the week's set piece debate: this will focus on the forthcoming Spring summit, devoted to economic issues, and the related topic of the Lisbon Strategy, aiming to bring new dynamism to the European economy. At midday, there will be a formal address by Mahmoud Abbas, President of the Palestinian National Authority. The afternoon session includes a debate on the future strategy for EU enlargement and a statement from the Competition Commissioner on EU merger policy. In the evening topics include a discussion on labelling of speciality foods.
On Thursday, Parliament will deal with two substantial EU programmes for the 2007-13 period, covering public health and consumer protection measures. The plenary session will end, as usual with three short debates on issues of human rights around the world, this time covering impunity in Africa, and in particular the case of Hissène Habré, Kazakhstan and Human Rights in Moldavia, in particular in Transdnistria.

European Council
The European Council and the Lisbon strategy
2006-03-15 - 21:17
Wednesday's sitting will open with debate on statements from the Council and Commission on the preparations for the Spring Summit and on the Lisbon Strategy. In March 2000, the European Council launched the Lisbon strategy, designed to make the EU 'the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world'. Its objectives were to raise employment rates, to develop a strategy of active ageing, to promote lifelong education and to build a research and information society. After disappointing results in the first five years, the strategy was relaunched in spring 2005.
Every year the Union holds a Spring European Council which focuses on the economic, social and environmental aspects of the Union's policies. This year it will take place on 23-24 March. In preparation for the European Council, the Commission has prepared an Annual Progress Report, published on 25 January, setting out the problematic areas in the implementation of the Lisbon strategy and outlining its strategic priorities, as well as containing an evaluation of every Member State's National Reform programme. So far, the Commission considers the National Reform Programmes to be "in general very encouraging". In addition, the report describes four areas of priority which it asks the Member States to commit to: investing in education and research; freeing up SMEs and unlocking business potential; getting people into work; efficient, secure and sustainable energy.

Combating forced prostitution during sports events
2006-03-15 - 21:17
Aiming to raise awareness about forced prostitution during international sports events, Anna Zaborska (EPP-ED, SK), Chair of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, will be putting an oral question to the Commission on behalf of her committee. MEPs will then vote on a resolution on the subject. The issue has been raised in the light of the forthcoming World Cup in Germany.
The question to the Commission stresses that human rights organisations in Europe fear that trafficking of women and forced prostitution will significantly increase during the football tournament in Germany. Most of the women who offer sexual services during similar events are in fact victims of organised crime and are often deceived by false promises of legitimate work and then forced to work as prostitutes. The committee asks the Commission whether the current strategies against trafficking include sports events. They also want to know what strategies the Commission and the Member States propose to fight the problem and how it will implement its action plan with immediate effect.
Further to the oral question, the committee is tabling a draft resolution, which urges the European Commission and the Member States to launch a European-wide campaign to inform and educate the general public and especially football fans about the issue. They also appeal for a prevention campaign targeted at potential victims. The draft condemns trafficking of women and children for sexual as well as other forms of exploitation as "one of the most egregious violations of human rights" and underline that forced prostitution is harmful to the society as a whole.
In light of the World Cup, MEPs in the committee call on Germany to set up a multilingual telephone hotline and visible communication campaign to help women forced into prostitution and other victims who are isolated and unable to speak the language of the country of transit or destination. They also urge the International Olympic Committee, FIFA, UEFA, the German Football Association and others as well as sportsmen to express their support for the fight against forced prostitution and trafficking. Furthermore they say that the media and sports stars also have to be involved in the awareness raising campaign to positively influence the changes in public mentality and behaviour.

Gender Equality Institute up and running in 2007
2006-03-15 - 21:17
MEPs are to examine plans to create a European Institute for Gender Equality. While strongly supporting the creation of this new Community body, MEPs in the Women's Rights and Gender Equality Committee want to make it more effective by sharpening the focus of its work. They also want guarantees about the management board's gender balance. It is hoped the institute will be able to start work next year.
The first reading legislative report, drafted by Lissy GRÖNER (PES, DE) and Amalia SARTORI (EPP-ED, IT), says the institute should to be operational "as soon as possible" and certainly no later than twelve months after the regulation establishing it enters force. EU governments have not yet decided where the Institute is to be located but Maria Rauch-Kallat, Austrian Minister for Health and Women's Issues, told the committee she was hoping for an agreement soon, so that the Institute can start work in 2007.
The Women's Rights Committee wants to make the Institute more active by shifting the focus of its work away from simply collecting and recording data on gender equality and towards data analysis, so as to enable the EU to " effectively promote and implement gender equality policy ". MEPs in the committee believe that what is lacking at EU and national level is a capacity to pool analysis and come up with innovative solutions on, for example, gender mainstreaming.
Regarding the Institute's Management Board, whose members are to be appointed by the Commission, Council and Parliament, MEPs say the aim must be to achieve an equal representation between women and men and that there should at least be a " guarantee that the representation of both sexes is not below 40% ".
The Institute will be funded by the Commission with a proposed budget of €52.2 million for the period 2007 to 2013.

Trafficking in human beings
2006-03-15 - 21:17
On behalf of the ALDE Group, Karin Riis-Jorgensen (ALDE, DK) and Elizabeth LYNNE (ALDE, UK) will be questioning the Commission on its measures against the trafficking of human beings and its position on the launch of an anti-trafficking day.
Along with the Daphne programme, the Council Directive 2004/81/EC on residence permits for victims of trafficking and the Council Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA on combating the trafficking of human beings are two of the EU's most fundamental instruments in its attempt to combat human trafficking. Accordingly, the speakers will ask the Commission which Member States have complied with the Council Directive 2004/81/EC, how they have done so, and ask for its position regarding the assessment reports demanded by the Council Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA. In addition, they will question the Commission on the possibility of launching an anti-trafficking day this year, on the initiatives it has thus far produced concerning data on the trafficking of human beings and its capacity to ensure a greater involvement of Eurojust and Europol in the fight against this trafficking.

Free movement of persons
Free movement of workers and transition periods
2006-03-15 - 21:17
On behalf of the ALDE group, Istaván Szent-Iványi (HU) Graham Watson (UK) and Ignasi Guardans Cambo (ES) will present a question concerning the treatment of third-country nationals and the citizens of new Member States within the European labour market.
The question is as follows:
Free movement of persons is one of the most fundamental freedoms guaranteed by Community law. It includes the right for EU nationals to move to another EU Member State to take up employment.
The Accession Treaty provides for a transitional period whereby Community law on free movement of workers may be deferred for a maximum period of 7 years in the enlarged EU.
According to Council Directive 2003/109/EC. Member States are required to ensure equal treatment between long-term third-country residents and nationals as regards access to employment and self-employed activity as of 23 January 2006. Thus the situation from that date contravenes the provisions of the Accession Treaty stipulating that the present Member States shall, during any period when national measures or those resulting from bilateral agreements are applied, give preference to workers who are nationals of the Member States over workers who are nationals of third countries as regards access to their labour market.
Does the Commission intend to submit proposals to remedy the situation as regards unequal treatment on the labour market of third-country nationals and citizens of the Member States that joined on 1 May 2004? Oral question to the Commission

Fisheries
Making fishing methods more environment friendly
2006-03-15 - 21:17
Parliament will be debating a report from the Fisheries Committee calling for an approach to fisheries which is balanced when it comes to social and economic requirements on the one hand and environmental sustainability on the other. The report is Parliament's response to a Commission communication on environmentally friendly fishing methods.
The own-initiative report, drawn up by Seán Ó Neachtain (UEN, IE), reminds the Commission that the protection of the marine environment is about more than just fisheries policy, and needs also to take account of the impact of pollution, deep sea dredging and maritime transport. Emphasising that technical measures should be based on scientific fishing research, MEPs in the committee say there should be compensation for fishermen affected by moves towards environmentally-friendly fishing.
The report calls for technical methods to improve selectivity, and for the reduction of discards - with the Commission to start pilot projects on the latter issue. It says the negative impact of fisheries on marine biodiversity should be limited through the establishment of marine reserves, real-time closures and other measures, at least until habitats have returned to safe biological levels.
Among other measures, the committee also wants satellite technology to be used to detect unauthorised fishing vessels in closed areas. Rapporteur Seán Ó NEACHTAIN UEN IE A6-0019/2006 More environmentally-friendly fishing methods Procedure : Own-initiative

Regional policy
MEPs concerned about EU funding for company relocations
2006-03-15 - 21:17
MEPs are to consider what action Member States and the Commission should take to deal with company relocations, to prevent potential damage to economic development and in particular the social decline to which job losses can lead.
The debate is based on an own initiative report drawn up for the Regional Development Committee by Alain HUTCHINSON (PES, BE). Speaking before the committee vote, he said: "European money should not be used to fund the relocation of companies. Large-scale relocation can lead to the destabilisation of an entire region's social fabric".
A recent study on industrial relocation calculated that between 1995 and 2001 some 95,000 industrial jobs were lost in France and relocated abroad, an average of 13,500 a year, a little over half of them lost to the developing countries. Countries where wages are low represent slightly under half of relocation destinations, China being the main destination, far ahead of Eastern Europe, North Africa, South America and other Asian countries.
The Regional Development Committee says that practices not conducive to the achievement of economic cohesion and full employment, such as unjustified relocation likely to cause job losses, should not be financially supported by the EU.
In the context of regional state-aid, MEPs in the committee call on the Commission to take measures with a view to repayment of aid granted to companies which relocate their plants within or, in particular, outside the EU. The committee backs the idea of penalising companies which, having received European Union aid, relocate their activity within seven years.
The committee also wants the Dublin-based European Foundation on the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions to carry out studies into the impact of the relocation of companies, assessing the number of jobs created and lost, while taking into account their quality.
Lastly, the committee calls on the Commission and the Member States to monitor the effective and targeted use of European funds, which, says the report, should be focussed on vocational training and the retraining of workers in regions affected by restructuring or relocation and, in particular, of those workers who have been directly affected by a job loss as a result of the relocation of their former employer.

Legal professions and the functioning of legal systems
2006-03-15 - 21:17
What are the steps and measures the European Commission plans in order to take into account the specificities of the liberal professions in the legal sector? This is the issue at the heart of an oral question to be put by Giuseppe Gargani (EPP-ED, IT) on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
The full text of the question is as follows:
Does the European Commission consider that the specificity of the liberal professions in the legal sector, notably lawyers, notaries and tax advisers, compared with other economic activities, results from the high qualifications required, the need to establish a specific relationship based on trust between professionals and their clients, their role in access to justice and administration of justice, asymmetric information and the externalities which affect professional legal services in general? What are the steps and measures the European Commission plans in order to take into account these specificities of the sector?
Does the European Commission consider that public regulations and self-regulation established by professional associations of legal professions like lawyers and notaries under their own responsibility are of crucial importance to guarantee the independence of the professions that is a necessity in a balanced legal system, to ensure quality of services, to establish special value-based standards and to ensure that those regulations will be observed in a professional manner and include professional ethics? How does the European Commission intend to take into account these crucial points?
Does the Commission recognise that the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice does not prevent Member States from establishing compulsory tariffs because Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty apply only to anti-competitive conduct engaged in by undertakings on their own initiative?
Does the Commission recognise that Member States are authorised to establish compulsory tariffs taking into account the general interest and the interest of consumers and to protect the high moral, ethical and quality standards that lawyers and notaries represent and their clients trust in?

Evaluating the European Arrest Warrant
2006-03-15 - 21:17
Parliament is to debate the state of implementation of the European arrest warrant, when it considers an own-initiative report on the subject from the Civil Liberties Committee. Drawn up by Adeline Hazan (PES, FR), the report is a formal recommendation to the Council to make progress in implementing and evaluating the arrest warrant decision.
The report calls on the Council to adopt a framework decision on procedural rights in criminal proceedings to ensure a similar standard of legal protection for all European citizens, and to ensure that Member States do not reinstate systematic checks regarding double jeopardy for their nationals when they transpose the framework decision on the European arrest warrant into national law. The committee wants the Council to ensure no political authority can interfere in the arrest warrant procedure and also to make sure legal and constitutional obstacles to the arrest warrant are avoided.
The report also calls on the Council, with the support of the Commission, to undertake a thorough evaluation of problems encountered by legal professionals in the various Member States and to avoid a proliferation of parallel research projects.
The committee also wants to ensure that close attention is paid to the respect for human rights and fundamental rights in the implementation of the arrest warrant. Rapporteur Adeline HAZAN PES FR Procedure : Own-initiative

Enlargement: EU must keep its promises but take account of absorption capacity
2006-03-15 - 21:17
While the European Union should keep its promises to candidate countries and possible candidate countries, it should also take the EU's absorption capacity fully into account, says the Foreign Affairs Committee in a report which will now be debated by the whole Parliament.
If necessary, says the report, drawn up by Elmar BROK (EPP-ED, DE), the Commission should propose a close multilateral relationship to all European countries which currently have no recognised " membership perspective ". Countries which do have such a perspective should be free to join this multilateral framework as an intermediate step towards full membership. The report is Parliament's response to the Commission's 2005 enlargement strategy paper.
The committee asks the Commission to submit a report by the end of this year setting out the principles defining the EU's absorption capacity. It also asks the Commission to draw up a communication strategy " so as to meet the legitimate concerns of the European public regarding European enlargement and integration ". MEPs in the committee add that the stalemate in the ratification of a constitutional treaty is preventing the EU from increasing its absorption capacity and that no new Member States should be allowed in before the necessary budgetary resources are available.
They support the Commission's emphasis on " fair and rigorous conditionality ", whereby it will lay down clear requirements for each phase of the negotiations with accession countries and suspend negotiations when relevant conditions are not met. The report reminds candidates and potential candidate countries that they should not only adopt laws to comply with the accession conditions, but should also rigorously implement and enforce them.
With regard to Turkey, the committee says that the pace of change slowed in 2005, but it expresses the hope that the opening of negotiations will stimulate further reforms. The report welcomes the decision not to prosecute Turkish author Orhan Pamuk, but denounces the further prosecution of others for the non-violent expression of their opinion, even on the basis of the newly adopted penal code. Turkey is urged once more to remove all restrictions on Cypriot ships and airplanes, but MEPs in the committee also urge the Council to move ahead on the financial aid and trade package for northern Cyprus. The committee voices concern at the increase in violence in south-eastern Turkey after the resumption of terrorist attacks.
The decision to open accession negotiations with Croatia is welcomed, as is the decision to grant the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia the status of candidate country. With regard to other countries in the Western Balkans, MEPs point out that these countries were given a European " perspective " at the Thessaloniki summit of 2003. They welcome the fact that Albania is close to finalising negotiations for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement, as well as the Council decision to start such negotiations with Bosnia-Herzegovina. The BiH authorities are urged to review the Dayton constitutional arrangements, while combining democracy and effectiveness with a proper representation of all ethnic groups. The international intervention in the government of Bosnia-Herzegovina should be further reduced.
The committee is pleased with the " significant progress " made by the Belgrade authorities in their cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.
It also welcomes the impending start of negotiations on the final status of Kosovo but is concerned that the UN Special Envoy has described inter-ethnic relations, especially with regard to Serbs and Roma, as " grim ". They conclude that the only solution to the status question may be a multi-ethnic Kosovo.

Agriculture
Maintaining strict quality labelling for food and drink
2006-03-15 - 21:17
MEPs are to deal with two measures on protected designations of origin (PDO), protected geographical indication (PGI), and traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) food and drink products. The Agriculture Committee is recommending approval for Commission proposals to amend the relevant regulations, but insists that high standards be maintained for these products.
PDOs (such as Roquefort cheese) must be produced, processed and prepared in a given geographical area using a recognised, specified method. PGIs (such as Newcastle Brown Ale ) require a link between at least one stage of production, processing or preparation and the region, place or country of origin. TSGs (such as the Belgian cherry-flavoured beer Kriek ) highlight the traditional composition or a traditional method of processing or preparation of a product.
A recent ruling by the WTO required the Commission to improve access by non-EU nationals to the EU system of granting these protected labels. The Agriculture Committee adopted two consultation reports today, giving its opinion on the proposed revisions. The consultative reports by Friedrich-Wilhelm GRAEFE ZU BARINGDORF (Greens-EFA, DE) on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs and on agricultural products and foodstuffs as traditional specialities guaranteed are now to be debated by the plenary session.
The committee calls on the Council to " make only those amendments to [the Regulation] which are necessary in light of the ruling of the WTO, and to debate without pressure of time those elements of the Commission proposal which are more far-reaching ." It also suggests publishing the register on the Internet, and clarifying the current labelling system by introducing colour-codes for different types of protection.
Although accepting private inspection bodies, the committee was concerned that giving Member States the role of registering PDOs, PGIs and TSGs would complicate the current system. Therefore, the report asks the Commission to examine " whether a specific agency or one of the existing Community agencies would be better able to ensure that the Community register is administered in an efficient and uniform way ."
Finally, the committee wants to maintain a clear difference between PDO, PGI and TSG labels and the actual origin of the product itself. Under current legislation, a non-EU party can apply for protection of a product from one of its own regions, and therefore gain access to the Community protection system. This can cause consumers to think that the product in question was produced in the EU. The report therefore suggests that " the place of origin and processing of agricultural products and foodstuffs marketed under a registered name should be indicated on the label ."

Budget
Simplifying the EU's financial regulation
2006-03-15 - 21:17
MEPs are to consider a series of modifications to the EU's Financial Regulation - the basis of the EU's budget management and spending procedures, when the ydebate a consultative report from Ingeborg GRÄSSLE (EPP-ED, DE) for the Budgets Committee.
The current regulation, adopted in 2002 after a major overhaul, aimed to simplify the system while ensuring strict financial discipline. But experience has shown that the 2002 regulation has been fairly cumbersome to handle in some respects, so the Commission is now proposing a new series of simplifications, reducing the red tape involved, notably when it comes to small grants and contracts with the EU institutions.
While they are supporting the effort as a whole, MEPs in the committee are proposing a series of changes to safeguard the powers of Parliament as budgetary authority, notably when it come to transfers between budget headings. A range of amendments deals with tenders: here the target is to render procedures faster and less burdened by paperwork. There are other amendment with similar goals for the grants system.
The final decision in this case is for the Council. It is hoped that the revised regulation could be in place in time to be implemented alongside the new Financial Perspective for 2007-13.

Budget
Parliament's guidelines for its own budget in 2007
2006-03-15 - 21:17
MEPs will debate the priorities for Parliament's own budget for 2007 when they consider a report from the Budgets Committee, drawn up by Louis Grech (PES, MT), which presents guidelines for the budget setting process for Parliament - and the other EU institutions with the exception of the Commission.
The report stresses the importance of information policy noting that over the years European institutions have failed to convince European citizens that they truly represent their interests and aspirations. It says insufficient knowledge coupled with a poor perception makes understanding of EU policies difficult and takes the view that the existing information services have to be improved and that an effective strategy, accessible to all European citizens, should be implemented as a matter of priority for all institutions.
The Budgets Committee invites all European institutions to study the feasibility of setting up a Centre of European Houses in Brussels, using existing resources without incurring any significant additional expenditure. This would be a place for citizens to participate freely in various areas, including cultural and technical events, training seminars and exhibitions on specific topics.
The report affirms Parliament's commitment to deliver on promises to the EU citizens in an efficient, tangible and accountable manner and in so doing strengthen the image and credibility of the European Institutions. It commits Parliament to fulfil its responsibilities as the only democratically elected representation of the people of the EU. One practical suggestion is to re-examine the structure of debates during the plenary sessions.
Among other points, the report calls for the Council to make progress on the issue of a statute for MEPs' assistants and insists on the need to re-address the "unnecessary and exorbitant costs" of Parliament having to work in three locations. Rapporteur Louis GRECH PSE MT Procedure : Budgetary

Social policy
How to ease the pain of industrial restructuring
2006-03-15 - 21:17
MEPs will debate a report from Jean Louis Cottigny (PES, FR) for the Employment Committee which stresses the importance of preventing social hardship as a consequence of economic restructuring. The own-initiative report points out that " social decline and loss of economic substance " is not necessarily a consequence of restructuring if there is effective collaboration between firms, trade unions and the public sector - but often, there is not. MEPs in the committee say the EU should offer " necessary financial resources to anticipate better and accompany restructuring and mitigate its social consequences ". Small businesses, in particular, should be supported in this context, mainly via the Structural Funds. Moreover, the committee proposes that the financial programs under discussion for 2007-2013 should be geared more closely to anticipating and managing restructuring.
The report stresses the enormous disadvantages suffered by people who lose their jobs, saying they should received assistance as a priority. MEPs in the committee note the "hidden effects" such as medical and psychological problems affecting workers` health when restructuring takes place. Other arrangements can help, including regional employment pacts and aid for training and re-training workers who are made redundant.
Calling " for better monitoring and better traceability of the use of Community funds " the report says funds are sometimes diverted to related, speculative or administrative purposes. To prevent " subsidy tourism " the committee says that firms subsidised from EU funds should not receive any further Community aid for a given period of time if they relocate within the EU. In addition they could be required to reimburse aid. Rapporteur Jean Louis COTTIGNY PSE FR A6-0032/2006 Restructuring and employment Procedure : Own-initiative

Social policy
Tackling poverty and social exclusion
2006-03-15 - 21:17
MEPs will debate the best ways of reducing poverty and social exclusion as they consider a Commission analysis of the issue. Parliament's response - in a report from the Employment and Social Affairs Committee - gives a thorough overview of the issues and calls for increased cooperation between EU Member States in tackling these problems.
The own initiative report, drawn up by Edit BAUER (EPP-ED, SK), notes that some 15 per cent of the EU population in 2002 was living at risk of poverty. It says EU employment and participation levels remain insufficient and unemployment is high in a number of Member States. The report emphasises that employment is the most effective safeguard against poverty - it therefore calls for a focus on the elimination of inequalities in the labour market.
Among many other points, the committee notably calls for the EU leaders to adopt an integrated framework in the fields of social protection and integration when they meet at the Spring Summit. Rapporteur Edit BAUER EPP-ED SK A6-0028/2006 Social protection and inclusion Procedure : Own-initiative

External/international trade
Shoe manufacturing and Chinese imports
2006-03-15 - 21:17
Enrique Barón Crespo (PES, ES), Chair of the International Trade Committee, will put an oral question to the Commission on the footwear sector after the lifting of restrictions on imports from China in 2005. MEPs will debate the issue after hearing the Commission's response.
Here is the full text of the question:
On 1 January 2005, the last restrictions on import of footwear from China were removed, and all footwear items have been allowed to enter the Community without restrictions.
The European Commission introduced a twofold surveillance system aiming to monitor import trends from China as well as from other exporting countries into the EU. Chinese goods entering the Community were in particular subject to a system of prior import licences (the so-called ex-ante surveillance).
Community surveillance showed that imports from China increased substantially in 2005 (up to +500%). This severely impacted on the competitiveness of the European footwear sector, which was unable to face the flooding of imported goods at very cheap prices.
This led to a further shrinking of the footwear sector in the Community, triggering an increasing number of bankruptcies and a substantial reduction of the sector's workforce.
Furthermore, traditional shoe and component suppliers from third countries, including certain candidate countries and developing countries, have been wiped out from the Community market.
Last year the European industry lodged a complaint against China (and Vietnam) claiming that their exports to the Community were priced artificially low. The European Commission opened an anti-dumping investigation. This investigation is, in terms of size and importance, the biggest anti-dumping case ever opened by the Community.
Parliament wishes to seek further information on the following aspects of the Commission initiatives in support of fair trade in the footwear sector.
- Can the Commission comment on the impact of the disappearance of the quota system for both the Community industry and developing countries?
- How does the Commission intend to face up to the inevitable restructuring of the European footwear sector?
- What is the Commission's assessment of the results of the footwear monitoring system?
- Bearing in mind that cases are confidential, can the Commission provide a short description and an evaluation of the ongoing anti-dumping investigation, the results of which are about to be made public? In particular, what is the Commission's approach to 'Community interest' in this case?
- Does the Commission envisage undertaking further international initiatives (similar to what happened to textiles) to defend the footwear sector from unfair trade?
- If requested by Member States, would the Commission consider whether it would be appropriate to open a TPSSM (Transitional product-specific safeguard mechanism) investigation against China?

Free movement of capital
Reducing red tape in the company law directive
2006-03-15 - 21:17
MEPs are to vote on changes to the rules on external reporting and shareholder consultation for public companies. The European Commission is aiming to lighten the regulatory burden of the 1976 second Company Law Directive, which sets out rules on the maintenance of companies' capital and on the way shares are bought and sold. Parliament's Legal Affairs Committee wants to go further in removing unnecessary red tape.
In a first reading legislative report drawn up by Piia-Noora KAUPPI (EPP-ED, FI), MEPs in the committee largely support the Commission's proposals, but are also proposing amendments to remove from the scope of the directive sell-out and squeeze-out rights, which protect minority shareholders in companies which have been the subject of a successful takeover bid.
The amendments proposed by the committee are the result of an agreement in informal discussions with the Council, so if the plenary approves them without further changes, the changes to the directive should enter force at this first reading stage. The European Commission is currently consulting interested parties on other changes to EU company law aimed at reducing the administrative burden on companies.

Information society
A knowledge-based society open to all
2006-03-15 - 21:17
MEPs are to debate a warning that Europe faces cultural and industrial decline if it cannot create a knowledge society with equal access for all. This comes in an own-initiative report from the Industry Committee, drawn up by Reino PAASILINNA (PES, FI), on the European Commission's strategy for a European Information Society for growth and employment (i2010),
The report stresses the importance of ICT (Information and Communications Technology) for the Lisbon Strategy and warns that, "unless the digital divide is overcome, enabling all citizens to gain access to, use and take part in the production of knowledge, there will be no knowledge-based society, but rather a cultural and industrial decline in the EU as a whole". MEPs in the committee call on the Commission to draw up a programme and a favourable legal framework to make citizens active participants in a knowledge-based society, thereby achieving the Lisbon objectives.
The report looks at the three policy objectives outlined by the Commission and stresses that the 2010 programme represents "a decisive phase" in the emergence of the information society. It makes a large number of recommendations, including the following:
- technology should be made more accessible for citizens and should also meet "the moral demands of society";
- the Commission should guarantee and promote media pluralism by interpreting and implementing the provisions which concern the electronic media infrastructure;
- as Parliament had long demanded, the Commission should draw up a Green Paper on concentration of media ownership and respect for the principles of freedom of information and pluralism;
- a regulatory framework should be established for the internet, given that it is "the fundamental vehicle for an economy based on information";
- Member States should support the universal provision of broadband and wireless technology;
- users should be able to change their service provider without having to change their e-mail address;
- the Commission should specify "clear actions" to provide protection from harmful content;
- when reviewing ICT legislation, the Commission should lay down quality criteria such as the protection of childhood and freedom of choice of consumers;
- the "Television without Frontiers" Directive should be adapted to changes in a converging media world;
- the Commission should promote concrete activities for facilitating and supporting the creation and distribution of European content, and pan-European broadcasting systems such as EuroNews should be supported;
- public services and public broadcasting services, which contribute to "social cohesion, the democratic discourse and pluralism in Europe", must be able to take part in technological and social development and continue to perform their social function;
- Member States should take additional measures to ensure access to e-government services irrespective of place, time or wealth;
- the Commission should draw up without delay a proposal for a charter of citizens’ fundamental rights for the digital age;
- a Charter of eRights should progressively be adopted by public administrations in Europe as a shared set of principles and guidelines defining the framework within which all citizens can enjoy those rights;
- the Commission should establish a dialogue with the main players on the media market, with a view to drafting a Gender Equality Code for the media. Rapporteur Reino PAASILINNA PES FI A6-0036/2006 A European Information Society for growth and employment Procedure : Own-initiative

Public health
What price the health of Europe's citizens?
2006-03-15 - 21:17
The Environment and Health Committee wants to allocate €1,500 million over seven years to the new Community action programme on health. Although healthcare services are run entirely by the individual Member States, the European Union has a complementary role in health issues. The full Parliament will now debate how best it can play this role.
The European Commission originally suggested a single action programme for health and consumer protection, with an overall budget of €1,203 million of which €969 million were earmarked for health. The Commission hoped to achieve more efficiency by combining the two areas but Parliament, while in favour of pooling administrative resources, decided that the two areas, which come under different legal bases (Articles 152 and 153 of the EC Treaty) in which the EU has different powers, should be split into two separate programmes. See the link below for details of the separate report dealing with the consumer protection programme. All these figures will ultimately depend on the overall agreement, if any on the next Financial Perspective.
The Environment Committee sees health as an extremely important area and one where the public has much to gain from an ambitious European policy, even if the organisation of healthcare and the funding thereof is in the hands of the individual Member States. The new EU programme is designed to protect the public against threats to health, make national healthcare systems more effective and encourage healthy lifestyles.
MEPs in the committee also believe that a higher standard of health protection should be a goal of all EU policies. They wish to reduce inequality between and within Member States by guaranteeing access to healthcare for all according to comparable standards and without discrimination, and they wish to facilitate patient mobility. To achieve this, transparency between national healthcare systems must be improved. There should be see greater cross-border cooperation, in particular for the treatment of rare diseases, plus exchanges of information on the services and treatments available and on reimbursements. The programme also includes special measures on risk prevention, information for practitioners and the public and the exchange of best practice.

Civil protection
A broader approach to disaster reaction
2006-03-15 - 21:17
The Environment Committee wants to widen the scope of EU action to prepare for and respond to natural disasters. MEPs will be debating the issue when they consider a report drawn up by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL, EL) on the Commission's plans for a 'rapid response and preparedness instrument.'
A series of natural disasters in 2004-5, including the tsunami in Asia, the cyclone in Louisiana, floods in Central Europe and drought and fires in Spain and Portugal have led to calls for a more efficient European Union response to such crises, whether within the EU or elsewhere.
This new 'instrument' will be the legal basis for EU funding to support civil protection measures after natural disasters. It brings together a number of existing instruments, widening and setting out more detail on what can be funded. The Committee is seeking three sets of changes: to legal base for the legislation, to the scope of the activity involved and to the budget.
On the legal base, the Committee wants the measure adopted as public heath and environment legislation (under the codecision procedure) rather than the Commission's plan to use article 308 of the Treaty, which allows for action at community level not specifically provided for elsewhere in the Treaty, but only with unanimity in the Council and just consultation of Parliament.
The original proposal did not address prevention, but the committee believes preventive measures are essential in this field and proposes amending the title and objectives accordingly. It also extended the scope of the proposal in other ways, so as to include a rapid response to emergencies, not only inside but also outside the Community, which have or may have "adverse impact on people, public health and safety, property, cultural heritage or the environment caused by natural, industrial or technological disasters, including marine pollution, or acts of terrorism".
As a result of the amendments extending the scope to include prevention and financing of actions outside the Community, the committee calls for the budget initially proposed by the Commission (€173 million for the period 2007-2013) to be increased by €105 million, bringing it up to €278 m. These budgetary provisions remain indicative, pending an agreement on the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013.
A report on the related European Union Solidarity Fund proposal has been drawn up by the Regional Development Committee and is due for debate at the April plenary session in Strasbourg. On 20 March, the Environment, Agriculture and Regional Development Committees will be holding a joint public hearing on natural disasters.

EU mercury strategy
2006-03-15 - 21:17
Parliament will consider the EU's future approach to the hazards of mercury, when it debates an own-initiative report from Marios Matsakis (ALDE, CY) for the Environment Committee. Mr Matsakis says it is "an economic, political and moral imperative" for the EU to take the lead in dealing with global mercury problems.
While welcoming the Commission's strategy on mercury, MEPs in the committee want the EU to take a series of specific measures to tackle the problems caused by the substance, of which the EU is the world's largest exporter. They want an export ban in place by 2010 at the latest and for measures to enforce safe storage of mercury produced by the chlor-alkali industry. The report says the Commission should apply the 'polluter pays' principle, in particular when it comes to the costs of storage.
MEPs recommend that compensation should be offered to the Almadén area in Spain, to tackle the environmental and social problems arising from the closure of the long established mercury mines there.
The committee also wants to establish emission limit values for mercury released through burning coal, and restrictions on the use of mercury in measuring and control equipment. Among other points, they call for the issue of mercury use in vaccine production to be addressed and for information campaigns to increase awareness of the risks associated with mercury.

Fourth World Water Forum in Mexico City
2006-03-15 - 21:17
Roberto Musacchio (GUE, IT), Caroline Lucas (Greens/EFA, UK), Alain Lipietz (Greens/EFA, FR), Glyn Ford (PES, UK), Giovanni Berlinguer (PES, IT) and Béatrice Patrie (PES, FR) will present a question to the Commission on its participation in the World Water Forum this year.
It reads as follows:
The Fourth World Water Forum, a platform for discussing and shaping world political decisions on the management of water and its resources, will be held in Mexico City from 16 to 22 March 2006. It is organised every three years by the World Water Council (WWC) and has met in Morocco (1997), the Netherlands (2000) and Japan (2003). With no democratic accountability, the World Water Forum is essentially a key-decision-making-body, inspired the World Bank, that sees itself as a centre for the worldwide coordination of the future management of global water resources. As part of the Forum in Mexico City, a 'Ministerial Conference' has been called for 21 and 22 March 2006, along with regional discussions, divided by continent. Regional 'Consultation Networks' and 'Operational Committees' have been set up, through which global water policy will be implemented, bypassing democratic debate and citizens, in Europe and elsewhere. According to official information given by the WWC, the European Commission is fully involved in the proceedings in Mexico City.
With what mandate, awarded by whom and following which political debate in the European Parliament will the Commission participate in the Forum in Mexico?
What political positions regarding water will the Commission be defending at the Fourth World Water Forum?
Does the Commission intend to defend the standpoint, formally adopted by the European Parliament at its vote on 11 March 2004 on the Miller report on Internal Market Strategy - Priorities 2003-2006, that 'since water is a shared resource of mankind, the management of water resources should not be subject to the rules of the internal market'?
What is the Commission's strategy for promoting access to water as a fundamental human right? Is the Commission in favour of drafting an international treaty, at UN level, on access to water as a human right?

Consumers
EU consumer protection programme
2006-03-15 - 21:17
"To promote the interests of consumers," reads the EC's founding Treaty, the Community is to take "measures which support, supplement and monitor the policy pursued by the Member States." The Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee is calling for €233 million worth of such measures -- by supporting the 2007-2013 programme of Community action in the field of consumer protection.
The programme's objectives, to be achieved with a range of Community-financed actions and instruments, are fourfold: to aim for a better understanding of consumers and markets; to ensure better consumer protection regulation and greater participation of civil society stakeholders; to guarantee better enforcement, monitoring and redress; and lastly, to help produce better educated, responsible consumers.
The Commission had originally suggested a single action programme for health and consumer protection in hopes of achieving more synergies between the two areas. MEPs, however, did not agree with this approach and the Parliament decided last year to separate the programme into two. See the link below for details of the separate report on the health programme.
Given that MEPs decided to split the joint programme, it was only logical that they would do the same with its budget. 233 million euros, out of a total budget of €1,203 million, was consequently earmarked for consumer protection. However, with a view to the pending negotiations between Parliament and the Council over the 2007-2013 financial framework, the committee decided not to introduce any other amendments relating to the cost of the action programme.
The committee did vote, to decrease some ceilings for Community financing for "actions in pursuit of the aims and objectives" of the programme -- from 60 to 50 percent. It also approved an amendment defining the eligibility criteria for bodies and legal persons seeking to qualify for such financing, all while expanding the list of actions eligible for Community support. Lastly, MEPs in the committee supported amendments to strengthen assistance to consumer organisations in the new Member States.

Call for EU to vote as a block in the IMF
2006-03-15 - 21:17
MEPs are to vote on a call for EU Member States to vote as a block at the International Monetary Fund. This comes in a report from the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which aims to be Parliament's contribution to the strategic review currently underway at the IMF. The vote will take place on Tuesday, following the debate on this report on 16 February.
The report, drawn up by Benoît HAMON (PES, FR) says the IMF continues to play an important role, while supporting a re-orientation of IMF policies towards emphasising its core mandate of stabilising global exchange rate fluctuations and as a lender of last resort for countries experiencing serious balance of payment problems.
MEPs in the committee believe that, in the interests of its own legitimacy, the IMF should aim to make the distribution of quotas and voting rights more representative of the international economic situation, enabling more appropriate weightings to be given to developing and emerging countries. They suggest increasing the number and weight of basic votes and a mechanism to allow developing countries to increase their membership shares in the Fund. When it comes to the representation of the EU, the committee says the eurozone countries or, if possible the whole European Community, should find a way to guarantee they will vote as a single block. It suggests the Lamfalussy procedure might be used to define EU positions in international financial institutions.
The report says the loan conditions imposed by the IMF have, in some cases, been too rigid and not always consistent with local circumstances. It recommends a priority reference to poverty reduction as the goal of all IMF lending to low income countries. MEPs in the committee say the liberalisation of developing countries financial systems should be "gradual, sequential and stable," adjusted to take account of their institutional capacities. They strongly believe "developing countries should not have to open up their markets fully and without restrictions to foreign imports"; instead they should be able to establish protection for certain industries for a limited period so as to permit a steady development. The committee welcomes the IMF's emphasis on improving the levels of education and health in developing countries, while stressing that increasing public expenditure, together with improving governance, combating corruption and efficient use of resources, remains the surest way to reduce inequality of access to goods and to fundamental rights such as health and education.

Human Rights
2006-03-15 - 21:17
The first meeting of the 62nd session of the Commission on Human Rights took place on 16 January. The Council and Commission will be making statements on the state of negotiations on the creation of a new Human Rights Council.
Established in 1964, the Commission on Human Rights is designed to address international themes relating to human rights. In the meeting held in Geneva, over 3,000 delegates from governments, inter-governmental organisations and NGOs discussed themes such as racism, civil and political rights, fundamental freedoms and the right to self-determination. As part of the reform of the UN, there are plans to replace the Commission with a more effective Human Rights Council. Council and Commission statements
