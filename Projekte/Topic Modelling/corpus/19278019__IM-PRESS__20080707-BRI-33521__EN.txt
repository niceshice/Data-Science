Opening of the Strasbourg plenary session: welcome for release of Ingrid Betancourt and other hostages
In a statement at the opening of the July Strasbourg session, EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering warmly welcomed the release on 2 July of Ingrid Betancourt and other hostages who were being held by guerrillas in Colombia. After reading out the names of all the hostages, who were liberated "thanks to a successful military operation by the Colombian army", Mr Pöttering said that the European Parliament shares their happiness and that of their loved ones. Their release, he said, clearly indicates that one must never give up hope.
Sarkozy to the European Parliament: "Europe can not be condemned to inaction"
French President Nicolas Sarkozy told MEPs that enlargement would only be possible with the Lisbon Treaty and new institutional arrangements. He told the House "we all have a heavy responsibility", namely "to get Europe out of its crisis". To do this, "we must reassure Europeans" and show that Europe is working for all. Many political groups supported the Presidency's priorities but some criticised the lack of social aspects and President Sarkozy's decision to attend the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games.
European Parliament backs liberalisation of EU gas market
The European Parliament supported the liberalisation of the gas market by adopting reports that - though reaching out to countries opposed to "full ownership unbundling" (the separation of gas suppliers from gas transmission networks) - place strict conditions on companies that do not unbundle.
European Strategic Energy Technology Plan needed to achieve 2020 energy climate objectives, say MEPs
MEPs say energy efficiency needs to be included in the European Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan in an own initiative report adopted by 596 votes in favour to 85 against and 14 abstentions. The report also makes recommendations to the Commission's SET Plan on the inclusion of intensified research into biofuels, and supports the plan to include research in nuclear power and carbon capture and storage (CCS).
EU actions in Afghanistan are a "test case for international development assistance", say MEPs
International reconstruction work in Afghanistan must be more closely harmonised among all institutions involved, says the EP in a report adopted with 423 votes in favour, 74 against and 43 abstentions. It calls for a larger political role for the EU in Afghanistan and stresses the need to maintain the distinction between military and civilian actions by all actors. The report calls on the US government to abandon its crop eradication policy and notably the use of ‘Roundup’ for aerial sprayings.
Parliament welcomes positive developments in EU-China relations
The resolution, adopted by 439 in favour to 51 against and 139 abstentions, calls on the Chinese authorities to bear in mind that earthquake warnings constitute one benchmark of the development of a country," stressing that future scientific warnings should be heeded if they forecast another natural disaster in China. Parliament stresses the importance of the EU and the international community for reconstruction efforts after the quake, and "notes with satisfaction that China rapidly agreed to accept the assistance of the international community in helping the victims of the earthquake."
Zimbabwe: MEPs call for a transitional administration
A transitional administration should help end the climate of terror sweeping Zimbabwe since the presidential elections campaign started. This administration should also organise fresh presidential elections, says a resolution adopted by the House. The resolution asks to tighten up sanctions against members of the Mugabe regime. The House stresses that the elections of 27 June cannot be regarded as legitimate, and welcomes the EU Presidency's statement of 28 June clearly stating this position.
Modernising the rules on food additives and labelling of azo dyes
MEPs updated and simplified EU rules for authorising food additives, flavourings and enzymes with the European Parliament adopting a legislative package on four draft regulations. The new procedures will assist the free movement of food within the EU and will also give better health and consumer protection, including clearer labelling of certain food colourings.
Public support, good neighbourhood policy and greater institutional efficiency needed for continued success in EU enlargement
The European Parliament reiterates its “firm commitment to all candidate countries and to those which have been given clear membership prospects,” but also notes that "the Union must make efforts to strengthen its integration capacity and that this capacity should be fully taken into account" in a report approved by a large majority (534-44-45). It also says that more substantive policies are needed to bridge the gap between the Union’s neighbourhood and enlargement policies.
Aviation to be included in the European Trading System from 2012 as MEPs adopt legislation
MEPs adopted legislation on including aviation in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), all flights starting and/or landing in Europe (including intercontinental flights) to be included in the ETS from 1 January 2012. The reduction target to be calculated on the basis of airlines' average annual emissions between 2004-2006: in the first period (2012), airline emissions to be cut by 3 percent based on an historic average; emissions will be reduced by 5% in 2013 compared to the historic average.
ECB praised for reaction to financial turmoil, caution advised on rate rises
The European Central Bank (ECB) has done “excellent work” in managing the financial turmoil, enhancing its reputation said MEPs in their annual report on the ECB. Parliament also calls for the ECB to monitor exchange rates and take action if necessary and to be cautious about raising interest rates to avoid endangering growth. The report was adopted by 501 votes in favour to 83 against and 78 abstentions.
MEPs' reflections on the Commission's 2009 Preliminary Draft Budget
In response to the Commission's 2009 Preliminary Draft Budget, MEPs call for finances to be available for the EU to respond to new financial needs, for the budget to include a proper reflection of the climate change priority and for the budget to be easier for EU citizens to understand. The report, adopted by 570 votes in favour to 49 against and 72 abstentions, is the first assessment by the European Parliament of the Commission's Preliminary Draft Budget (PDB) for 2009 and gives a provisional mandate to Parliament's negotiations with the Council in the July conciliation.
European Parliament adopts written declaration urging 2011 to be the European Year on Volunteering
Parliament adopted a written declaration announcing 2011 as the European Year on Volunteering. The House pointed out that there are more than 100 million Europeans of all ages, beliefs and nationalities who volunteer.
MEPs call for action over Sovereign Wealth Funds
In a resolution adopted by 661 votes in favour, 11 against and 23 abstentions, MEPs ask the Commission to work closely with the IMF and OECD to establish a global code of conduct for Sovereign Wealth Funds (state owned investment funds from around the world). But the Commission should also monitor SWF activities and play a coordinating role in ensuring national initiatives do not go against the commitment to openness to investments or endanger the EU's position on global markets.
New rules on written questions
Parliament adopted a report by Richard CORBETT (PES, UK) on new rules for written questions, this report introduces new guidelines for MEPs wanting to table a written question to either the Council or the Commission. According to the proposed changes, written questions will have to fall within the EU's competences, be concise and not contain offensive language. The report was adopted with 516 votes in favour, 143 against and 36 abstentions.
European Parliament increases threshold to form a political group
After the June 2009 European elections, to enjoy the status of political group within the Parliament, a minimum of 25 Members representing at least 7 Member States will be needed. MEPs decided to amend their internal rules to raise the threshold to constitute a political group. The report was adopted with 481 votes in favour, 203 against and 26 abstentions.
All-inclusive air fares just around the corner as MEP back legislation on transparency
Air travellers will soon be able to see at a glance exactly what they have to pay for their tickets, as the European Parliament approved new EU rules. Air fares as displayed will have to include all taxes, fees and charges added to the basic ticket price and known at the time of publication. Parliament approved a deal on this legislation reached with the Council, as it takes on board the EP's key first-reading amendments.
Europe-wide authorisation of railway rolling stock, but heritage railways exempted by MEPs
The European Parliament approved an agreement reached with the Council on the EU-wide approval of different types of railway rolling stock. Under the new legislation, any rolling stock already approved for use in one Member State will have to be accepted in the other states. This will cut red tape and should boost the development of rail transport in Europe. Heritage, museum and tourist railways are exempted from the directive, as the result of another successful demand by Parliament.
Towards a new culture for urban mobility
New thinking and innovative concepts on mobility on cities are urgently needed in order to tackle the negative effects of urban transport on climate change and the environment. By adopting an own-initiative report (581 votes in favour to 100 against and 33 abstentions) on a recent Commission Green Paper, the European Parliament calls for a clear definition of the EU's role in terms of urban mobility policy, with due respect to the subsidiarity principle.
Airbus/Boeing disputes: MEPs defend the European aircraft industry
MEPs support the defence of EU interests in the pending dispute settlement proceedings before the WTO, in a resolution adopted with 589 votes in favour, 53 against and 64 abstentions. Airbus/Boeing disputes over subsidies should be ruled out in the coming weeks. Implementing fair competition rules is among the recommendations sent by MEPs to the European Commission.
MEPs urge Italy to stop the ethnic census of Roma
The European Parliament asks the Italian authorities to refrain from collecting fingerprints from Roma people, including children, and to put an end to discriminatory policies, in a resolution adopted on 10 July. MEPs also say the integration of Roma people should be ensured at European level. The resolution was adopted with 336 votes in favour 220 against and 77 abstentions.
Reliable space assets needed for an independent European Security and Defence Policy
The European Union needs a common approach to defending its interests in space, says an own-initiative report by Security and Defence Subcommittee Chair Karl von Wogau (EPP-ED, DE), adopted by a large majority (483-99-20) in the European Parliament. The report underlines "the need for space assets in order that the political and diplomatic activities of the European Union may be based on independent, reliable and complete information”.
EP gives green light to derogations to European Fisheries Fund for a period of two years
The European Parliament backed the proposal instituting an ad hoc special temporary regime which will derogate from some provisions of the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) regulation up to the end of 2010. This proposal pledges up to another 600 million euros to fund this temporary specific action to help the fishing industry to adapt to high fuel prices.
Human rights: Kashmir, Bangladesh, death penalty in USA
In three resolutions adopted at the end of the Strasbourg session, Parliament calls for an inquiry into allegations of mass graves in Kashmir, for the speedy restoration of democracy in Bangladesh and for a fresh trial for Troy Davis, an American who sits on death row despite strong evidence that he may be innocent. 20080707BRI33521

Opening of the Strasbourg plenary session: welcome for release of Ingrid Betancourt and other hostages
2008-07-14 - 15:45
In a statement at the opening of the July Strasbourg session, EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering warmly welcomed the release on 2 July of Ingrid Betancourt and other hostages who were being held by guerrillas in Colombia. After reading out the names of all the hostages, who were liberated "thanks to a successful military operation by the Colombian army", Mr Pöttering said "The European Parliament shares their happiness and that of their loved ones. ( …) Their release clearly indicates that one must never give up hope."
He said he had congratulated President Uribe on the success of the military rescue operation and had stressed "that democracy should never give in to terrorism and that the rule of law must prevail".
He had also invited Ingrid Betancourt to visit the European Parliament when she has recovered. Lastly, the President issued "an appeal to FARC and to all terrorist groups to lay down their arms and to cease all irrational violence which does not lead anywhere. They should liberate all hostages and accept the offers of the Colombian authorities to seek peace".
French presidency of Council attends plenary: a first at Parliament
President Pöttering welcomed Jean-Pierre Jouyet , Minister of State for European Affairs, to the plenary session. He said this was the first time that the Presidency-in-Office of the Council had officially attended the opening of a Strasbourg plenary session at the start of its term of office.
Kashmir remained on the agenda
The House rejected, by 123 votes to 72, a request to remove the topic "Allegation of mass graves in Indian-administered Kashmir" from the list of human rights debates. The debate took place on Thursday, 10 July followed by the vote. A summary is available in this publication.

MEPs' reflections on the Commission's 2009 Preliminary Draft Budget
2008-07-14 - 15:45
In response to the Commission's 2009 Preliminary Draft Budget, MEPs call for finances to be available for the EU to respond to new financial needs, for the budget to include a proper reflection of the climate change priority and for the budget to be easier for EU citizens to understand. The report, adopted by 570 votes in favour to 49 against and 72 abstentions, is the first assessment by the European Parliament of the Commission's Preliminary Draft Budget (PDB) for 2009 and gives a provisional mandate to Parliament's negotiations with the Council in the July conciliation.
Payment appropriations and flexibility
In the report MEPs point out that at EUR 116 796 million, the level of payment appropriations is "extremely low" compared to the commitment appropriations adopted in the 2007 and 2008 budgets (totalling EUR 126 500 million and EUR 129 100 million respectively).
The report notes that the 2007-2013 financial perspective doesn't allot the EU to respond to new political needs flexibly and "the Union's capacity to react to policy changes in budgetary terms is extremely limited".
MEPs also note that they cannot always see a clear correlation between the Commission's political priorities and the PDB, and are "still not satisfied with the attempts of the Commission to include Parliament's priorities in the PDB".
Clarity, consistency and transparency
The report stresses "the importance of clarity, consistency and transparency in the presentation of the EU budget, which is an absolute necessity also with regard to the need to communicate to European citizens how EU money is spent".
Changes with the PDB headings
With heading 1a, the report deplores the limited margin available and recommends additional funding if "new priorities are to be set".
With heading 1b, the report "deplores the sharp decrease in payments which, when compared to 2008, fall by 13.9%" and MEPs state the EU must be able to deal with "current and future challenges to the solidarity principle".
With heading 2, the report welcomes the increase of expenditure for LIFE + (the new Financial Instrument for the Environment), but "considers that the horizontal budgetary priority of combating climate change is not properly reflected in these figures".
With heading 3a, MEPs say they are concerned about the poor funding for "fundamental rights and justice" activities, which has decreased by 10% in payments compared to the 2008 budget.
With heading 3b, MEPs consider that the funding of "vital policies with a direct impact on the every day life of citizens" is not sufficient and that the possibility to finance pilot projects and preparatory actions (which is important for the European Parliament) is very limited.
With heading 4, MEPs call for clarification as to its total needs, including the Common Foreign and Security Policy, and considers that the Commission's budgetary approach is "vague" and "rather arbitrary". The report is concerned by the under-financing of this heading, particularly with regards to Kosovo, Palestine, the Middle East, food aid and macro-financial assistance. The report also "repeats its conviction that neither Flexibility Instrument nor Emergency Aid Reserve must be diverted or misused to finance long-planned policies and activities of the EU".
The first reading resolution of the 2009 PDB will be voted on in October 2008. Text, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 8 July)

European Parliament adopts written declaration urging 2011 to be the European Year on Volunteering
2008-07-14 - 15:45
Parliament adopted a written declaration announcing 2011 as the European Year on Volunteering. The House pointed out that there are more than 100 million Europeans of all ages, beliefs and nationalities who volunteer. In order for a written declaration to be adopted, over half of all the 785 MEPs have to have signed it. In this case some 416 MEPs have signed it. The written declaration was initially put forward by Marian HARKIN (ALDE, IE), Gisela KALLENBACH (Greens/EFA, DE), Emmanouil ANGELAKAS (EPP-ED, GR), Mieczysław Edmund JANOWSKI (UEN, PL) and Joel HASSE FERREIRA (PES, PT).
In 2006 a Eurobarometer survey revealed that 3 out of 10 Europeans claim to be active in a voluntary capacity and that close to 80% of respondents feel that voluntary activities are an important part of democratic life in Europe.
The voluntary sector, says the declaration, contributes an estimated 5% to GDP of our national economies, and develops innovative actions to detect, voice and respond to needs arising in society,
Parliament adds that the European Volunteer Centre, the European Youth Forum, the Association of Voluntary Service Organisations, the World Scouts Movement, the Red Cross/European Union Office, Volonteurope, AGE, Solidar, Caritas Europa, ENGAGE, Johanniter International, the European Non-Governmental Sports Organisation and others – all representing thousands of organisations involving millions of volunteers – have all called upon the European Institutions to announce 2011 as the European Year of Volunteering.

European Council
Sarkozy to the European Parliament: "Europe can not be condemned to inaction"
2008-07-14 - 15:45
President Sarkozy told MEPs that enlargement would only be possible with the Lisbon Treaty and new institutional arrangements. He told the House "we all have a heavy responsibility", namely "to get Europe out of its crisis". To do this, "we must reassure Europeans" and show that Europe is working for all. Many political groups supported the Presidency's priorities but some criticised the lack of social aspects and President Sarkozy's attendance at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. In his opening remarks to MEPs in Strasbourg, French President Nicolas SARKOZY told the House "we all have a heavy responsibility", namely "to get Europe out of its crisis". To do this, "we must reassure Europeans" and show that Europe is working for everyone.
Lisbon or Nice? No enlargement without new treaty, says Sarkozy
First, "we have an institutional problem", he said. He himself had announced before the French presidential elections that he favoured "parliamentary ratification of the treaty" not referendums, and he had been elected on that understanding. Now an early solution must be found to the Irish "no" vote, to decide whether next year's European elections were to be held on the basis of the Lisbon Treaty or the Nice Treaty. That was the only choice.
He also strongly emphasised that without Lisbon there could be no further enlargement: enlargement required new institutions. And while he himself favoured the accession of the Balkan countries - since they were "unquestionably European" - people could not say "no" to Lisbon and also demand enlargement to include these countries.
The president also rejected the view that "it doesn't matter if we have a multi-speed Europe", saying this would be "a last resort". In his view "everyone must be on board in the European family".
Protection, energy and climate change
Turning to the French presidency's other priorities, Mr Sarkozy first argued that Europeans had a right to expect "protection" from Europe but that this need not mean "protectionism".
He then spoke of the energy and climate package, saying "we are the last generation that can prevent disaster". This could only be done if nations agreed to join forces, and "Europe must set the example". He believed a solution could be found for the (mainly new) Member States who relied largely on fossil fuels.
Immigration, development, defence
France had now taken the difficult decision to open its labour market to all European workers but in those circumstances, asked Mr Sarkozy, "is it reasonable for each country to have its own immigration rules without taking into account the impact on others"? He believed immigration and asylum must be debated at European level, citing the problem of asylum seekers who can lodge 27 separate applications EU-wide.
Development was another priority of his country's presidency, as was security and defence. He rejected the idea that one must choose between NATO and an EU defence.
Agriculture, health
On agriculture, Mr Sarkozy believed that common sense must prevail: in 2050 there would be 9 billion people in the world. "This is not the time to scale down Europe's food production", he argued. He also mentioned social issues, notably health, saying that diseases such as Alzheimer's and cancer would be best tackled through greater European cooperation.
Special rules for culture….and sport?
Turning to culture and sport, Mr Sarkozy said he believed not only in an "exception" to free market rules for culture, he also hoped to see one introduced for sport. For example, he could not accept that football clubs which trained up young players should see their efforts destroyed.
Responsibility on the treaty, debate on monetary policy
The French president then complained that some political leaders were "unwilling to defend in public the choices they made in Brussels". He had told the president of Poland that since he had negotiated the Lisbon Treaty, he had not just a political but a moral duty to sign it.
Turning to monetary policy, he maintained that it was fair to ask "what is the right monetary strategy?" and "what is the right exchange rate policy?". He was not challenging the independence of the Central Bank but he wanted a more open debate on certain issues.
Lastly, he stressed that Europe was a place for teamwork and he hoped that in six months' time people would say "Europe has progressed thanks to your participation and support".
European Commission
José Manuel BARROSO , President of the European Commission, noted that President Sarkozy had said he wanted "France to come back to Europe." "That is good news for us," he said, promising the Commission would stand with France throughout its presidency to achieve a common success for the EU.
New challenges - like the scarcity of fossil fuels and climate change - required common solutions, said Mr Barroso. "We also need to reform our economies, step up competitiveness and invest in research and education," he said. "We are first trading power in world, but need courage to change if we want to protect ourselves."
This was a challenging time: with the Irish 'no' vote, a difficult world economic situation, prices of oil and food going up in an inflationary push going which was a big enemy of social justice: "Those on low wages suffer most."
Having just returned from the G8 summit in Japan, Mr Barroso noted the contrast between the gloom often expressed within EU and the external view of Europe: "Outside, the EU is seen as positive, an important and decisive player with importance on the world stage."
The Commission President highlighted climate change and development as areas where Europe has taken initiatives. "The US has pretty much signed up to our goals on climate change," he said, something that was not easy to achieve. "I am proud of the leadership role of the EU. It is a success achieved through European unity."
Rising food prices, he said, were undermining the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, so he was pleased the European Council has supported the Commission's plans for an agricultural support fund for developing countries. The formal proposals would be adopted by the Commission next week.
It was clear that the poorest countries needed European aid: "This is why we can create an example of solidarity between European and African farmers, the Common Agricultural Policy and development policy working in tandem."
Rather than indulging in what he called "crisisophilia," Mr Barroso said the EU should be the solution to major problems.
On the Lisbon Treaty, he said it could make Europe more effective, efficient and democratic, but not having the treaty in force was not an excuse to not answer the problems of ordinary citizens. "We need to talk to them frankly and tell people how it is - and to provide evidence that Europe works, focussing on policies that bring people closer to Europe and change people's daily lives."
Mr Barroso said the integrated energy policy fighting against climate change was the right top priority for the presidency. It would put the EU in a good position to start the Copenhagen negotiations in a year's time. The French Presidency would have the Commission's full support on this.
Europe, continued the Commission President, needed a managed immigration policy. "We should look at what immigration we need, what an aging Europe needs and where there are skills shortages, but we also need to make sure that dignified integration can take place." The adoption of Blue Card would be a good step forward. It was also important to deal with illegal immigration and the exploitation that arises from it. "We should penalise employers who employ illegal workers, not threatening those who are already poor enough, but penalising those who exploit their labour."
Europe, he said, could not solve the immigration issue by being permissive on all fronts. "We need to be firm on illegal immigration, but also show solidarity with migrant communities who are integrating and wanting to work hard." "When you have a Europe of Schengen, having 27 immigration policies is absurd, we need one single policy."
Turning to social measures, he said we could not have dynamic economic models without social policies providing a safety net. He congratulated France on its new social agenda, saying that no-one should be left at the side of the road.
Mr Barroso also welcomed plans for European defence - and the Union for the Mediterranean to be launched on Sunday (13 July). These were two opportunities to have Europe play its part in the world.
"The first duty of politicians is to face up to challenges and redouble efforts to meet them successfully. We can do a great deal together, with the institutions of Europe working hand in hand - this is the key to joint success we owe to citizens of Europe. We can Identify together concrete solutions to concrete problems," concluded the Commission President.
Political group speakers
Joseph DAUL (FR), leader the EPP-ED group, said France had decided that political commitment would mark its presidency. "This is what we need to face developments before Europe. The worst of these is from the 'no' in Ireland. We need to ensure citizens support building Europe," This means addressing their fears on prices and misgivings on social and family issues. "If we can't persuade people that major issues like climate, energy and immigration can only be solved at European level, then we have a major problem."
"We would like to see all remaining Member States ratify the Treaty. We hope after a period of reflection Ireland will put forward suggestions out of impasse. I hope we will be able to end this institutional debate." But, he said, the world was not waiting while we try to equip ourselves with better decision making tools: "We need political commitment to deal with priorities of climate change, energy, migration, food security and defence."
On climate change, we should, he said, provide an example before Copenhagen. On migration, it was time to debate the subject and decide on positive, humane and responsible results. The Pact proposed by France was, he said, a step in the right direction. On food security, it was important to help the most vulnerable in world and poorest in the Member States, and how, he asked "can Europe be credible without defence policy worthy of the name?"
"If we have the courage to make clear political choices our citizens will discover again that they do like Europe," concluded the EPP-ED group leader.
Martin SCHULZ (PES, DE) singled out two priorities for the next six months: the climate change package and the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon. He stressed the need for increased transparency, democracy and a greater role for national Parliaments. He deplored the stalling of the Lisbon Treaty "at the moment when we need a new instrument".On Social Europe, he described as a "mistake" the idea that social questions could be dealt with on a national basis. According to Mr Schulz "European economic progress generates more growth and employment but must also generate more social protection".
The leader of the PES recalled the fear of European citizens over social hardship and the need to give confidence to the uninformed citizen for whom "progress is only good for business and banks", by showing them that the EU can be good for the individual too. "France gave us the first Charter of Fundamental Rights and the tradition of the protection of human rights - he underlined asking the President of the Council to curb the actions of the government of Silvio Berlusconi in relation to the Roma "You are brave and bold, help us and your Presidency will be a great success", he concluded.
Graham WATSON (ALDE, UK) said: "The decision by Irish voters to reject the Lisbon Treaty has made your impressively-prepared presidency more problematic. It has also made the case for a practical, problem-solving Europe stronger than ever." The energy and climate change packages become more urgent every day. Capping VAT on fuel is a short-term sop." Europe should be tackling the long-term rise in fuel prices, and tackling global warming. We need substantial investment in renewable energy, as Commissioner Piebalgs has urged. Small-scale and localised to keep individual household bills down in the long-term; and large scale, such as using our new Union for the Mediterranean to invest in high voltage solar thermal power production in North Africa.
To stabilise food prices we need good ideas, such as the recent CAP reforms of Commissioner Fischer Boel. The truth is that people care more about the petrol price and the bread bill than about the grand aims of our Union. Today no-one should say, "Qu'ils mangent de la brioche."
The presidency is also right to focus on migration. Migration will become manageable only when we address the despair that leads so many to risk so much to come here.
It may be optimistic to ask a French presidency to liberalise markets. But to bring security within our borders we must bring hope beyond them. There is another way in which this presidency can break new ground. Human rights are core to the European ideal. France gave Europe the Rights of Man. Now France must lead us in their defence. By using the Union for the Mediterranean to press North African countries on their human rights record. And by ensuring that China meets its commitments.
To bring citizens closer to the institutions, Europe needs to "refresh its soul" with common roots, values, and ambitions said Cristiana MUSCARDINI (UEN, IT) adding that the forest of flags outside the Parliament building were symbolic of what citizens share.
"Europe needs aims that inspire young people", she continued, suggesting the Presidency press for a "charter of rights and duties", inter alia to protect the environment.
"Where rules are weakened, democracy and freedom are weakened", she stressed, citing the need for a new relationship with Africa, based on more than just trade, to combat evils such as terrorism in Mogadishu and human rights abuses in Zimbabwe.
the Euro-Mediterranean project.
Ms Muscardini also stressed that the small and medium-sized enterprises are a "cultural asset", and that the Council must ensure that trade rules are obeyed.
Daniel COHN-BENDIT (Greens/EFA, DE) praised Mr Sarkozy's commitment to, and ambition for, the EU - "It's a drug we're all hooked on", he said, paraphrasing a popular song.
However, "if we are ambitious enough to accept the climate package, then we should not kneel to the German car industry", he continued, adding that "consumers are paying for our laxism" in high fuel prices.
On immigration, Mr Cohn-Bendit stressed that Parliament must be a genuine partner in shaping a policy on legal immigration, rather than just complaining about the illegal sort. Immigration made Europe what it is, and "rather than have people trying to get in through the windows, we should throw open the doors", he said.
Social policy does fall within Europe's remit, and Parliament and the Council must work together to combat social and fiscal dumping, he said.
Finally, Mr Cohn-Bendit strongly advised Mr Sarkozy not to attend the opening of the Olympic Games in China, given its record of human rights abuses at home and in Tibet. Missing this golden opportunity to "say no" would be a "total disgrace", which Mr Sarkozy would regret when the time came to write his memoirs, he predicted.
Francis WURTZ (GUE/NGL, FR) admired Mr Sarkozy's lucidity in describing Europe's crisis of legitimacy, and readiness to listen to disquiet - the referendum "noes" reflected the views of millions of other Europeans, he said.
Mr Wurtz, ,nonetheless, felt that Mr Sarkozy had "ignored the social dimension", and pointed out that ,like it or not, national social policies would be affected by European Court of Justice rulings.
"We should welcome workers from everywhere with equal rights", said Mr Wurtz, asking why, in Lower Saxony, immigrant building workers earn only half as much as their German workmates.
For many, France's about-face on the Working Time Directive means a 65-hour week: "Dickens is still with us" said Mr Wurtz, adding that Mr Sarkozy's promise to important guests that "in future, when there's a strike, no-one will notice", had been an "insult to trade unions".
Philippe DE VILLIERS (IND/DEM, FR) said: "The peoples of Europe have had to accept in their daily lives the devastating policies of Brussels and Frankfurt and see all their power trickling through their fingers, whether on GMOs, on fishing or even on football"
"The powers of the state are being stripped away from democracy to go instead to officials, bankers and judges"
He told President Sarkozy that the French Presidency was an opportunity to get Europe moving in the right direction again and he asked for the vote of the people of Ireland to be honoured and the Lisbon Treaty to be proclaimed dead.
Jean-Marie LE PEN (NI, FR), also declared that the Lisbon Treaty is dead "in spite of all the manoeuvring going on"
He spoke of 'demoralising waves of foreign immigrants' invading across open borders and of further opening of borders and freeing of competition allowing the rest of the world to take advantage. "Meanwhile, Europeans have not gained the economic growth and the jobs they were promised"
On the release of Ingrid Betancourt, Mr Le Pen accused President Sarkozy of negotiating with the Farc terrorists in Colombia and asserted that France was helping Farc terrorists by offering them asylum
Finally, he said: "Europe is going down the wrong path. It is economically-ruined by social liberalism; it has no proper defence forces and is just an American protectorate; and it is being held hostage by federalism…The 'no' votes to the Constitution and treaties should be a warning."
British and Irish speakers
Philip BUSHILL-MATTHEWS (EPP-ED) speaking for the UK Conservative MEPs, quoted from President Sarkozy's own book "Témoignage", which had said that rather than a uniform and rigid policy of a 35 hour week and compulsory retirement at 60, citizens should have free choice to work more if they choose. "That is the true social Europe," agreed Mr Bushill-Matthews.
"If freedom of choice are your guiding principles, the Conservative Party will stand by your side in this presidency," he said. And this should be the case for the Working Time Directive and for the Temporary Agency Workers Directive.
Finally, Mr Bushill-Matthews urged the President to respect the choice of the people of Ireland, 'not as a problem to be addressed, but as an opportunity for Europe to reconnect with the people".
Brian CROWLEY (UEN, IE) said the new presidency needs to "meet the challenges head on" but stressed that "the complexity of the world today is far more varied than what one single ideology or plan can give us". Concerning President Sarkozy's plans for the Lisbon Treaty, Mr Crowley said the Irish No vote is "not just a problem with Ireland's relationship with Europe, but is reflective of a deeper problem between Europe and its citizens".
Nigel FARAGE (IND/DEM, UK) said the priorities of the French presidency "says that you want an EU that controls every single aspect of our lives and that you want us to be isolated from the world", and demonstrates an "arrogance of saying that you would know best when it comes to the EU". Addressing the Irish No vote, Mr Farage said it shows that "the people of Europe do not want a more integrated EU" and "to try to ratify the treaty through the backdoor... would be showing an utter contempt for democracy".
Marian HARKIN (ALDE, IE) said that she appreciates President Sarkozy's comments on "protection without protectionism" and his commitment for Europe, and, as someone who canvassed for a Yes vote in Ireland, she said "the Irish No is just as legitimate as the French or Dutch No" and as such, "must be given the same respect, it will take time to resolve the and no deadlines can be given."
Gay MITCHELL (ALDE, IE) said the Lisbon Treaty received a No vote for a variety or reasons, including a lack of understanding and the "theories led by the extremists on the right and the left", He urged President Sarkozy to "come prepared and come prepared to listen" when he visits Ireland, and also said that President Sarkozy's visit to Ireland will be welcomed but the Lisbon issue in Ireland "is complex and will take some time".
Commission President's response
In his response to the debate, Commission President BARROSO congratulated President Sarkozy on his resolve and enthusiasm, which he said he was sure would be shown throughout the French Presidency. It was at difficult times that political capabilities and strong political will were most important.
Europe, he said, was different from national political systems where there was not question about the legitimacy of political leaders. Here there were all sorts of populists opposing the mission of peace and solidarity which the EU embodies. It was essential for the institutions to work together ahead of the European elections to avoid handing arguments to the extremists of the political system.
"Good luck to France and good luck to my friend Nicolas Sarkozy!" concluded Mr Barroso.
President Sarkozy's responses: Olympic Games ceremony, immigration policy
Among his responses to the debate, Mr Sarkozy commented on his own decision to attend the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. He said he would raise human rights issues while in China but "we can't boycott a country with a quarter of the world's population". The world needed China's help with problems such as Darfur and Iran. (By contrast, Parliament's president Hans-Gert Pöttering announced yesterday that he would not be attending the opening ceremony because negotiations between the Chinese authorities and the Dalai Lama's envoys had not produced results.)
To Philip Bushill-Matthews , he said "Europe needs the United Kingdom" and if Britain has "one foot in and one foot out, Europe is weakened". To Nigel Farage, he said "You don't want a common ID card or a common immigration policy" and yet "you were happy for France to close Sangatte". But, he argued, "France can't solve all Britain's immigration problems", and in his view there was a clear case for a common immigration and asylum policy.

European Parliament backs liberalisation of EU gas market
2008-07-14 - 15:45
The European Parliament supported the liberalisation of the gas market by adopting reports that - though reaching out to countries opposed to "full ownership unbundling" (the separation of gas suppliers from gas transmission networks) - place strict conditions on companies that do not unbundle. The Commission's original proposal would have given Member States a choice between two models: ownership unbundling; or the preservation of integrated supply and transmission companies, provided that the operation of the transmission network was handed over to an independent system operator (ISO). A 6 June Council meeting subsequently endorsed another alternative to unbundling, known as the "independent transmission operator" (ITO) model (which would allow companies to retain the ownership of pipelines but compel them to abide by rules and a structure to ensure they operate independently in practice).
MEPs, in their vote on the two reports by Romano La Russa (UEN, IT) and Atanas Paparizov (PES, BG) rejected the ISO option, but endorsed the ITO model (as the sole alternative to ownership unbundling). They made sure, however, to equip it with several safeguards:
an "independent trustee”meant to protect “the asset value of the transmission system operator”
a “supervisory body” – composed of gas company representatives, third party shareholders, transmission system operator representatives, as well as the Trustee – responsible for decisions “which may have a significant impact on the value of the assets of the shareholders”; (the Trustee, under some circumstances, can veto the body's decisions)
a “compliance programme” setting out measures that prevent “discriminatory conduct”;
a “compliance officer” responsible for monitoring the implementation of the compliance programme.
(The Council agreement does not include the "independent trustee")
Revision clause
No later than five years after the directive's entry into force - the text says - a new energy regulators' Agency will report on whether these requirements have managed to ensure the independence of transmission system operators. If this turns out not to be the case, " the Commission shall submit proposals [...] to ensure full and effective independence of transmission system operators". MEPs also ask the Commission to submit a report "outlining the feasibility of creating a single European transport operator ".
The vote also confirmed the EP's position in favour of the Commission's proposal to prevent control of transmission systems by third countries unless there is an EU-third country international agreement.
Consumer protection measures
Other changes bolstered the draft legislation with a number of consumer protection measures. Customers, MEPs decided, should have:
the right to withdraw from contracts with their gas providers without charge;
the right to compensation if service quality levels are not met (as with, for example, inaccurate and delayed billing);
access to information on their rights through bills and gas company web sites;
access to information on procedures to be followed in case of disputes;
the right to be informed, at least quarterly, of actual gas consumption and costs;
access to smart meters within 10 years of the directive's entry into force.
independent complaints services and alternative redress schemes such as an independent energy ombudsman or a consumer body
As in the vote on the electricity market, the EP sought to address the needs of vulnerable energy consumers. It decided, therefore, that EU countries should take "appropriate measures [...] to ensure that the number of people in energy poverty" – those unable to afford heating the home to an acceptable standard, as defined by the WHO – "decreases in real terms." MEPs insisted that countries work towards cutting the cost of energy to low income households. In the same vein, they backed an amendment mandating national authorities "to introduce pricing formulas which increase for greater levels of consumption" - and to prohibit the disconnection of "pensioners and disabled people in winter".
This was far from the only amendment to heighten the role for national regulatory authorities. In parallel with the introduction of the new alternative to unbundling, MEPs had already decided on 19 May to mandate national authorities:
to ensure energy efficiency and integrate renewables (e.g. biogas) in both transmission and distribution grids;
to “facilitate the access to the grid [...] for new market entrants and renewable energies”;
to approve the annual investment plans of the transmission system operators;
to fix or approve network access tariffs;
to impose sanctions - including penalties of up to 10% of yearly turnover - against gas companies non-compliance with their obligations or for discriminatory behaviour.
The Commission, MEPs decided, should also put forward an accessible, user-friendly charter listing the rights of energy consumers.
Regional Cooperation
The Parliament's vote also confirmed support for provisions that would see Member States having to ensure that transmission system operators have "one or more integrated systems at regional level covering several Member States for capacity allocation and for checking the security of the network."

European Strategic Energy Technology Plan needed to achieve 2020 energy climate objectives, say MEPs
2008-07-14 - 15:45
MEPs say energy efficiency needs to be included in the European Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan in an own initiative report adopted by 596 votes in favour to 85 against and 14 abstentions. The report also makes recommendations to the Commission's SET Plan on the inclusion of intensified research into biofuels, and supports the plan to include research in nuclear power and carbon capture and storage (CCS). The aim of the SET Plan is to improve the European innovation system on energy technologies, first by creating the framework conditions and incentives for the development of new energy technologies, and then by fostering the acceleration of the lab-to-market process.
In the report MEPs consider the SET Plan as "fundamental to achieving the EU's energy climate objectives for 2020", which include reductions in CO2 emissions, increasing the use of renewable energy and improvements in energy efficiency, if it has adequate financial support.
Nuclear energy, biofuels and energy efficiency
The report supports a list of industrial initiatives the Commission has drawn up, including one on research in nuclear power, and states that research and design resources should support both third and fourth generation nuclear technologies.
The report also supports the European Industrial Initiatives (EIIs) outlined by the Commission, but calls for biofuels research to be intensified under the programme so the overall environmental impact of the production of those fuels can be determined, and for energy efficiency to feature more prominently as "it is the area with the most potential for cost effective emission reductions in the medium term".
Support for research into carbon capture and storage
The report calls on the Commission to facilitate the realisation of up to 12 proposed CCS demonstration projects and believes that the development of CCS technology could play a role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, "provided its efficiency and safety is assured". The report also notes that support for clean coal technologies, such as coal to gas conversion, "will make it easier and cheaper to deploy CCS with the possibility of making it mandatory in the future".
Research and technology transfer
The report emphasises "the need to boost research in basic sciences such as biology, information technology, materials science and macro-technologies", "the need to improve the transfer of technologies from research centres and enterprises" and urges the private sector to invest more in research and assume greater risks.
Financing the SET Plan
MEPs stress that the SET Plan should not be financed through the reallocation of funds made available for energy under the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) and the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP), and encourage the Commission to urgently ensure adequate financing and support for new low carbon and zero carbon technology research and development, demonstration and commercialisation.

EU actions in Afghanistan are a "test case for international development assistance", say MEPs
2008-07-14 - 15:45
International reconstruction work in Afghanistan must be more closely harmonised among all institutions involved, says the EP in a report adopted with 423 votes in favour, 74 against and 43 abstentions. It calls for a larger political role for the EU in Afghanistan and stresses the need to maintain the distinction between military and civilian actions by all actors. The report calls on the US government to abandon its crop eradication policy and notably the use of ‘Roundup’ for aerial sprayings. The own-initiative report (André Brie (EUL/NGL, DE) rapporteur withdrew his name from the report before the vote), notes that "in Afghanistan, the EU is primarily known as a humanitarian organisation," but considers that "there is also a need for the EU to be seen as having a stronger political influence." To achieve this, the House argues that "a major strengthening of political will and commitment is necessary," and that "this should be followed up not only by a willingness to provide additional combat troops in the most difficult areas, unrestricted by national caveats, but also by urgent and reinforced civil reconstruction efforts." Winning the war while building the peace The Parliament "supports the efforts of NATO forces to improve security in the country and tackle local and international terrorism, and considers the presence of these forces to be essential in order to ensure the country's future." Nevertheless, MEPs also say that "Afghanistan's security problems are more complex than just a war on terror and therefore they require more than a military solution." The report is especially concerned about the effects of military actions on humanitarian aid and development. It notes that "although security and development are interdependent in Afghanistan, there is a clear demarcation between military and humanitarian action that should be maintained." In particular, MEPs consider "that 'Operation Enduring Freedom' could be perceived as counterproductive if the military pressure on the insurgents is not matched by a strengthened political process through which the Afghan authorities reach out to all segments of the population that recognise the Constitution and lay down their weapons." Poppy production - US should abandon its policy The report calls on the US government to abandon its crop eradication policy and notably the use of ‘Roundup’ for aerial sprayings, a substance which is associated with serious environmental and health hazards, inasmuch as targeting poppy farmers will only fuel resentment against the international troop presence. Media freedom, civil society, judiciary reform The report notes that several areas are absolutely crucial for rebuilding Afghanistan. It underlines that "in order to overcome the prevailing 'culture of violence' within Afghan society, the international donor community should lend financial and technical support to local projects aimed at reconciliation." The House also "emphasises that media freedom is essential in creating a democratic society," and "is very concerned about the rising number of attacks on journalists and calls on the Afghan authorities to seriously investigate these violations." The report also draws attention to the fact that the mandate of the EU Police Mission (EUPOL) provides opportunities for it to support and train the Afghan Ministry of the Interior, a key priority for establishing the rule of law in Afghanistan. In this context, it strongly criticizes EU Member States for failing to contribute enough personnel to allow EUPOL to be deployed at full strength, and asks the Council to urgently examine this situation. Pakistan relationship The report considers that the Afghanistan-Pakistan relationship has been the source of much of the region’s instability, and therefore concludes that stabilising the region requires a comprehensive policy geared to that relationship. MEPs hope that, with the new government in Pakistan, the improvement of the bilateral relationship will receive a fresh impetus. The House believes, however, that without the active engagement and assistance of the international community the two countries will not be able to extricate themselves from their difficult bilateral relationship. MEPs recognise that security in Afghanistan hinges to a very large extent on the democratisation of Pakistan. Parliament urges the international community to initiate and support measures that lessen tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan, including a long-term programme to stabilise and develop the cross-border region, involving stakeholders on both sides.

Parliament welcomes positive developments in EU-China relations
2008-07-14 - 15:45
A European Parliament resolution adopted on 10 July "expresses satisfaction at the developments in EU-China relations, the sectoral dialogues and the closer cooperation on various globalised issues." It commends China's reaction to the recent earthquake in Sichuan, but "deplores the fact that China's human rights record remains a matter for concern owing to widespread and systematic human rights abuses." The resolution, adopted by 439 in favour to 51 against and 139 abstentions, calls on the Chinese authorities to bear in mind that earthquake warnings constitute one benchmark of the development of a country," stressing that future scientific warnings should be heeded if they forecast another natural disaster in China. Parliament stresses the importance of the EU and the international community for reconstruction efforts after the quake, and "notes with satisfaction that China rapidly agreed to accept the assistance of the international community in helping the victims of the earthquake."
Tibet and human rights
The House "welcomes the resumption of contacts, after the events of March 2008 in Lhasa, between the representatives of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities," and calls for an intensification of these contacts. Nevertheless, MEPs also deplore the fact that "participants in the protest in Lhasa [are] still being traced, detained and arbitrarily arrested," and calls on China to "halt its ‘patriotic re-education’ campaign."
Parliament urges the Chinese authorities to display clemency to all political prisoners and human rights activists who are currently in jail, and to stop practices of discrimination and harassment. It "condemns China's frequent use of the death penalty and calls on the Chinese authorities to establish a moratorium on executions."
Beijing Olympics
The resolution "calls on China to abide by the public commitments which it made with regard to human rights and minority rights, democracy and the rule of law and which the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced when it decided to allow China to host the Olympic Games."
The President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering, announced yesterday that he will not be attending the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in Beijing, due to the lack of progress in talks between Chinese authorities and representatives of the Dalai Lama. At the same time, during Wednesday afternoon's debate, the French State Secretary for European Affairs Jean-Pierre Jouyet announced that after consultations with his colleagues in the European Council, French President Nicolas Sarkozy will be attending the event, representing both France and the EU as the holder of the current EU presidency.

Zimbabwe: MEPs call for a transitional administration
2008-07-14 - 15:45
A transitional administration should help end the climate of terror sweeping Zimbabwe since the presidential elections campaign started. This administration should also organise fresh presidential elections, says a resolution adopted by the House. The resolution asks to tighten up sanctions against members of the Mugabe regime. The House stresses that the elections of 27 June cannot be regarded as legitimate, and welcomes the EU Presidency's statement of 28 June clearly stating this position. The transitional administration should demobilise militias, repeal repressive legislation, resolve the humanitarian crisis and stabilise the economy. Youth militias and war veterans should be disarmed, demobilised and prosecuted, say MEPs.
The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) should be rebuild and create conditions for free and fair presidential elections in the near future under the auspice of the AU and the UN. A Truth and Reconciliation Commission should also be set up, according to MEPs.
Aid for Zimbabwe
The European Parliament welcomes Commissioner Michel's commitment to significantly increase support for Zimbabwe and its people by pledging 250 million euros in development aid, once democracy returns and a legitimate and credible government is elected.
Lift restrictions on humanitarian aid
MEPs call on Robert Mugabe's government to lift all restrictions on the delivery of aid, in the wake of the orders given to humanitarian aid organisations to suspend their operations.
The EU is urged to channel its aid through local and international NGOs without passing via the Harare authorities. Around two million people in Zimbabwe are under threat of famine, poverty and disease.
Beef up sanctions against Mugabe regime
The House calls on the Member States not to grant any visa to Mugabe, his cabinet and the ZANU PF leadership for any national or international purpose on EU territory.
The Council is called upon to tighten up the sanctions against members of the Mugabe regime and others responsible for grave violations of human rights, if mediation is not accepted and the state-sponsored violence is not ended, and to press for sanctions to be adopted at UN level, including an arms embargo and a comprehensive freeze of assets of the entire government and ruling party leadership.
The resolution also calls on EU Member States to reject international recognition should Robert Mugabe be sworn in as President for another term. China and Libya are urged to cease their support for the Harare regime.
Impact of this crisis on neighbouring countries
The impact of this crisis on neighbouring countries, including South Africa, should not be disregarded in the region.
Among the 10% - 40% predicted increase in numbers of Zimbabweans crossing borders in the next few weeks, MEPs note that, among these migrants, children will be in a particularly vulnerable situation, at risk of abuse and forced to take up dangerous jobs such as mining, handling farm machinery or sex work in order to survive.
The second round of the presidential elections took take place Friday 27 June with Mugabe as the only candidate. Election observers from both the Southern African Development Community and the Pan African Parliament condemned the election.
The resolution was adopted with 591 votes in favour, 8 against and 21 abstentions.

Food safety
Modernising the rules on food additives and labelling of azo dyes
2008-07-14 - 15:45
MEPs updated and simplified EU rules for authorising food additives, flavourings and enzymes with the European Parliament adopting a legislative package on four draft regulations. The new procedures will assist the free movement of food within the EU and will also give better health and consumer protection, including clearer labelling of certain food colourings. Food additives are currently regulated by a dozen or so EU laws, which the four new regulations will simplify, update and bring into line with the latest scientific findings. The first regulation lays down an EU-level "common authorisation procedure" for additives, enzymes and flavourings. The other three deal in detail with each of these categories, for which lists of authorised products will be compiled, with conditions of use and rules on labelling. For flavourings, maximum levels for undesirable substances will be set. The European Commission will manage the lists of approved products subject to risk assessments carried out by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Single EU-wide approval will guarantee high standard of consumer protection The new "common authorisation procedure", dealt with by the EP in a report by Åsa WESTLUND (PES, SE) will contribute to the free movement of food within the Community and to the protection of human health and consumer interests. Community authorisation will be granted in a transparent, centralised manner on the basis of a scientific opinion by EFSA, provided the authorisation criteria set out in the sectoral food laws are met. Authorisation will take the form of a regulation adopted under comitology rules. EFSA will have nine months to give its opinion, not six as the Council wanted. The Commission will have a further nine months to submit a draft regulation to include the new substance in the relevant Community list. Food additives must be safe and bring benefits to consumers A second report by Åsa WESTLUND (PES, SE) deals with additives such as sweeteners, colourings, preservatives, antioxidants, emulsifiers, gelling agents and packaging gases. The legislation states that a food additive may be authorized only if it is safe in use, if there is a technological need for its use, if its use does not mislead the consumer and if it has advantages and benefits to consumers. Food additives will be completely banned in unprocessed food, as will sweeteners and colourings in food for babies and small children, except when specifically included in the Community list. Member States may continue to prohibit the use of certain categories of food additives in traditional foods produced on their territory. Better labelling of additives containing azo-dyes As new scientific data on health risks for children exposed to azo-dyes had emerged since Parliament's first reading, MEPs managed to include in the compromise a new provision that foods containing some of those food colours (colourings E 110, E 104, E 122, E 129, E 102 and E 124) must be labelled not only with the relevant E number but also with the words "may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children". Nanotechnology In its first reading, the EP had called for separate limit values for nanotechnologies. This was not taken up in the compromise but MEPs demanded successfully that, if the production process of an additive is changed, for example via a change in particle size through nanotechnology, a fresh authorization process, including a safety evaluation, must be carried out. Stricter conditions for "natural" flavourings The food industry uses many natural and artificial flavourings, about 2,600 of which are currently registered. Flavourings are used in or on foodstuffs to impart odour and/or taste. The EP report on flavourings was drafted by Mojca DRČAR MURKO (ALDE, SI). The new legislation introduces stricter conditions for the use of the term “natural” when describing flavourings. The compromise adds a recital stating that where possible, attention should be given to the effect of flavourings on vulnerable groups and that flavourings should not mislead the consumer. Limits on "undesirable substances" - but reprieve for pesto fans The new legislation sets out clearer rules on maximum levels for "undesirable substances" that might be present in flavourings due to their natural occurrence in plants traditionally used as food or food ingredients. The limits will not apply to certain substances if the only flavouring ingredients added are fresh, dried or frozen herbs and spices (an example is pesto sauce). This exception will cover not only food prepared in restaurants (as proposed by Council) but also, thanks to Parliament, industrially processed food. Enzymes Food enzymes have been used for hundreds of years, for example in baking, cheese-making and brewing, where they products perform useful functions such as improving texture, appearance and nutritional value. They play an increasingly important role in food production and can be used as alternatives to chemicals. Currently food enzymes used as processing aids are not covered by EU legislation. Member States’ legislation on food enzymes differs significantly. Under the new legislation, harmonised EU rules would be laid down for the evaluation, approval and control of enzymes used in food. As with additives, under the new rules enzymes will be authorised only if they do not mislead the consumer. The compromise specifies that misleading the consumer relates to the freshness, nature and quality of ingredients and the naturalness and nutritional quality of the product. Avril DOYLE (EPP-ED, IE) drafted the EP report on enzymes. Speaking in the debate on Monday 7 July, Avril Doyle said: ""It is the first time that we have an EU- legislation on enzymes. Until now only three Member States - UK, France and Denmark - have their own risk assessment for enzymes ... the new harmonised rules will increase food safety and give more choice to consumers." How will the system work? In parallel to the authorisation procedure for new additives, flavourings and enzymes, all such substances already on the market - around 300 additives and 2,600 flavourings - will gradually be re-assessed. Additives/flavourings/enzymes that are currently authorised may stay on the market but once the updating process is complete, any such substance not on the approved list will be banned.

Aviation to be included in the European Trading System from 2012 as MEPs adopt legislation
2008-07-14 - 15:45
MEPs adopted legislation on including aviation in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), all flights starting and/or landing in Europe (including intercontinental flights) to be included in the ETS from 1 January 2012. The reduction target to be calculated on the basis of airlines' average annual emissions between 2004-2006: in the first period (2012), airline emissions to be cut by 3 percent based on an historic average; emissions will be reduced by 5% in 2013 compared to the historic average. The main elements of the compromise are as follows: All flights starting and/or landing in Europe (including intercontinental flights) to be included in the ETS from 1 January 2012; The EU to have an obligation to seek an agreement on global measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation. Bilateral agreements, for example with the US, could be a first step; 85 percent of the emissions certificates to be allocated for free according to a common European benchmark. 15 percent to be auctioned; The reduction target to be calculated on the basis of airlines' average annual emissions between 2004-2006: in the first period (2012), airline emissions to be cut by 3 percent; in the second, from 2013 onwards, by 5 percent. The percentage to be further modified as part of the general review of the ETS; The revenues generated from the auctioning of emissions allowances should be used to fund: climate change mitigation; research on clean aircraft; anti-deforestation measures in the developing world; low-emission transport. The deal says that "It shall be for Member States to determine the use to be made of revenues generated from the auctioning of allowances. Those revenues should be used to tackle climate change in the EU and third countries, inter alia, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to adapt to the impacts of climate change in the EU and third countries, especially developing countries, to fund research and development for mitigation and adaptation, including in particular in the fields of aeronautics and air transport, to reduce emissions through low-emissions transport, and to cover the cost of administering the scheme. The proceeds of auctioning should also be used to fund contributions to the Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund, and measures to avoid deforestation." Commenting on the compromise deal he helped broker over the last few weeks, Peter LIESE (EPP-ED, DE), EP rapporteur on emissions, said: "Of course, a global agreement is our final goal, but the inclusion of third country flights starting and landing in Europe is a major step for the global fight against climate change. Other industries like steel would very much like to be in such a situation." The Parliament, said Mr Liese, has fought for very strict provisions concerning the revenues from auctioned allowances. "Money should be used to tackle climate change and not disappear somewhere in the general budget. It is not a tax but an environmental instrument. This is why we are very engaged in this field. The agreement is not perfect, but the Council went further than on any other comparable occasion." Highlighting the importance of funding public transport to reduce emissions, Mr Liese added: "people should be encouraged to use buses and trains - for example by reducing taxes and charges on [such] low emissions transports." Exemptions for some light airplanes with a take-off weight under 5.7 tonnes, flights for humanitarian purposes under a UN mandate, fire-fighting and other emergency flights, police, customs and military flights Research flights are excluded from the scheme, and Small airline companies producing low emissions are excluded. Government and Head of State flights included Flights performed exclusively for the transport, on official mission, of a reigning Monarch and his immediate family, Heads of State, Heads of Government and Government Ministers, of an EU Member State are included. Costs According to the European Commission's impact assessment: " Fully passing on costs to customers would mean that by 2020 airline tickets for a return journey could increase by €4.6 to €39.6, depending on the journey length. " The compromise was adopted with 640 votes in favour, 30 against and 20 abstentions.

Enlargement
Public support, good neighbourhood policy and greater institutional efficiency needed for continued success in EU enlargement
2008-07-14 - 15:45
The European Parliament reiterates its “firm commitment to all candidate countries and to those which have been given clear membership prospects,” but also notes that "the Union must make efforts to strengthen its integration capacity and that this capacity should be fully taken into account" in a report approved by a large majority (534-44-45). It also says that more substantive policies are needed to bridge the gap between the Union’s neighbourhood and enlargement policies. The own-initiative report by Elmar Brok (EPP-ED, DE) notes that “past enlargements have been a great success, benefiting the old as well as the new EU Member States.” At the same time, it recalls that "every enlargement must be followed by adequate consolidation and political concentration” within the Union itself, if the EU is to be able to continue functioning effectively.
The House therefore takes the view that “that the success of the enlargement process (and thus the success of the EU political integration process) can only be ensured if there is clear and long-lasting support for the EU membership of each candidate country.” The report urges a more effective communication policy on EU enlargement, and “reminds the governments and parliaments of the Member States that it is their responsibility adequately to inform public opinion about the positive achievements of former enlargements.”
Defining the Union’s “integration capacity”
The report insists that for future enlargements, “the Union must make efforts to strengthen its integration capacity.” The Parliament "recalls in this context the need to undertake the necessary internal reforms, aimed, among other things, at increasing efficiency, social cohesion and strengthening democratic accountability,” although it never mentions the Lisbon Treaty explicitly. Members are also “convinced that any acceding State should resolve its main internal problems, particularly concerning its territorial and constitutional set-up, before it can join the Union.”
MEPs note that the EU’s "integration capacity is linked with the Union’s ability at a given point in time to decide and thus to achieve its political objectives,” and define the term "integration capacity" as having four elements: accession states should contribute to and not impair the EU's political objectives, its institutions should be efficient and effective, its financial resources should be adequate, and a communication strategy should be set up to inform public opinion about the implications of enlargement.
Bridging the gap between neighbours and tenants
The report affirms that “participation in the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) does neither in principle nor in practice constitute a substitute for membership or a stage leading necessarily to membership.” Nevertheless, it argues that there is a conceptual and legal gap between the European neighbourhood policy and the Union’s enlargement policy, which needs to be bridged. MEPs therefore argue that the EU should “establish an area based on common policies” related to democracy, human rights and the rule of law.
MEPs support the recent Polish-Swedish proposal, the re-launch of the Barcelona Process, and further regional cooperation in the Black Sea region by calling for a "Black Sea Cooperation Agreement, which should include the EU, Turkey, and all Black Sea littoral states as equal partners, while seeking the full involvement of Russia, and which could, at a later stage, develop into a Union of the Black Sea."

Economic and monetary union
ECB praised for reaction to financial turmoil, caution advised on rate rises
2008-07-14 - 15:45
The European Central Bank (ECB) has done “excellent work” in managing the financial turmoil, enhancing its reputation said MEPs in their annual report on the ECB. Parliament also calls for the ECB to monitor exchange rates and take action if necessary and to be cautious about raising interest rates to avoid endangering growth. The report was adopted by 501 votes in favour to 83 against and 78 abstentions. In a report drawn up by Olle Schmidt (ALDE, SE) in reaction to the ECB’s annual report for 2007, MEPs highlight the “increased need for cooperation between central banks and supervisory authorities” and ask the ECB also to continue to improve its relationship with other central banks and relevant institutions. The report calls for the setting up of an EU framework for financial supervision closely involving the ECB.
Recognising the ECB had warned about the under-estimation of risk before the crisis, MEPs ask the Central Bank to examine how to improve “the correlation between such forward-looking warnings and market reactions” and to say what powers it needs to improve macro-prudential supervision in the euro area.
Economic and monetary developments
Parliament notes that the Treaty gives the ECB its goal of ensuring price stability, but also that of supporting EU economic policy, and that the two are not substitutable.
The report backs the ECB’s “two-pillar” approach to targeting price stability, which includes analysis of the M3 measure of money supply. It highlights the risks of asymmetric economic developments within the euro area and calls on the ECB to tackle these risks at an early stage. Respect by Member States of the Stability and Growth Pact, is among the strongest measures to protect against these risks.
Caution on interest rates
Given that expectations of economic growth have been revised downward, any further interest rate rises “should be undertaken with caution in order not to endanger economic growth” says Parliament, also emphasising the need for investment and structural reforms by Member States to support growth.
A close watch on exchange rates
MEPs note the recent rise in the value of the euro against the US dollar in particular, and ask the ECB to monitor developments and take action if necessary. They invite the Eurogroup, Commission and ECB to step up their coordination on exchange rate policy.
Communicating with Parliament and the public
The report asks the ECB to provide Parliament and public with an annual summary of the measures it takes to improve its performance in line with Parliament’s annual resolution. MEPs were disappointed with “the low level of commitment” of the ECB’s response to last year’s resolution.
MEPs say that the ECB’s ex-post accountability via the monetary policy dialogue with Parliament is “of primordial importance for confidence, and hence stability, on the financial markets” and Parliament’s responsibility would increase if the ECB becomes a full institution, as proposed in the Lisbon Treaty.
More transparency on decision making?
While recognising the difficulties in making the Governing Council’s minutes public, Parliament calls for the ECB to elaborate clearly whether consensus was easily reached within the Council or if divergent views persisted.
Governing Council structure and Executive Board appointments
Parliament calls on the ECB to present its ideas for reforming the structure of the Governing Council, which will be ever more necessary as more countries join the euro area.
As for appointments to the Executive Board, MEPs stress that nationality should not be a factor, and that democratic accountability would improve if “the Council evaluated several potential candidates and if the candidate proposed by the Council were then subject to a vote of approval by Parliament.”
Unified international representation
The report also calls for specific steps to be taken towards “a unified euro area representation within international financial institutions such as the IMF.”
EP debates economic outlook with European Central Bank
MEPs discussed inflation, interest rates, financial supervision and the prospects for growth and jobs during their annual debate with the President of the European Central Bank.
Rapporteur Olle Schmidt (ALDE, SE) opened the debate by saying "The ECB has the wind in its sails, pressure had been put on the Bank due to turmoil in the markets and inflationary pressures. We should be grateful that the ECB was there to tackle inflation." The ECB, he recalled, had been existence for ten years and the euro zone economies had enjoyed a strong economic performance. "My country [Sweden] is interested in joining", he said.
He underlined the importance of increased transparency and openness: "There is room for improvement and the ECB, after expansion, should come forward with new proposals." Mr Schmidt said the ECB should reveal whether Governing Council meetings had taken decisions unanimously or whether there was more difficulty in finding a consensus. He added that the role of the ECB President to represent the euro area in international contexts should be strengthened.
The rapporteur recalled that inflation was at a record high of 4 per cent in the euro zone. There had to be a clear debate about exchange rates and large disparities between euro zone economies were undesirable. Overall, he said, the ECB was a mature institution and could deal with these challenges but, with, he said, the French President calling into question price stability objectives, national leaders should be having an open debate with the public on monetary policy.
ECB President: "strong determination to anchor inflation expectations"
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said that growth in emerging countries should remain robust, supporting euro area foreign demand. On the domestic side, the economic fundamentals of the euro area were sound with no major imbalance and the lowest unemployment for 25 years, but "uncertainty surrounding this outlook for growth remains high". Risks were related to further increases in commodity prices, further spill over from the financial market turmoil and increasing protectionist tendencies. Inflation, he said, had reached the "worrying level" of 4 per cent, and was likely to remain well above target for some time, moderating only gradually in 2009. Inflationary risks had intensified, he said, and included further rises in commodity prices, increases in indirect taxes or second round effects on prices and wages. "First signs are already emerging in some regions of the euro area. In this context, indexation schemes for nominal wages are of particular concern and should be avoided," he said.
The ECB had raised its main interest rate to 4.25 percent. Its action, he said, "underlines our strong determination to maintain longer term inflation expectations in line with price stability." "The monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving price stability over the medium term. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead."
Mr Trichet welcome the recognition in the Schmidt report that publishing the minutes of Governing Council meetings was, as he put it, "not advisable when what counts is decision of college as a whole. It could lead to pressure on individuals to abandon their necessary whole-euro-area perspective. I see the Introductory Statement I present on behalf of the Governing Council at the monthly press conference as an equivalent to what other central banks call 'summary minutes'"
He said the economic differentials within the euro area were best tackled by "well designed structural reforms to enhance productivity and foster labour market flexibility."
Regarding financial market supervision, he said he saw no need to set up a new EU supervisory authority, but there was a need to strengthen information flows between central banks and market supervisors. "The envisaged reinforcement of EU legal basis for this is strongly supported by ECB."
Eurogroup Chair: fight against inflation is public's main concern
Jean-Claude Juncker , chair of the Eurogroup, stressed the "identity of views" between the EP report, the Eurogroup and the ECB, and said this was important given the "barrage of criticism directed at the ECB" over the world financial crisis. "The fight against inflation is the public's main concern" because of fears of "a loss of purchasing power", he argued. The ECB was complying with "its obligation to pursue price stability" although, he emphasised, governments also had a responsibility to support monetary policy through their economic policies, for example by preventing "an escalation of public sector wage levels".
The independence of the ECB was "a founding principle of EMU" and had been upheld in the Constitutional Treaty and the Lisbon Treaty. He advised against "sterile debates". Not that it was wrong to criticise or advise the Bank but one must be consistent and not ask the Bank "to pursue too many objectives" at once.
Lastly, Mr Juncker spoke of "ambiguities" in the Schmidt report. "Exchange rate policy is not the sole responsibility of the ECB", he maintained, but is "shared with national authorities". Moreover, the ECB is not the only institution responsible for the external representation of the euro: here too, there are "shared powers".
Political group speakers
For the EPP-ED group, Thomas Mann (DE) said the ECB had been right over 10 years always to pursue price stability and never to deviate from this objective. With high oil prices, this was now a major challenge.
Banks, he said, had found themselves in a difficult position after the sub-prime housing market collapse in the US. "The intervention by the ECB prevented a total crisis. Generally, ECB decision-making is transparent. We need to prevent national interests being pursued and prevent attacks on the ECB's independence." It was he said, time to heap praise on the ECB, it was in good hands with Jean-Claude Trichet.
Manuel António dos Santos (PES, PT) also supported the ECB's reaction to the financial market crisis: "If financial turmoil was not prevented, many of its effects were mitigated." A crisis, he said, does not have to be a disaster if you have the right leadership and up to date policies. It was not just about defending current rules, we needed to try to change the situation.
There was need for greater cooperation among central banks and supervisory authorities and to remove regulatory gaps. There should be cooperation between the Eurogroup and ECB cooperation, and, he added, more transparency in decision making especially to make comprehensible to the public. "All action on interest rates should be taken very cautiously, preventing hasty action which could jeopardise growth."
For the ALDE group, Wolf Klinz (DE) said the ECB acted in an able and confident manner at the start of the crisis: "You stand out as model of competence for other central banks, but the "most difficult phase yet to come." The risks of stagflation were real and we needed to ensure we get a grip on situation and avert risk, he said. The increase in rates had been the right reaction and fighting inflation was major concern.
Regarding transparency, he said "We want to know how decisions are taken, not names and votes, but to understand whether there was unanimity or more argument"
Claude Turmes (LU) spoke for the Greens/EFA group. He said price rises were "due to the entering of a new age; an age of scarcity. In the 21st century there will be hundreds of millions of new people entering the growing middle classes in places like China, India, Mexico and Brazil. [...] When the Chinese eat as much fish as the Japanese where will it come from? Or when the Indians are all driving cars where will the steel come from? When developing countries are consuming as much as developed countries currently do, where will the resources come from?" He said the real way to find a solution is to ask how we can make the European economy less dependent on imports of oil and gas and prices.
Johannes Blokland (NL), for the IND/DEM group, said the prospects were not favourable for next year: "The ECB would have to deal with a rising number of complaints, and the ECB would have to prove its metal in less favourable times". The euro zone would soon be composed of sixteen Member States all of whom have their own national economic policies. Mr Blokland questioned whether interest policy alone was a sufficient instrument to combat a recession.
Sergei Kozlík (NA, SK) said that the ECB had played a key role in ensuring a strong economic performance in the euro zone. However in these difficult times, he said, the citizen would likely to suffer the most. He said the ECB should play a greater role in supervision and national banks should work even more closely with the ECB. As in environment field, global co-operation was essential, he concluded.
The Chairwoman of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, Pervenche Berès (PES, FR) said that everyone had paid tribute to ECB action in summer 2007. But, she asked, with inflation now at 4 per cent, interest rates up by a quarter-point and when Europe was importing inflation "is your strategy of vigilance possible to maintain when there are risks to growth and jobs?" It was time, she said to assess what tools were needed now the "first age of globalisation" with its downward pressure on prices was over.
She added that the euro area needed to speak with one voice and that there should be a structured dialogue on exchange rates between the world's major currency areas.
Ryszard Czarnecki (UEN, PL) saw a worrying trend in attempts to exert pressure on the ECB from across Europe. "Larger and more economically powerful member states are attempting to push their own agendas," he said, adding that "we cannot say Europe has a stable and finished financial system. It is still a work in progress."
Responses from Trichet and Juncker
Responding to the debate, Jean-Claude Trichet said he "enormously appreciated" remarks supporting independence of the Central Bank. "It is because of very visible independence and primary mandate of price stability that we have been successful in anchoring inflationary expectations."
There was, he said, no contradiction in seeking stability of prices expectations and growth and job creation. It was generally agreed at global level that price stability paves way to sustainable growth and job creation.
"We insist always on Stability and Growth Pact because overburdening of monetary policy by lax fiscal approach is a danger and we call on price setters in general to take account of medium term price stability and avoid second round effects. This applies to social partners too - we will deliver price stability in the medium run."
"We need to remember what happened in 1973-4, those who let second round effects gallop ended up with inflation, low growth and the start of the mass unemployment we are fighting still today." Inflation hurt the poorest citizens most, he noted.
On oil and commodity prices, he said there was a triangle driving increases: demand from emerging markets, supply constraints and the "reallocation of capital at a global level in the direction of commodities." All sides of the triangle should be tackled: increasing energy efficiency, increasing supply capacity and ensuring that markets operated in the most transparent way possible.
On prudential supervision, he called for close cooperation between central banks and supervisory authorities, and said the current agreed plans for improvements should be implemented as a first priority.
On exchange rates, he stressed the need for caution in his comments, but said: "We agree with all the G7 on the message for China, and we also consider it important to look at adverse effect of excessive fluctuations. It is important too that US authorities have repeated that a strong dollar is in the interests of the USA."
In his reply to the debate, Eurogroup president Jean-Claude Juncker criticised the "wave of nostalgia for the 1970s and 1980s". The Eurogroup was being asked to "coordinate economic policy better" in its member countries but people should then not complain about the results. Under the reformed Stability and Growth Pact, with its greater emphasis on the "preventive side", governments were supposed to build up their reserves in the good times. Those that had done so now had greater financial leeway.
Mr Juncker also stressed that he had not called for a ban on wage increases, simply for wage growth to be linked to increases in productivity. In this connection he questioned the "exponential increase" in salaries drawn by some business leaders, notably in the financial services sector. These, he argued, "do not reflect productivity gains" and he questioned if they are "socially compatible."
Returning to his earlier theme of fiscal responsibility, he said that countries which had consolidated their budgetary position in prosperous times were now able, for example, to fund social measures to help the less well-off cope with energy price rises.
He also noted that in the 1970s and 1980s there had been "galloping inflation, growing state deficits and, as a result, mass unemployment". Social benefits had been too high in some cases, as had taxes. The goal, he pointed out, was "inflation-free growth". Therefore "over-generosity on the social side" was undesirable. "We must think of future generations".
Parliament's rapporteur responds
Rapporteur Olle Schmidt in his response to the debate said that his experience in the 1990s as a politician in Sweden on the Parliament's Finance Committee had shown that low inflation and stable interest rates were important. Sweden, he pointed out, had suffered with mass unemployment and stagflation during the 1990s. The ECB should be commended and he repeated: "I hope that my country [Sweden] will join the euro zone." He concluded by thanking the Parliament for allowing him to be the rapporteur on the ECB 2007 annual report despite coming from a non euro zone country.

MEPs call for action over Sovereign Wealth Funds
2008-07-14 - 15:45
Parliament is concerned that the lack of transparency of certain sovereign wealth funds does not allow a proper understanding of their structures and motivations. It wants to see a global code of conduct and for the Commission to examine what measures might be taken under EU law to improve the situation. In a resolution adopted by 661 votes in favour, 11 against and 23 abstentions, MEPs ask the Commission to work closely with the IMF and OECD to establish a global code of conduct for Sovereign Wealth Funds (state owned investment funds from around the world). But the Commission should also monitor SWF activities and play a coordinating role in ensuring national initiatives do not go against the commitment to openness to investments or endanger the EU's position on global markets.
Parliaments say the Commission and Council should examine what legislative or other tools the EU has regarding transparency requirements, voting rights, shareholders' rights and golden shares that could allow reactions to ownership problems following SWF intervention. It wants to check the options for coordinated EU-level action.
MEPs also call on the Commission and Council to conduct an in-depth analysis of the functioning of global financial markets, defining a strong EU vision or what should be the principles and rules guiding their functioning. Resolution adopted on Sovereign Wealth Funds

All-inclusive air fares just around the corner as MEP back legislation on transparency
2008-07-14 - 15:45
Air travellers will soon be able to see at a glance exactly what they have to pay for their tickets, as the European Parliament approved new EU rules. Air fares as displayed will have to include all taxes, fees and charges added to the basic ticket price and known at the time of publication. Parliament approved a deal on this legislation reached with the Council, as it takes on board the EP's key first-reading amendments. The price you actually have to pay Booking via Internet - often the only possibility with low-cost air carriers - is a particular concern. Under the EU regulation, all carriers will in future have to provide the general public with comprehensive information, "including on the Internet," on their air fares. Air fares that are "addressed directly to the travelling public" will have to include all applicable taxes, non-avoidable charges, surcharges and fees known at the time of publication. The following information, at least, must be specified: air fare or air rate, taxes, airport charges and other charges, surcharges or fees, such as those related to security or fuel. Optional price supplements must be communicated in a clear, transparent and unambiguous way at the start of any booking process and their acceptance by the consumer must be on an "opt-in basis". According to Arūnas DEGUTIS (ALDE, LT): "This regulation promotes price transparency for the passenger and fair prices. The passenger has a right to know the actual price of the ticket, including taxes and extra charges. It is misleading to advertise a ticket at 1 or 2 euros, when the actual cost is actually much higher." Brian SIMPSON (PES, North West Labour, UK) said:" Apart from flight delays, the most complaints that I receive against airlines concern the way that they lure people with what appear to be low fares and conveniently tell them the true cost only at the very end of the process. Low fare airlines have perfected this art over recent years. Now, not only will the customers see the true price, but also the security taxes levied by national governments will have to be highlighted separately. This transparency has to be a good thing, and I hope it will end what has been over recent years an exercise in deceit by some airlines which try to con the travelling public into believing they are buying a very cheap ticket when the opposite is true." Security taxes and charges With security charges on the rise, MEPs successfully argued that the consumer has a right to know how high these costs are, and what they are used for. Where airport or on-board security costs are included in the price of an air ticket, these costs will have to be shown separately on the ticket or otherwise indicated to the passenger. And, whether levied by the Member States or by air carriers or other entities, security taxes and charges must be transparent and be used exclusively to meet airport or onboard aircraft security costs. A wide-ranging regulation The new rules on transparency of air fares are part of a regulation which updates existing EU legislation on a range of matters to do with the operation of air transport services in the Community. Among other things, it aims to establish a level playing field for leasing aircraft and to clarify who has administrative responsibility for revoking or suspending licences. In addition, stricter controls on the financial situation of airlines should ensure that, if a carrier is on the verge of going bankrupt, passengers' rights can be safeguarded. Moreover, Member States must now ensure the proper application of Community and national employment legislation to employees of any Community carrier operating air services from an operational base outside the Member State where that carrier has its principal place of business. In the past, the use of bases outside the country of origin has made it difficult to determine which territory's employment laws apply to crews. The new regulation should enter into force later this year or early next year.

Europe-wide authorisation of railway rolling stock, but heritage railways exempted by MEPs
2008-07-14 - 15:45
The European Parliament approved an agreement reached with the Council on the EU-wide approval of different types of railway rolling stock. Under the new legislation, any rolling stock already approved for use in one Member State will have to be accepted in the other states. This will cut red tape and should boost the development of rail transport in Europe. Heritage, museum and tourist railways are exempted from the directive, as the result of another successful demand by Parliament. The agreement on which the House will be voting - at second reading under the co-decision procedure - relates to two pieces of legislation. The first updates the existing Railway Safety Directive; the second amends the current European Railway Agency regulation.
Cross-border acceptance of rolling stock crucial to free movement
Under current rules, locomotives and other vehicles that can operate in one Member State are not necessarily allowed to operate in another State. Sometimes national safety rules conflict. For example, in Italy fire extinguishers on trains must contain CO2 powder and no foam, while Austria requires fire-extinguishers to be filled with foam and CO2 is not allowed.
Furthermore, rail companies wishing to operate international services have to undergo repeat approval procedures for their rolling stock in each Member State. This often requires the provision of evidence that is not mutually recognised between States and can cause delays and costs. Certification can take up to three years to complete.
The solution proposed by the European Commission - and now on the verge of being endorsed by Parliament and Council - is to introduce the principle of "cross-acceptance through mutual recognition". This means that a railway vehicle that has been approved for use in one Member State must be authorised in the other States.
Safety not to be neglected
Efficiency must not come at the expense of safety, and the Commission proposed from the outset that Member States' authorities be allowed to impose additional national safety requirements in some cases, for example to take account of "local system specifications".
However, MEPs were keen to ensure that safety issues were not used as an excuse to hinder the approval of rolling stock and the creation of new railway undertakings. They therefore proposed a clearer definition of “national safety rules”, which has been taken on board by the Council.
The Commission and Council wanted a voluntary certification system to guarantee that trains are properly maintained but MEPs successfully argued for it to be mandatory, thus creating a level-playing field in the EU. Following pressure from MEPs, this system will apply to all vehicles: for freight wagons two years after the directive enters into force and for all other vehicles no later then ten years after entry into force.
Lastly, heritage, museum and tourist railways are exempted from the directive, as the result of another successful demand by Parliament.
Speaking in the debate in Strasbourg on 8 July, Brian Simpson (PES, UK, Labour North West) said: " Finally, I must thank our rapporteur and all the Members for their support of my amendments exempting heritage and tourist railways from this directive. Had they been forced to comply, the cost burden would have been crippling, putting at risk the preservation of that rich industrial heritage that these railways undoubtedly provide. "
European Railway Agency
For the Rail Safety Directive to work, centralised procedures and data will be needed. This is the task of the European Railway Agency. Under the amended regulation on the European Railway Agency, this body is mandated to develop a reference document with information on all the national rules on the placing in service of rolling stock. It will also play a coordinating role in efforts to streamline the number of national safety rules.
A key point was the introduction of a European Railway Traffic Management System, consisting of the most advanced rail safety technology. This system will be installed on the Trans-European Transport network but, at Parliament's insistence, it will be phased in gradually.

Towards a new culture for urban mobility
2008-07-14 - 15:45
New thinking and innovative concepts on mobility on cities are urgently needed in order to tackle the negative effects of urban transport on climate change and the environment. By adopting an own-initiative report (581 votes in favour to 100 against and 33 abstentions) on a recent Commission Green Paper, the European Parliament calls for a clear definition of the EU's role in terms of urban mobility policy, with due respect to the subsidiarity principle. MEPs said that action at EU level should only be taken when it provided a clear added value and they ask for an integrated European urban approach to urban mobility, which should serve as a common frame of reference for European cities and should encourage them to draw up Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMP). Where the EU has legislative power in the field of environment, industry, regional and cohesion policy, it should take into account the needs of urban transport.
Furthermore, the report asks for specific EU rules on standardisation and harmonisation in a number of areas, for instance in relation to the interoperability of transport modes, the mobility of people with disabilities or the introduction of green zones and road pricing. The decision on whether or not to introduce these measures should, however, be taken at local level.
The House is also in favour of facilitating the dissemination of best practices throughout the EU, such as the promotion of alternative modes of transport, multi-modality or the improvement of public transport. It is proposed to create a "European Platform for Urban Mobility", which should bring together relevant data, practices and policy information.
Financing
With regard to financing, the House emphasises that there should be a shared responsibility between the various levels of governance. It is believed that the EU could make an important contribution in this area for example via structural and cohesion funds. The report is expected to provide firm guidance to the European Commission, which is currently drawing up an EU Action Plan on urban mobility. Text adopted - Towards a new culture of urban mobility

Petitions
Environmental and geopolitical concerns mix in EP objections to Nord Stream project
2008-07-14 - 15:45
The planned Nord Stream pipeline along the seabed of the Baltic Sea worries MEPs for both environmental and geopolitical reasons. In a report adopted by 542 votes in favour, 60 against and 38 abstentions, the EP calls on Commission and Council to be more actively involved in evaluating the potential environmental impact of this gas pipeline. The report responds to two petitions by Polish and Lithuanian environmental associations who fear that the planned pipeline could harm marine eco-systems. As one of the infrastructure projects selected under the EU Trans-European Energy Networks (TEN-E) initiative, the Nord Stream submarine pipeline, which would directly link up Germany and Russia, is the subject of an own-initiative report by Petitions Committee Chair Marcin Libicki (UEN, PL).
Dumped munitions might pose threat to environment and human health
MEPs warn that this, the world's longest and shallowest dual sub-sea gas pipeline, would be "especially vulnerable to potential damage". They stress that "while carrying out work in an area of up to 2,400 km² in the Baltic Sea, requiring the use of a large number of vessels and other equipment, could represent a serious threat to biodiversity and to the number of habitats", and that Nord Stream AG should be obliged to pay compensation for any environmental damage.
Disturbing munitions dumped on the Baltic seabed after World War II could pose a threat to the Baltic marine environment, and to human life and health, says the report. Toxic substances such as mustard gas, sulphur yperite, nitrogen yperite, lewisite, Clark I, Clark II and adamsite are all present in about 80,000 tonnes of munitions that are now very heavily corroded and cannot always be located, adds the report.
Diversification of resources and alternative routes essential for European energy security
As the EU depends on a limited number of energy sources, suppliers and transport routes, "it is essential to support initiatives aimed at their diversification, both geographically and by developing sustainable alternatives", says the report. It also underlines that "energy security must be regarded as an essential component of the overall security of the European Union," taking into account "the geopolitical dependency on imports and the potential therein for politically motivated interruptions."
The Parliament notes that the Nord Stream pipeline will be only one of a large number of infrastructure projects, such as pipelines and liquid natural gas facilities, needed to meet growing demand for natural gas. MEPs also argue that given growing EU gas demand, alternative gas pipeline routes should be analysed and promoted.
Clear European interest, but insufficient EU involvement
The Parliament notes that the Nord Stream pipeline is "a project of European interest that would help meet the EU's future energy needs." While saying that "Nord Stream is an infrastructure project with a wide political and strategic dimension for both the EU and Russia,", the House also notes "the lack of institutional structures capable of responding adequately to the environmental and geopolitical security issues associated with this project." The report also notes that "in light of Russia's current political situation and geopolitical ambitions, [...] it is of great importance that Russia show goodwill regarding cooperation in the European energy policy."
Emphasising that "greater EU involvement would reduce the uncertainty felt by many Member States," the report asks the Commission to evaluate the environmental impact of the project. MEPs voice their opposition at the "carrying-out of an investment on the proposed scale without having first a positive environmental impact assessment," and call on the Commission and Council to ensure that the pipeline's construction adheres to all EU and international legislation.

Parliament's Rules of Procedure
New rules on written questions
2008-07-14 - 15:45
Parliament adopted a report by Richard CORBETT (PES, UK) on new rules for written questions, this report introduces new guidelines for MEPs wanting to table a written question to either the Council or the Commission. According to the proposed changes, written questions will have to fall within the EU's competences, be concise and not contain offensive language. The report was adopted with 516 votes in favour, 143 against and 36 abstentions. Parliament adopted the report to implement the proposals made by the Working Group on Parliamentary Reform, established last year and ably chaired by German Socialist MEP Dagmar ROTH-BEHRENDT. The modifications include new rules on own-initiative reports, proposals to make parliamentary debates more open and lively and guidelines for the procedure of tabling written questions to the Commission and Council. Under the new rules questions for written answer shall: - fall within the competence and sphere of responsibility of the institution concerned and be of general interest; - be concise and contain an understandable interrogation; - not contain offensive language; - not relate to strictly personal matters. If a question does not comply with these guidelines, the Secretariat shall provide the author with advice on how the question may be drafted in order to be admissible. If an identical or similar question has been put and answered during the preceding six months, the Secretariat shall transmit a copy of the previous question and answer to the author. The renewed question shall not be forwarded to the institution concerned unless the author invokes new significant developments or is seeking further information. If a question seeks factual or statistical information that is already available to Parliament's library, the latter shall inform the Member, who may withdraw the question. Questions concerning related matters may be answered together.

Parliament's Rules of Procedure
European Parliament increases threshold to form a political group
2008-07-14 - 15:45
After the June 2009 European elections, to enjoy the status of political group within the Parliament, a minimum of 25 Members representing at least 7 Member States will be needed. MEPs decided to amend their internal rules to raise the threshold to constitute a political group. The report was adopted with 481 votes in favour, 203 against and 26 abstentions. At present, a group can be formed by a minimum of 20 Members (or 2.5% of EP's membership), who also represent at least one fifth of the Member States (i.e. at least 6 countries). By approving the report by Richard CORBETT (PES, UK), the House agreed to amend the rules of procedure to raise the threshold to 25 MEPs (3.3% of total membership), representing at least one quarter of the Member States (i.e. 7 Member States).
A compromise solution
During the vote in the Constitutional Affairs' committee on 26 May, an amendment proposing to raise the threshold to 30 MEPs was rejected by a majority of one vote, with 15 against and 14 in favour. A compromise was then found among most of the groups on the approved figure of 25.
Speaking in the plenary debate in Strasbourg on 7 July, Richard Corbett (PES, UK, Labour Yorkshire and The Humber) said: "At the moment, if you look around the parliaments of the world, we have one of the lowest thresholds that exist for allowing the constitution of a political group. Just 2.5% of our membership can create a political group. When you remember that constituting a group gives those Members extra resources above what ordinary Members get as a Member – extra resources as a group in terms of finance from the taxpayer, in terms of staff and in terms of procedural privileges – it should give us cause to reflect."
Special provision for groups falling below required threshold
An amendment was approved to introduce new rules on the possibility for a political group to continue to exist if it falls below the required threshold, under certain conditions.
Particularly, the President of the EP, in agreement with the Conference of groups' Presidents, can allow a group with less than the required number of Members to exist till the end of the term, if:
members continue to represent at least one-fifth of the Member States and
the group was established more than one year before.
If there is "sufficient evidence" that this right is being abused, the President of the Parliament can avoid applying the derogation.
The adopted changes will come into effect after the June 2009 European elections. An absolute majority of MEPs is always required to approve amendments to the EP's Rules of Procedure. Text adopted by the EP on Formation of political groups

Airbus/Boeing disputes: MEPs defend the European aircraft industry
2008-07-14 - 15:45
MEPs support the defence of EU interests in the pending dispute settlement proceedings before the WTO, in a resolution adopted with 589 votes in favour, 53 against and 64 abstentions. Airbus/Boeing disputes over subsidies should be ruled out in the coming weeks. Implementing fair competition rules is among the recommendations sent by MEPs to the European Commission. According to MEPs, the contract award to the Northrop Grumman Corporation EADS team for the US aerial tanker recapitalisation program was based on "neutral criteria" to identify and place "the best and most suitable equipment" in the hands of the US Air Force (USAF).
On June 18, the GAO (Government Accountability Office) recommended that the US Air Force re-open the bidding process over tankers. The report of the Government Accountability Office sustaining Boeing's bid protest is recognised as an evaluation merely of the selection process and not the merits of the aircraft. Parliament reaffirms its belief that the integrity of the US Department of Defence procurement process will remain intact for all competitors.
Parliament is concerned with the "bitter attacks" of Boeing and the US Congress portraying EADS operations and certain Member States as "unreliable aerospace partners" and a "security risk" to US military readiness.
More generally, the House calls on the Commission - which defends Member States' interests and the EU civil aircraft industry - to ensure that any anti-competitive actions in legislation or executive policy that would improperly restrict the ability of EU companies to compete in either civil or military programmes should be met with the "appropriate response by the EU and its Member States, if necessary on a case-by-case basis.
WTO rulings vs. negotiated solution
Parliament urges the Commission to continue its efforts to defend EU interests in the pending dispute settlement proceedings before the WTO. MEPs doubt, however, whether WTO rulings in themselves will provide the necessary long-term solution the market requires. A negotiated solution could deliver more security and predictability.
The WTO court is expected to rule on the European subsidies in the fall.
According to the resolution, European financing for Airbus is strictly limited, repayable with interest and clearly has no impact on Boeing’s ability to compete. Airbus repaid 40 % more than it has received from EU governments since 1992 and has repaid in excess of EUR 7 billion so far.

MEPs urge Italy to stop the ethnic census of Roma
2008-07-14 - 15:45
The European Parliament asks the Italian authorities to refrain from collecting fingerprints from Roma people, including children, and to put an end to discriminatory policies, in a resolution adopted on 10 July. MEPs also say the integration of Roma people should be ensured at European level. The resolution was adopted with 336 votes in favour 220 against and 77 abstentions. MEPs point out that Roma are one of the main targets of racism and discrimination, as shown by the recent incidents involving attacks and aggression against Roma in Italy and Hungary and further underlined by recent Eurobarometer surveys.
A motion from EPP-ED, aiming to postpone the vote until September to wait for explanations from the Italian governments, was rejected by 316 votes against 296 and 14 abstentions.
MEPs urge Italian authorities to "refrain" from collecting fingerprints of Roma and from using those already collected as it would be a discriminatory act infringing the European Convention of Human Rights.
State of emergency
MEPs also voiced concern at the affirmation that a 12-month "state of emergency" could be justified by the presence of Romani camps, thus allowing extraordinary measures, in derogation of laws, to be taken. Members say this is "non adequate nor proportionate" to the case.
They consider that the best way to protect the rights of Roma children is to guarantee equal access to quality education, housing and healthcare through integration policies, and to protect them from exploitation. They ask for the Commission and Member states to launch an EU Roma strategy for their inclusion and integration and recalls that Parliament, in a vote in January, urged Member states to solve the problem of slums and illegal camps .
Parliament calls on the Commission to review the measures defined by the Italian government in order to check their compatibility with EU law.

Reliable space assets needed for an independent European Security and Defence Policy
2008-07-14 - 15:45
The European Union needs a common approach to defending its interests in space, says an own-initiative report by Security and Defence Subcommittee Chair Karl von Wogau (EPP-ED, DE), adopted by a large majority (483-99-20) in the European Parliament. The report underlines "the need for space assets in order that the political and diplomatic activities of the European Union may be based on independent, reliable and complete information”. With an eye to debate over the civilian or military nature of the Galileo satellite navigation project, the report underlines "the necessity of Galileo for autonomous European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) operations, for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), for Europe’s own security and for the Union's strategic autonomy". The House also urges EU Member States to ensure the interoperability of their various observation and reconnaissance systems, and "recommends the urgent conclusion of agreements between the EU Satellite Centre and EU Member States to provide imagery to ESDP operation and force commanders". Weaponisation and security of space The Parliament “is concerned by the possible future weaponisation of space” and "expresses particular concern about the use of destructive force against satellites" such as the January 2007 test of the Chinese anti-satellite system. The report urges "that under no circumstances should European space policy contribute to the overall militarisation and weaponisation of space". The House also calls on EU institutions to "promote a conference to review the Outer Space Treaty, with the aim of strengthening it and expanding its scope to prohibit all weapons in space", and calls on "all international actors to refrain from using offensive equipment in space". On security, the report "deplores the fact that EU Member States do not have access to instant data on ballistic missile launches around the world", and supports projects for early-warning systems to be established. It also "underscores the vulnerability of strategic space assets", and therefore "stresses the need for them to be adequately protected by ground-based theatre missile defence, planes and space surveillance systems". A space assets budget? The report also advocates setting up "an operational budget for space assets" and strongly favours putting space operations under the Community budget. "As experience has shown, large-scale common projects cannot be properly managed when 27 different national budget authorities applying the principle of 'fair return' are involved", the Parliament says, and it "therefore strongly recommends that these projects and programmes be financed from the EU budget". It also “recommends that European non-commercial satellites be carried into orbit by European launchers, preferably from the territory of the European Union”.

Fisheries
EP gives green light to derogations to European Fisheries Fund for a period of two years
2008-07-14 - 15:45
The European Parliament backed today the proposal instituting an ad hoc special temporary regime which will derogate from some provisions of the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) regulation up to the end of 2010. This proposal, presented by the Commission on Wednesday, pledges up to another 600 million euros to fund this temporary specific action to help the fishing industry to adapt to high fuel prices. The core of the proposal, voted today in the European Parliament under the urgent procedure, consists of a regime of temporary derogations to the EFF allowing funds to be targeted quickly where they are needed most to address the underlying causes of the crisis, and provide short-term support to the hardest-hit segments of the fleet. The Agriculture and Fisheries Council will discuss the package next week, with a view to ensuring its rapid entry into force.

Human rights: Kashmir, Bangladesh, death penalty in USA
2008-07-14 - 15:45
In three resolutions adopted at the end of the Strasbourg session, Parliament calls for an inquiry into allegations of mass graves in Kashmir, for the speedy restoration of democracy in Bangladesh and for a fresh trial for Troy Davis, an American who sits on death row despite strong evidence that he may be innocent. Allegations of mass graves in Kashmir
In its resolution on Kashmir, Parliament calls for an urgent inquiry into claims that mass graves have been discovered in Jammu and Kashmir, and for human rights activists investigating the alleged abuses to be given protection.
According to the resolution "it is reported that hundreds of unidentified graves have been discovered since 2006 in Jammu and Kashmir" and "at least 940 bodies have reportedly been found in 18 villages in Uri district alone". Human rights organisations say the grave sites may contain the remains of victims of unlawful killings, disappearances, torture and other abuses which have occurred in the armed conflict in Jammu and Kashmir since 1989.
Impartial inquiry needed
MEPs call on the Indian government "to urgently ensure independent and impartial investigations into all suspected sites of mass graves in Jammu and Kashmir and as an immediate first step to secure the grave sites in order to preserve the evidence".
The resolution asks the European Commission to offer financial and technical assistance to the government to support an inquiry and to aid conflict resolution measures. EU Member States are urged to raise the issue in their forthcoming dialogue on human rights with India.
Call for protection of human rights activists
The EP expresses concern for the safety of Pervez Imroz and other human rights activists who are investigating the unmarked graves and other allegations of human rights abuses in Jammu and Kashmir and calls on the Indian authorities to ensure their protection.
More broadly, Parliament "condemns the unlawful killings, enforced disappearances, torture, rape and other human rights abuses which have occurred in Jammu and Kashmir since the beginning of the armed conflict in 1989".
It also calls on all governments to ratify and implement the UN Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance without reservation, to recognise the competence of the Committee on Enforced Disappearances and to ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.
MEPs want full access to be granted to both sides of the Line of Control for the UN Special Rapporteurs on Torture and on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions and the UN Working Group on Enforced or Voluntary Disappearances.
Lastly, Parliament urges the Lok Sabha "to amend the Human Rights Protection Act in order to allow the National Human Rights Commission to investigate independently allegations of abuse by members of the armed forces".

Restore democracy and rule of law in Bangladesh, say MEPs
The state of emergency should be lifted, mass arrests of the government's political opponents and journalists should cease, the military should withdraw from politics and elections should be held as soon as possible, says the EP's resolution on Bangladesh.
The resolution states that, on 11 January 2007 amid violence in the run-up to the election, the caretaker government of Bangladesh imposed a state of emergency, with the suspension of many civil rights. On 11 June 2008 a new Counterterrorism Ordinance was adopted, "violating fundamental freedoms and basic fair trial rights".
The number of people reportedly arrested since the introduction of the state of emergency has risen to well over 300,000. Although most have since been released, a large number are alleged to have been tortured. Since 28 May 2008 more than 12,000 more people have been arrested.
Progress on elections recognised
On a positive note, the resolution acknowledges the caretaker government's progress in preparing for parliamentary elections. It also "applauds the Bangladesh Government for banning former war criminals from standing in elections and calls on it to follow up this positive step by forming an independent committee of inquiry to initiate the trial of war criminals". The release of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on humanitarian grounds is welcomed.
MEPs urge swift restoration of rule of law
However, MEPs believe swifter progress is needed. They call on the government to lift the state of emergency in order to prepare for the holding of the elections and so that local council elections can take place in August 2008. The resolution also calls for the armed forces to withdraw from involvement in the political process.
Ethnic minority voting rights and press freedom stressed
MEPs urge the government to ensure that Bangladesh’s ethnic and religious minorities are in a position to cast their votes freely. And the resolution "calls for freedom of the press in the pre-electoral period".
The government is urged to ensure that its new Anti-Terrorism Ordinance meets internationally recognised legal standards on combating terrorism. In addition, MEPs call for abolition of the death penalty and an end to the recent wave of mass arrests and the harassment of political opponents and journalists.
Democracy and climate change
MEPs point out that a further reason for holding elections is that "an elected government would make it easier to deal with the effects of climate change", which poses a particular threat to Bangladesh and will require large-scale mobilisation of all sections of society.
EU action
Lastly, Parliament wants the European Commission and Council to impress on the Bangladesh Government the need for a speedy and complete lifting of the state of emergency. And to ensure free and fair elections in accordance with international standards, the EU Election Observation Mission should resume work as soon as possible.

The death penalty and the case of Troy Davis
Parliament adopted a resolution calling for Troy Davis, who has been convicted of murder and sentenced to death in Georgia, USA, to be granted a retrial in view of evidence which strongly indicates his innocence.
Troy Davis was sentenced to death by the Georgia State Court in 1991 for the murder of a policeman and scheduled to be executed at the end of July 2008. According to Mr Davis' lawyers, there is abundant proof of his innocence, material evidence against him has never been found and seven witnesses against him have retracted their testimony.
On 4 August 2007 the Supreme Court of Georgia had agreed to reconsider the new elements casting doubt on Mr Davis' culpability but on 17 March 2008 the same court decided to deny him a new trial.
Retrial of Troy Davis merited on the basis of evidence
The EP resolution "asks, in view of abundant evidence which might reverse his sentence, for the relevant courts to grant Troy Davis a retrial, and for the death sentence therefore to be commuted". It also "appeals urgently to the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles to commute the death sentence".
MEPs call on the Presidency of the Council and the Delegation of the European Commission to the USA to raise the issue with the US authorities as a matter of urgency.
EP opposed to death penalty on principle
More broadly, today's resolution calls upon those countries where the death penalty is carried out to take steps towards abolition. This is in line with Parliament's general stance on capital punishment: in the past it has devoted much effort to seeking abolition of the death penalty and warmly welcomed UN General Assembly Resolution 62/149 of 18 December 2007 calling for a worldwide moratorium on the death penalty.
Innocent death row prisoners have been reprieved in USA too
Lastly, to underline the flaw in the use of the death penalty, today's resolution points out that more than 120 people have been released from death row in the USA since 1975 on the grounds of innocence.
