Equality in advertising caught the eye Tuesday Initiatives on education, employment and social protection were debated by MEPs Tuesday morning. Europe's Social Affairs Commissioner Vladimír Špidla outlined 18 measures, which he said were based on opportunity and solidairity between peoples and countries. Also discussed Tuesday were gender equality and a new telecoms package that deals rules covering the internet and call pricing. Reports on judicial cooperation, culture and education were adopted.
Špidla tries to relaunch social Europe
Mr Špidla reminded MEPs that two months ago the Commission adopted a series of social measures on employment, education, health and economic affairs aiming to provide opportunity, access and solidarity. For the Council, French minister for employment and social affairs Xavier Bertrand said 2008 must be the year to relaunch a social Europe.
In the subsequent debate most MEPs welcomed the proposed measures and underlined the importance of real changes - namely the need to fight discrimination, balancing flexibility and security. The importance of a good work-life balance was also stressed, as was the need to improve relations between employers and employees and the importance of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
The debate brought to surface clear ideological divergences concerning the future of social policy in the EU, with some speakers attacking what they perceived as a watering down of social Europe and protection for citizens in the Commission's proposal. Others warned of the adverse economic effect of excessive regulation.
Several MEPs called the new measures "vague" and urged the EU to face the loss of purchasing power and poverty, unemployment and insufficient birth levels. A resolution on the whole package will be voted at the next plenary session.
Effect of advertising on gender relations
In the evening, equality between women and men in 2008 as well as the influence of marketing and advertising on gender equality were on the table. Major problems were identified - violence against women, a pay gap of 15% leaving women systematically less well-paid than men, the risk of poverty and reconciliation of family and professional life.
As advertising is often seen as "restricting individuals to predetermined and artificial roles" and is "degrading, humiliating and dumbed down for both sexes", MEPs called for stereotypes to be broken down by creating national monitoring bodies and a code of conduct for advertising.
Telecoms, missing children
MEPs also discussed the telecom package, which will affect rules on internet provision, call pricing and access to services. MEPs spoke about the need to build trust among stakeholders and regulators in the sector, the use of spectrum freed by the switch-over to digital TV for public ends and the provision of clear and full information on prices, tariffs and contract conditions.
A written declaration on emergency cooperation in recovering missing children, signed by more than half of all MEPs, was announced as an official EP position. It was tabled as a reaction to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann in Portugal on 3 May 2007.
