Russian troops near the Georgian town of Gori, 9 September On Wednesday 10 September EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering and the leaders of parliament's political groups were in Paris for talks on the Russia-Georgia crisis with France's President Nicolas Sarkozy. France currently holds the EU Presidency and Mr Sarkozy briefed them about his recent visit to Moscow and Tbilisi. Separately, the Foreign Affairs Committee discussed Russia and Georgia with EU High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy Javier Solana.
During the meeting in the Elysée, Mr Pöttering praised the president's mediation efforts. After the meeting he told journalist, "Thanks to Mr. Sarkozy, the EU has been able to show itself united and effective in the search of a solution to the situation".
"We trust Russia to keep its promise"
The aim of the meeting, the first of its kind, was to inform the EP about the results of Mr Sarkozy's visit to the region, together with Mr Solana and Commission president José Manuel Barroso, on 8-9 September.
Asked by the journalists what would happen if Russia did not comply with the commitment of withdrawing its troops from Georgia's mainland (not including the disputed areas of South Ossetia and Abkhazia ) by 10 October, Mr Pöttering said: "we trust Russia will keep its promise and will respect the agreement". He said that the European Council and the Parliament will have the chance to analyse the development of the situation during October's European summit and during the Parliament's October plenary session, when President Sarkozy will inform MEPs about the outcome of the summit.
Solana voices optimism to MEPs
Speaking the same day to Foreign Affairs Committee MEPs, Mr Solana was optimistic about what has been done in Georgia so far, although he said that "much remains to be done". He went on to say that "a well united approach from the EU can produce results" and that unity "is the best way of exerting pressure".
