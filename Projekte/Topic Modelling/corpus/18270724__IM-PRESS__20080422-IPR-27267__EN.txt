Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: progress towards EU
External relations
2008-04-23 - 12:52
The European Parliament reiterates that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's bilateral name dispute with Greece should not obstruct FYROM's EU accession process in a report adopted today by 601 votes in favour, 52 against and 30 abstentions.
The report by Erik Meijer (GUE/NGL, NL) on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia welcomes the government's achievements “in the implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement”, which deals with the political aspects of inter-ethnic relations in the country, while noting the “continuing discrimination against the Roma community.”
The House also welcomes the fact that the government has pledged to rebuild the mosque that was damaged in the otherwise “professional and effective” police operation in Brodec on 7 November, 2007. MEPs also commended the government’s economic performance, and the adoption of several crucial laws on prosecutors.
While welcoming the entry into force of the visa facilitation and readmission agreement between the country and the EU, MEPs underline the difficulties citizens still face when trying to enter the EU. At the same time, Members regret the signing of a bilateral immunity agreement between the US and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, granting exemption from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court in the Hague, which “contradicts EU standards and policies.”
Name dispute
On the consistently contentious issue of the country’s bilateral name-dispute with Greece, the report welcomes the increased bilateral cooperation, as well as people-to-people contacts between the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Greece.
The report notes with satisfaction that, since the adoption of Parliament's above-mentioned resolution of 12 July 2007, bilateral talks have been held in the region, under the auspices of the United Nations and assisted by Special Envoy Matthew Nimitz, with a view to finding a mutually acceptable solution to the difference that has arisen over the name of the country.
MEPs note the increased dynamics in the negotiations and call on both sides to seize the opportunity to immediately resume negotiations in light of the important progress made recently and to reach a compromise solution, so that the issue does not continue to represent an obstacle to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's membership of international organisations, as provided for in the Interim Accord of 1995, which is still in force.
