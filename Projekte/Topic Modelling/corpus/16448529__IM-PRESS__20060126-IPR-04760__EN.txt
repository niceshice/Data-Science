The members of Parliament's temporary committee on the alleged CIA detention camps and flights in Europe held their constituent meeting on Thursday and formally appointed, by acclamation, the members of the committee's bureau. The committee chair will be Carlos Miguel Coelho (EPP-ED, PT), the 1st vice-chair Sarah Ludford (ALDE, UK), the 2nd vice-chair Giorgios Dimitrakopoulos (EPP-ED, EL) and the 3rd vice-chair Cem Ã–zdemir (Greens/EFA, DE).
The 46 members also appointed Giovanni Claudio Fava (PES, IT) as the rapporteur to draft the committee's report over the next four months.
The newly elected chair, Mr Coelho, announced that the committee's next meeting would take place during the week of 13-16 February and said that, in performing its work, the committee will aim to follow a policy of transparency. " All the meetings of this temporary committee should be open to the public. This will be our 'modus operandi', unless we occasionally decide to hold a meeting in camera in order to receive restricted information ", said Mr Coelho. This could happen if a witness makes such a request and Parliament's political groups agree to it.
Mr Coelho also restated that the temporary committee's mandate will be to find out whether the CIA carried out torture or illegal detentions on EU territory, whether Member States or candidate countries have been involved in such detentions and whether citizens from Member States or from candidate countries have been detained.
