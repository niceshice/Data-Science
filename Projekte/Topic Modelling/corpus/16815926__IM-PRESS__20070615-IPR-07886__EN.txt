Galileo - MEPs say it should be financed in full from EU money
Budget
2007-06-20 - 12:39
In adopting a joint resolution on the financing of the European programme of satellite radio-navigation(Galileo), MEPs consider that the Galileo programme should be financed in full from the Union's budget. The House also points out that the Commission must present a revised proposal for a regulation on the financing of the Galileo programme, which must be agreed upon by Parliament and the Council in codecision.
MEPs will oppose any solution which would combine Community funding with additional intergovernmental funding.
The European Parliament expresses its concern at the possibility that the additional financing necessary to fill the gap following the failure of the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) could be agreed on an intergovernmental basis.
The House reminds the Council and Commission that the multi-annual financial framework contains an amount of roughly€1 billion foreseen for the operational expenditure of Galileo for the period 2007-2013 and that the financial reference amount under the amended proposal for a regulation on the implementation of the deployment and commercial operating phases of the European programme of satellite radionavigation is €1.005 billion at current prices;
The House reiterates its support for the Galileo programme, which is of an enormous European added value, and expresses its strong support for continuing it under EU responsibility.
Finally, the House is of the opinion that if the public sector assumes the complete financing of the project, as well as taking over some or all of the risks and liabilities, this factor should be taken into account in a future revised concession contract, especially as regards the reimbursement mechanism for public financial contributions and the prices of services.
