Cutting red tape and making it easier to table citizens' initiatives seeking EU legislation were central themes at a hearing held by the Constitutional Affairs Committee on Tuesday. Questions were raised about admissibility criteria for both initiatives and signatories.
Parliament's co-rapporteur on the citizens' initiative plans, Zita Gurmai (S&D, HU), raised several suggestions made by the four rapporteurs working on the plans, which would enable groups of at least one million EU citizens from several Member States to ask the European Commission to table legislative proposals. Ms Gurmai called for an admissibility check on initiatives "at the earliest stage possible" and stressed that if someone had collected one million signatures "they need to get something in exchange, at least a hearing".
Are ID cards and citizens' committees needed?
The two experts invited to the hearing, Professor Jürgen Meyer and former MEP Sylvia-Yvonne Kaufmann, both backed Ms Gurmai's ideas. However, both were against a Commission proposal to make it mandatory for all signatories of an initiative to supply their ID card numbers.
Another co-rapporteur, Gerald Häfner (Greens/EFA, DE), noted that at least a uniform system for verifying identity should be in place. He also brought up the rapporteurs' joint suggestion of requiring the organisers of an initiative to form a "citizens' committee" consisting of at least seven persons. Thus seven signatures from several EU Member States, would be the minimum requirement for launching an initiative. Both the experts regarded this as too bureaucratic.
Admissibility check
All speakers were in favour of an early admissibility check on the citizens' initiatives, as opposed to the Commission proposal that they be checked only after 300,000 signatures have been collected. The Commission representative admitted they are "talking about making it earlier".
Morten Messerschmidt (EFD, DK), questioned the admissibility criteria, and wondered why the Commission was referring only to the "values of the Union" - "why not subsidiarity or proportionality?" he asked. Andrew Duff (ALDE, UK), insisted that "it is not difficult to say if something is admissible - I can tell them in 15 minutes".
Other criteria
Both the invited experts supported extending the time allowed for collecting signatures from 12 to 18 months. Sylvia-Yvonne Kaufmann also argued that the minimum age for signatories should be 16 throughout Europe, not just in Austria, where this is also the voting age for European elections. Committee Chair Carlo Casini (EPP, IT), pointed out that "if it is only Austria, that's 26–1, and it would be difficult to agree to 16 on this basis".
Finally, Helmut Scholz (GUE/NGL, DE), reiterated that "we should not be afraid of our citizens", but "need to find rules to make the threshold for involving citizens in politics as low as possible". Anneli Jäätteenmäki (ALDE, FI), observed that there is "no reason for us to be afraid for bad initiatives, as Commission and Parliament initiatives are not always that great either".
Next steps
The committee vote is scheduled for 30 November, and the plenary one for 15 December.
