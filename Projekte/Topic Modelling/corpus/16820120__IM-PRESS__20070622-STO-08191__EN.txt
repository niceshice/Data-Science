Online shopping: a domestic affair?

credit with confidence is key to cross-border sales
In the last few years online sales have exploded. However, consumers are still reluctant to use the internet to shop abroad, with only 6% of EU consumers buying outside their domestic market. This means that much of the economic potential of the EU's internal market is unused. MEPs adopted a report during their June Plenary calling for greater safeguards for customers and businesses in order to boost online confidence and sales.
Last year 21% of adults in the European Union's then 25 states bought goods or services over the internet. However, the sales are primarily taking place in the country where the person is based.
Lack of consumer confidence in "foreign" sales
Some of the problems identified in "cross-border" internet sales are that consumers feel less confident about the goods they are buying. There is confusion about the reliability of the guarantee and what to do to get your money back if anything should go wrong.
For business - the costs of cross-border delivery, uncertainty over whether the transaction is valid and different legal rules are just three obstacles they encounter. Firms also have the extra expense of having their company literature/guarantee translated into other languages. This can be particularly onerous for smaller companies.
The report drafted by Czech European People's Party and European Democrats MEP Zuzana Roithová calls for greater confidence to be placed in the digital economy. One of the solutions is a pan-European trust mark that consumers and businesses can recognise.
The idea is that traders could use the mark if they met certain standards and rules covering contracts, information and procedures for dealing with complaints.
" Euro-Label" offers one possible way forward
The Roithová report identifies the "Euro-Label", already used for electronic shopping in Italy, Germany, Austria, France, Poland and Spain, as a good model. It is used to identify reliable vendors, clear terms and conditions on a company's website and whether the trader respects laws on data protection. It also covers deliveries and what happens if there are disagreements between buyers and sellers.
At present terms and conditions of online sales can be a big source of confusion. Speaking last week, Ms Roithová said that the buyer "is bound by countless digital agreements, on which he simply clicked 'YES', but did not read. Therefore they are not aware of the fact that they often contain a number of unfair and malicious regulations".
Need for SMEs to go online
The majority of firms in the EU are small and medium size businesses and have much to gain from online market. Green MEP David Hammerstein said "the EU should encourage SMEs to participate in online markets".
The report is also concerned about fragmentation of the internal market where certain goods are available to certain people but restricted to others because access to websites is denied in some countries. The report describes these restrictions as "unacceptable". German Socialist Evelyne Gebhardt said, "citizens find a lot of problems in the digital environment; sometimes they cannot buy a product because the seller says they don't deliver to that country".
MEPs want the European Commission - which supervises the running of the internal market - to draw up proposals to boost digital consumer confidence in the EU.
