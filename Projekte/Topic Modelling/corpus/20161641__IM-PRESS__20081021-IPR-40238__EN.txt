The film 'Le Silence de Lorna', by the Belgian directors Jean-Pierre and Luc DARDENNE, is the winner of the European Parliament Cinema Prize LUX 2008. EP President, Hans-Gert Pöttering handed over the trophy to Luc Dardennne in a ceremony in front of MEPs and representatives of the three competing films in the final. The aim of the LUX Prize is to facilitate the circulation of European films within Europe.
In awarding the prize, Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering said: "The European Parliament has always recognised the pivotal role culture plays in our society and the award of the second LUX Prize reflects this. One of the objectives of the prize is to experience cultural and language differences within the EU. With this year's winner, a major social issue affecting Europe can be brought to cinemas in all European countries."
Director Luc Dardenne said, on receiving the prize: "We don't see enough of each other's films in different countries of the European Union. I think this prize is the first step in remedying this problem."
Aim of the LUX Prize
The aim of the LUX Prize, awarded for the first time in 2007, is to break down the language barriers that prevent European films from circulating in the EU and give a boost to cinematic work within the EU. The winner of the LUX Prize will have his film subtitled in the Union's 23 languages and one copy will be produced per Member State in 35mm format. The Prize also covers an adaptation for the deaf and hard of hearing, and eventually an adaptation for blind and visual impaired-people.
The competition
'Le Silence de Lorna' was selected by the MEPs who could vote for three films in competition; 'Le Silence de Lorna' (Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne) 'Delta' (Kornél MUNDRUCZÓ) and 'Obcan Havel' (Miroslav JANEK and Pavel KOUTECKÝ)
The three films were part on an official selection of 10 films, selected by a 17-strong independent panel drawn from the highest level of the cinema profession: producers, distributors, cinema operators, festival directors, critics, etc.
In order to be eligible the film should illustrate the universality of European values and/or the diversity of European culture and/or bringing insights into the debate on the process of building Europe. The films have been shown in the European Parliament in Brussels from 15 September-17 October 2008.
The LUX Prize was awarded for the first time in 2007 to the Turkish-German co production "On the Edge of Heaven" ( "Auf der anderen Seite" ).
