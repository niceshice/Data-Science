The President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering, has expressed his strong concern about the increase in violence in the streets of Iran following the announcement of the electoral result on Saturday.
Hans-Gert Pöttering said:
"I am worried about the development of the ongoing protests in Iran, where dozens of activists and protesters have been arrested over the past days. I am dismayed to hear that seven people have been killed last night while attacking a military post. The use of force is never a solution. The authorities' response to citizens' protests must be always measured and never disproportionate. Iranian citizens must be able to achieve their democratic aspirations through peaceful means. Freedom of expression and the freedom to demonstrate are part of the core individual rights that the European Union endorses and promotes."
Hans-Gert Pöttering added:
"The European Parliament is seeking to engage with the Islamic Republic of Iran as long as it explicitly commits to universal fundamental rights and principles, which include Iran's readiness to establish peaceful relations with its neighbouring countries."
