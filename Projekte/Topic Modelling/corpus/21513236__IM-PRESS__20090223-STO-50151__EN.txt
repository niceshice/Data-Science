Polish builders in London exercising their right to move and work The right to live, work and vote across the European Union are just three of the rights we have as EU citizens. However, Polish Christian Democrat Urszula Gacek says that people are not sufficiently aware of their rights and wants to raise awareness across Europe.
Ms Gacek wants to make citizenship "relevant" and believes it should be seen as a bonus not an alternative to national citizenship. She has written a report which deals with the "new Europe" after 2004, when 10 new countries, mainly from central and eastern Europe, joined the Union.
It highlights the problems that have arisen as literally millions of people have used the new opportunities to live and work abroad. From her own native Poland it is estimated that 2 million people headed west in search of work.
Among the "myriad of problems" she identified were in family law, divorce, pensions and healthcare. Ms Gacek said that shortcomings in interpreting people's rights are because of "poor implementation of current directives".
Her solutions are better information campaigns, specifically targeted at younger people whom she feels should know their rights before they go and live and work in a different country. Speaking at a public hearing on 16 February, Greek Christian Democrat MEP Panayiotis Demetriou said, " European citizens have to be aware of their rights, exercise them and be proud of them".
EU Ombudsman Nikiforos Diamandouros was more positive. "Europeans know their rights and exercise them," he said, although he admitted that administrative problems can hamper citizens from fully benefitting from their rights. He called for effective application of laws and effective remedies in case of breaches.
The last truly EU-wide survey done about people's knowledge of their rights was in -2007 when it revealed that only a third of EU citizens were aware of their rights.
