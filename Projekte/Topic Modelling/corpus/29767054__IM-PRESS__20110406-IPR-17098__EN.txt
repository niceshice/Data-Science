Flood victims in Central Europe to receive EU solidarity aid
Budget
Plenary sittings
2011-04-06 - 12:27
Plans to release €182.4 million in EU Solidarity Fund aid to help repair the flood damage in Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Croatia and Romania in 2010 were approved by the European Parliament on Wednesday. The direct cost of the damage is estimated at about €5.5 billion.
Despite strong reservations about the funding method chosen by Member States, MEPs felt they could not let flood victims become victims of a dispute between the Council and Parliament about the level of payment appropriations.
Parliament argued that the Council should have followed the Commission's proposal to add 'fresh money' to the Solidarity Fund, an approach agreed during last year's budget discussions. However, the Council refused to add payment appropriations and on 15 March suggested the introduction of a "negative reserve" to which, at the end of the year, money could be added from underspent budget lines. A negative reserve can amount to €200 million, making it a "once-only solution".
Parliament's resolution, drafted by Reimer Böge (EPP, DE), was approved by 647 votes to 17, with 5 abstentions.
