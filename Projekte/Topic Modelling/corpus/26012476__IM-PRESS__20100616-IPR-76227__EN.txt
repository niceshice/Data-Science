The activities of sport players' agents should be regulated by the EU, and include a licensing system, to improve the transparency of their activities and player transfer transactions, says a resolution approved by a show of hands in Parliament on Thursday.
Sport players' agents are central in financial streams that are often not transparent, making them prone to illegal activities and even organised crime, says a recent study by the European Commission.
Player transfers
MEPs believe that this is "detrimental to the image of sport, its integrity and ultimately its role in society". They are especially critical of the opacity of player transfer systems, particularly in team sports, "which are conducive to illegal activities where agents as well as clubs and players are involved".
Money laundering, match fixing, and human trafficking
Parliament asks the Council "to step up in its co-ordinating efforts in the fight against criminal activities linked to agents' activities, including money laundering, match fixing and human trafficking". Underlining the "specific vulnerability of young players and the risk of them becoming victims of human trafficking", they call for a ban on remuneration to players' agents related to the transfer of minors.
Although in some sports disciplines, agents' activities are already extensively regulated by sporting bodies internationally and nationally, very few EU Member States have specific laws on sports agents.
Licensing system
MEPs therefore call for an EU initiative to set "strict standards and examination criteria before anyone could operate as a players' agent", ensure transparency in agents' transactions and introduce an EU-wide licensing system and register for players' agents. They nonetheless acknowledge that doing away with the existing FIFA licence system without setting up a robust alternative would not be appropriate.
