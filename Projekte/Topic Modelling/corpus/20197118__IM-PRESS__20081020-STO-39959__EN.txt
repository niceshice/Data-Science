08 LUX Prize
Parliament hosted the award ceremony for the 2008 LUX prize. Three provocative and moving films went head to head in a bid to claim the coveted prize, which finally went to the Belgian film, "Le Silence de Lorna", which triumphed over Hungarian film "Delta" and the Czech entry "Občan Havel".
During the award ceremony, European Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering said: "Culture has always played a pivotal role for the European Parliament. The award of the second LUX Prize shows this."
He added: "One of the objectives of the prize is to experience cultural and language differences within the EU."
UN envoy stresses need for tolerance
On Wednesday morning the UN's High Representative Jorge Sampaio spoke of the task facing Europeans in bridging social chasms and building similarities on common differences. He opened his speech with a message on behalf of the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon. This year is the European year of intercultural dialogue.
"Europe faces multiple challenges in promoting intercultural dialogue. Migration, economic uncertainty and political tensions are putting strains on relations between different cultural, ethnic and religious groups", he said.
The 69 year old from Lisbon went on to say: "Cross-cultural tolerance, dialogue, respect and understanding must be pillars of the better world we are trying to build."
Mr Sampaio stressed the importance of multilateral understanding and the achievement of common goals. "Cultural diversity has become a major political issue challenging modern democracies, pluralism, citizenship and social cohesion as well as peace and stability among nations."
He also drew upon current situations facing many member states and urged tolerance and understanding by Europe's citizens. "Europe is a place where we can live together as equals and that requires more and more inclusive citizenship and better governance of cultural diversities."
