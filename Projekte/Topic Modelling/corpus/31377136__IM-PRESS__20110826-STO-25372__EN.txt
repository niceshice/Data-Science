Tough sanctions needed to facilitate regime change in Syria Bernardino Le√≥n, the newly appointed EU Special Representative for the Southern Mediterranean Region set out his views on the current situation in the region to a closed session of Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee 31 August. Afterwards he spoke to us.
All eyes are on Libya. The fighting continues and the humanitarian situation is grave. How can the EU help?
Europe has to take the lead in Libya and Europe is aware that the international community is expecting this. The first step is providing basic services like water, electricity, fuel, medicine. Providing security and economic reconstruction will also be very important, as will recovering assets from abroad, which seem to be in many different places because of the actions of the former regime and particularly Gaddafi. We will also have to contribute to building a government in a post-conflict Libya.
How can a country with no real tradition of political culture make the transition?
If Libya ever had institutions, the Gaddafi regime completely destroyed them. The Jamahiriya system, which translates as direct government by the people, was an empty slogan. In fact it was a dictatorship where one person made all decisions. The challenge in Libya will be to build institutions involving the citizens.
What's next in Egypt and Tunisia and what do you expect in Syria?
In Egypt and Tunisia all the political forces and actors are working on paving the way for the elections by building consensus. The second step will be organising and contributing to the success of the elections, after which constituent assemblies can be formed. The success of the new constitutions will be the success of the transition. The authorities in these countries are doing a great job, but the international community and the EU need to be ready to help if requested. In Syria the most important thing right now is that by applying tough sanctions we facilitate a regime change.
What role should religion play in politics in these countries in the future?
Religion plays an important role in these countries and it is possible to acknowledge this in a constitution but not through a direct link between religion and state. Some Islamist interlocutors also share this view and this is a positive sign.
Economic discontent was a factor in the Arab spring so development will be important in safeguarding the results of the transition. How can we help?
The EU has not only appointed a special representative, it has also created task forces to work with the economic authorities of the countries in the region. The aim is to make our contribution more efficient. The message is "more for more", meaning more trade, more mobility, more financial contribution on our part in exchange for democratic reforms.
