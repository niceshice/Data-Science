MEPs from the EPP, S&D and ALDE groups urged EU Member States to help Italy to deal with the migrant inflow crisis on the Italian island of Lampadusa, and asked Commissioner Malmstr√∂m to activate the solidarity mechanism envisaged in EU Treaty, in a debate on Monday evening. An estimated 22,000 migrants fleeing unrest in north Africa have arrived since January.
A draft European Parliament resolution analysing possible long-term ways to cope with migrants fleeing conflict areas was also debated, and will be put to vote on Tuesday 5 April at noon.
Rapporteur Fiorello Provera (EFD, IT) said his report is "tragically topical" today and hoped the EU will mobilise its resources to help Italy. "No country can deal with this pressure on its own", he said.
