Following the announcement of the death sentences imposed by a Libyan court on the Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor who are accused of having deliberately infected more than 400 children with the Aids virus, the President of the European Parliament, Josep Borrell, issued the following statement:
"The European Parliament has always been categorically opposed to the very idea of the death penalty.
On 30 November 2006, it once again expressed 'continued support for the Bulgarian nurses and Palestinian doctor in custody in Libya since 1999'.
When the appeal is heard by the Supreme Court, I call on the Libyan authorities to reconsider this verdict, which is an obstacle to improved relations between the European Union and Libya."
