Strasbourg, Monday, minutes before the 5pm opening
The possibility of an EU-wide organ donor card was discussed by MEPs on Monday evening. It was amongst a series of measures proposed to tackle a shortage of donors, transplantation risks as well as organ trafficking and tourism. More than 60,000 people across the Union are currently on waiting lists for transplants. Also on Monday's agenda was the European Ombudsman's right to access to information held by EU bodies.
The state of organ donation was raised in an own initiative report by Cypriot MEP Adamos Adamou (GUE/NGL) which will be put to the vote on Tuesday.
The main proposal is a voluntary European organ donor card alongside existing national ones. It also proposes that people can appoint a legal representative to decide on donation after death. The report wants all organs to be exchanged on a "strictly non-commercial basis".
The report notes that many people die before transplants can be carried out and pushes for research that could lead to the growth of organs from existing tissues and cells.
Clarification needed over Ombudsman
In response to a request from the Ombudsman Nikiforos Diamandouros, a report drafted by Finnish Liberal Anneli Jäätteenmäki proposes changes to the statute of the Ombudsman and his staff.
It calls for the EU institutions to clarify the obligation of the body and employees to provide information to the Ombudsman. It also wants to clarify his access to information and confidential documents held by EU bodies, as well as rules on the evidence provided by EU civil servants. The report will be put to the vote Tuesday.
Also on Monday's agenda : Debates on budget priorities for 2009; cross-border cooperation to combat terrorism and cross-border crime: the role of volunteering in contributing to economic and social cohesion.
