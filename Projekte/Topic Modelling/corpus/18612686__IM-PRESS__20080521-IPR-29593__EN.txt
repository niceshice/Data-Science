The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the recent earthquake that hit China, killing tens of thousands of people, expressing its "sincere condolences and solidarity to the people of China and to the numerous victims." MEPs welcome the "prompt response to the disaster by the Chinese authorities by means of their emergency operation," and note "with appreciation China's readiness to accept foreign assistance."
MEPs also welcome "the fact that the Chinese and foreign media are being allowed to provide detailed and accurate information on the disaster." The resolution was adopted with 525 votes in favour, 4 against and 4 abstentions.
Members urge the Council and Commission to provide emergency aid, technical assistance and reconstruction aid through the ECHO programme, and support the contribution which the EU Member States are making through the 'Civil Protection Mechanism', coordinated by the Commission." The House "underlines the importance of good governance in preventing and preparing for possible natural disasters," and "calls for development of the technology for a comprehensive and effective early warning system to prepare populations to cope with earthquakes and other natural disasters."
In the debate, all political groups expressed their sympathies and condolences, calling on the Commission to help with all means possible to ease the humanitarian disaster. Commissioner Louis Michel noted that the EU has contributed over €10 million already, including €2 million for supplies such as tents and blankets which the Chinese authorities have requested.
