European Parliament combats exploitation of women
Women's rights/Equal opportunities
2006-12-05 - 15:22
Efforts to combat violence against women in all its forms, fight trafficking in human beings for sexual exploitation, and help women out of poverty, are in many cases initiated and strongly supported by the European Parliament. Through its plenary resolutions and the work of its Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, it keeps up pressure on governments and EU institutions to improve the lot of all women. More generally, Parliament also seeks to promote equal treatment of women and men. For example, it is instrumental in setting up the European Gender Institute, which will monitor progress in this area.
Every day millions of women around the world are victims of abuse of all kinds: brutality within a relationship or the family, intimidation at work, mental cruelty, sexual abuse or forced prostitution. The European Parliament has for many years been at the forefront of campaigns to stop violence against women - in all its forms.

Zero tolerance for all forms of violence against women
In a resolution of 2 February 2006, Parliament calls for zero tolerance for all forms of violence against women, and stresses its criminal nature. MEPs point out that men's violence against women can affect women of any age, irrespective of education, income or social position. Studies in Sweden, Germany and Finland have shown that at least 30-35 % of women between 16 and 67 have at some time been victims of physical or sexual violence. If psychological violence is included, the proportion of women affected rises to between 45 and 50 %.
In an EP resolution on 10 March 2005, following International Women's Day on 8 March, Parliament recognises that some measures have been taken to combat violence against women. The resolution stresses, however, that there is still a lack of clear political commitment to address and eradicate domestic violence against women, sexual tourism and trafficking in women, including legislative measures, such as asylum rights for victims.
In September 2006, Parliament called at the first reading for €125 million in renewed funding for the EU's DAPHNE programme to support action against violence to women, young people and children in 2007-2013. DAPHNE has funded around 420 projects since 1997. Moves to merge DAPHNE with EU drugs prevention and information programmes were rejected by MEPs on the grounds that these different issues require separate programmes, and that a merger would have reduced DAPHNE's visibility.

Forced prostitution
Over 100,000 women are the victims of trafficking in the EU every year. Many end up in sexual slavery. Strategies to combat trafficking in women, including measures to deal with the supply and demand sides as well as the traffickers, were set out in a European Parliament resolution of 17 January 2006. This resolution calls on the Commission and Council to create a clear legal basis for combating all forms of violence against women. The relevant report notes that individual actions by each Member States are not enough to combat this problem but suggests a holistic and integrated multidisciplinary approach at the EU and international level.
Ahead of the Football World Cup in Germany (9 June-9 July 2006), many organisations called for vigilance to protect women from forced prostitution. For International Women's Day, on 8 March 2006, the EP Committee on Women's Rights therefore chose to highlight problems related to forced prostitution on the fringes of events such as major international sports events, exhibitions and important congresses. Parliament followed this up with a resolution on 15 March 2006 calling for a Europe-wide campaign to inform and educate the public about the scale of the problem and to seek to curb demand by raising awareness among potential clients as well as a prevention campaign targeting potential victims.

Women and poverty
Although the principle that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work is enshrined in the Treaty of Rome, and has often been reiterated since, women are still paid less for the same work. The European Parliament has looked at measures to close the gender pay gap (15 % in EU-25 in 2004) and to fight poverty (in 17 EU Member States the risk of extreme poverty amongst women greatly exceeds that of extreme poverty amongst men) and social exclusion of women. A European Parliament resolution of 14 October 2005 highlights the number of single-parent households (85%) which are headed by women and notes that two thirds of over-65s in the EU are female. Both groups are disproportionately prone to poverty.
In a March 2005 resolution Parliament stresses that empowering women is a "crucial factor" in eradicating poverty and a prerequisite for achieving the EU's "Lisbon" jobs and growth target of 60% of women in the work force by 2010.

Breast cancer
Breast cancer kills one woman in the EU every 6 minutes, or 88,000 women (and 1,000 men) EU-wide every year. It is the most frequent form of cancer among women in the EU, and imposes a heavy burden on its economy and society. Yet success in fighting it varies widely - breast cancer mortality rates vary by over 50% among EU Member States. The European Parliament believes that a woman's chances of surviving breast cancer should depend neither upon her income, nor upon where she lives.
In October 2006 - International Breast Cancer awareness month - Parliament adopted a resolution calling on EU Member States to "introduce nationwide breast screening" whereby all women aged between 50 and 69 will be offered a mammogram in line with EU guidelines at two-year intervals, in order to achieve a significant reduction in deaths from breast cancer. This resolution, which follows up a similar one in 2003, also calls on Member States to introduce nationwide provision of interdisciplinary breast units by 2016 and stepped-up support for research into breast cancer prevention.

Gender equality
Finally the Parliament strongly supports the setting up of a European Institute for Gender Equality (under the procedure for co-decision with the EU Council of Ministers). In December it adopted a second-reading report which will enable this Institute to start work in 2007. The Institute will be based in Vilnius (Lithuania) and will be funded by the European Commission, with a proposed budget of €52.2 million for 2007 to 2013. MEPs wish to make the Institute more effective by sharpening the focus of its work to enable the European Community to effectively promote and implement gender equality policy.
