Depleted uranium has been widely used in modern warfare, both as ammunition against hardened targets in rural and urban environments and as hardened armoured protection against missile and artillery attacks.
There have been serious concerns about the radiological and chemical toxicity of the fine uranium particles produced when such ammunition hits hard targets, and also about the potential contamination of soil and groundwater by expended rounds that have missed their targets and their implications for civilians.
Parliament has already called for a global ban on all types of conventional weaponry containing any form of radioactive material, given its potential harm on human health and the environment. 10:00 12:30 Brussels, Paul-Henri Spaak building, room 4B001 Website of the Subcommittee on Security and Defence Watch webstreaming live Draft programme PERGER István BXL +32 2 28 40924 (BXL) EMAIL +32 498 98 33 30 EMAIL foreign-press@europarl.europa.eu Other events Internal Security Strategy - Interparliamentary Committee meeting with National Parliaments Organised by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the European Parliament's Directorate for Relations with National Parliaments , this interparliamentary committee meeting with national parliaments entitled "Democratic Accountability of the Internal Security Strategy and the role of Europol, Eurojust and Frontex" will focus on the following:
