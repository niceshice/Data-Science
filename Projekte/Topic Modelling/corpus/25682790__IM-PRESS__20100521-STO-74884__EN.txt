German Green MEP Franziska Keller Trade and Agriculture levies can inhibit aid MEP thinks some fishing agreements dubious Ensuring that the European Union doesn't take back (through trade rules or agricultural levies) what it donates in aid is the main aim behind a recent report by Franziska Keller. We spoke to the German Green MEP about her report which was endorsed by fellow MEPs on 18 May. It envisages greater coordination between Parliamentary Committees and a special spokesperson on development coherence.
What is policy coherence and what is its objective?
We want to make development policy more effective. Currently, for instance, we give money to support fish farms and small fishermen in developing countries so they can buy new boats or establish better fish processing facilities.
At the same time we have a fisheries policy which allows large EU fishing boats off the West African coast to empty the fishing grounds. This means that there are no fish left for the local fishermen so there is little point in putting money into the development of local fisheries.
Or, for example, we give money to develop local agriculture, so the farmers in developing countries can cultivate tomatoes. At the same time we subsidise our own agricultural products, which are then exported cheaply, destroying the local market because local farmers simply can not compete with our cheap prices. This is a problem and we wanted to underline it once more in the report. We have given examples of what is going wrong and what we can do about it. It's not about bad intentions, we lack mechanisms to check these things, and we have no prior impact assessment for the developing countries.
What do you foresee to reach the objectives?
We propose an impact assessment whenever an area affects developing countries. Within the European External Action Service, development policies should be strengthened.
We are not only looking at what governments or the European Commission are doing wrong, we are also looking at ourselves - for example what can we improve within the Parliament? The Parliamentary Committees should work better together and we'd like to set up a permanent rapporteur, who would be a watchdog for policy-coherence, safeguarding the interests of development.
Are you happy with the outcome?
There were amendments in committee. We ( the Green Group in the European Parliament ) proposed for example that the European Ombudsman should be able to deal with complaints on maladministration in the developing countries. If the Commission authorized the sale of milk powder at dumping prices on the market in Ghana, NGOs and private persons could have complained if it had been against the objectives of policy-coherence.
Unfortunately, it was not accepted. Apart from that, we are happy with the vote in committee and Tuesday in plenary.
