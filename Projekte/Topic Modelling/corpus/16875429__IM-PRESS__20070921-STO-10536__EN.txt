The way ahead for rail?
The second September plenary began with a report on energy and three on railways. Before the debates, President Hans-Gert Pöttering expressed Parliament's "solidarity and sympathy" with the people of Burma, who are demonstrating against the military government there. Outside the sitting, the shortlist of three finalists for the 2007 Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought was announced.
Mr Pöttering opened the session by commemorating former British MEP (1979-2003) and human rights campaigner Lord (Nicolas) Bethell who died recently. The President asked for a minute of silence for Lord Bethell, who played a leading part in creating the Sakharov Prize, and for two Spanish soldiers killed in Afghanistan on Monday.
The House agreed to debate the situation in Burma on Wednesday.
"Strong political will needed"
The first debate was on a report on renewable energy that calls on the Commission to present a proposal for a renewable energy legislative framework before the end of the year. During the March 2007 European summit, member states set a binding target to produce 20% of all the energy consumed in EU from renewable sources by 2020.
The rapporteur, Danish Socialist Britta Thomsen, underlined the need for a common energy policy. "We must achieve security of supply, a reduction of CO2 emissions and the creation of new jobs by means of green energy." Zbigniew Kuźmiuk (PL, UEN) criticized the EU for "not having a common energy policy."
Ms Thomsen also said "we need to see biofuels as part of renewable energy. The EP must provide a signal to Member States that it is serious about this type of energy." Willem Schuth (DE, ALDE) said "Bio energy is likely to have a primary role in the energy discussion but should not lead to distortion of competition. Biofuels from third countries if imported must follow stringent criteria." However, David Hammerstein (ES, Greens) was concerned that biofuel use could lead to negative consequences for poor countries: "Our desire for biofuels could endanger world food supplies. We have to ask ourselves: should we eat or should we drive ? "
Pilar Ayuso (ES, EPP-ED) said "Our group agrees new investments in the sector are needed in order to make new energy compatible with old forms of energy." These goals should be reached at national level, "we call upon Member States to achieve this by investing in and the better use off renewable energies."
Third Railway Package
MEPs then turned their attention to three agreements about the development of the Community's railways: opening up the market, a European licence for train drivers and the rights of rail passengers.
EU Transport Commissioner Jacques Barrot said Monday in Paris that there will be efforts next year to develop railways for the transport of goods in order to fight global warning.
Sakharov Shortlist
The three finalists for this year's Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought are: Sudanese human rights attorney Salih Mahmoud Osman, deceased Russian journalist and human rights activist Anna Politkovskaya and Chinese human rights defenders Zeng Jinyan and Hu Jia. The political group leaders will pick the winner on October 25. The award ceremony will take place in Strasbourg on 11 December . The shortlist was announced during a joint meeting of the Foreign Affairs and Development Committee.
