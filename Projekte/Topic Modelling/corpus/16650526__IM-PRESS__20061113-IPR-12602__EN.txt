Highlights of the week
The centrepiece of the Strasbourg November plenary is Parliament's second-reading of the Services Directive . Following the Council's decision to follow to a wide extent Parliament's position in first reading, MEPs are likely to approve the common position with little or no change. Nevertheless, Parliament is expected to receive a written declaration from the Commission to provide answers to what the rapporteur Evelyne GEBHARDT (PES, DE) regards as key questions: the legal scope and nature of the guidelines to be presented by the Commission to the Member States, the possibility of future harmonisation of legislation governing the provision of services, the neutrality of the Services Directive vis-Ã -vis labour legislation and the influence of the directive on the provision of social services. Other highlights include formal addresses by the President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia and by the Emir of Qatar - Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani . The House will also debate the dangers of mercury . The Environment Committee will recommend at first reading that Parliament approve a draft directive outlawing the sale of certain measuring devices containing mercury. However, in its amendments, the committee calls for exemptions for traditional barometers and instruments held in museum collections or put up for sale in the antiques market. Hubert WEBER , the President of the Court of Auditors, the independent EU institution which monitors EU spending, will present the Court's annual report for 2005 on the management of the EU budget to MEPs . This plenary debate comes after the publication of the annual report already presented to the Budgetary Control Committee. The House will also debate the Commission's work programme for 2007 . The vote will take place in December. Monday 13 November The session starts off with the 2006 annual report on the euro area. This is the first report of its kind. Parliament will also debate changes to payment systems under the CAP . The Agriculture Committee, will be recommending that Parliament reject the Commission proposal on laying down rules for voluntary modulation of direct payments, establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers. Away from the plenary, the Culture and Media Committee will vote on the revision of the Television Without Frontiers Directive . Tuesday 14 November Tuesday starts off with Hubert WEBER, the President of the Court of Auditors, the independent EU institution which monitors EU spending, presenting the Court's annual report for 2005 to MEPs on the management of the EU budget.

MEPs will turn their attention to measuring devices containing mercury . The Environment Committee will recommend at first reading that Parliament approve a draft directive outlawing the sale of certain measuring devices containing mercury. However, MEPs want to introduce exemptions for antique instruments. John PURVIS (EPP-ED, UK) will be putting forward a report on mortgage credit which reacts to the Commission Green Paper on opening up the mortgage markets. The report says that any EU level action should aim principally at directly improving the situation for the public, notably by widening access to mortgages, for example to people with fixed term contracts. The House will also debate the issue of gambling and sports betting in the internal market. Arlene McCARTHY (PES, UK), Chair of the Internal Market Committee, will be asking the Commission questions on gambling and sports betting in the internal market.

Wednesday 15 November The key debate of the week takes place on Wednesday morning with MEPs debating the Services Directive . Apart from a few details, the Council text reflects the one adopted by Parliament at first reading. However, the Commission is still expected to give further clarifications. If the Parliament approves the common position, then the earliest the legislation can be implemented would be December 2009. At midday, th e Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani will address the House in a formal sitting.

Parliament will then debate the Commission's White Paper on a European communication policy . The White Paper is one of the Commission's initiatives aimed at improving the EU's interaction with its citizens following the 'no' votes in referendums on the proposed EU constitution in France and the Netherlands. MEPs in the committee say that to reach citizens it was important to communicate better and to show the relevance of EU decisions on their daily life.
