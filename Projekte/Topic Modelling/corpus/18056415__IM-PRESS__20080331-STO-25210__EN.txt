MEPs held a question and answer session with prospective health Commissioner Androula Vassiliou Tuesday to assess her suitability and qualifications. It was also an opportunity for MEPs on the Environment, Agriculture, Internal Market and Employment Committees to gauge her political views and sentiments. Ms Vassiliou stressed her legal and Parliamentary qualifications for the position.
A new Commissioner is needed following the resignation of fellow Cypriot Markos Kyprianou, who left to take up the post of foreign minister in the new Cypriot government. Ms Vassiliou was nominated by the Cypriot government and the Council of the European Union has already given its support to her nomination.
Ms Vassiliou told MEPs that she intends to put to good use the experience she acquired in her 20 years of law practice which she thinks "will be valuable in treating the complex and plentiful legal issues of the health portfolio". She also noted that 10 years of parliamentary experience has taught her "how to be a responsible and accountable politician".
Ms Vassiliou was asked questions indirectly and directly related to her portfolio. When one MEP declared himself disappointed by her answer (on tobacco), her answer "it would be an impossible task for me to please everybody" was applauded by some MEPs. After three rounds of questions, Ms Vassiliou held a press conference.
The EP will vote on whether to endorse the Commissioner designate during the 9-10 April Brussels plenary session. If all goes well , Ms Vassiliou will be in office until the appointment of a new Commission after the June 2009 European Parliament elections.
