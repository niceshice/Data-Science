After 8 years of incarceration the medics are free
In a statement released today Hans-Gert Pöttering, the President of the European Parliament, welcomed the decision of the Libyan authorities to release the five Bulgarian nurses and a doctor. President Pöttering stated that "the European Parliament welcomes the release of the six detained Bulgarians, who today were freed to return to Europe and their homeland. We are particularly pleased that a solution has been found to this legal ordeal for those concerned and their families".
He added that "for the five Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor, who meanwhile received Bulgarian nationality, almost nine years of imprisonment ended today".
He went on to say "we consider the decision of the Libyan authorities as a positive signal. The European Parliament thanks all those, in particular EU External Affairs Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner, who worked tirelessly and, in the end, successfully for the release of the six Bulgarians and for the care of the infected children".
The European Parliament had repeatedly called on the Libyan authorities to release the Bulgarian nurses and the doctor. The President of the European Parliament met with the relatives of the nurses in April this year. In addition, Parliament asked the European Commission and the Member States for political and diplomatic support for the liberation of these Europeans. Their story has now reached a happy conclusion.
