The European Parliament is back in business This autumn sees the first "term" for newly elected MEPs with 6 plenary parliamentary sessions being held between now and Christmas. MEPs will also vote on the candidacy of Commission President Barroso as well as approving the entire new Commission. A poll in Ireland on the Lisbon treaty and the Copenhagen climate summit will also hold MEPs attention. This article looks at some of the issues that will dominate the European news over the coming months.
Ireland votes on Lisbon - again
The revamped Lisbon treaty will be put to a vote in Ireland on 2 October in what is seen as the crucial final hurdle before ratification. A "yes" vote would see the treaty come into force on 1 January.
If the vote is yes then the Sweden, the holders of the EU presidency, will have the tricky task of gaining consensus around who will be nominated for the two key posts the treaty will create - the EU President and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy . If adopted the treaty will also give the European Parliament a raft of new legislative powers.
Barroso vote and "job interviews" for new Commissioners
One man this autumn waiting to hear about his job will be European Commission President Jos√© Manuel Barroso. He needs a confirmation vote in Parliament before he can take up his second 5 year mandate.
If re-appointed he will then have to allocate portfolios to the people nominated by national capitals. Prior to taking up office these Commissioners-designate face tough Q&A "job interviews" with MEPs on their opinions, suitability and skills for their allotted posts. Although no date has yet been set for the hearings, late October or early November would seem the most likely dates.
Given that most governments in Europe are of the centre right and that the centre right European People's Party dominate the European Parliament, then we could expect the European Commission to have a centre right persuasion.
Copenhagen: Agreement on low-carbon economy?
At the UN Climate Change conference in Copenhagen in December world leaders will have to grapple with the task of agreeing a post-Kyoto protocol deal on limiting CO2 emissions. The European Union has already adopted legislation that commits itself to a 20% cut in CO2 compared to 1990 levels as well as 20% more efficiency in energy usage added to a 20% share for renewables in final energy consumption. If a meaningful agreement is to be reached in the Danish capital, then the world's largest emitters of C02 - the US and China - must sign up to CO2 cuts.
Reform of EU asylum policy: new MEPs will pick up the baton
In May MEPs from the outgoing parliament approved steps to improve the way the European Union's asylum policy works through legal rights for migrants and more solidarity between the 27 members.
In July the Swedish Presidency launched the "Stockholm Programme" which aims to set out cooperation in areas such as policing, judiciary, visas and immigration cooperation over the next five years. Part of that is a call for countries to show greater solidarity and share the burden of immigration as states like Malta, Spain and Italy are receiving huge amounts of immigrants from Africa, whereas many other Member States are not.
Swedish immigration Minister Tobias Billstroem has said that he would like to unveil proposals this September - expected to include the potentially controversial policy of re-distributing refugees and asylum seekers among the 27 members. Given the sensitivity of the issue, lively debates on the proposals among MEPs can be expected when they are submitted to Parliament later this year.
