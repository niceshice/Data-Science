2008-03-06 - 09:58
Selected highlights of the Strasbourg plenary session 10-13 March 2008:
50th anniversary of the European Parliament
European Institute of Technology to get the green light?
Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves to address the House
€162.4m for the UK from EU Solidarity Fund following floods last year
11 March - European Day against terrorism
Sky marshals on board planes - legislation to be approved
Reform and health check of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)
Preparations for the European Council on jobs and growth
Commission's annual policy strategy for 2009
Monday 10 March 2008
EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering will make a statement on the situation in Gaza as the first point, followed by statements from the political groups.
Parliament will then debate, after a statement from the Commission, the bilateral agreements being negotiated between certain Member States and the United States on visas and passenger name records (PNR). The House will also debate data protection and consumer rights .
The session continues with a debate on a conciliation agreement on common rules in the field of civil aviation security. Parliament will vote on a new regulation that aims to ensure a high level of aviation security throughout the EU. It lays down common rules and standards, such as screening of passengers and cabin baggage, access control or aircraft security checks. The regulation also deals with in-flight-security measures, such as the deployment of "sky marshals" or the carriage of weapons on board an aircraft.
The House will debate and vote on reports from the Budgets Committee on the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund for an amount of €162.4 million in commitment and payment appropriations, relating to the major storms in the United Kingdom in June and July 2007. The grant will go towards reimbursing part of the cost of emergency measures such as rescue services, cleaning up after flood damage, and restoring basic infrastructure.
Tuesday 11 March 2008
EP President Pöttering will open the debate on Tuesday by marking 11 March, four years after the Madrid bombings, on the European day against terrorism .
Tuesday starts with a debate on the Commission's annual policy strategy for 2009. The vote will be held at a later part-session. The strategy outlines the Commission's policy objectives in five priority areas: growth and jobs, climate change and sustainable Europe, making a reality of the common immigration policy, putting the citizen first, and Europe as a world partner.
Parliament will then debate a legislative report on establishing the European institute of Innovation and Technology. (EIT) The EIT will be able to start operating this summer if the Council's common position on establishing the institute is officially approved by the European Parliament.
At midday on Tuesday, Estonian President (and former MEP) Toomas Hendrik Ilves will address Parliament at a formal sitting of the House, just weeks after the 90th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of Estonia (24 February 2008).
Parliament will also tackle two non-binding reports from the Agriculture Committee. The first is on national quotas for milk . As consumers complain about the rising price of milk, Parliament is being consulted on legislation drafted by the Commission which would allow Member States to increase dairy quotas by 2% on a voluntary basis from 1 April 2008, thereby expanding supplies.
The second is on the Commission health check on the CAP . The committee recommends broad approval of the proposals, although it has reservations about certain points, including the amount of funds to be switched from the "first pillar" of the CAP (market support) to the "second pillar" (rural development) as well as the capping of direct aid.
The House will then debate sustainable agriculture and biogas . The report stresses that, in the long term, renewable energy sources such as biogas and biofuels, together with solar power and wind energy subject to further intensified research efforts, can bring about a higher degree of independence from fossil-fuel energy sources.
Wednesday 12 March 2008
The key debate is on the forthcoming Spring European Council 13-14 March 2008 . The two-day meeting of EU Heads of State or Government begins on Thursday, and as usual for the Spring Summit, it is mainly devoted to economic issues. As usual the summit will begin with an address from the EP President, Hans-Gert Pöttering , followed by a discussion.
At 3pm on Wednesday, the Chamber in Strasbourg will play host to a special ceremony to mark the 50th anniversary of the European Parliament . The President of the European Parliament Hans-Gert Pöttering, President of the Council - Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Janša and Commission President José Manuel Barroso will address the House. The European Union Youth Orchestra will perform for Parliament. For the record, the European Parliamentary Assembly first met for its constituent meeting in Strasbourg on 19 March 1958.
Later on Wednesday, the House will debate the EU's role in Iraq . MEPs will vote on a report that urges greater EU involvement in Iraq, increased transparency and efficiency of EU aid and more support for the United Nations' efforts in the country. The suggestions are part of a recommendation to the Council on the EU's role in Iraq, contained in an own-initiative report drafted for the Foreign Affairs Committee.
MEPs will hold a debate with the Commission and Council on the situation in Chad , where EU troops have been dispatched under a UN mandate to protect refugees who are fleeing over the border from Darfur, Sudan. The operation's overall commander, Lieutenant-General Patrick Nash , is Irish. Ireland has committed 400-plus troops to the mission.
On Wednesday evening, the House will debate international financial reporting standards. The International Accounting Standards Board (IFRS) lacks transparency, legitimacy and accountability. It is not under the control of any democratically elected parliament or government says a report from the Economics Committee.
In the evening, MEPs then tackle a legislative report from Neena GILL (West Midlands, Labour, PES, UK) on enhancing the quality of life of older people . Helping older people to stay healthier and to live independently for longer is the aim of a new research programme on "Ambient Assisted Living" (AAL). It will develop new information and communication technology (ICT), to enable more elderly people to access public services more easily, but these services must nonetheless respect their privacy and dignity, say MEPs in the Industry Committee. There is now a first-reading agreement with Council .
On the subject of women in prison , MEPs highlight the situation of female prisoners, a minority of the prison population but a fast-growing one. The report focuses on prison conditions, the preservation of family ties and reintegration into society and the workplace.
Thursday 13 March 2008
Thursday is dedicated to development issues with debates and votes on the challenges of the EU development cooperation policy for the new Member States, and gender equality and women empowerment in development cooperation.
As usual the session ends with debates and votes on human rights issues in the world , on this occasion, the two topics are: Afghanistan and Armenia .

50 years of the European Parliament - evolution, powers, policies, presidents and elections
2008-03-06 - 09:58
The European Parliament will be celebrating its 50th anniversary on 12 March 2008 at 3pm. The President of the European Parliament Hans-Gert Pöttering, President of the Council, Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Janša and Commission President José Manuel Barroso will address the House. The European Union Youth Orchestra will give a performance in Parliament. Speakers of national parliaments (EU-27), former EP Presidents and former EP Secretaries-General have all been invited.
This background note details the evolution of what was the European Assembly of 142 nominated Members with just four official languages and is now the directly elected European Parliament, with Members speaking 23 languages.
The European Parliamentary Assembly met for its constituent meeting in Strasbourg on 19 March 1958 with simple consultative powers.
The European Parliament of 2008 has wide decision-making powers on legislation, the budget and control and scrutiny of the European Commission. In fact, the European Parliament is unique in the world. There is no other directly elected supra-national parliament with such wide-ranging power.
Once and if the Lisbon Treaty is ratified, the European Parliament, following the elections in June 2009, will be composed of 751 MEPs with its powers once more enlarged.
Specifically, this background note (link below) highlights and recalls, over the last 50 years, key legislation adopted by the European Parliament, increases in its powers, dates of past European elections and elections of Parliament's Presidents, as well as the increase and evolution in the number of both MEPs and languages. There is also a list of EP Sakharov Prize-winners, an annual award for freedom of thought. Formal sitting - Celebration of the European Parliament's fiftieth anniversary

Commission Annual Policy Strategy 2009
2008-03-06 - 09:58
MEPs will debate the Commission's annual policy strategy for 2009 after hearing a statement from the Commission. The vote will be held at a later part-session. The strategy outlines the Commission's policy objectives in five priority areas: growth and jobs, climate change and sustainable Europe, making a reality of the common immigration policy, putting the citizen first, and Europe as a world partner. The Commission will seek to gain approval for its legislative initiatives and also look forward by stimulating debate on the internal market, social agenda and budget reviews.
During 2009, the Commission will maintain its focus on delivering results for the benefit of citizens and businesses. Growth and jobs remain a major policy priority for the Union, backed up by further efforts to tackle climate change and to meet the energy needs of the Union. The Commission will follow up on the Single Market review, the revised Social Agenda and also look forward to laying the foundations for the years ahead. One of the main highlights will be the work on the budget review, based on the consultation now underway, which will pave the way for the preparation of the next financial perspectives.
The development of a common immigration policy will be a fundamental priority in order to meet the challenges and harness the opportunities provided by migration in an era of globalisation. Initiatives will be put forward to simplify the life of citizens and ensure their security. Negotiations with candidate countries will be pursued on the basis of the renewed consensus on enlargement. Work to develop closer political and economic ties with partners around the world will continue to intensify, and new partnerships with African countries will be implemented in the context of the Africa/EU strategy. The Commission will also continue to deliver on its better regulation agenda, to focus on the proper enforcement of EU legislation and to ensure the sound management of financial programmes.
2009 will be an important year for the European Union, marked by the possible entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, a new European Parliament and a new European Commission.
In addition to the Commission's policy priorities to be taken forward in 2009, the Annual Policy Strategy proposes an allocation of human and financial resources to reinforce the Commission's ability to deliver in priority areas. The Annual Policy Strategy also identifies the main communication priorities for 2009. The Commission will give specific focus in 2009 to the new possibilities and benefits offered by the Treaty of Lisbon to the citizens of the Union (subject to its entry into force), the review of the EU budget, growth and jobs presented in the perspective of citizens' concerns, and energy and climate change.

European Council
Parliament prepares for the Spring Summit
2008-03-06 - 09:58
On Wednesday, MEPs will debate plans for the next European Council session with the Commission and Council. The two-day meeting of EU Heads of State or Government begins on Thursday, and as usual for the Spring Summit it is mainly devoted to economic issues. The summit will begin with an address from the EP President, Hans-Gert Pöttering , followed by a discussion.
Agenda of the summit
After that, according to the Slovenian Council Presidency, the European Council will launch the new cycle of the Lisbon Strategy, covering the period 2008-2010. In particular, it will be invited to confirm that the current Integrated Guidelines remain valid for the period 2008-2010, to endorse the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and the country specific Integrated Recommendations and to adopt conclusions on the Employment Guidelines. Financial markets will also be a topic for discussion by the European Council.
Heads of State or Government will discuss the climate change and energy package with a view to agreeing on key principles and guidelines for future work. They will discuss the external aspects of the Union's climate change policy, notably as regards the follow up to the Bali Conference. They will also address the impact of climate change on security in the light of the report from the SG/HR and the Commission. The European Council will, furthermore, take stock of progress as concerns the liberalisation of the energy markets.
Parliament’s position on the EU economy and the Lisbon Strategy
At the February plenary session, MEPs adopted a report on the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines, and a resolution on the Lisbon Strategy. They say sound economic policies would help to restore confidence following the financial market turmoil. They recommended a series of measures to boost Europe’s long-term growth potential in what is a wide-ranging assessment of EU economic policy.

Common rules for safeguarding civil aviation - sky marshals
2008-03-06 - 09:58
On Tuesday (11 March) Parliament will vote on a new regulation that aims to ensure a high level of aviation security throughout the EU. It lays down common rules and standards, such as screening of passengers and cabin baggage, access control and aircraft security checks. The regulation also deals with in-flight-security measures, such as the deployment of "sky marshals" and the carriage of weapons on board an aircraft. European Parliament and Council representatives were able to strike a deal in conciliation on civil aviation security beginning of January after long and extensive negotiations. Paolo COSTA (ALDE, IT), Chairman on the Transport Committee and rapporteur on the new regulation, welcomed the agreement. "The necessity of new security measures that are implemented quickly and effectively is undoubted. I am glad that we found an agreement which will increase security and balance measures of antiterrorism and the rights of passengers", Mr Costa said. He also stressed, that the principles of the financing and transparency will be addressed in an upcoming report by the European Commission, which will "safeguard undistorted competition between airports and air carriers".
Security programmes at national airport and air carrier level
Common basic security standards include, inter alia , screening of passengers and cabin baggage, access control, screening of hold baggage, aircraft security checks, security controls for cargo and mail, staff recruitment and training as well as patrols and other physical controls.
Security programmes at national airport and air carrier level shall assure that the common rules are applied and maintained.
Member States are free to apply more stringent measures. However, those measures must be "relevant, objective, non-discriminatory and proportional" to the risk that is being addressed.
Sky marshals
For the first time, in-flight security measures such as access to the cockpit, unruly passengers and in-flight security officers ('sky marshals') are addressed at European level.
The new regulation doesn't oblige Member States to deploy in-flight security officers. Each Member State retains the competence to do or not to do so.
Parliament and Council agreed that those Member States that decide to deploy sky marshals must ensure that they are "specially selected and trained". Strict rules concerning sky marshals were a crucial point for Parliament at the first and second readings.
As regards the carriage of weapons, those must not be carried on board an aircraft (with the exception of those carried in the hold), unless the required security conditions in accordance with national laws have been fulfilled and authorisation has been given by the States involved.
Financing security measures
Each Member State determines the shares of the cost of security measures to be borne respectively by the state, the airport entities, air carriers, other responsible agencies or users. Additionally, the Commission will, no later than 31 December 2008, present a report which will consider what steps need to be taken in order to ensure that security charges are used exclusively to meet security costs, and to "improve the transparency of such charges". If appropriate, this report will be accompanied by a legislative proposal.
According to Mr Costa, modern-day transport security activities are an answer both to a “private (passenger) fear” and to a “public concern”. It is virtually impossible not to burden the passenger. But, at the same time, Mr Costa underlined, it would have been unfair to keep governments away from any financial responsibility in the matter and to burden all citizens without any distinction between users and not users.
One-stop security checks
Passengers and/or their baggage arriving on flights from third countries that have aviation security standards equivalent to the EU law need not be re-screened. Therefore, agreements between the EU and third countries, which recognise that the security standards applied in the third country are equivalent to the EU standards, should be encouraged.
Entry into force
The regulation enters into force on the twentieth day after publication in the Official Journal and will be applied not later than 24 months after this date.

Sustainable European Transport Policy
2008-03-06 - 09:58
The Committee on Transport and Tourism is proposing an own-initiative report drawn up by Gabriele ALBERTINI (EPP-ED, IT) on sustainable European transport policy, taking into account European energy and environment policies. The report points to the importance of the transport sector for employment, growth, and innovation, and considers safe and affordable guaranteed mobility to be a sine qua non of our lifestyle.
To achieve the aim of making European transport sustainable in energy and environmental terms, MEPs consider it necessary to combine different policies with the involvement of more and more stakeholders representing the transport sector, government and citizens. This combination of measures should encompass the following in particular:
(a) technological developments (measures to increase energy efficiency; new standards/regulations for engines and fuels, use of new technologies and alternative fuels);
(b) market-based instruments (charges/fares based on environmental impact or congestion, tax incentives, Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) allowing for the specific features of the different modes of transport); and
(c) flanking measures to enable means of transport and infrastructure to be used as efficiently as possible.
The report maintains that the EU and the Member States need to focus their efforts on the key elements of the system, namely congested large cities and urban areas, the main European intercity corridors and environmentally sensitive areas.
The Council and the Member States are called upon to step up their investment in infrastructure and Intelligent Transport Systems (ITSs), in particular with a view to:
(a) completing the trans-European network priority projects as soon as possible;
(b) tackling congestion in urban areas and along corridors in sensitive areas; and
(c) improving intermodal transport.
MEPs in the committee urge the Commission to submit by June 2008 at the latest, a comprehensible, transparent, generally applicable model for assessing the external costs of all modes of transport, on which to base future calculation of the charges to be paid for the use of infrastructure.
Congestion charges
The committee considers it essential to focus on technological innovation, better exploitation of existing infrastructure, especially by means of demand management measures (congestion charges and road pricing), and innovative solutions for the optimum integration of urban freight flows; and, lastly, new ways to optimise the use of private cars such as car-sharing, carpooling and arrangements for working at home. The committee estimate that urban traffic generates 40% of CO 2 emissions and 70% of other pollutant emissions from vehicles and whereas road congestion, concentrated mainly in the big cities, entails a cost to the EU equivalent to about 1% of GDP.
Urban mobility: According to MEPs in the committee, the problem of urban congestion needs to be tackled by applying a Europe-wide cooperation and coordination strategy. The report calls on the Commission and the Member States to analyse the way in which transport infrastructure and the tariffs applied to it influence urban development and future demand for transport services. In this context, MEPs believe it is necessary to invest in technological innovation, better exploitation of existing infrastructure (e.g. congestion charges and road pricing) and new ways to optimise the use of private cars such as car-sharing, carpooling and arrangements for working at home.
Rail transport: emphasising that this is the mode of transport which consumes the least energy and produces the lowest level of CO2 emissions, MEPs call on the Commission, the Member States, and the rail industry to:
(a) complete a single European railway area or rail market as soon as possible;
(b) with that end in view, eliminate the technical obstacles and move towards a single European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) and interoperable solutions; and
(c) improve freight and passenger transport services and the quality of service.
Civil aviation: although airlines have cut their fuel consumption per passenger-kilometre in the last ten years, the overall environmental impact of civil aviation has risen on account of the substantial expansion in traffic. Therefore, MEPs call for:
(a) air transport to be included in the ETS;
(b) emissions-based differential take-off and landing charges at airports;
(c) the establishment of the'Clean Sky a Joint Technology Initiative' that aims at reducing CO2 and NOx emissions and noise pollution;
(d) the creation of a real Single European Sky;
(e) practical steps to relieve airport congestion; and
(f) the improvement of access to airports by rail.
Shipping: given the fact that emissions from shipping are continuing to increase, the report recommends that:
(a) CO2, SO2, nitrogen oxide, and other emissions from ships be reduced;
(b) the use of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power be encouraged;
(c) vessels that come to anchor be fuelled from land-based sources;
(d) the use of emission allowance trading to contain emissions be treated as a possibility deserving careful consideration;
(e) an integrated European rivers policy be agreed. Rapporteur Gabriele ALBERTINI EPP-ED IT A6-0014/2008 Sustainable European transport policy, taking into account European energy and environment policies Procedure : own-initiative

New technologies for active ageing and longer independent living
2008-03-06 - 09:58
Helping older people to stay healthier and to live independently for longer is the aim of a new research programme on "Ambient Assisted Living" (AAL) says the co-decision report by Neena GILL (PES, UK). It will develop new information and communication technology (ICT), to enable more elderly people to access public services more easily, but these services must nonetheless respect their privacy and dignity, say MEPs in the Industry Committee. There is now a first-reading deal with Council on the programme.
As the baby-boom generation retires, the number of people aged 65 and older will rise by nearly 40% between 2010 and 2030 (European Commission estimate). But "innovative solutions are emerging to help counteract problems related to memory, vision, hearing, mobility, loss of independence which are more prevalent with age", noted EP rapporteur Neena GILL (PES, UK), adding that since "Ageing is a global phenomenon, a strong base of ICT-enabled solutions in Europe could be the start of export opportunities worldwide".
UK and Ireland taking party in the programme
In implementing the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (2007 to 2013), the Community makes a financial contribution to the Ambient Assisted Living research and development programme (hereinafter referred to as "the AAL Joint Programme") undertaken jointly by Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom (hereinafter referred to as "the participating Member States") as well as Israel, Norway and Switzerland.
Respect privacy and dignity
MEPs in the committee add several criteria that the AAL programme should taken into account when selecting projects. The new technology must be adapted to the needs of older people, such as so-called "smart homes", but at the same time, services must respect their privacy and dignity.
In order to support (near) market-ready products and services, every project should be co-financed by the private sector, and especially by small and medium-sized enterprises, says another criterion added by the committee.
Equitable access for all through cost-effective solutions
The AAL programme will aim to develop cost-effective solutions that facilitate equitable and simplified access to new products services across Europe, but especially for older people in rural and peripheral areas.
MEPs in the committee propose that AAL funding be used inter alia for "conversion projects" that transform former military or industrial installations into housing projects adapted for older people.
EU to invest €150 million
The Seventh Research Framework Programme will co-finance the AAL programme to the sum of €150 million for 2008-2013. To ensure success, participating countries should jointly contribute at least the same or possibly a higher amount, says the text. Each participating country is expected to allocate at least 20% of its national research funding to AAL-related activities. MEPs say that if the programme is implemented inadequately, partially or late, the Community will reduce or terminate its financial contribution. This participation should be subject to a minimum financial contribution commensurate with the potential demand from the various national research communities and should normally be at least €0.2 million for the participation
The amended proposal also emphasises that overlaps with existing national and other Community programmes should be avoided.
Entry into force
This Decision enters into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

Budget
€162.4m for the UK in EU Solidarity Fund following floods last summer
2008-03-06 - 09:58
The House will debate and vote on reports from the Budgets Committee on the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund for an amount of €162.4 million in commitment and payment appropriations, relating to the major storms in the United Kingdom in June and July 2007. The grant will go towards reimbursing part of the cost of emergency measures such as rescue services, cleaning up after flood damage, and restoring basic infrastructure. Unusually heavy rainfall in June and July 2007 caused disastrous floods in several UK regions, resulting in severe damage to infrastructure, businesses and private households. Direct damage is estimated to amount to over €4.6 billion, the third highest total caused by a natural disaster since the EU Solidarity Fund was launched in 2002. This is the first application from the UK for financial assistance after a major natural disaster.
The UK application indicates the regions that were affected by the floods. These are: East Midlands, West Midlands, Yorkshire/Humber, South West England, Wales, Northern Ireland. Projects from all of these regions would be eligible for a share of the funding.
Richard CORBETT (Yorkshire and the Humber, Labour, PES, UK) said: " Large parts of Yorkshire and the Humber were affected terribly by the floods and I’m confident our region will receive its fair share of the money. As I understand it, Britain will receive the second largest payment made since the Solidarity Fund was created, with the money going towards paying for the emergency operations that followed the flooding like providing shelter and restoring essential utilities."
The amount of damage and the aid proposed by the Commission is summarised as follows:

EP to give green light for European Institute of Innovation and Technology
2008-03-06 - 09:58
The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) will be able to start operating this summer, if the Council's common position on its establishment is officially approved by the European Parliament. Parliament will debate and take its final vote on the text, already agreed in informal negotiations beforehand. The Industry Committee voted by large majority against an amendment to reject the Council Common Position. The common position was reached after negotiations with the Parliaments' rapporteur Reino Paasilinna (PES, FI), who was satisfied with the compromise, which took on board most of the points raised by Parliament in first reading.
"The agreement with Council represents a success for Parliament", said Mr Paasilinna, adding that "the compromise stresses the role of innovation. Innovation is where we really have to catch up: too often, our brilliant students and researchers do not reap the rewards of their work simply because there is no one to help them turn research results into commercial products."
"Knowledge and Innovation Communities" of universities, research organisations and businesses
The EIT will have a two-tier structure, in which a Governing Board selects higher education institutions, research organisations, companies and other stakeholders to form autonomous partnerships called "Knowledge and Innovation Communities" (KICs). Every KIC should consist of at least three partner organisations, situated in at least two different Member States and including at least one higher education institution and one private company. Universities which take part in a KIC are encouraged to add an EIT label to the degrees and diplomas they awarded.
First KICs on climate change, renewable energy and next-generation ICTs
Within eighteen months after the EIT is established, a first set of two or three KICs will be selected "in areas that help the European Union to face current and future challenges", such as climate change, renewable energy and the next generation of information and communication technologies.
Further KICs will then be selected after the adoption of the first "Strategic Innovation Agenda" (SIA), which is the "policy document outlining the priority fields of the EIT for future initiatives". The EIT must draw up an SIA by mid-2011 at the latest and every seven years thereafter. Parliament and the Council shall then adopt this agenda, acting on a proposal from the Commission.
Community to contribute €308.7 million
The Commission estimates that the institute will need an overall budget of €2.4 billion for the first six years, to be funded from a combination of private and public sources. On 18 December 2007 the EP and the Council agreed to revise the Multi-Annual Financial Framework 2007-2013 in order to ensure funding for Galileo and the EIT and to provide €308.7 million from the Community budget for the EIT.
Next steps
The Commission set up a four-strong identification committee early in February which is to nominate the 18 experts for the EIT's first Governing Board within about four months.
The European Council will then take a decision on where the EIT's governing body will be located. During the first-reading debate in Parliament, some MEPs proposed the Polish city of Wroclaw, the Hungarian capital Budapest or the city of Munich in Germany as possible seats for the EIT's governing board.

CAP health check: MEPs' first response
2008-03-06 - 09:58
Parliament will debate and vote in Strasbourg on a report by the Agriculture Committee on the Commission's proposals for further reform of the CAP, known as the "CAP health check". The committee recommends broad approval of the proposals, although it has reservations about certain points, including the amount of funds to be switched from the "first pillar" of the CAP (market support) to the "second pillar" (rural development) as well as the capping of direct aid. At this stage, MEPs are voting on an own-initiative report that constitutes Parliament's initial response to the Commission's general ideas on further CAP reform. At the next stage, the Commission will submit draft legislation, on which Parliament will have to be consulted.
Major shift in European agricultural policy in recent decades
Since 1992 the CAP has undergone three major overhauls, all designed to:
improve the efficiency and transparency of the CAP;
make farming more market-oriented;
better integrate new features – especially environmental and animal protection – into agriculture policy;
boost rural areas.
The earlier system of price support , which proved unable to solve the problem of farmers’ low incomes and also led to large surpluses that could only be disposed of on world markets with the aid of further subsidies, has been gradually replaced by a system of direct payments . The new reform plans (or "health check") must be seen against this background.
The main Commission proposals in the "health check" are:
further decoupling of aid from production,
a faster move to an area-based flat rate for direct payments,
the abolition of smaller, production-based measures or their integration into the system of decoupled direct payments,
further modulation (the shifting of funds from the first to the second pillars),
the capping of direct aid and an increase in minimum thresholds for payments, and
a commitment to end the milk quota and pave the way for a "soft landing".
EP Agriculture Committee's main demands
In the own-initiative report drafted by Lutz Goepel (EPP-ED, DE) and approved, as amended, by 33 votes to 6 with 3 abstentions, the Agriculture Committee argues that the "health check" should enable the last round of reforms to be consolidated without reducing further the funding available under the "first pillar" nor applying discriminatory capping to direct aid. Account must also be taken of the special needs of regions in difficulty and of sensitive sectors such as stockfarming, while further simplifying the rules for farmers.
Direct aid, decoupling
The committee favours giving Member States more flexibility to separate direct payments more from historical reference values at national level. MEPs want a study of the potential impact of an area-based premium, notably with regard to farms with high livestock densities.
The committee approves the principle of faster decoupling of production aid (which has been broadly successful in making European farming more market-oriented). However, it believes special animal premiums should not be altered for the time being, given the difficulties in the stockfarming sector following the exceptional rise in feed prices. It calls on the Commission to devise a global strategy to safeguard stockfarming in the EU over the long term.
MEPs also stress that direct payments will still be needed after 2013, not only in the event of market failures but also to pay for the provision of public benefits by farmers and for Europe's high environmental, food safety and animal welfare standards.
Set-aside and cross-compliance
The committee argues that the set-aside obligation, as well as direct payments without cross-compliance, should be abolished. However, it rejects the idea of broadening the scope of cross-compliance until substantial progress is made towards simplifying and harmonising monitoring rules. The environmental goals of set-aside could be achieved via rural development measures.
Market intervention, risk management
MEPs favour reducing intervention for market crops and, more broadly, replacing the current system by a safety net for crises, which are likely to occur more often as a result of global warming. They also believe that private sector or mixed insurance schemes must be developed urgently, with public financial support, while not affecting the level-playing-field between different Member States. The Commission is urged to consider backing a Community-wide reinsurance system for climate-related or environmental disasters.
No capping of payments to large farms
The committee rejects, in its present form, the Commission proposal for capping direct aid for large farms, saying there is no clear link between the size and wealth of a farm. It stresses that the proposal does not factor in the workforce needed for larger farms and that it would put such farms at an unfair disadvantage.
Call for modulation to be made "progressive" as well as compulsory for all
The committee also opposes further "modulation" of funding from the first to the second pillar, as this would be equivalent to a reduction of 8% in direct payments to farmers up to 2013. Instead, MEPs argue for "progressive modulation", based on an impact assessment of the consequences for farms. The funds thus generated would be distributed according to the prevailing rules on modulation and would remain in the regions or States in which they accrued. This progressive modulation, applicable over the period 2009-2013, would consist of a reduction of 1% of the total of direct aid from €10,000 to €100,000, 2% for €100,000 to €200,000, 3% for €200,000 to €300,000 and 4% for payments over €300,000.
The committee would also prefer modulation to be compulsory for all Member States rather than voluntary for some (namely the UK and Portugal) as at present.
Article 69 revised, a key to new types of support?
The committee believes that the current "Article 69" mechanism, which enables Member States to keep and reallocate up to 10% of direct aid to their farmers under the first pillar, should be reviewed so that funds are devoted as a priority to the preservation of livestock farming in mountain areas, those with water shortages, wetlands or disadvantaged areas, the restructuring of key agricultural sectors (e.g. the dairy and sheep sectors), area‑based environmental measures (e.g. organic farming) and risk management.
Preparing for the end of the dairy quota system
Aware that the current system of milk quotas is unlikely to be continued after 2015 in its present form, the Agriculture Committee asks the Commission to put forward a convincing plan for the dairy sector for the period after 2015. Lastly, MEPs argue for a 2% increase in dairy quotas in the milk year 2008/2009 on a voluntary basis for each Member State (see our separate article on milk quotas).

Biogas - a need for a review of EU legislation
2008-03-06 - 09:58
Csaba Sándor TABAJDI (PES, HU) for the Agriculture Committee will be tabling an own-initiative report on sustainable agriculture and biogas: a need for a review of EU legislation. The report stresses that, in the long term, renewable energy sources such as biogas and biofuels, together with solar power and wind energy, subject to further intensified research efforts, can bring about a higher degree of independence from fossil-fuel energy sources. The committee recognises that biogas is a vital energy resource that contributes to sustainable economic, agricultural and rural development and environmental protection.
Adoption of an EU directive
The committee promotes the adoption of an EU directive on biogas production that should include the following elements:
a) Specific targets for the priority use of manure, for instance in the form of the share of the livestock manure that is digested, and taking into account the agricultural conditions and the situation in the Member States,
b) Annual statistics and reports on agricultural biogas production in order to be able to follow up on the targets,
c) Measures for the construction and promotion of biogas-installations based on a national or regional impact assessment, promoting those installations that, nationally and/or regionally, are most beneficial to the environment and which are economically sustainable; measures for the dissemination and promotion of results gained from prior experiences or demonstration projects need to be included in all plans; if regional and rural development regulations do not allow funding of such measures, they must be amended,
d) EU Member States should engage in national and regional planning in order to limit legal and administrative impediments, for instance natural gas or other fossil fuels should not be preferred in areas in which it is feasible to sell heat from biogas to local heating providers.
Environmental guarantees
The Agriculture Committee stresses that animal manure, municipal sewage and agro-industrial waste can contain substances (bacteria, viruses, parasites, heavy metals, harmful organic substances) that can potentially be a threat to public health or the environment.
The committee asks the Commission to present proposals for legislation on the use of residues from biogas installations; asks the Commission to ensure that only organic material that allows residues to be used without endangering the environment may be used in biogas installations.
Banning growth enhancers
The committee asks the Commission to consider banning growth enhancers in animal feed containing heavy metals if this should prove to be a Europe-wide problem for subsequent use of biogas residues in fields. Rapporteur Csaba Sándor TABAJDI PES HU Procedure : own-initiative

Dairy quotas: Agriculture Committee favours 2% voluntary increase
2008-03-06 - 09:58
As consumers complain about the rising price of milk, Parliament is being consulted on legislation drafted by the Commission which would allow Member States to increase dairy quotas by 2% on a voluntary basis from 1 April 2008, thereby expanding supplies. To meet growing demand in the EU and on world markets, the Commission recently proposed increasing dairy production quotas by 2% in all Member States from 1 April 2008, which would represent a potential of 2.84 million additional tonnes for the year 2008/2009 over the current total of 145.7 million tonnes.
Although most members of the EP Agriculture Committee back the principle of an increase to enable the dairy sector to take advantage of new opportunities on world markets, others, including rapporteur Elisabeth Jeggle (EPP-ED, DE), fear that a uniform increase of 2% would result in lower prices paid to producers who are already in difficulty, in a context where quotas are under-used in many regions.
Proposed compromise
The committee agrees with the proposed 2% voluntary increase in quotas but argues there should be a mechanism for "balancing out" between states that exceed their quotas and those that under-use them, to avoid penalising any state that has a surplus.
The compromise being put to the plenary by the Agriculture Committee would allow the Member States to increase their production quotas by 2% on 1 April if they so wished. However, for the year 2008/2009, levies on surpluses would only have to be paid if there were still a surplus at European level after a process of balancing out between states that had exceeded their quotas and those that had under-used them.

Energy
Global energy efficiency and renewable energy
2008-03-06 - 09:58
The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy will be proposing an own-initiative report drawn up by Mr. Claude TURMES (Greens/EFA, LU) which welcomes the Commission's proposal for a Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund (GEEREF). The report stresses that the key objectives of the fund should be the promotion of energy efficiency, energy saving and renewable energies, the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases and of other risks, the improvement of access to energy services in the poorest countries and the diversification of energy sources in the developing world. The committee insists that all support for projects and choice of technology is conditional on the fulfilment of comprehensive sustainability criteria and on a contribution being made to sustainable development, among other things.
Members in the committee call on the Commission to focus, when implementing the fund, on small-scale projects which are the most difficult to attract private sector investment. In this regard, the Commission should keep under regular review its eligibility threshold of €10 million for individual projects, while earmarking at least one third of the funds available for small-scale projects costing less than €1 million.
The European Commission is also invited to:
ensure that support for all biomass projects in developing countries is subject to the fulfilment of rigorous sustainability criteria;
ensure that the GEEREF supports photovoltaic projects and calls on it to support the development of intelligent grid technologies;
ensure that the fund supports the development of local markets, manufacturing and capacity by supporting local small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) so that they can take on responsibility for merchandising new technologies in a particular region;
ensure that the fund will be consistent with and supplement other Member State and EU development policies and energy initiatives targeted at developing countries;
explore ways of enlarging the fund in the future context of a post-2012 regime under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
The committee regrets the fact that the suggested minimum funding target of €100 million - with a contribution of only €15 million for each of the years 2007 and 2008 - is woefully inadequate as the GEEREF's contribution when the goal is to "boost the share of energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. It urges the Commission to increase its contribution while at the same time encouraging Member States, as well as multilateral finance institutions, to join forces in order to significantly increase the size of the fund.

Strong criticism of the International Accounting Standards Board’s governance
2008-03-06 - 09:58
The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) lacks transparency, legitimacy and accountability. It is not under the control of any democratically elected parliament or government. So says a report from the Economics Committee now due for debate by Parliament in Strasbourg plenary. The report, drawn up by Alexander Radwan (EPP-ED, DE) welcomes the moves made by the IASB – the body which draws up the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) which EU law requires stock exchange-listed companies to use for their accounts – and the International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation – the IASB’S oversight body – have made to redress these deficiencies, but it argues that there is more to be done. A debate should be launched, it says, on integrating the IASB into the system of international governance with the IMF, OECD and World Bank.
More European representation and more public oversight
MEPs in the committee believe that since the EU is the largest jurisdiction which has adopted the IFRS, there should be more representatives of a European background in the standard setting bodies, and that all trustees of the IASB should come from nations that have signed up to the IFRS, or intend to do so.
The committee wants to see a public oversight body set up involving all IASCF/IASB public stakeholders, including legislators and supervisors, and a second body representing market participants, which would deliver an annual report on the functioning of the IASCF/IASB. Such a body could also be responsible for selecting and appointing trustees in a transparent manner.
More use of impact assessments and involvement of stakeholders
The report urges IASB to carry out impact studies among all interested parties before adopting new accounting standards.
As for the funding of the IASB, MEPs in the committee want to ensure that all user groups are adequately involved, that there is no conflict of interest between financiers and users and that access to the standards themselves is made easier. They call on the Commission to examine how it might be able to contribute to funding the IASCF/IASB. It also suggests a funding method involving all publicly traded companies in the EU.
MEPs are keen to ensure the IFRS themselves are interpreted in a consistent manner. They ask the Commission to develop an EU structure as an international partner for third country bodies on this issue and to guarantee uniform interpretation and application.
IFRS for SMEs – too complicated for most
The report says that the IASB’s proposed version of the IFRS for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) is far too complicated for most of them. While it might be a transitional option for larger SMEs hoping to expand, it should not be used for enforced harmonisation of SME accounting standards. The committee says the Commission should arrange a proper consultation procedure for an EU accounting framework for SMEs.
Among other points, the report emphasises that convergence with third-country standards (such as US GAAP) must be based on a prior assessment of the impact and merits of changes for EU companies and users of financial statements. It also calls for the “fair value” principle to be limited in scope, noting that it can be costly and lead to unrealistic valuations in some circumstances.

Improving financial market supervision
2008-03-06 - 09:58
MEPs will ask the Commission and Council Presidency how they plan improve supervision of Europe’s financial markets in the light of a review of the current system of cooperation between national supervisors under the ‘Lamfalussy process’ and the recent financial market turmoil. Pervenche Berès (PES, FR), chair of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, will put oral questions to the two institutions. After hearing their responses, MEPs will debate the issues.
In the questions, the committee points out that the European Commission review of the Lamfalussy process lays down a set of actions aiming to strengthen the Lamfalussy process and enhance supervisory cooperation and convergence.
The Interinstitutional Monitoring Group final report on the implementation and functioning of the Lamfalussy process has voiced similar recommendations. The ECOFIN Council met on 4 December 2007 and reviewed the Lamfalussy process.
Both the Commission Communication and the ECOFIN Council Conclusions stress the importance of the Lamfalussy level 3 committees and that they should have adequate means to fulfil their tasks in terms of supervisory convergence and cooperation.
The ECOFIN Council Conclusions also underline the need for efficient and effective supervision of cross-border groups, and draw a roadmap of tasks designed to improve the current situation.
Moreover, previous ECOFIN Council Conclusions of 9 October 2007 on EU arrangements for financial stability clearly indicate that a better coordination between the relevant supervisory authorities and institutions involved is needed. To this end, the ECOFIN Council adopted a strategic roadmap, building upon the recommendations of the report of the EFC ad-hoc working group on financial stability.
The European Parliament, which has long called for an increased convergence of national supervisory practices and improvement of existing crisis management arrangements in the EU, therefore welcomes both ECOFIN Council Conclusions, and shares the view that a consistency between the evolution of going concern supervisory arrangements, both at national and cross-border levels, and that of crisis management/ financial stability arrangements is needed. It welcomes the main actions proposed in the Commission Communication.
The Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee therefore poses the following questions :
Having regard to the two ECOFIN Council Conclusions, and to the still-unfolding financial crisis whose speed and pace has taken by surprise many market participants and supervisors, and having regard to the threats the crisis still poses to the EU financial markets and to its spill-over into the EU economy, what does the Presidency consider as appropriate steps to be undertaken in this area in order to better respond to the challenges of globally integrated markets and to preserve the soundness and stability of the EU financial markets?

Taxation
Minimum taxes for diesel should rise to equal petrol tax minimums
2008-03-06 - 09:58
The current EU-wide minimum rate of tax on diesel should be increased to match the current minimum rate for unleaded petrol, but no further, says the Economics Committee in a report now due for a plenary vote. They also want to set a limit on further petrol and diesel tax increases in the Member States which already have the highest taxes. The European Commission says the wide variation in rates of diesel (officially known as gas oil) taxes creates distortions in the road haulage market – and also increases environmental damage by encouraging “fuel tourism” by hauliers (i.e. making special journeys or using longer routes in order to fill up in a country with low taxes). Also, since diesel and petrol have similar impacts, especially from the point of view of CO2 emissions, there is no environmental reason for the two minimum rates to differ. The Commission is therefore proposing to raise the minimum rate on diesel up to the minimum rate on petrol.
Slower pace of increase
Adopting a report based on a draft by Olle Schmidt (ALDE, SE), MEPs in the committee agreed with this in principle, but want to raise the minimum taxes on diesel more slowly, from the current level of €302/1000 litres to the petrol level of €359/1000 litres by 2015 rather than 2012. Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Bulgaria and Romania should have until 2016 to reach the target.
No to further rises
Furthermore, the committee opposes the Commission’s plan to increase both minimum rates to €380/1000 litres in 2014. In addition, still with a view to avoiding divergence between tax rates getting worse, MEPs say those countries with current tax rates over €400/1000 litres on diesel and €500/1000 litres on unleaded petrol should not increase their taxes further until 2015.
As usual with taxation matters, Parliament’s role is consultative. Once the plenary has voted, the final decision is for the Council, which can act only if it can reach unanimity.
Impact on UK and Ireland
In the UK, current tax levels are well above the minimum EU levels, and this would still be true after the increases proposed by the Commission, so these changes would have little practical impact. If the Council were to adopt MEPs’ proposal of a moratorium on further rises, this would affect the UK.
The increases proposed by MEPs would make little difference in Ireland for the same reason, but an increase would be needed in the tax on diesel to if this was to reach the Commission’s goal of €380/1000 litres (the current rate is €368/1000 litres).

Development and cooperation
EU development policy and the new Member States
2008-03-06 - 09:58
Parliament will debate and vote on a draft own-initiative report from the Development Committee on the challenge of EU development cooperation policy for the new Member States, all of which must take part in this well-established policy, although each has its own priorities. The report, by Danute Budreikaite (ALDE, LT), looks at how the new Member States implement their development policy. The committee stresses that this policy is a part of the acquis communautaire (the existing body of Community law and policy) and recalls the new Member States' international commitments in this field. It also mentions that promoting democracy and the rule of law - a key priority for the new Member States - also helps reduce poverty in developing countries.
These states have undertaken to reach an official development assistance (ODA) target of 0.17 % of gross national income (GNI) by 2010 and 0.33% by 2015. However, many are not on course to meet the target and some may even see ODA fall in line with overall budget cuts due to the need to reduce government debt.
The eastern dimension of EU external relations is highlighted in the report, which argues that a new assembly of EU and neighbouring countries (similar to the ACP-EU, Euromed and Eurolat assemblies), building on historical experience, could boost the impact of the new Member States in EU policy in this area.
Lastly, the report acknowledges that the priorities of the new Member States are largely determined by historical ties and that most of their development cooperation budgets will target their immediate neighbours and the CIS countries. The priority countries for each of the new Member States are listed, whether they are immediate neighbours or belong to the group of African-Carribean or Pacific countries (ACP), although the report also highlights cases where the new Member States are targeting aid - or planning to target it - at ACP countries.

Development and cooperation
Empowering women: the key to development
2008-03-06 - 09:58
Parliament will be asked to back an own-initiative report by the Development Committee on gender equality and women's empowerment in development cooperation. The report calls for measures to promote women's rights in areas such as responsible governance, employment, education, health and violence against women, arguing that these rights are essential to economic and social development. The report, drafted by Feleknas Uca (GUE/NGL, DE), is a response to a Commission communication (see link below). According to Feleknas Uka, gender equality and equal access to resources for men and women are crucial to sustainable development. In Africa, for example, women make up 52% of the total population but perform 75% of agricultural work and produce and market 60-80% of the food.
Disappointment with progress so far
The Development Committee says that, although in 1995 the Council declared the gender perspective to be a principle underpinning development policy, not enough has been done in practice. It endorses the Commission’s view that funding made available for the integration of gender equality issues into development cooperation is insufficient and urges the Commission and Member States to take action, with the emphasis on amending laws, institutions and existing patriarchal patterns, increasing budgetary resources and improving social and economic conditions for women.
Women's role in post-war societies, violence against women
Turning to specific problems, the report calls for better understanding of the role of women in post-war societies and of their contributions to post-war reconstruction. Regarding violence against women, it acknowledges the Commission’s efforts to raise awareness of the issue but urges that more attention be paid to "trafficking in human beings, torture and harmful traditional practices, with an emphasis on female genital mutilation, honour crimes and early and forced marriage". It also calls for more female personnel in institutions that directly assist victims of these practices.
Sexual issues, reproductive and health rights
The express link between women and HIV (in terms of increasing the rate of infection) spelt out in the Commission's paper is welcomed by the committee, but MEPs believe Member States should be pressed to meet the financial commitments they have given on this matter.
The report states that "empowering women by ensuring full access to sexual and reproductive health information, services and supplies puts them in a better position to negotiate safe sex and protect themselves from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)". It backs the Commission's proposals for protecting women from STDs, including funding for developing microbiocides and vaccines and measures on reproductive health and rights.
Status of women under Sharia law
Lastly, the report "deplores in the strongest possible terms the virtual chattel status of women trapped under Sharia Law, and regards this oppression as representing the diametric opposite of every principle this Report holds to be of paramount importance".

Call for greater commitment to Iraq by EU
2008-03-06 - 09:58
MEPs will vote on a report that urges greater EU involvement in Iraq, increased transparency and efficiency of EU aid and more support for the United Nations' efforts in the country. The suggestions are part of a recommendation to the Council on the EU's role in Iraq, contained in an own-initiative report drafted for the Foreign Affairs Committee by Ana Gomes (PES, PT), which will be debated on Wednesday (12 March) and put to the vote the following day. In the draft report, the Foreign Affairs Committee urges the Council "to adopt, together with the Commission, a new strategy that will step up, both in quantitative and – especially – in qualitative terms, EU support for UN efforts to help build a safe, stable, unified, prosperous, federal and democratic Iraq that upholds human rights, protects its minorities and promotes inter-ethnic tolerance so as to pave the way towards regional stability and security".
The Council is also asked "to focus EU aid in Iraq generally on relevant technical assistance and capacity-building in the fields of the rule of law and justice and human rights, good governance, financial and budget management, gender equality, health and education, and on the strengthening of federal, regional and local government institutions".
The Commission, say MEPs, should "ensure the transparency and efficiency of EU assistance for Iraq", among other things "by providing complete, regular and transparent information on the actual disbursement and implementation of EU assistance".
The EU should also "foster the renewal of bilateral political, diplomatic, cultural and economic relations and exchanges between Member States and Iraq" alongside "a new strategy for proactive involvement on the part of the EU and its Member States in Iraq".
The draft report mentions the EIDHR (European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights), which it says could be used extensively to fund civil society organisations that deal with the rights of women, minorities and children, and to fight arbitrary detention torture and the death penalty.

Situation in Chad - Irish troop contribution
2008-03-06 - 09:58
MEPs will hold a debate with the Commission and Council on the situation in Chad, where EU troops have been dispatched under a UN mandate to protect refugees who are fleeing over the border from Darfur, Sudan. The 3700-strong European Union force is being deployed in eastern Chad and also the Central African Republic, which borders on both Chad and Sudan. The mission began at the end of January but was initially delayed by a rebel attack on the Chadian capital Ndjamena in early February.
Fourteen EU Member States are contributing to the force, with more than half the total coming from France, which has troops and planes in its former colony under a military cooperation treaty. Apart from France, of the fourteen countries contributing to the force, Austria, Sweden and Ireland have already sent troops. The operation's overall commander, Lieutenant-General Patrick Nash , is Irish. Ireland has committed 400-plus troops to the mission.
Chad will feature high on the agenda of the EU-ACP session in Slovenia (15 to 20 March 2008) as one of two urgent topics, the other being Kenya. Council and Commission statements - situation in Chad

European code of conduct of arms exports - MEPs to vote on a resolution
2008-03-06 - 09:58
The House will debate the European code of conduct of arms exports after hearing statements from the Council and the Commission. The EU Code of Conduct on arms exports builds on the Common Criteria for arms exports adopted in 1991 and 1992 and also includes a denial notification and consultation mechanism, the first such mechanism ever applied to conventional arms exports. MEPs will also vote on a resolution on this topic. The adoption of the Code marked a qualitatively new stage in the EU's development of a common approach to arms exports as an important element of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. The Council assesses implementation of the Code on an annual basis.
In the ninth year of operation of the European Code of Conduct, numerous developments have further strengthened the implementation of the Code and contributed to expanding its application. These achievements have reconfirmed the Code's status as the most comprehensive international arms export control regime.
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Iceland and Norway have officially aligned themselves with the criteria and principles of the Code.
In the ninth annual report published in the Official Journal on 26 October 2007, on the Code of Conduct, Member States have identified the following priority guidelines for the near future:
1. continuation of the process of earlier adoption and harmonisation of national reports in order to promote more homogeneous statistical data for inclusion in the European Union annual report, to produce clearer, more transparent summary tables;
2. continuation of activities on the promotion of an Arms Trade Treaty, inter alia through the ATT contact group and active support of the Group of Governmental Experts;
3. follow-up to the implementation of the Common Position on arms brokering, taking into account different national legislation and expanding the appropriate information sharing mechanism;
4. continuation of the policy of promoting the principles and criteria of the Code of Conduct among third countries, specifically those countries that have aligned themselves with the Code of Conduct, and assisting in its practical implementation through, inter alia, the provision of practical and technical assistance to ensure the harmonisation of policies on arms export control;
5. continuation of discussions regarding the Commission initiative concerning Intra-Community Transfers of defence-related products;
6. further development of a dialogue with the European Parliament;
7. continued close cooperation and consultation with interested third parties, including international NGOs and the defence industry. Council and Commission statements

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Women in rural areas
2008-03-06 - 09:58
On the situation of women in rural areas of the EU, Christa KLAß (EPP-ED, DE) for the Women's Rights committee will be tabling an own-initiative report which calls on the Member States to develop strategies aimed at curbing the out-migration of women in rural areas, especially those who are highly educated. The committee is convinced that mainstreaming gender into the rural sector is a key strategy not only for the promotion of equality between women and men but also for economic growth and sustainable rural development;
The report calls on the Commission to improve statistical data and information as regards this phenomenon and to analyse the patterns of, main reasons for and consequences of the out-migration from rural areas in the EU . The report also calls on the Member States to develop strategies aimed at curbing the out-migration of women in rural areas, especially those who are highly educated.
MEPs in the committee call on the Member States, in collaboration with local government and business, to create incentives for the participation of women in the labour force. These incentives could particularly focus on getting rid of any discrimination against women in the labour market, with the aim of addressing the problem of poverty and social exclusion in rural areas. The Committee notes that poverty is widespread in rural communities, especially in the new Member States.
Sexual violence
The report draws attention to the strong taboos surrounding sexual and/or domestic violence against women and girls in rural areas, and calls on the Member States to take appropriate measures to ensure better protection and support of victims and those at risk of becoming victims of such violence.
The report refers to the fact that women are under-represented in formal rural or regional leadership positions, despite the fact that they play an important role in the ‘informal’ community, where women often play an essential role in the community’s social life by influencing the emergence of social capital through their involvement in informal local networks (e.g. in the framework of voluntary community work or various thematic associations).
Finally, the committee calls on the relevant national, regional and local authorities to encourage the participation of women in local action groups and the development of local partnerships under the Leader axis as well as to ensure gender-balanced participation on their management boards.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Special needs of women prisoners
2008-03-06 - 09:58
The situation of women in prison, a minority of the prison population but a fast-growing one, together with the impact of the imprisonment of parents on social and family life is highlighted in a report by Marie PANAYOTOPOULOS-CASSIOTOU (EPP-ED, EL) on behalf of the Women's Rights and Gender Equality Committee. The report focuses on prison conditions, the preservation of family ties and reintegration into society and the workplace. Women account for a small percentage of the prison population in the European Union - around 5% - with Spain and Portugal having the largest numbers at 8% and 10% respectively, but most European countries have experienced a significant increase. The female prison population grew by 410% in Cyprus between 1994 and 2003 and by 173% in England and Wales from 1992 to 2002.
Due to the lack of resources for prisons, "women in prison are a minority whose special needs are not sufficiently taken into account in EU countries", according to Ms Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou who drafted the report.
As unskilled female workers, those women also often suffer poor labour-market integration. For instance, in the UK, only 3% of women in prison were in work prior to coming to prison and over half said they were living on state benefits8
Prison conditions
Women's needs differ from those of men, notably in health and maternity care. MEPs call on the Commission and Council to adopt a framework decision on minimum standards for prisoners' rights based on Article 6 of the EU Treaty, to reflect the special needs of women.
As a high proportion of female prisoners have been victims of violence, sexual abuse or ill treatment, Member States are urged to provide psychological support, especially to women prisoners who have suffered such violence, to mothers with family responsibilities and to minors.
On the maternity front, MEPs say pregnant women should have access to prenatal and postnatal care.
The committee also wants special arrangements for foreign prisoners, who it says should be able to contact their consulates and have access to prison resources and programmes.
Preserving social and family ties
If imprisoning women is likely to seriously disrupt family life (e.g. in cases of lone parent families or responsibility for dependants) the report suggests greater use of non-custodial punishments if the sentence is minor and the risk to public safety is low.
MEPs also call for judicial systems to guarantee the rights of children and for Member States and penal institutions to set up separate mother-and-child units with qualified staff to help prisoners who are mothers to meet their educational and care responsibilities.
Social reintegration
To encourage their reintegration into society, the report stresses the need for women prisoners to have access, without encountering discrimination, to jobs and voluntary work as well as to varied vocational and civic training courses adapted to job market requirements.
MEPs also want every detention centre to have monitoring and individual support programmes available to all prisoners on a voluntary basis, to devise and implement personal reintegration plans.
Lastly, the report calls on Member States to invest more in resources for prisons to develop literacy, life-long learning and vocational training programmes, partly by using financing instruments such as the European Social Fund and PROGRESS.

Fisheries agreement EC - Guinea-Bissau
2008-03-06 - 09:58
The Fisheries Committee is proposing a report by Luís CAPOULAS SANTOS (PES, PT) on the conclusion of a fisheries agreement between the European Community and Guinea-Bissau. The Protocol to the agreement grants fishing possibilities for 23 tuna seiners and surface longliners from Spain, France and Portugal and for 14 pole-and-line vessels from Spain and France, subject to a total of 37 licences. The rapporteur recommends, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, that Parliament approve the proposal for a regulation with some amendments, which are intended to highlight the importance of enhancing Parliament’s role and the information supplied to it.
The fisheries agreement with Guinea-Bissau is one of the oldest to be signed by the Community, having been adopted by a Regulation from 1980. The Protocol now being extended is the ninth protocol to have been agreed by the two parties.
The fishing opportunities set out in the Protocol to the agreement are allocated among the Member States as follows:
( a) shrimp fishing :
Spain - 1421 GRT
Italy - 1776 GRT
Greece - 137 GRT
Portugal - 1066 GRT
( b) fin-fish/cephalopods :
Spain - 3143 GRT
Italy - 786 GRT
Greece - 471 GRT
( c) tuna seiners and surface longliners :
Spain - 10 vessels
France - 9 vessels
Portugal - 4 vessels
( d) pole-and-line vessels :
Spain - 10 vessels
France - 4 vessels.
The financial contribution is fixed at €7 million per year. 35% of this financial contribution (€2.450 million) will be allocated each year to the support and implementation of initiatives taken in the context of the sectoral fisheries policy drawn up by the Government of Guinea-Bissau. An additional specific contribution of €500,000 per year will also be targeted at improving the health and hygiene conditions of fishery products. However, this contribution could also be used to support control and surveillance measures. The Protocol will also contain a financial mechanism, with a maximum allocation of €1 million per year, aiming to improve the use of fishing opportunities by shipowners, and support for setting up joint ventures.

Fisheries Partnership Agreement EC - Côte d’Ivoire
2008-03-06 - 09:58
The Fisheries committee is also proposing a report on the conclusion of a Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and Côte d’Ivoire. As regards fishing opportunities, the agreement lays down that authorisation to fish will be granted to 25 freezer tuna seiners (10 vessels from France and 15 from Spain) and 15 surface longliners (10 vessels from Spain and 5 vessels from Portugal), subject to a total of 40 licences. The rapporteur, Daniel VARELA SUANZES-CARPEGNA (EPP-ED, ES), stresses in the amendments that Parliament needs to be supplied with proper information so that it can evaluate the agreement.
The agreement is to apply for a period of six years from 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2013. It repeals and replaces the fisheries agreement between the European Economic Community and Côte d’Ivoire which entered into force on 19 December 1990.
The fishing opportunities negotiated by the Community are restricted to highly migratory species: tuna, mainly albacore, skipjack and bigeye, and to a lesser extent swordfish.
At the request of the Community, exploratory fishing trips may be carried out under the agreement. If they are conclusive and the sustainable management of Côte d’Ivoire’s fishery resources is not jeopardised, the two parties may decide by common agreement to award new fishing opportunities to Community vessels.
The financial contribution is fixed at €595,000 per year, with payment being due on 30 March 2008 at the latest for the first year and on 1 July for the following years. This contribution will be allocated in full to the support and implementation of initiatives taken in the context of the sectoral fisheries policy drawn up by the Government of Côte d’Ivoire. The annual reference tonnage is 7,000 tonnes.
The number of ACP nationals signed on by tuna seiners and surface longliners has been set at 20% of the seamen signed on during the corresponding fishing season.
