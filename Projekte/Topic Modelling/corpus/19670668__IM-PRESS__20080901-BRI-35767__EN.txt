Georgia: Debate and vote on resolution - MEPs say Russia must honour its commitments
MEPs call on Russia to honour its commitments and withdraw its troops from Georgia, in a resolution adopted by the European Parliament. MEPs are in favour of a European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) monitoring mission to Georgia and ask the European Commission to propose visa facilitation and readmission agreements. They also call for a boost to the EU's neighbourhood policy and reaffirm the importance of Georgia in improving EU energy security. MEPs debated the situation in Georgia following Monday's (1 September) extraordinary European Council meeting and ahead of the vote on the resolution which took place on Wednesday (3 September). While a number of MEPs underlined the need to respect Georgian territorial integrity, they said that Russia's reactions were disproportionate and called for a boost to the EU's neighbourhood policy. The need to move away from dependence on Russian energy supplies was also underlined
Costa Rican President urges EU not to neglect Central America
In his formal address to the House, the President of Costa Rica, Óscar Arias Sánchez , urged Europe to support Central America's efforts to build a peaceful and prosperous society. In particular he called for the association agreement currently under negotiation with the EU to grant favourable trade terms to the region and for arms sales by outsiders to be discouraged.
European Parliament welcomes release of Palestinian prisoners
In adopting a resolution (416 votes in favour to 136 against and 61 abstentions) on the situation of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, MEPs welcome the recent decision by the Israeli Government to free 198 Palestinian prisoners on 25 August. This is "a positive gesture to strengthen the authority of the Palestinian Authority and to install a climate of mutual trust" says the resolution. The House also calls for the immediate release of the Israeli Corporal Gilad Shalit, abducted 25 June 2006 and held hostage since by Hamas.
Parliament's rapporteurs set out their positions on the telecoms package
MEPs debated the reform of the regulatory framework for electronic communications - including mobile and fixed telephones, broadcasting and the internet. The telecoms package seeks to strengthen consumer rights and privacy protection, to ensure a consistent application of regulatory measures and to modernise radio spectrum use. Parliament will vote on the package during the second September plenary (22-25 September 2008).
New plans on equality, employment law and social standards debated
Presenting "the largest package ever submitted by the Commission" to Parliament Commissioner Vladimír Špidla , responsible for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, stressed that "the 18 measures represent a first step towards the aim to share and strengthen Europe's social dimension". "Economic and social goals are two sides of the same coin and must be closely coordinated to people's benefit", he added. Most MEPs who participated in the debate on Tuesday (2 September) on the Commission's new "social agenda" welcomed the package of measures, though some said there were insufficiently specific and substantial. There will be a vote on a resolution on the whole package at the September II plenary (22-25 September) after a debate on the patient mobility plans.
Equality of men and women in the EU in 2008: for quality jobs
More effort is needed to boost the quality of jobs and combat violence against women, says an own-initiative report (adopted by 563 votes in favour to 65 against and 61 abstentions) on equality of men and women in the EU MEPs welcome a European Commission report on the same subject and back a twin-track approach to equality of the sexes, which, on the one hand, ensures equality between men and women in all EU policy areas and, on the other, puts in place targeted measures to reduce discrimination.
Stereotypes in advertising continue despite EU efforts
MEPs adopted an own-initiative report on how marketing and advertising affect equality between men and women. The report notes the continued widespread existence of male and female stereotypes despite various Community programmes to promote gender equality. The report was adopted with 504 votes in favour, 110 against and 22 abstentions.
UN level classification of hazardous substances to be incorporated into EU law
MEPs adopted three legislative reports on the classification, labelling and packing of substances and mixtures. The first-reading agreement concerns the implementation of the UN level agreed, GHS (Globally Harmonised System) on classification, labelling and packaging of hazardous substances into EU legislation. The new rules are similar to existing EU rules (which will be replaced later) but certain technical change will have to be made.
More competition in airline reservation systems - with protection for consumers
MEPs adopted a first-reading legislative report on proposals to simplify and modernise the rules for the computerised reservation systems used by high-street and online travel agents to book airline tickets for their customers. The report by Timothy KIRKHOPE (EPP-ED, UK) was adopted by 496 votes in favour to 103 against with 23 abstentions, with amendments to the draft regulation. MEPs believe this will mean more competition and therefore lower distribution costs, but they also want measures to ensure consumers get a fair deal - and can be presented with environment-friendlier travel options.
Make freight a higher rail network priority, says European Parliament
The European Commission should allocate at least 40% of EU transport infrastructure appropriations to the railways and prioritise freight, to reduce the need for road transport, says an own-initiative adopted by the European Parliament with 541 votes in favour, 6 against and 15 abstentions. MEPs urge the Commission to concentrate EU co-financing on improving the efficiency, interoperability and upgrading of rail infrastructure, inter-modal hubs and other freight transport modes.
Guidelines urgently needed on state aid to ports, says European Parliament
The own-initiative report adopted with 572 votes in favour, 12 against and 10 abstentions on the Commission communication on European Ports Policy, points out that the EU port sector is expanding fast and that the maritime sector is particularly affected by globalisation. It highlights the need to take account of major changes in international traffic resulting from technological and economic progress, the widening of the Panama Canal and the increase and size of capacity of vessels.
Mid-term review of the European Environment and Health Action Plan 2004-2010
In adopting an own-initiative report on the mid-term review of the European Environment and Health Action Plan 2004-2010, the European Parliament acknowledges the efforts made by the Commission since the action plan was launched in 2004. It considers, however, that such an action plan is bound to fail at least in part, since it is designed solely to accompany existing Community policies. The report was adopted with 522 votes in favour and 16 against.
MEPs move towards cross-border motor insurance
In adopting an own-initiative report on motor insurance in Europe, MEPs welcome the Commission’s report on certain issues relating to motor insurance. The report highlights the importance of including, fully and effectively, all stakeholders, in particular consumers, in the process of consultation in the development of EU policy. The report underlines the importance of increasing consumer confidence in motor insurance policies as regards cross-border motor vehicle travel within the EU.
Time to get serious on tax fraud say MEPs
€200-250 billion that should reach national budgets is thought to be lost to fiscal fraud. VAT fraud alone accounts for some €40bn a year – ten per cent of the total receipts. Parliament says it is time for Member States to get serious in tackling this problem and is calling for reform to the VAT system and the Savings Tax Directive. A report drawn up by Sharon BOWLES (ALDE, UK) and adopted by 391 votes in favour to 93 against with 178 abstentions says some Member States have shown a “blockading attitude” in the last ten years when it comes to tackling tax fraud.
Asylum: MEPs point out at the unsatisfactory results of the Dublin system
MEPs adopted the own-initiative report by Jean LAMBERT (Greens/EFA, UK) by 609 votes in favour, 53 against and 30 abstentions. They ask the Commission to add a provision restricting the detention of Dublin claimants to a measure of last resort, thereby specifying the grounds on which detention may be employed and the procedural safeguards which should be provided for. MEPs call on the Commission to complement the Dublin system with measures in order to make it fairer for migrants as well as for Member States, by sharing the work of examining asylum applications and ensuring better rights for claimants. Detention should be used only as a last resort solution, MEPs say.
Improving judicial cooperation in Europe
MEPs adopted three reports which on Improving judicial cooperation in Europe. The subjects of the reports are mutual recognition between Member States of court decisions rendered in absentia, strengthening of the Eurojust system and the European Judicial Network.
McCann inspired written declaration on emergency cooperation in recovering missing children formally adopted
The written declaration on emergency cooperation in recovering missing children, inspired by the disappearance of Madeline McCann on 3 May 2007, was formally adopted in plenary with 418 MEP signatures. More than half of the total 785 MEPs need to sign a written declaration for it to become the official position of the European Parliament. The declaration will be recorded in the official minutes of the plenary session of 2 September 2008.
Fisheries and Aquaculture in the context of Integrated Coastal Zone Management
MEPs adopted a non-binding report (652 votes in favour to 14 against and 25 abstentions) on "Fisheries and Aquaculture in the context of Integrated Coastal Zone Management in Europe", the European Parliament stresses the importance of aquaculture to the food industry for social and economic development in some EU coastal communities.
Management of non-tuna species in the Southern Indian Ocean
MEPs adopted a report (646 votes in favour to 26 against and 14 abstentions) on the conclusion of the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement. This new Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (RFMO) will exercise its responsibilities for the effective conservation and management of non-tuna species in the high seas of the Southern Indian Ocean. The Community has fishing interests in the South Indian Ocean and is also a Coastal State on behalf of Réunion.
Hydrogen powered motor vehicles - supply network essential say MEPs
Parliament adopted (644 votes in favour to 2 against and 11 abstentions) a legislative report on hydrogen powered motor vehicles. MEPs point out that the successful introduction of hydrogen-powered vehicles on the European market will also depend on whether the appropriate hydrogen filling station network can be established in time.
MEPs call for ban on animal cloning for food
The European Parliament called for a ban in the EU on the cloning of animals for food supply. MEPs also urged an embargo on imports of cloned animals, their offspring and products derived from these sources. In a resolution adopted by 622 MEPs in favour, 32 against and 25 abstentions, the House calls on the Commission "to submit proposals prohibiting for food supply purposes:
Developing countries growth to be boosted by opened trade in services
Pursuing both progressive and reciprocal opening of access to the service market in trade negotiations is stressed by MEPs in a report adopted by 525 votes in favour to 77 against. This would give access to entrepreneurs of developing countries to a wider range of service. The own-initiative report reiterates that liberalisation of services is important for both developed and developing countries.
Making EU sanctions more coherent and effective
The House adopted on Thursday (4 September) a resolution by the Foreign Affairs Committee calling for the European Union to improve the way it uses sanctions as a foreign policy instrument. The report highlights the need for greater coherence in the use of sanctions, including better analysis and impact assessments, to make EU sanctions more effective.
Human rights: coup in Mauritania, hangings in Iran, albino killings in Tanzania
In three resolutions on democracy and human rights adopted at the end of this week's Brussels plenary session, the European Parliament condemned the recent coup in Mauritania, the continuing execution of minors in Iran and a wave of killings of albino people in Tanzania. 20080901BRI35767 Texts adopted 2-4 September 2008 Draft Agenda for Sept II - 22-25 September (to be held in Brussels) will be available here

Opening of the plenary session: Parliament mourns MEPs and victims of air crashes
2008-09-05 - 10:21
The President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering, opened the plenary session with some comments on the situation of the EP's damaged building in Strasbourg, which had forced the session to be held - exceptionally - in Brussels. He also expressed the Institution's condolences at the deaths during the summer of three sitting or former MEPs as well as the deaths of many passengers in two plane crashes. Following the partial collapse of the ceiling of the plenary chamber in Strasbourg, Mr Pöttering said it was hoped that investigations and repair work would be completed in time for the EP to hold its next session in Strasbourg.
The president then turned to the deaths of MEPs that had occurred during the summer. He spoke first of Bronisław Geremek (ALDE, PL), whom he described as "a great Polish patriot and a major European", who had been one of the founding fathers of the new Poland. Mr Pöttering then expressed his "great sorrow" at the death of Willi Piecyk (PES, DE), a leading figure in the Transport and Tourism Committee. Lastly, he spoke of former Italian Christian-Democrat MEP Maria Luisa Cassanmagnago Cerretti , who had joined the European Parliament at the same time as Mr Pöttering in 1979 and had been "an inspiration" and a woman of "intellectual courage and compassion".
Turning to this summer's air disasters, Mr Pöttering reiterated the message of solidarity and support to the families and friends of the deceased that he had made the day after the crash in Madrid on 20 August which left 154 people dead. He also expressed sorrow at the crash on 24 August at Kyrgyzstan's capital, Bishkek, which killed 68 of the 90 passengers and crew. "I would like to speak for everyone in this House in expressing our most heartfelt condolences to the victims of these and other tragic events", said Mr Pöttering. The House rose for a minute’s silence in memory of the dead.

Ingrid Betancourt to address the European Parliament plenary in Brussels on 8 October
2008-09-05 - 10:21
Ingrid Betancourt will address the European Parliament plenary session in a formal sitting on 8 October 2008 following an invitation from European Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering. Mr Pöttering announced on Thursday, 4 September to the Conference of Presidents (political group leaders) that Ingrid Betancourt had accepted the invitation. President Pöttering said: "I am delighted that Ingrid Betancourt has accepted our invitation to address the European Parliament. We are proud of her courage and thrilled that the Parliament will have the opportunity to salute her." Ingrid Betancourt was kidnapped by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) on 23 February 2002, and rescued from captivity six and a half years later in Operation Jaque, along with 14 other hostages (three Americans and 11 Colombian policemen and soldiers). Since her release, Ingrid Betancourt has been actively voicing support for the liberation of all remaining hostages; her visit to the European Parliament is also taking place in that spirit.

MEPs debate the situation in Georgia
2008-09-05 - 10:21
MEPs debated the situation in Georgia following Monday's (1 September) extraordinary European Council meeting and ahead of the vote on the resolution on Wednesday (3 September).. Most MEPs underlined the need to respect Georgian territorial integrity, said that Russia's reactions were disproportionate and called for a boost to the EU's neighbourhood policy. The need to move away from dependence on Russian energy supplies was also underlined.
Most MEPs condemned Russia's recognition of the South Ossetia and Abkhazia, while others questioned whether Georgia's initial action was appropriate.
Council - French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner
The EU must take a balanced position on the crisis in Georgia, adopting a firm stance while keeping channels of communication open, MEPs heard today from French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner, speaking on behalf of the Council Presidency immediately after the extraordinary European Council summit. However, he said EU leaders had decided to suspend talks on a new EU-Russia partnership agreement until Russia withdrew its troops.
Mr Kouchner pointed to the six-point agreement mediated by the EU in August, which had been only partly observed by Russia since it had not fully withdrawn its troops. He then turned to the key conclusions of the EU summit, which included firm condemnation of Russia's unilateral action and support for every country to choose its foreign policy and its alliances.
The EU would also help Georgia rebuild its economy and consider creating a free trade area with the country. By contrast, while not wanting to isolate Russia or move towards a new Cold War, the EU would now suspend talks on the new EU-Russia partnership agreement until Russia withdrew its troops to their pre-August 7th positions. Moreover, institutional cooperation with Ukraine would be stepped up.
Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner spoke first of the practical aid the EU had already provided: €6 million from the Commission plus €9 million from the Member States to cover urgent needs. A further €15 million would probably be needed for reconstruction, plus another €110 million to help the 22,000 displaced persons.
The Commissioner stressed that there could be no "business as usual" with Russia. Like Mr Kouchner, she was keen to maintain "communication" while also "sending a signal". Thus, existing processes should continue but no new initiatives should be started. Above all, she argued, "the EU has a legitimate interest in the region" because of the Neighbourhood Policy. The crisis had also underlined Europe's need for a coherent energy policy.
Political groups
On behalf of the EPP-ED group, Joseph DAUL (FR) described the situation in Georgia as "intolerable" and said Russia had "flouted the fundamental principles of international law". Europe must "use its political and economic clout" to pressure Russia into an immediate and total withdrawal from Georgian territory. Negotiations on a partnership agreement must be reviewed.
He also said the crisis showed the EU's weakness. Its energy supplies were at risk and it must look for alternative supplies. A European defence policy should also be a priority, and the Lisbon Treaty would help on this point. He concluded by saying that "Georgia does have a genuine EU and NATO vocation", and that "relations with Ukraine must be taken forward rapidly".
Hannes SWOBODA (PES, AT) reminded MEPs that mistakes had been made by the West and by Georgian President, Mikheil Saakashvili, but this did not excuse Russia which had exploited the situation for its own ends.
The EU should concentrate on helping its neighbours and helping to strengthen its neighbourhood policy. Russia is strong at the moment because of energy prices, he argued, but this may not last and Russia also has a lot to gain from proper co-operation with Europe. "The conclusions from today's Summit are good," he said, "but we now have to go for what is achievable and I hope the European Parliament will come up with similar conclusions to the Council."
Graham WATSON (ALDE, UK) agreed that it was important to condemn Russia's actions, but argued that "we will not persuade the Russian bear by backing President Medvedev into a corner"
He acknowledged that there are different views among the Member States over the way forward, but said that the six-point plan negotiated with Russia needed now to be fully implemented.
The EU needed now to make both sides listen. He called for the EU to convene a trans-Caucasian peace conference and called for an end to the "anomaly whereby Georgian citizens with Russian passports have freer access to the EU than those who do not".
Finally, he argued, Russia must face the consequences of its actions even if this means questioning the decision to hold the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.
Konrad SZYMAŃSKI (UEN, PL) said that three out of six points in the plan agreed with the French Presidency had not been implemented by Russia, making it "not fit to be a partner of Europe."
"Political and economic isolation leading up to presidential elections in 2012 is the only way to divide leaders in Moscow", he argued.
Daniel COHN-BENDIT (Greens/EFA, DE) suggested Europe should look at its fundamental relationship with Russia and at the whole approach to dealing with problems in the Caucasus. He argued that it will be impossible to move forward politically if we discuss the idea of Georgia and Ukraine joining NATO.
He also asked how we should control the actions of Georgian leader Saakashvili. "What the Russians did is unacceptable. But it is also unacceptable to bomb a city."
He suggested a privileged partnership with both Georgia and the Ukraine as a first step towards future participation, but argued that "we have to get rid of nationalism from the region" otherwise there would be no end to the violence. He recalled the words of former French President Mitterrand: "Nationalism is war".
Francis WURTZ (GUE/NGL, FR) said that adopting either a pro-Georgian or pro-Russian position was to take Europe up a blind alley. He criticised Saakashvili who, since his election in 2004, has talked about revenge against secessionist regions and taken his alliance with George Bush to extremes: "This strategy has been disastrous for Georgia and for Europe".
On the other hand, Russia has everything to lose if it heads isolation, he argued.
He agreed that observers should be sent in the context of the OSCE, but pleaded for a new pan-European treaty for security and co-operation dealing with non-rearmament, respect for borders and security of energy supply. Finally, he reminded members that 21 September is the International Day of Peace.
Bernard WOJCIECHOWSKI (IND/DEM, PL) said that he came from a country (Poland) which had suffered war and was in favour of peace everywhere. The East European states including the Baltic States wanted Russia to pay for its actions. The EU needs Georgia, he said, but it may need Russia even more. "The EU should not be party to this conflict and take sides. The EU needs an independent policy in relation to the US." Russia, he recalled, was the EU's third largest trading partner, and could we let this relationship suffer. He said the European Parliament was not a co-legislator on foreign affairs and question whether the voice was really being heard when "everything had already been done."
Sylwester CHRUSZCZ (NI, PL) said that the situation in Georgia was linked to the situation in Serbia and Kosovo. Breaking up Serbia was opening Pandora's box. Abkhazia and South Ossetia, he said, have their own cultural identities and were denied independence by Stalin. He said that Georgia's action depended on its friends. The international community should revisit its decisions on Kosovo. If the US can act in the Balkans, then Russia has the right to act in the Caucuses.
UK speakers
Jim ALLISTER (Northern Ireland, UK) said that the EU had shown ambivalence towards Georgia. Russia was "hardly shaking in its boots over the EU's divided reaction to Russian aggression". Mr Allister feared that Georgia would not be the end to this crisis and he questioned if Ukraine was next in line. The EU, he said, must move away from dependence on Russian energy.
Commencing in French, Christopher BEAZLEY (EPP-ED, UK) congratulated the French Presidency on its firm stance and united EU policy which was not the case in 2003. Continuing in English, he said the crisis was not only about Georgia, it is about values and whether Russia shared them, he said. If Russia does not withdraw its troops from Georgian territory it would not be possible to have an open dialogue. The EU can not surrender its values; investors were now withdrawing their finances from Russia due to Russia's instability. It was necessary, he said, to re-examine the Olympic Games in Sochi and the Nord and South stream pipelines.
Charles TANNOCK (EPP-ED, UK) said that Russia's actions were disproportionate, the EU needed to offer aid for the reconstruction of Georgia, and increase efforts on visa facilitation. NATO membership for Georgia should be supported and the EU must break Russia's stranglehold on energy supplies to Europe. The EU should support the White Stream pipeline that passes through the Caspian via Georgia and the Ukraine.

Georgia: Vote on resolution - MEPs say Russia must honour its commitments
2008-09-05 - 10:21
MEPs call on Russia to honour its commitments and withdraw its troops from Georgia, in a resolution adopted by the European Parliament. MEPs are in favour of a European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) monitoring mission to Georgia and ask the European Commission to propose visa facilitation and readmission agreements. They also call for a boost to the EU's neighbourhood policy and reaffirm the importance of Georgia in improving EU energy security. MEPs call on Russia to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Georgia and to honour all its commitments under the ceasefire agreement, beginning with the complete and immediate withdrawal of its troops. They strongly condemn the recognition by the Russian Federation of the independence of the breakaway Georgian regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
Otherwise, MEPs call on the Council and Commission to review their policy towards Russia. They back the European Council's decision to postpone the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement negotiations until the withdrawal of the Russian troops to their positions prior to 7 August.
In order to facilitate de-mining operations, MEPs call on the Russian and Georgian authorities to provide full information concerning the areas where their armies dropped cluster bombs.
Visa facilitation and international investigation
MEPs call on the Commission to propose visa facilitation and readmission agreements with Georgia at least equivalent to those for Russia.
MEPs demand that an independent international investigation be carried in order to establish the facts and bring greater clarity to certain allegations. The House urges Georgia, which ratified the Rome Statute of the ICC, and the Russian authorities to lend support to and fully cooperate with the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court.
European Security and Defence Policy monitoring mission
MEPs ask the Council to consider the deployment of an ESDP (European Security and Defence Policy) monitoring mission to complement the UN and OSCE missions. MEPs welcome, in particular, the decision to appoint an EU Special Representative for the crisis in Georgia.
Neighbourhood policy and energy dependence
The European Neighbourhood Policy should be developed and more adapted to "the needs of our eastern partners", including a strengthening of EU involvement in the Black Sea region, according to MEPs. They back the proposal to speed up the establishment of a free trade zone with Georgia, Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova.
The House stresses the importance of Georgia in improving EU energy security by providing an alternative to the Russian energy transit route. MEPs expect a strong EU commitment in pursuing the Nabucco pipeline project which would cross Georgia's territory. The need to diversify sources of supply is also underlined by MEPs.
Socialist group would have preferred mention of Saakashvili "inappropriate" initial action
Martin Schulz (PES, DE) said that the PES group would have preferred that a mention of Georgia's "inappropriate initial behaviour" at the start of the conflict be included in the joint resolution. In the negotiations with the other groups on the joint resolution this mention was not included.

Costa Rican President urges EU not to neglect Central America
2008-09-05 - 10:21
In a speech to the House on Wednesday, the President of Costa Rica, Óscar Arias Sánchez, urged Europe to support Central America's efforts to build a peaceful and prosperous society. In particular he called for the association agreement currently under negotiation with the EU to grant favourable trade terms to the region and for arms sales by outsiders to be discouraged. Introducing President Arias, EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering referred to his previous term as President of Costa Rica in 1986-90, when his work for peace in Central America had led to him being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. He described Mr Arias and his achievements as "a model for the whole world". The EP, Mr Pöttering stressed, was keen to see the association accord signed and he believed Mr Arias could play a key role in the negotiations. Costa Rica: a haven of peace in a turbulent region President Arias began by describing his country as one which had realised the ideal of "a society without an army" and would soon celebrate 110 years of democracy, even though it had been "surrounded by the most appalling dictatorships" in the second half of the 20th century. Constructive role by Europe still needed to aid progress in Central America He then recalled that twenty years ago Europe had played a positive part in helping to end the civil wars ravaging Central America. "Europe at that time was the answer to our prayers. The moral support of this continent legitimised our efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the conflicts". Now, however, "relations between Europe and Central America, so close in a time of war, have become distant in a time of peace". "We never imagined that in crossing the threshold of peace, we would enter the kingdom of oblivion", he said. Mr Arias then highlighted three courses of action that could help strengthen ties between Europe and Central America. Firstly, the signing of the planned EU-Central America association agreement, which contained provisions on free trade. He acknowledged that "in this House there are all kinds of views regarding free trade". However, he pointed out bluntly that for a small country like Costa Rica, "if we cannot export more and more goods and services, we will end up exporting more and more people". Secondly, said Mr Arias, "it is not a mark of honour that in 2007 Latin America's military expenditure reached 36,000 million dollars". To applause from the House, he argued "the developed nations of the world must not support, with aid and resources, the decision of those who prefer to equip their soldiers rather than educate their children". He called on Europe to support the Consensus of Costa Rica, "an initiative to create mechanisms for forgiving debt and supporting, with international resources, developing countries which investment more in environmental protection, education, health and housing for their peoples and less on arms and soldiers". He also urged backing for the Treaty on the Transfer of Arms, which bans arms transfers to states, groups or individuals suspected of using them to violate human rights or international law. Thirdly, to further applause from MEPs, he alluded to Costa Rica's efforts to set an example on the environment by becoming carbon neutral by 2021. "We are leading a global crusade against global warming and today I ask you, humbly, to join us". Concluding, the president said: "We are all members of a single species, which is still capable of plucking the best flowers from the garden of life. Our dreams are a common heritage and our decisions have an impact on the lives of others, whether we like it or not."

European Parliament welcomes release of Palestinian prisoners
2008-09-05 - 10:21
In adopting a resolution on the situation of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, MEPs welcome the recent decision by the Israeli Government to free 198 Palestinian prisoners on 25 August. This is "a positive gesture to strengthen the authority of the Palestinian Authority and to install a climate of mutual trust" says the resolution. The House also calls for the immediate release of the Israeli Corporal Gilad Shalit, abducted 25 June 2006 and held hostage since by Hamas. The resolution was put forward by four political groups (Socialist, Liberal, Greens/EFA and GUE/NGL) and adopted with 416 votes in favour, 136 against and 61 abstentions. A substantial release of Palestinian prisoners, as well as the immediate release of the 48 imprisoned members of the Palestinian Legislative Council including Marwan Barghouti, could serve as a positive step to establish the climate of mutual trust needed to make progress in the peace negotiations, says the resolution. According to MEPs, more than 11 000 Palestinians are being held in Israeli prisons and detention centres. Corporal Gilad Shalit MEPs call on Israel to guarantee that minimum standards of detention are respected, to bring to trial all the detainees, to put an end to the use of 'Administrative Detention', and to implement adequate measures for minors and for visits to prisoners. The Palestinian Authority is asked to make every effort to prevent any violent or terrorist acts, particularly by former prisoners, especially children. Palestinian children from the age of 16 years (instead of 18) are considered adults under Israeli military regulations governing the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and are often held in inappropriate conditions.

Industry
Parliament's rapporteurs set out their positions on the telecoms package
2008-09-05 - 10:21
MEPs debated the reform of the regulatory framework for electronic communications - including mobile and fixed telephones, broadcasting and the internet. The telecoms package seeks to strengthen consumer rights and privacy protection, to ensure a consistent application of regulatory measures and to modernise radio spectrum use. The entire European Parliament will vote on the package during the second September plenary (22-25 September 2008)
The revision of the framework directive must be justified, by benefits to consumers (easier, cheaper, faster access) and industry (fair competition, investment-friendly climate), said rapporteur Catherine Trautmann (PES, FR), who not ed that electronic communications account for 3% of the EU's GDP.
Ms Trautmann had sought to build trust among stakeholders, in order to build an appropriate "eco-system" for electronic communication technologies. This should help to stimulate industry, innovation and job-creation by enhancing the competitiveness of big and small companies, inter alia by encouraging investment in fibre-optic networks, she said, adding that the industry and the Council had generally responded positively.
She also stressed the need to build certainty as to the law, and to foster co-operation, both among regulators and between regulators and the Commission.
On remedies, Ms Trautmann observed that most people wanted rules to be applied more consistently, but opposed a Commission veto. Functional separation should require the agreement of both the Commission and the European regulators body, she added.
Finally, Ms Trautmann regretted that the intellectual property rights issue had arisen now, and felt that it should be resolved without substantially changing the proposal.
Mr Chatel (French minister) was absolutely right about the importance of electronic communications in developing a knowledge-based economy - already, they account for 25% of overall growth and 40% of productivity growth, said rapporteur Pilar Del Castillo Vera (EPP-ED, ES).
The "consistent, coherent and powerful concept" underlying Parliament's position is that of shared responsibility, she stressed. Shared, or co-responsibility, combined with ex-ante support for developing competitive potential, is the right response to telecoms market needs, she said, stressing the need clearly to define the structure, tasks and responsibilities of the body of regulators.
Furthermore, co-responsibility entails co-funding - funding by the Community alone would undermine consistency and coherence, she added.
Patrizia Toia (ALDE, IT), rapporteur on "reaping the full benefits of the digital dividend in Europe", stressed that an EU policy was needed to make the best use of the "digital dividend" (the new resources that will become available as radio spectrum is freed up by the switchover to digital). Radio spectrum, she argued, was "a public good" with "social value" that could be used to benefit all citizens, such as those in remote areas. In this way, the "digital dividend" can be used to overcome the "digital divide". Coordination at EU level was essential in this area.
Malcolm Harbour (EPP-ED, UK), rapporteur on "universal service, users' rights relating to networks and services, processing of personal data, protection of privacy, consumer protection cooperation", spoke of the need to give consumers clear information on prices, tariffs and contractual conditions as well as on ways of protecting themselves against threats to the security of their personal data. Good quality universal emergency services and the needs of disabled users were other points emphasised by Mr Harbour. In addition, "consumers are entitled to be informed about some of the problems they might encounter, whether it is potential for infringing copyright, whether it is potential for unauthorised use, whether it is potential for example for buying things that could damage their health like counterfeit medicines".
To help consumers, he asked "why should we not demand that electronic service providers carry public service messages in the same way that television channels do at the moment?"

Social policy
New plans on equality, employment law and social standards debated
2008-09-05 - 10:21
Most MEPs speaking in Brussels plenary debate on Tuesday (2 September) on the Commission's new "social agenda" welcomed the package of measures, though some said there were insufficiently specific and substantial. There will be a vote on a resolution on the whole package at the September II plenary (22-25 September) after a debate on the patient mobility plans. Commission and Council
Presenting "the largest package ever submitted by the Commission" to Parliament Commissioner Vladimír Špidla, responsible for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, stressed that "the 18 measures represent a first step towards the aim to share and strengthen Europe's social dimension". "Economic and social goals are two sides of the same coin and must be closely coordinated to people's benefit", he added.
According to Xavier Bertrand, French minister for employment and social affairs and president-in-office of the Council, "2008 must be the year for relaunching a social Europe. I believe all European actors want this". He said the Council presidency also wished to "tackle at the outset the question of the European social agenda, by coming up with practical measures".
The minister added that the Member States are linked by common values, which are the distinctive feature of the European social model. This he saw as "a trump card in globalisation as it emphasises the value of human capital". He also argued for an adaptation of the system through the introduction of "flexicurity" for both workers and employers.
Political group speakers
"My group sets great store by the definition of social justice", in the context of globalisation, stressed Joseph Daul (EPP-ED, FR). He welcomed the Commission's proposal but added that he would like to "go further on the basic issues such as demographic change, globalisation and poverty".
Mr Daul also welcomed the Commission's proposals on social dialogue as "a key feature of success". "The social field remains fundamentally an area for the Member States, and this can and must change", he said, while still stressing the importance of subsidiarity.
Martin Schulz (PES, DE) said that "many people were afraid that Europe no longer guarantees social protection". In his view "Europe is governed by the right, and so is aiming in the wrong direction - and that has to be corrected in the European elections", he stressed.
Mr Schulz acknowledged that "in the worldwide competition from Beijing to Brisbane we can only stand our ground if the EU's internal market is developed" but stressed that "we have to create a European added value that everyone benefits from".
For Graham Watson (ALDE, UK) "this social package constitutes a welcome step forward" in building "a Europe that aims to take care of its citizens". Mr Watson backed the proposal to revise the adjustment fund, "which is based on the solid Liberal principle that a job is the best source of welfare".
"The social dimension is what differentiates Europe from other powers such as the United States and China, said Jan Tadeusz Masiel (PL), for the UEN group. "These social values are a good example for the new Member States that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007", he added. Mr Masiel called on the European Commission to "send a strong signal to Member States to strengthen the social acquis, which serves the EU".
Jean Lambert (Greens/EFA, UK) said she was happy that the package recognised that "we have poverty" and welcomed "the sentiment". However, "concrete action is what we are really looking for", she added.
"The package in no way fulfils citizens' expectations", said Gabriele Zimmer (GUE/NGL, DE). "The package won't bridge the social divide", she stressed, adding that her group rejected the package "in its vagueness and misguided development".
"This social package is not really new" said Derek Clark (UK) on behalf of the IND/DEM group. "To fund this package, we need a prosperous economy", he stressed. "The EU is protectionist and is afraid of globalisation. Don't fight it. Don't combat it. Join it! Accept the rest of the world and the EU economy will increase", he said. He also underlined that the social policy is not a priority of the French presidency according to the speech by Mr Sarkozy in July in 2008.
Carl Lang (NI, FR) observed that "sadly, the European social model is now no more than a myth", as European society is in a state of "regression, anguish and social precariousness". We should prepare to reorganise the European social model around two concepts: "family policy and the reconquest of the social market (...) we must reindustrialise, without bowing to the quasi-religious dogma of free trade", he declared.
Rapporteur and Committee Chair
Referring to Martin Schulz's speech, Philip Bushill-Matthews (EPP-ED, UK), rapporteur on European Works Council, pointed out that the centre right is the largest group in Europe "because the people have decided it" and due to "the gap between the rhetoric of the left and the reality".
He welcomed the revised social package tabled by the Commission and stressed the important role of the Member States, the rights of non-workers, job creation and the need to involve SMEs in the decision process. Mr Bushill-Matthews welcomed the fact that there is an agreement between the social partners on the Works Council directive, even though he personally was not very much in favour of it.
Civil Liberties Committee Chairman Gérard Deprez (ALDE, BE), congratulated the Commission on its proposal to combat discrimination, because, he said, "we had feared that it would be limited to a mini-directive." He regretted that Parliament had not been consulted, but noted a degree of openness on the part of the Council on this dossier. Mr Deprez felt that some of the concepts used needed to be clarified. "But neither should the directive be emptied of substance by hasty recourse to concepts such as public order or public safety", as observed in certain Member States. Press release with related links

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Equality of men and women in the EU in 2008: for quality jobs
2008-09-05 - 10:21
More effort is needed to boost the quality of jobs and combat violence against women, says an own-initiative report on equality of men and women in the EU adopted by MEPs, the first to cover all 27 EU Member States. MEPs welcome a European Commission report on the same subject and back a twin-track approach to equality of the sexes, which, on the one hand, ensures equality between men and women in all EU policy areas and, on the other, puts in place targeted measures to reduce discrimination.
The report by Iratxe García Pérez (PES, ES), adopted by 563 votes for, 65 against and 61 abstentions, also underlines the importance of combating violence against women in the context of equality of the sexes.
Qualitative challenges
Although quantitative progress in women's employment is undeniable - the female employment rate has risen each year to 57.2%, i.e. 3.5 points higher than in 2000, qualitative progress remains problematic.
The male-female wage gap in the EU has remained steady at 15% since 2003, and sector-specific and job-specific segregation is not declining - in some countries, it is increasing. The proportion of company directors who are women is stagnating at 33%, and in politics, 23% of national MPs and 33% of MEPs are women.
More effort is also needed to reconcile family and professional life, say MEPs, noting a substantial decline in the employment rate of women with young children (down 13.6 points on average). Furthermore, three quarters (76.5%) of part-time workers are women.
Wage inequalities
MEPs are "worried" by the lack of progress in closing wage gaps between men and women. They back the proposal by the Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities to strengthen EU legislation by requiring employers to do wage audits and develop action plans to reduce the wage gap. They also call on Community institutions and Member States to declare 22 February an "International Equal Pay Day".
Women's participation in decision-taking
MEPs consider that the participation of women in decision-taking at local, national and European levels is inadequate. They call on the Commission, Member States and political parties to "envisage positive action to improve the situation". The report also notes that the use of electoral quotas has had a positive impact on the representation of women.
Reconciling family and professional life
Among the measures proposed to reconcile family and professional life, propose improving the framework agreement on parental leave by introducing incentives for fathers to take it, strengthening the rights of workers taking parental leave and making the rules on the duration of parental leave and payment more flexible.
Violence against women
Violence against women is a major obstacle to equality between men and women and is the most widespread human rights violation, say MEPs.
Finally, they also call on the Commission and Member States to combat organised crime and to take new measures to discourage demand for prostitution. Equality between women and men - 2008 Text, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 3 September)

Stereotypes in advertising continue despite EU efforts
2008-09-05 - 10:21
MEPs adopted an own-initiative report on how marketing and advertising affect equality between men and women. The report notes the continued widespread existence of male and female stereotypes despite various Community programmes to promote gender equality. The report was adopted with 504 votes in favour, 110 against and 22 abstentions. Incitement and the media The report calls on the EU institutions to monitor the implementation of existing provisions in European law on sex discrimination and incitement to hatred on the grounds of sex. MEPs call on the EU institutions and Member States to develop awareness actions against sexist insults or degrading images of women and men in advertising and marketing. The report calls on Member Sates to study and report on the image of women and men in advertising and marketing. Women in advertising MEPs note with extreme concern the advertising of sexual services, which reinforce stereotypes of women as objects, in publications, such as local newspapers, which are readily visible and available to children. The European Parliament notes that marketing and advertising portrayals of the ideal body image can adversely affect the self-esteem of women and men, particularly teenagers and those susceptible to eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Parliament calls on advertisers to consider carefully their use of extremely thin women to advertise products. Extremely thin women The report recommends that broadcasters, magazine publishers and advertisers adopt a more responsible editorial attitude towards the depiction of extremely thin women as role models and portray a more realistic range of body images and calls on advertisers in particular to consider more carefully their use of extremely thin women to advertise products. Prize for equality in all Member States The report also emphasises the need for good examples from a gender perspective in the media and advertising world in order to show that change is possible and desirable. The House emphasises the need for good examples from a gender perspective in the media and advertising world in order to show that change is possible and desirable. MEPs consider that Member States should make official the award of a prize by advertisers to members of their own industry, and a prize awarded by the public, to reward advertising which best breaks with gender stereotypes and presents a positive or status-enhancing image of women, men or relations between them.

UN level classification of hazardous substances to be incorporated into EU law
2008-09-05 - 10:21
MEPs adopted three legislative reports on the classification, labelling and packing of substances and mixtures. The first-reading agreement concerns the implementation of the UN level agreed, GHS (Globally Harmonised System) on classification, labelling and packaging of hazardous substances into EU legislation. The new rules are similar to existing EU rules (which will be replaced later) but certain technical change will have to be made. Parliament's rapporteur Amalia SARTORI (EPP-ED, IT) said: "An acceptable compromise has been reached. It gives the possibility to maintain the EU's international commitments, provides consistency between EU and UN legislation, is in line with the REACH regulation, provides for a better consumer protection and will help EU companies to become more competitive." Objectives The aim of the UN level agreed, GHS (Globally Harmonised System) system is to enable a judgment on a substance or mixture with respect to its hazardous properties (physical hazards and toxicity) and to provide a hazardous chemical with pertinent hazard labelling and information on safety measures (for example via labels, hazard pictograms and signal words ("danger" , "warning"). As with the current legislation, the proposed regulation is intended to be primarily a self-classification system for enterprises. The system aims at enhancing the protection of human health and the environment during the handling, transport and use of these chemicals. It is in line with REACH. Chemicals are manufactured and traded globally, and their hazards are the same around the world. Therefore the description of hazards should not differ between countries if the product is the same. Enterprises will save costs if they do not have to assess hazard information for their chemicals against different sets of criteria. If the same criteria are used to identify the hazards of chemicals and the same labelling is used to describe them, the level of protection of human health and the environment becomes more consistent, transparent and comparable throughout the world. Agreement with Council The compromise which has been agreed between representatives of the Parliament and the Council, aims to implement the GHS system into EU legislation. The new regulation will replace the existing EU directives on classification and labelling of substances which set forth an extensive system (3 key directives), but the current rules and the GHS are conceptually similar. The proposal aims to maintain the current level of environment and health protection, to keep the scope of the classification and labelling rules as close as possible to the existing EU system and to ensure a smooth transition to a new system based on GHS. The reclassification and labelling of most substances must be completed by 1.12.2010 for substances and 1.6.2015 for mixtures. The current Directives on classification, labelling and packaging will be repealed on 1 June 2015. During a transitory period both systems will be applied. • The regulation: - harmonises the classification, labelling and packaging rules for substances and mixtures; - obliges enterprises to classify their substances and mixtures themselves and to notify the classifications; - establishes a harmonised list of substances classified at Community level in Annex VI; - establishes a classification and labelling inventory, made up of all notifications and harmonised classifications referred to above. In the negotiations, MEPs managed to include several changes to the Commission's proposals wanting to guarantee a proper balance between the interests of consumers, the environment and industry: Member States shall appoint a body or bodies responsible for receiving information for formulating preventative and curative measures, in particular in case of emergency health response. Three years after entry into force the Commission shall assess possibility to harmonise information. Animal testing MEPs reiterate the commitment to reduce animal testing. Where new tests are carried out for the purposes of this Regulation, tests on animals within the meaning of Directive 86/609/EEC should only be undertaken only where no other alternatives, which provide an adequate reliability and quality of data, are possible. Tests on non-human primates are prohibited for the purposes of this Regulation. Tests on humans are not be performed for the purposes of this Regulation. Data obtained from other sources, such as clinical studies, can however be used for the purposes of this Regulation. Chemicals: classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures (amend. Directive 67/548/EEC and Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006) Chemicals (downstream legislation): Decision amending Council Directives 76/768/EEC, 88/378/EEC, 1999/13/EC and Directives 2000/53/EC, 2002/96/EC and 2004/42/EC in order to adapt them to Regulation (EC) ... on Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures, and amending Directive 67/548/EEC and Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 Chemicals (downstream legislation): Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 in order to adapt it to Regulation (EC) No... on Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures, and amending Directive 67/548/EEC and Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006

More competition in airline reservation systems - with protection for consumers
2008-09-05 - 10:21
MEPs adopted a first-reading legislative report on proposals to simplify and modernise the rules for the computerised reservation systems used by high-street and online travel agents to book airline tickets for their customers. MEPs believe this will mean more competition and therefore lower distribution costs, but they also want measures to ensure consumers get a fair deal - and can be presented with environment-friendlier travel options. Request for referral back to committee rejected
A request by the ALDE and PES groups to refer the package back to the Transport Committee was rejected by the House with 265 voting in favour, 300 against and 37 abstentions.
The Code of Conduct for computerised reservation systems regulates how travel bookings are managed by air carriers, the CRS companies (e.g. Amadeus and Sabre), travel agents and, where relevant, rail operators.
"The new code is designed to re energise the travel sector, so the sooner it is introduced, the sooner we see the benefits of that – lower air fares, more choice and greater transparency." said EP rapporteur Timothy KIRKHOPE (EPP-ED, UK) speaking in the plenary debate.
The existing Code includes strict requirements on non-discrimination between airlines which date from the time when the various CRSs were owned by airlines themselves. In most cases, the CRSs are now independent from airlines and the strict rules now have the effect of stifling competition and raising costs, according to the Commission, leading airlines to favour alternative approaches, such as selling tickets via their own websites.
Competition on price and service quality
The main aim of the Commission proposal is that airlines and CRSs should be able to negotiate freely the conditions of the distribution of air services. Systems should compete on price and service quality. Under the revision, the House believes, CRSs will have to compete more aggressively with each other for air carrier participation on the basis of lower booking fees and better service quality.
Offer train as an alternative
Parliament insisted that w here travel options are ranked, and where train services for the same city-pair are offered on the CRS, at least the best ranked train service or air-rail service must feature on the first screen of the principle display.
Definitions of parent carrier, control and participation in the capital
The only exception to this new freedom to negotiate terms of business concerns carriers who are the parent of a CRS – they must provide all the same information to other CRSs as they do to their own CRS. The text adopted by the European Parliament revises the key definitions of 'parent carrier' and 'control' to limit the influence of airlines over CRSs, but also to make an exception for accidental investments not conferring 'decisive influence' in the running of the CRS.
Data Tapes and Data protection
MEPs say that w here a system vendor operates databases in different capacities such as a CRS or as a host for airlines, technical and organisational measures must be taken to prevent the circumvention of data protection rules through the interconnection between the databases, and to ensure that personal data are only accessible for the specific purpose for which they were collected.
A price is an inclusive price
Where prices are shown in the principal display, and/or where a ranking based on prices is chosen, MEPs say that prices must be inclusive of the fares and of all applicable taxes, charges, surcharges and fees to be paid to the air carrier or rail-transport operator, and which are unavoidable and foreseeable at the time when shown on the display.
CO2 emissions
Parliament said that CRS should be encouraged to provide in the future easily understandable information about CO 2 emissions and fuel consumption of the flight. This could be shown via average fuel consumption data per person in litre/100km and average CO 2 emissions per person in g/km, and could be compared with data of the best alternative train/bus connection for journeys of less than five hours.

Transport
Make freight a higher rail network priority, says European Parliament
2008-09-05 - 10:21
The European Commission should allocate at least 40% of EU transport infrastructure appropriations to the railways and prioritise freight, to reduce the need for road transport, says an own-initiative adopted by the European Parliament with 541 votes in favour, 6 against and 15 abstentions. MEPs urge the Commission to concentrate EU co-financing on improving the efficiency, interoperability and upgrading of rail infrastructure, inter-modal hubs and other freight transport modes. The Commission should also define "green corridors", as exemplary inter-modal projects and encourage the shift to intelligent and environmentally-friendly transport modes so as to reduce accidents, congestion, noise, local toxic and non-toxic pollution, CO2 emissions, landscape and energy consumption, suggests the report. Europe's freight transport system must meet integration and sustainability challenges Members also stress that freight transport must meet pressing challenges to increase effective integration and sustainability, doing more to improve mobility and energy efficiency and to reduce oil consumption, polluting emissions and external costs. In an enlarged European Union, the use of more efficient logistics systems is part of the gradual integration of priority cross-border freight corridors, hubs and conventional networks, they say. Streamline administration To improve the transport system, the House advocates standardising and simplifying the administration of freight transport market authorities and simplifying customs rules at borders. It welcomes the decision to establish a maritime space without barriers and urges the Commission to ask the appropriate international associations and organisations to develop a single inter-modal document, with the assistance of the relevant associations and organisations. Solutions to the current blockages MEPs also urge the Commission to propose, no later than the end of 2008, a programme for strengthening cooperation between the Member States responsible for transport projects. This should assess and facilitate solutions to the current blockages, with particular attention to goods transport, taking due account of the added value of logistics. The Commission is also asked to support projects seeking the differential use of existing high-speed lines, e.g. for freight transport. Improve logistics education Finally, MEPs call on the Member States to give absolute priority to higher and further education in logistics and freight transport.

Guidelines urgently needed on state aid to ports, says European Parliament
2008-09-05 - 10:21
The European Parliament is urging the European Commission to adopt guidelines on state aid to ports by the end of this year. In an own-initiative report on European ports policy adopted by MEPs, the House urges the Commission to identify possible distortions of competition and to clarify in the state aid guidelines what types of aid to port authorities should be treated as state aid. MEPs also look at ways to upgrade the port system to meet the EU's future transport needs. The own-initiative report adopted with 572 votes in favour, 12 against and 10 abstentions on the Commission communication on European Ports Policy, points out that the EU port sector is expanding fast and that the maritime sector is particularly affected by globalisation. It highlights the need to take account of major changes in international traffic resulting from technological and economic progress, the widening of the Panama Canal and the increase and size of capacity of vessels. Links to port hinterland Members also stress that maritime and river transport should not be isolated from land and air transport. Given that links to a port's hinterland are of great importance to its commercial success, one aim of the 2010 mid-term review of the trans-European network should be to integrate maritime and river transport with land transport via European ports, they say. Customs controls Parliament also recommends that Community-cleared goods should be exempt from customs controls in short-sea shipping in the Community. It advocates creating separate port zones for intra-community and international traffic, simplifying internal transport, and standardising and identifying special containers. It calls on the Commission and the sector to encourage shipping companies to reduce the number of empty containers transported, so as to reduce environmental impact, whilst at the same time taking account of the specific needs of clients. Social dialogue in the port sector The House urges that a social dialogue be established on port-related subjects, including worker's rights, concessions and the 1979 International Labour Organisation Convention on the occupational safety and health of dock workers. It also stresses the importance of protecting and ensuring the highest possible standard of training for port workers. Scanning US-bound cargo Finally, MEPs urge the Commission to pursue its efforts to win a reform of the US regulation requiring that 100% of US-bound cargo be scanned. It urges the Commission to evaluate the potential cost of this measure to busin Text, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 4 September)

Environment
Mid-term review of the European Environment and Health Action Plan 2004-2010
2008-09-05 - 10:21
In adopting an own-initiative report on the mid-term review of the European Environment and Health Action Plan 2004-2010, the European Parliament acknowledges the efforts made by the Commission since the action plan was launched in 2004. It considers, however, that such an action plan is bound to fail at least in part, since it is designed solely to accompany existing Community policies. The report was adopted with 522 votes in favour and 16 against. MEPs say the action plans is not based upon a preventive policy intended to reduce illnesses linked to environmental factors, and it pursues no clear, quantified objective. MEPs regret the fact that the Commission has not provided sufficient funding for human biological monitoring in 2008 to enable it (as it had promised Parliament and the Member States) to introduce a consistent approach to biological monitoring within the EU. They call on the Commission to respond by 2010 to two essential objectives: - Make members of the general public aware of environmental pollution and the impact thereof on their health; - Adapt European risk-reduction policy. MEPs recommend that the Member States meet their obligations as regards implementation of Community legislation and that the Commission does not weaken those laws under pressure from lobbies or regional or international organisations. Vulnerable groups : MEPs stress that, when it comes to assessing the impact of environmental factors on health, consideration should be given first and foremost to vulnerable groups such as pregnant women, newborn babies, children and the elderly. Those who are the most susceptible to pollutants should be protected by specific measures to reduce exposure to indoor environmental contaminants in healthcare facilities and schools. A new dynamic approach to protection based on the precautionary principle: MEPs claim that the EU needs to apply a continuous dynamic and flexible approach to the Action Plan and that it should acquire specific expertise on the subject of environmental health, to be based on transparency and on a multidisciplinary and adversarial approach which would thus enable the general public's distrust of official agencies and committees of experts to be countered. Although there have been genuine advances in environmental policy in recent years, MEPs state that EU policy still lacks a comprehensive preventive strategy and fails to apply the precautionary principle. The Commission should revise the criteria as regards recourse to the precautionary principle pursuant to European Court of Justice case-law, in order to ensure that an action and security principle based on the adoption of provisional and proportionate measures lies at the heart of Community health and environment policies. Air quality : MEPs call once again upon the Commission to come forward as soon as possible with concrete measures on indoor air quality. The Commission is called upon to draft appropriate minimum requirements to guarantee the quality of indoor air in buildings to be newly built. MEPs recommend that, in awarding individual European Union support, the Commission bear in mind its impact on the quality of indoor air, exposure to electromagnetic radiation and the health of particularly vulnerable sections of the population. They also call for environmental quality standards for priority substances in water to be laid down. MEPs point out that certain Member States have successfully introduced mobile analysis laboratories (or ‘green ambulances’) to enable habitat pollution in public and private places to be diagnosed swiftly and reliably. They consider that the Commission could promote such a practice within the Member States which have not yet acquired such a means of direct intervention at a polluted site. Dangers of new technologies : MEPs are concerned about the lack of specific legal provisions to ensure the safety of consumer products containing nanoparticles being put on the market. They are greatly concerned at the Bio-Initiative international report on electromagnetic fields, which highlights the health risks posed by emissions from mobile-telephony devices such as mobile telephones, UMTS, Wifi, Wimax and Bluetooth, and also DECT landline telephones. It notes that the limits on exposure to electromagnetic fields which have been set for the general public are obsolete. They do not take account of developments in information and communication technologies or vulnerable groups, such as pregnant women, newborn babies and children. Mental health : MEPs call on the Commission to pay attention to the serious problem of mental health, considering the number of suicides in the EU, and to devote more resources to the development of adequate prevention strategies and therapies. To conclude, MEPs urge the Commission and Member States to acknowledge the advantages of the prevention and precautionary principles and to develop and implement tools enabling potential environmental and health threats to be anticipated and countered. They recommend that the Commission cost the 'second cycle' of this action plan and make provision for appropriate funding covering a larger number of practical measures to reduce environmental impact on health and to implement prevention and precautionary measures. Lastly, they urge the Council to take a decision without delay on the proposal for a regulation establishing the Union Solidarity Fund Text, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (clik on 4 September)

MEPs move towards cross-border motor insurance
2008-09-05 - 10:21
In adopting an own-initiative report on motor insurance in Europe, MEPs welcome the Commission’s report on certain issues relating to motor insurance. The report highlights the importance of including, fully and effectively, all stakeholders, in particular consumers, in the process of consultation in the development of EU policy. The report underlines the importance of increasing consumer confidence in motor insurance policies as regards cross-border motor vehicle travel within the EU. The report calls for the systematic involvement of consumer organisations representing in particular victims in the process of evaluation of the effectiveness of the systems in place in the Member States. The report underlines the importance of increasing consumer confidence in motor insurance policies as regards cross-border motor vehicle travel within the EU, especially for motorists from the old Member States travelling to destinations in the new Member States and vice versa. The Commission is invited to continue to closely monitor the effective functioning of market mechanisms and to report periodically to Parliament on this issue. MEPs consider, in line with the generally established EU approach on sanctions, that the principle of subsidiarity should be applied and that there is no need for the harmonisation of national penalty provisions. They recommend, with reference to the reasoned offer/reply procedure, leaving to the discretion of Member States the imposition of sanctions and the choice of which types and levels of provision are appropriate. Member States are called upon to ensure that in the event of non-compliance with the three-month deadline for submitting a reasoned reply to the claim for compensation or a reasoned offer of compensation, the penalties introduced are effective. MEPs reiterate the importance of boosting citizens’ confidence in the functioning of the claims representative system by promoting it through public campaigns and by other appropriate measures. Insurers are required to include the contact details of the information centre in the Member State in question in their contractual information package. They are also, as part of the pre-contractual information package, to provide comprehensive information to consumers on how the claims representative system works and what are its uses and benefits to the insured party. MEPs consider that, in relation to Motor Third Party Liability insurance, the negative effects of introducing a system of compulsory cover of legal costs in Motor Third Party Liability insurance would outweigh the potential benefits. The Commission is invited to take, in partnership with Member States, the further steps necessary to raise awareness of legal protection insurance particularly in the new Member States, focussing on informing consumers of the advantages of being offered and holding one or another type of insurance cover. The European Parliament considers in this context the role of national regulatory bodies to be crucial for the implementation of best practices from other Member States. The House calls on those Member States that do not have established alternative dispute resolution systems for settling claims to consider introducing such systems based on best practice from other Member States. British and Irish speakers in the debate Diana Wallis (UK) for the ALDE group said: " Mr Mladenov’s report makes a very important contribution to the ongoing work. It is clear that claims need to be simplified as much as possible and the three month period has to be respected. Accident trauma must not be increased by legal trauma. We know that there are complicated issues of conflict of law that this Parliament wanted to solve in our approach to the Rome II Regulation." Malcolm Harbour (EPP-ED, UK) said: " I want to build on some of the points that a number of my colleagues have made, particularly Diana Wallis and Andrew Schwab. Diana and I have been involved in this area since we came to Parliament in 1999, and therefore understand its importance. It is probably fair to say that if Parliament had not consistently raised these issues with the Commission and said that the motor insurance regime, and particularly its cross border aspects for mobile motorists, was deeply unsatisfactory, then we would be where we are now, and nowhere close to the fourth Motor Insurance Directive and perhaps looking forward to a fifth." Colm Burke (EPP-ED, IE) said: "As a legal practitioner who has dealt with cross border claims, it is not all rosy in the garden as might be suggested in the report. While I welcome the report, some of the kind of problems that I have come across are problems where there is legal cost insurance and where the claimants are finding it difficult to recover costs on the basis of it. These claimants have gone through court procedures and expended monies in order to validate their claims and then find that, on the one hand, the insurer of the offending party which caused the accident is not paying the full costs of putting the case together, and on the other hand, their own insurance company, with whom they had insurance for covering legal costs, is also not paying up and is walking away from its responsibilities."

Time to get serious on tax fraud say MEPs
2008-09-05 - 10:21
€200-250 billion that should reach national budgets is thought to be lost to fiscal fraud. VAT fraud alone accounts for some €40bn a year – ten per cent of the total receipts. Parliament says it is time for Member States to get serious in tackling this problem and is calling for reform to the VAT system and the Savings Tax Directive. A report drawn up by Sharon BOWLES (ALDE, UK) and adopted on Tuesday (2 September) with 391 votes in favour to 93 against with 178 abstentions says some Member States have shown a “blockading attitude” in the last ten years when it comes to tackling tax fraud.
VAT system based on taxation in country of origin?
It says that in the long run a VAT system based on taxation in the country of origin of goods would be a solution to VAT fraud in cross-border supplies, but this would require a clearing system for sharing revenue. The best solution, say MEPs, would be to impose a 15 per cent tax on intra-community supplies (they are presently exempt with tax charged when they are sold on in the destination country). A decentralised clearing house system for rebalancing payments between Member Sates (because of the differential rates of VAT) could be rapidly developed.
Caution over the reverse charge mechanism
Another much discussed proposal to tackle missing-trader fraud in the VAT system (where the company selling goods or services, which should pay VAT receipts to the tax system, is a sham organisation which vanishes) is to make the customer account for the tax instead of the supplier, except where the customer is a private individual. This “reverse-charge” mechanism would indeed solve this missing-trader problem, MEPs note, but they are concerned it might create new opportunities for fraud elsewhere as well as a heavy administrative burden for businesses and are cautious about introducing it on a wide scale.
The report also calls for more cooperation between Member States’ tax authorities in tacking fraud.
Remove loopholes in Savings Tax Directive; eliminate tax havens
Turning to taxation of savings and other financial income, MEPs want to see action against tax avoidance, a widening of the scope of the Savings Tax Directive and action through the OECD to tackle uncooperative tax havens. The EU should keep the elimination of tax havens at worldwide level on the agenda.
Parliament regrets that Member States are hindering reform of the Savings Tax Directive and says it needs to be updated to remove loopholes and deficiencies. They ask the Commission to investigate some widening of its scope regarding legal entities and sources of financial revenue.

Asylum: MEPs point out at the unsatisfactory results of the Dublin system
2008-09-05 - 10:21
In an own-initiative report adopted by the European Parliament, MEPs call on the Commission to complement the Dublin system with measures in order to make it fairer for migrants as well as member states, by sharing the work of examining asylum applications and ensuring better rights for claimants. Detention should be used only as a last resort solution, MEPs say. MEPs adopted the own-initiative report by Jean LAMBERT (Greens/EFA, UK) by 609 votes in favour, 53 against and 30 abstentions. They ask the Commission to add a provision restricting the detention of Dublin claimants to a measure of last resort, thereby specifying the grounds on which detention may be employed and the procedural safeguards which should be provided for.
Overview of Dublin regulation evaluation
The Dublin regulation establishes the criteria and mechanisms to determine the Member State responsible for examining an application for asylum. The report is an evaluation of the original regulation which was adopted in 2003. The report is a response to the evaluation presented by the Commission. It highlights current weaknesses in the regulation, not least the widely differing standards towards the assessment of asylum cases between Member States, which undermines the regulation. The report puts forward suggestions for amendment, particularly in relation to broadening the definition of 'family member', ensuring that Dublin claimants are detained only as a measure of last resort, and addressing the need for increased responsibility sharing between Member States.
The report says that that unless a satisfactory and consistent level of protection is achieved across the EU, the Dublin System will always produce unsatisfactory results from both the technical and the human viewpoints, and asylum seekers will continue to have valid reasons for wishing to lodge their application in a specific Member State to take advantage of the most favourable national decision-making.
Financial mechanisms
The report calls on the Commission, pending the introduction of European burden-sharing mechanisms, to consider providing for mechanisms other than financial within the Dublin Regulation to correct the adverse effects of its implementation for the smaller Member States at the Union’s external borders.
Family reunification and the principle of the best interest of the child
MEPs regret that the definition of a family member under the current Regulation is too restrictive and asks the Commission to extend the present definition to include all close relatives and long-term partners, particularly those who have no other family support, and adult children unable to care for themselves.
MEPs consider that where an asylum seeker is in a particularly vulnerable state owing to a serious illness, a severe disability, old age or pregnancy, and he or she is therefore dependent on the assistance of a relative present in the territory of a Member State other than the one in charge of the examination of the application, he or she should, as far as possible, be reunited with that relative.
MEPs also ask the Commission to cooperate with third countries in order to ensure that ensure that those countries meet their international legal obligations.
Data-collection and Eurodac
The House expresses its concern at the discrepancies and deficiencies in the collection of data revealed by the Commission's evaluation of the Dublin system, especially in relation to the registering of fingerprints of illegal entrants at the borders of the Union, which casts serious doubts on the validity of the system. Report from the Commission on the evaluation of the Dublin system Text, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 2 September)

Improving judicial cooperation in Europe
2008-09-05 - 10:21
MEPs adopted three reports which on Improving judicial cooperation in Europe. The subjects of the reports are mutual recognition between Member States of court decisions rendered in absentia, strengthening of the Eurojust system and the European Judicial Network. Mutual recognition of judgments rendered in absentia
The report by Armando França (PES, PT), adopted by 609 votes in favour, 60 against and 14 abstentions, follows a proposal by 7 Member States for common rules to be laid down on the recognition and enforcement of judicial rulings handed down in a Member State other than the one in which the person concerned is to be found.
The EU wants to create a common area for justice, which requires the mutual recognition of criminal law judgments by the Member States. Four framework decisions already deal with different aspects of this matter: the European arrest warrant, financial penalties, confiscation orders and prison sentences.
However, in practice national judicial systems diverge and in many cases of trials held "in absentia" the person concerned can argue that he/she was not informed of the procedures or was not summoned before the courts in accordance with the rules (which differ from one state to another). As a result the "enforcing" Member State does not enforce the judgment, since one condition for a fair trial is that the defendant should be properly informed.
To reduce legal uncertainty, Parliament is proposing to define cases in which enforcement can be refused. It stresses the importance of duly summoning the individual concerned as well as the right to a retrial and the right to be represented by legal counsel. However, the report also emphasises that the fact of summoning a person to court is not in itself enough to guarantee a fair trial and that the system of a retrial does not exist in all Member States. It therefore proposes that this could take the form of a right to an appeal.
Lastly, the report calls for defendants to be given information in a language they understand and for them to have the right to legal representation, possibly paid for by the state.
Strengthening of Eurojust
The report by Renate Weber (ALDE, RO), adopted by 615 votes in favour, 64 against and 16 abstentions, relates to a proposal by 14 Member States to strengthen the European judicial cooperation system in criminal law matters. This system, known as Eurojust, was set up in 2002 following a decision by the Tampere European Council of 1999. While it has been transposed into national law by all the Member States, the text establishing the system has given rise to various national interpretations.
The report therefore proposes the creation of a common basis of equivalent judicial powers for all national members when they are acting as the national authority of their Member State. It also calls for links between Eurojust and the European Judicial Network to be strengthened through the creation of a national coordination system. And it wants it to be made compulsory for Eurojust to be given the information it needs.
In addition, Parliament wishes to beef up data protection, especially when data is forwarded to a third country. It also seeks to add the fight against the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography to Eurojust's priorities. Lastly, the EP wants the right to oversee the activities of the network.
European Judicial Network
The European Judicial Network (EJN) was set up by a Joint Action in 1998. It consists of contact points at national level which provide each other with practical and legal information in order to facilitate judicial cooperation.
The report by Sylvia-Yvonne Kaufmann (GUE/NGL, DE), adopted by 618 votes in favour, 51 against and 12 abstentions , looks at a proposal by 14 Member States seeking to replace the existing framework while preserving its structure and content. It strengthens the communication system between contact points through a more secure telecommunications network and clarifies relations between the EJN and Eurojust.
Parliament believes the EJN is functioning well. However, it wishes to strengthen data protection by referring to the framework decision due to be adopted at the plenary session in late September (Roure report). It also emphasises the ideas of selection criteria and training sessions for the contact points, to improve the operation and use of the network. Judicial cooperation: enforcement of decisions rendered in absentia; European arrest warrant; surrender procedures between Member States; application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties; application of the principle of mutual recognition to confiscation orders; application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments in criminal matters imposing custodial sentences or measures involving deprivation of liberty (amend. Framework Decisions 2002/584/JHA, 2005/214/JHA, 2006/783/JHA, 2008/.../JHA). Initiative Slovenia, France, Czechia, Sweden, Slovakia, United Kingdom, Germany Strengthening of Eurojust (amend. Decision 2002/187/JHA). Initiative Belgium, Czechia, Estonia, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia, Sweden European Judicial Network.

McCann inspired written declaration on emergency cooperation in recovering missing children formally adopted
2008-09-05 - 10:21
The written declaration on emergency cooperation in recovering missing children, inspired by the disappearance of Madeline McCann on 3 May 2007, was formally adopted in plenary with 418 MEP signatures. More than half of the total 785 MEPs need to sign a written declaration for it to become the official position of the European Parliament. The declaration will be recorded in the official minutes of the plenary session of 2 September 2008. The written declaration brought forward by Edward MCMILLAN-SCOTT (EPP-ED, UK), Roberta ANGELILLI (UEN, IT), Glenys KINNOCK (PES, UK), Evelyne GEBHARDT (PES, DE) and Diana WALLIS (ALDE, UK) calls on Member States to introduce a missing child alert system, the activation of which would require the immediate forwarding to the relevant news media, border authorities and customs and law enforcement agencies of details of: – the missing child, with a photograph if available – information relevant to the disappearance and/or the suspected abductor(s) – a telephone number to call with information (116 000 where operational). EP Vice-President Mr McMillan-Scott speaking on the adoption of the declaration said: "I'm grateful for the support from the majority of MEPs who have given political impetus in what so far has been rather a bureaucratic process. We need to encourage Member State governments to take up the mantle. If we can afford to issue severe weather warnings, we can also afford to issue warnings about missing children. Since 2003, 400 American children have been found - 80 % within the crucial first 72 hours - through the Justice Department's Amber Alert. Only France has a similar state-funded 'severe weather warning'-style missing child alert, which uses TV and radio flashes, messages on motorway gantries and town centre information boards." EP Vice President Diana Wallis said: "Following a productive meeting with Justice minister Dati yesterday, I am now working together with the French Presidency to produce an concrete outcome in time for the December Council. We need to convince all Member States that ad hoc cooperation is not enough - territorial objections cannot stand in the way of such an initiative either - we need something more systematic and coordinated. In cases of child abduction, time is of the essence." The declaration calls on the Member States to reach cooperation agreements with all bordering states to ensure the capacity to raise an alert rapidly across any relevant territories. The declaration calls for the development of a common organisation to provide assistance and training to national bodies and points out that there is no Europe-wide alert system for child disappearances nor any local or national systems throughout much of the European Union. The declaration, together with the names of the signatories, is now forwarded to the Commission and the Council.

Fisheries and Aquaculture in the context of Integrated Coastal Zone Management
2008-09-05 - 10:21
MEPs adopted a non-binding report (652 votes in favour to 14 against and 25 abstentions) on "Fisheries and Aquaculture in the context of Integrated Coastal Zone Management in Europe", the European Parliament stresses the importance of aquaculture to the food industry for social and economic development in some EU coastal communities. Furthermore, "aquaculture for repopulation purposes is an essential tool to achieve ecological conservation in certain coastal zones, and it must therefore be promoted, stimulated and financially supported", MEPs say.
The report drawn up by Ioannis GLAVAKIS (EPP-ED, EL) emphasises that the European Fisheries Fund can contribute to the long-term funding of measures within the framework of Integrated Coastal Zone Management in Europe (ICZM) since it supports actions which contribute to the sustainable development of fishing regions.
The European Parliament says that aquaculture projects which use renewable energy sources and which do not infringe areas protected under EU environmental law should be given priority under ICZM. According to MEPs say that greater research efforts should be made in aquaculture with a view to introducing closed-circuit intensive-production cultivation systems.
The House calls on the Commission, after consulting Member States, to set a clear timetable for examining progress in the implementation of ICZM in the EU.
The importance of proper spatial planning
The implementation of integrated-management policies involves the planning in coastal areas of population-related, tourism-related and economic uses and of landscape and environmental protection.
According to Ioannis GLAVAKIS, "the viability of fishing and aquaculture is being affected by the very rapid transformation of natural coastal areas into artificial surfaces". Between 1990 and 2000 it is estimated that artificial surfaces spread by 190 km2 annually. 61% of this expansion is due to housing, tourism and recreation displacing other activities.
"Regional planning has so far been land-based and has failed to take into account the impact of coastal development on certain marine activities. This has led to limits on fishing grounds and the degradation of marine habitats, i.e. the feeding, spawning and reproduction areas of some species. At the same time, lack of space is also a basic obstacle to the development of European aquaculture", stresses the report, emphasising the importance of proper spatial planning.
This report is the Parliament's reaction to the Commission communication of 7 June 2007 entitled "An evaluation of Integrated Coastal Zone management in Europe".

Fisheries
Management of non-tuna species in the Southern Indian Ocean
2008-09-05 - 10:21
MEPs adopted a report (646 votes in favour to 26 against and 14 abstentions) on the conclusion of the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement. This new Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (RFMO) will exercise its responsibilities for the effective conservation and management of non-tuna species in the high seas of the Southern Indian Ocean. The Community has fishing interests in the South Indian Ocean and is also a Coastal State on behalf of Réunion. In 2000, the South Indian Ocean fishing states (the Comoros, France, Kenya, Mozambique, New Zealand and Seychelles) and the European Community together with FAO took the initiative to launch the process of setting up a new regional fisheries organisation (Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement).
The Community signed the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA) on 7 July 2006, in conformity with the Council Decision No. 2006/496/EC adopted by the Council on 6 July 2006. On 21 December 2007, the European Commission forwarded to the Council a proposal for a decision on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Community, of the SIOFA. The Council decided on 30 January 2008 to consult the European Parliament on this agreement and sent a request for consultation.
The only amendment adopted by the European Parliament concerns the legal basis of this dossier, since the committee considers that it is not a case of consultation, but rather of assent. Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Text, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 2 September)

Hydrogen powered motor vehicles - supply network essential say MEPs
2008-09-05 - 10:21
Parliament adopted (644 votes in favour to 2 against and 11 abstentions) a legislative report on hydrogen powered motor vehicles. MEPs point out that the successful introduction of hydrogen-powered vehicles on the European market will also depend on whether the appropriate hydrogen filling station network can be established in time. The House said that the Commission should, therefore, look into measures to support the establishment of a Europe-wide filling-station network for hydrogen powered vehicles.
The purpose of this proposal is to lay down harmonised technical provisions for the type-approval of hydrogen-powered vehicles for the first time. There is a need to introduce EU-wide approval criteria for such vehicles, to safeguard not only the operation of the single market but also a high level of safety and environmental protection. Since hydrogen-powered vehicles are not at present included in the EC type-approval system, Member States may grant approvals for such vehicles on a one-off basis without having to lay down new laws. In such a practice there is a risk that every Member State will draw up its own approval conditions, resulting in distortion of the single market. This would lead to high costs for manufacturers, create safety risks and also considerably impede the spread of hydrogen technology in the EU. For these reasons the rapporteur regards the Commission proposal as an important step towards obtaining alternative fuels for the transport sector.
In other parts of the world – such as in the United States or the Asian economic area – work is also proceeding on the development of hydrogen-powered vehicles. Here too the question of type-approval comes up. The EU’s negotiations at international level for approval conditions applicable worldwide are bound to take some while yet. An EU type-approval regulation could point the way forward for an international approval system.
Arlene McCarthy MEP (PES, UK) said: "At a time when petrol prices in Europe have doubled and with ever growing concern about the effects of climate change it is clear we need new hopes for future fuels."
Sale of alternative fuelled vehicles in the UK alone has grown from just a few hundred in 2000 to over 16'000 last year. Arlene McCarthy MEP added: "Sales of electric cars and other alternatives have soared but hydrogen cars are only on the cusp of large scale production. This new law will boost the development of these vehicles while ensuring they are reliable and safe".
Pure hydrogen in the future
In the future, hydrogen powered vehicles should be vehicles propelled by pure hydrogen produced as far as possible from renewable energies. Use of mixtures of hydrogen and natural gas/biomethane to propel vehicles must be no more than a transitional technology say MEPs.
Motorcycles
The regulation’s scope should also be expanded to include motor-cycles. And she also favours ensuring that rescue services are able to identify the hydrogen power source of such vehicles. For this purpose there are, in addition to the labelling scheme to be introduced initially, various longer-term options such as eCall (which automatically sends a signal to rescue services from the vehicle in the event of an accident), or a central database in which the vehicle’s technical data are stored independently of the vehicle’s owner and can be interrogated by accident rescue services.
Emergency services
The European Parliament also says that it must be possible for rescue services to identify the hydrogen power source of a vehicle. Motor vehicles: type-approval of hydrogen powered vehicles (amend. Directive 2007/46/EC) Text, as adopted, by the EP will be available here (click on 3 September)

MEPs call for ban on animal cloning for food
2008-09-05 - 10:21
The European Parliament called for a ban in the EU on the cloning of animals for food supply. MEPs also urged an embargo on imports of cloned animals, their offspring and products derived from these sources. In a resolution adopted by 622 MEPs in favour, 32 against and 25 abstentions, the House calls on the Commission "to submit proposals prohibiting for food supply purposes:
the cloning of animals,
the farming of cloned animals or their offspring,
the placing on the market of meat or dairy products derived from cloned animals or their offspring, and
the importing of cloned animals, their offspring, semen and embryos from cloned animals or their offspring, and meat or dairy products derived from cloned animals or their offspring."
Animal health problems and risks for the European quality model
The text refers to the health, welfare and higher mortality problems of cloned animals and their surrogate dams recently highlighted by several groups of European experts, including the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Group on Ethics. MEPs also stress that cloning would significantly reduce genetic diversity within livestock populations, increasing the possibility of whole herds being decimated by diseases to which they are susceptible.
In addition, the European Parliament fears that use of cloning techniques would harm the image of the European agricultural model, which is based on product quality, environment-friendly principles and respect for stringent animal welfare conditions. They also point out that Directive 98/58/EC on the protection of farm animals bans natural or artificial procedures which are likely to cause suffering or injury to any of the animals concerned.
Currently no products derived from cloned animals are sold in Europe or the rest of the world. However, experts believe that such products could reach the market by 2010. A moratorium on the sale of this type of product, introduced in the USA in 2001, was challenged by the US Food and Drug Administration, which concluded in January that meat and milk from clones of cattle, pigs and goats and their offspring are as reliable as those of traditionally bred animals.
European Commission quizzed
During the debate (2 September), MEPs quizzed the European Commission on its position and its plans as regards animal cloning. "Not only is it a case of food safety, we in Europe believe that we are producing food quality products", EP Agriculture Committee Chairman Neil Parish (EPP-ED, UK) said. "It is also a question of animal welfare and consumer confidence" and there is a "risk of producing less strong and healthy animals". He stressed "we have to look at this seriously".
Mr Parish said: "Cloning entails serious health and welfare problems for clones and their surrogate dams; animal health problems come from invasive techniques required to produce a clone; there is the suffering of surrogate dams which carry cloned foetuses, and high levels of ill health and mortality in early life for cloned animals. I call on the Commission to submit proposals prohibiting the cloning of animals in the food supply and the placing of cloned animals on the market in meat and dairy products."
Androula Vassiliou , the Commissioner for health and food safety, said that the Commission was closely following scientific developments in this area and "is aware that even though the efficiency of animal cloning has improved over the last years, adverse health effects on animal health and welfare still occur today". The Commission "is now evaluating the necessary steps to be taken" and "takes ethical considerations fully into account", including the opinion of the European Group of Ethics which "advocated that at the moment there are no convincing arguments to justify the production of food from clones and their offspring". "According to global trade rules, imports of food products from third countries might be suspended if they present a serious threat to animal or public health. On the basis of the studies conducted and the opinion of EFSA, the Commission will consider whether restrictions must be imposed", she added.

External/international trade
Developing countries growth to be boosted by opened trade in services
2008-09-05 - 10:21
Pursuing both progressive and reciprocal opening of access to the service market in trade negotiations is stressed by MEPs in a report adopted by 525 votes in favour to 77 against. This would give access to entrepreneurs of developing countries to a wider range of service. The own-initiative report reiterates that liberalisation of services is important for both developed and developing countries. The efficiency gains that could be obtained thanks to opening markets to services competition could allow less developed countries to provide a greater range of services for their citizens. The importance of universal, accessible and sustainable services with affordable prices and high-quality standards is underlined in the report drafted by Syed Kamall (EPP-ED, UK).
The House stresses the need to allow developing countries political space regarding the level of reciprocity in the opening up of trade by enabling them to decide for themselves the depth and the speed at which liberalisation may be pursued.
Services make up an ever increasing percentage of GDP of nearly every economy, 75% for EU, 78% for North America, 52% for Africa and 60% for Asia.
MEPs underline the need for rules and standards to govern liberalisation. MEPs of the Trade Committee encourage compliance with environmental and quality standards, "without constituting unnecessary barriers to trade". Trade regulations must comply with ILO social standards.
The House recognises the existing distinction among the different nature of services, especially the need to distinguish between commercial and non- commercial services; stresses the need for a differentiated approach in opening the markets in services of general interest.
ACP and ASEAN regional agreements
MEPs support the achievement of full Economic Partnership Agreements with the ACP countries that cover not only goods but also services and investment, thus enabling those countries' integration in the global economy. They also support the agreement on Mode 4 in the EU-CARIFORUM Economic Partnership Agreement. Mode 4 is the possibility for citizens from the Caribbean to work temporarily in the EU.
They also call for universal, accessible, sustainable and affordable public services with high-quality standards to be ensured for all.
On the EU-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (FTA), MEPs say that the aspects of the agreement affecting public procurement, investments and services should "recognise the varying level of development of ASEAN members".
The European Commission is asked to pursue a balanced package with an ambitious offer in services, especially in financial services, where the European industry has competitive expertise and has a strong potential for growth, says the report.

Human rights
Making EU sanctions more coherent and effective
2008-09-05 - 10:21
The House adopted on Thursday (4 September) a resolution by the Foreign Affairs Committee calling for the European Union to improve the way it uses sanctions as a foreign policy instrument. The report highlights the need for greater coherence in the use of sanctions, including better analysis and impact assessments, to make EU sanctions more effective. The House adopted the own-initiative report, drafted by Hélène Flautre (Greens/EFA, FR), chair of the Human Rights Subcommittee, by 546 votes to 36, with 40 abstentions. Assessment, analysis and benchmarks seen as crucial The resolution, which is a general review of EU sanctions policy, welcomes the "systematic inclusion of human rights clauses" in all new EU bilateral accords with third countries but highlights the fact that "no evaluation or impact assessment has been carried out in respect of the EU's sanction policy and it is therefore extremely difficult to gauge the policy's impact and effectiveness". Greater effectiveness would require, for example, "in-depth analysis of each specific situation prior to the adoption of sanctions" and "clear and specific benchmarks as conditions for the lifting of sanctions". MEPs also deplore the use of "sunset clauses" providing for sanctions to be lifted automatically. Sanctions must be part of human rights strategy The EP believes that "a sanctions policy will be much more effective when it forms part of a coherent human rights strategy" and therefore calls on "the Council and the Commission to devise a specific strategy on human rights and the situation as regards democracy as part of each country strategy paper". It recommends the creation by the Commission of a "network of independent experts" to advise on sanctions. But it also urges that sanctions be systematically accompanied by "positive measures to support civil society, human rights defenders and all kinds of projects promoting human rights and democracy". Targeted sanctions preferred so as to spare populations Since general economic sanctions can cause great suffering to the population of a country, the EU has shifted towards "smart", targeted sanctions aimed at regime leaders, such as the freezing of bank accounts and travel and visa bans. The EP stresses that such sanctions must be observed more strictly through a "concerted approach" by Member States. It also calls for measures against EU-based economic operators who flout such sanctions. In a new departure, MEPs suggest that sanctions should be imposed where the authorities are guilty of "voluntary and irreversible degradation of the environment". They also say measures should be envisaged against "non-state entities" (e.g. mercenaries or multinationals) which undermine security and human rights. Use of blacklists to fight terrorism On the controversial question of "blacklisting" individuals and organisations as part of the fight against terrorism, the report as adopted says that "the system of anti-terrorist lists", provided it respects recent EU case-law, is "an effective instrument of European Union anti-terrorist policy". However, it calls on Council and Commission "to review the existing procedure for blacklisting and delisting, in order to respect blacklisted individuals' and entities' procedural and substantive human rights". Moreover, "the evidence leading to blacklisting is based primarily on information held by the secret services", notes the report, and MEPs call for effective parliamentary control over the work of those services, including a role for the EP. Allegations of double standards Lastly, MEPs deplore "the fact that the EU has often applied its sanctions policy inconsistently, by treating third countries differently even though their human rights and democratic records are similar, and thus triggering criticism for applying 'double standards'". The EU's policies on Russia and Cuba are pinpointed, and the invitation to Robert Mugabe to attend the EU-Africa summit in December 2007 is criticised.

Human rights: coup in Mauritania, hangings in Iran, albino killings in Tanzania
2008-09-05 - 10:21
In three resolutions on democracy and human rights adopted at the end of this week's Brussels plenary session, the European Parliament condemned the recent coup in Mauritania, the continuing execution of minors in Iran and a wave of killings of albino people in Tanzania.
Coup in Mauritania
In the resolution on Mauritania, MEPs criticise the coup of 6 August, when President Sidi Mohamed Ould Cheikh Abdallahi was ousted by a group of high-ranking generals whom he had dismissed from office earlier that day.
Parliament "condemns the military coup", and particularly "regrets this setback, given "the notable advances made in the development of democracy and the rule of law over the past few years in Mauritania". Elections held in 2006 and 2007 had been regarded as fair and transparent by international observers.
The EP "calls for the current political tensions in Mauritania to be resolved within an institutional framework reflecting the transition to democracy, and for the constitutional order and civilian rule to be restored as soon as possible". Noting the announcement of new presidential elections by the junta, the resolution "calls on the military in power to commit themselves forthwith to a timetable for the restoration of the democratic institutions in cooperation with the political forces".
The resolution demands the immediate release from house arrest of President Sidi Mohamed Ould Cheikh Abdallahi, Prime Minister Yahya Ahmed el-Waghef and other members of the government. According to the EP, a solution to the crisis will require "full respect for the constitutional legality of the powers of the President and the parliament". Any adjustment to the balance between executive and legislature must take place in the framework of the constitution and "following a large-scale debate including all political forces".
The international community's role
MEPs back the African Union's efforts to seek a rational solution to the crisis. However, they note that the people of Mauritania will need aid as they are already severely affected by the economic and food crises. They call on the Commission "to implement the support projects for civil society under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights".
A freeze on EU aid?
At the same time, the Commission is urged "to engage in a political dialogue, pursuant to Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement". Should it not succeed, Parliament calls for "the reactivation of Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement", which could lead to the freezing of aid, excluding food and humanitarian assistance. The resolution calls for Parliament to be kept informed by the Commission and also for an EP delegation to be sent as soon as possible to Mauritania.
During the debate preceding the vote, External Affairs Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner told the House that on 2 September the Commission had formally initiated the process requiring consultation with Mauritania under Article 96, the first step towards possible suspension of aid.

Hangings in Iran
Parliament returns once again to the high level of executions in Iran, especially of juveniles, and urges the authorities to change their policy and legislation on this matter.
The resolution, which notes that notes that 29 simultaneous executions took place in Evin prison in Tehran on 27 July 2008, "strongly condemns the growing number of executions, and urges the Iranian authorities to establish a moratorium on the death sentence with a view to abolishing the death penalty in accordance with the resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 18 December 2007".
Execution of juveniles
In particular, Parliament is "profoundly saddened at the recent execution of several juvenile offenders in Iran, making Iran the only country in the world where this grave and inhumane punishment is still practised in 2008".
MEPs call on the Head of the Judiciary, Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Sharoudi, "to systematically commute all death penalties for juvenile offenders". A number of individual cases are cited. The Majlis (Iranian parliament) is asked "to urgently amend legislation in order to ensure that no-one is executed for a crime committed when less than 18 years of age". The resolution also backs efforts in Iran to introduce a separate legislative and court system for juvenile offenders.
Backing for human rights defenders, condemnation of stoning
MEPs condemn "the persecution and imprisonment of citizens in Iran who engage in the defence of human rights and campaign against the death penalty, and are frequently charged with 'activities against national security' ". Here too, individual cases are cited.
While welcoming the recent announcement of the suspension of stoning as a means of execution, the EP voices concern that in the penal code reform currently before the parliament, stoning for certain forms of adultery is being maintained. It calls for "the full abolition of stoning".

Killing of albinos in Tanzania
Parliament is shocked at reports that a number of albino people have been killed in Tanzania. While welcoming the swift response so far from the Tanzanian authorities, MEPs call for further steps to be taken, and for the EU to give support. This resolution was adopted by roll-call vote, with 93 votes in favour, 0 against and 0 abstentions.
According to NGOs and media reports, confirmed by the Government of Tanzania, at least 25 albinos, including children, have been killed and mutilated since March 2008 in the Lake Victoria region. Belief in witchcraft is also a problem there, and according to the Tanzanian authorities the killings of albinos are the work of organised gangs hired by witch-doctors. They sell severed body parts and blood from albinos to miners and fishermen, who believe that these parts can bring them luck, health and fortune.
Action by Tanzanian authorities
In its resolution, Parliament strongly condemns the killings and the speculative trading in their body parts. It welcomes the promise by Tanzania's President Jakaya Kikwete of concentrated efforts to end these crimes and his decision to nominate Ms Al-Shymaa Kway-Geer as the first albino member of parliament. Steps taken by the government are also welcomed but the EP endorses a call by Tanzanian MPs for more to be done.
The resolution "calls on the Tanzanian authorities, local government authorities and civil society in general to collaborate in order to protect all albinos", it "urges the Tanzanian Government to undertake immediate action, promoting social awareness and providing information related to albinism" and it "considers that such measures should particularly be implemented in rural areas, where people tend to be less educated and more superstitious".
Arrests of suspects, but threat to investigating journalist
The arrest last month of 173 suspects in connection with the killing of albinos is welcomed but the EP "notes with regret that an investigative journalist, Vicky Ntetema, has gone into hiding after receiving death threats for exposing witch-doctors and police involvement in the killings". It urges the authorities to investigate.
EU support for local efforts to protect albinos
Turning to what outsiders might do to help, MEPs urge the European Commission to support the work of the Albino Association of Tanzania, including the latter's call on academics, religious leaders and human rights activists "to make the public aware that the killing of albinos is socially and morally unacceptable".
More generally, the resolution calls on the Commission and Member States to support the efforts of the Tanzanian Government, NGOs and civil society to formulate policies to address the needs and rights of albinos, promoting non-discrimination and access to employment.
