The twofold discrimination immigrant women suffer based on origin and gender is highlighted by the Women’s Rights Committee in a report adopted on Wednesday, which proposes ways to promote their integration into the EU. Accessing the labour market, education, language training and information about rights are some of the measures put forward.
Immigrant women's awareness of their rights is important to facilitate their smooth social integration and to protect them from discrimination. The report, drafted by Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou (EPP-ED, EL), calls on the Member States to ensure language education and information concerning fundamental human, political and social rights and democratic principles in the host country is available.
MEPs call on the Member States to create favourable conditions for immigrant women to access the labour market and to balance their professional and private life. The report also underlines the importance of promoting access of young women immigrants to education and training systems.
Combat all forms of violence
The report urges the Member States which have not done so "to ensure that effective and deterrent penalties apply under their criminal codes to all forms of violence against women and children, particularly forced marriage, polygamy, crimes of honour and female genital mutilation".
MEPs call on Member States, on the basis of their national legislation and the International Conventions, to "guarantee respect for the fundamental rights of immigrant women, whether or not their status is regular, particularly access to justice, legal aid, accommodation facilities and health care."
