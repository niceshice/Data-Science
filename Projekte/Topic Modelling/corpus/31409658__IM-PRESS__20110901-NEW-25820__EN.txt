EU border guards set to get new powers and new watchdog
2011-09-08 - 13:01
European border guard teams would patrol the EU's outer borders by the end of 2011, and EU border control agency Frontex would hire an inspector to ensure that EU border checks respect human rights, under plans to be voted on Tuesday. Under changes to the Frontex mandate, already provisionally agreed by Parliament and the Council, the agency itself could buy or lease its own equipment, such as cars or helicopters, rather than depending on what Member States allocate to it. Member States would also be prohibited from withholding equipment pledged to Frontex.
European border guard teams, which should boost efficiency by combining today's "joint support teams" and "rapid border intervention teams", would be formed by national guards assigned by Member States to joint operations, rapid interventions and pilot projects.
The draft text would also require Frontex to hire a fundamental rights officer and set up a consultative forum on fundamental rights, to assist the agency's management board. The officer would have access to all information relating to respect for fundamental rights.
The agreement also requires Frontex to promote solidarity among Member States, especially those facing "specific and disproportionate" migratory burdens.

Energy: wholesalers may have to disclose deals
2011-09-08 - 13:01
New rules to prevent abuses in wholesale energy trading, and thus protect final consumers, will be put to a vote on Wednesday. Wholesale trading is to be independently monitored EU-wide, to enable Member States to prevent and punish anti-competitive behaviour. The EU Regulation on energy market integrity and transparency (REMIT) would govern all wholesale energy trading in the EU, and specifically contracts and derivatives for the production, supply and transportation of natural gas and electricity.
Deals would be monitored by the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), which would supply data to EU Member States, to help them to investigate breaches of the regulation and enforce remedies.
To balance ACER's powers with those of national regulators, its Director would be required to consult them on REMIT issues, but would not be bound by their opinions.
At Parliament's request, all wholesale energy traders in the EU would be registered and national penalties for breaches of the regulation would have to reflect damage done to consumers.
Next steps
The text of this regulation has already been informally agreed with the Council. Once a formal first-reading agreement is reached, it would take effect 20 days after its publication in the EU Official Journal

Parliament's Budgets Committee will approve its position in the first half of October, followed by a plenary vote on 26 October.
Parliament and Council will then have a 21-day "conciliation" period, starting on 1 November, in which to agree.

Libya, Syria and famine in East Africa
2011-09-08 - 13:01
The latest developments in Libya and Syria will be debated on Wednesday, and the famine in the Horn of Africa on Thursday. Resolutions on Syria and East Africa will be voted on Thursday, and on Libya at the September II session. MEPs will look at ways to support the Libyan people and help rebuild the country. The EU recently banned oil imports from Syria in response to President Bashar al-Assad’s crackdown on pro-democracy protestors.
Conflict and drought have hit 11 million people in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and Djibouti. As the crisis is expected to persist at least until next year, MEPs will call for increases in humanitarian aid.
MEPs will also debate efforts to revive the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and Palestine's intention to seek UN recognition of its statehood in mid-September.
Debate: Wednesday, 14 September (Libya and Syria) and Thursday 15 September (famine in East Africa)

Counter-terrorism policy: weighing costs and benefits
2011-09-08 - 13:01
Counter-terrorism measures taken in Europe since the September 2001 attacks on New York and Washington should be properly assessed with regard to their cost, effectiveness, and impact on civil liberties, says a controversial resolution to be put to a vote on Tuesday. Ten years after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, it is time to assess whether the counter-terrorism measures taken so far are proportionate to evidence of the terrorist threat and how they affect civil liberties, says the draft resolution.
MEPs also urge the Commission to draw up a map of all existing counter-terrorism policies at EU and national levels, to serve as a basis for this assessment.
Cost of counter-terrorism policy
The European Commission should prepare a detailed report on all EU funds used for counter-terrorism purposes, such as spending for staff, IT systems and databases.
It should also establish what share of these costs are paid by the private sector and which business sectors benefit from counter-terrorism policies, says the draft resolution.
The resolution was approved in the Civil Liberties committee with 29 votes in favour and 24 against. The EPP, ECR and EFD groups voted against.

Offshore drilling: call to step up environment protection
2011-09-08 - 13:01
No EU Member State should allow offshore drilling for oil or gas until it has received and approved a "site-specific contingency plan" to protect the environment, says a resolution to be put to the vote on Tuesday, with a view to forthcoming legislation. Requiring site-specific plans for all drilling, to be approved by the relevant Member State before any drilling begins, would better protect the environment, says the resolution, with a view to new draft legislation to be tabled this autumn.
On financial liability, the resolution suggests that all oil and gas operators be required to show, as part of the licensing procedure, that they have "sufficient financial capacity in place to secure remediation in relation to environmental damage caused by the specific activities they carry out".
Parliament will also propose that whistleblowers be protected, by enabling employees to declare any security breaches or risks anonymously, without fear of harassment.
Background
The resolution is Parliament's reply to a Commission consultation paper issued last October in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010.
It also follows on from an EP resolution of October 2010 on EU action on oil exploration and extraction in Europe. The Commission will unveil new draft legislation early this autumn.

Stepping up the fight against corruption in EU countries
2011-09-08 - 13:01
MEPs are urging the Council and Commission to ensure that all EU countries give a firm political commitment to combat corruption and enforce rules to prevent it. A resolution is to be voted on Thursday. Corruption costs the EU economy €120 billion per year, a sum almost equivalent to the EU annual budget, according to a package of anti-corruption proposals tabled in June.
This package, to be debated Wednesday, warns of corruption's "corrosive impact" on Member States’ financial resources, the economic integrity of markets and the trust of citizens in their governments.
Parliament will vote on a resolution on Thursday.

MEPs set to deplore lack of Doha trade deal
2011-09-08 - 13:01
Parliament's reasons for regretting the lack of progress in the Doha world trade liberalisation talks will be set out in a resolution to be voted on Tuesday. It now seems that there will be no deal on outstanding Doha Development Agenda (DDA) issues at the Ministerial Conference to be held in Geneva on 15-17 December 2011.
In their draft resolution, MEPs note the need for a Doha deal to stimulate worldwide economic recovery, stress that development should be at the heart of the trade talks and demand at least some results for least-developed countries.

Protecting the environment and promoting respect for EU citizens’ fundamental rights remain key priorities for the Petitions Committee, says its 2010 activity report, to be put to a plenary vote on Wednesday.

Raw material use: efficiency and international co-operation
2011-09-08 - 13:01
EU industry needs to use raw materials far more efficiently, in co-operation with international suppliers, and also to recycle more, says a resolution to be put to the vote on Tuesday. Global demand for commodities such as iron ore and aluminium, far outstrips supply, notes the resolution.
International co-operation with suppliers such as Russia, Australia or Brazil can help to ensure raw materials are used more efficiently, but should also address environmental and social needs, it adds.
