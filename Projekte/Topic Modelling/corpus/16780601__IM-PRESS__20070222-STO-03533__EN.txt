Dalit children - "untouchable"?
India's 160 million Dalits are a poor and segregated group whose members are regularly discriminated against, assaulted and even murdered. Often these crimes go unnoticed or unpunished. In a resolution adopted at their last Plenary session MEPs called on the Indian government to ensure that Dalits have equal protection before the law. The resolution says that the enforcement of laws for Dalits is "grossly inadequate" although it acknowledges the Indian Constitution does make provision for them.
Limited access to jobs, education, healthcare
Dalits are not included in Hinduisms four groups or castes (priestly, warrior, business or supportive workers). This 3000 year-old caste system was formally abolished by the Indian Constitution in 1950.
Dalits are largely segregated from the rest of the Indian population with limited access to jobs, education and healthcare. Extreme poverty, scavenging on rubbish tips and exploitation of their labour are just three things Dalits must cope with in India. Exploitation of child labour and landlessness are two other problems they face.
The resolution adopted by MEPs on 1 February calls on the Indian government to improve their legal protection.
Equal access to Courts, police stations, institutions say MEPs
Among the measures MEPs called for are improvements to the criminal justice system. Over 10 Dalits a week are murdered and the resolution demands improvements in the registration of offences and speeding up of Court procedures giving Dalits greater legal access and justice.
MEPs would also like the Indian authorities ensure that Dalits have equal access to police stations, public institutions and polling booths.
However, the resolution did not meet with universal approval as some MEPs complained about the tone of the resolution being unnecessarily harsh on the Indian authorities.
Raise discrimination at highest level, says resolution
In terms of measures the EU can take the resolution calls for European Ministers and the European Commission to raise the issue of caste-based discrimination when they meet Indian counterparts.
MEPs believe that EU-development programmes should focus on minorities. They would also like to see the private sector promote equal opportunities - the growing trade links between the EU and India could provide an opportunity for this.
Previous Parliamentary resolutions in November 2005 and 2006 requested improvements in the rights of minorities in India.
