New VAT system Schengen: MEPs to call for fair decision on whether Bulgaria and Romania can join
Was it "fair" or "legal" for the Netherlands and Finland to block a bid by Bulgaria and Romania to join the Schengen border check-free area? MEPs say the candidates already meet all Schengen membership requirements, and should not be held hostage to populist discourse. Parliament will put the question to the Commission and the Council, and vote a resolution on Thursday.
Getting ready for the European Council
Topics for the 23 October European Council in Brussels will be debated Wednesday with the Council and the Commission. Economic policy, particularly EU competitiveness and growth, and preparations for the next G20 Summit and the Durban conference on climate change, both in November, are high on the agenda.
MEPs to discuss the situation in Yemen and Bahrain
The latest developments in Yemen and in Bahrain are on the agenda for a Wednesday evening debate with the Council.
New rules on firearms exports
New EU export control rules for civil-use firearms, such as sports and hunting weapons, will be put to a vote on Thursday. The bill has already been informally agreed with the Council. Parliament wants to ensure maximum safety, but also to preclude unnecessary checks on hunters and sports shooters leaving the EU temporarily.

MEPs to reaffirm support for Bulgaria, Romania joining Schengen
MEPs want same rules to apply to all ©Belga/EPA MEPS will stand up for the right of Bulgaria and Romania to join the Schengen border-free area under the same conditions as the other 22 members Wednesday.
The EP gave a green light for their membership of the Schengen area on 8 June, but on 22 September the Netherlands and Finland blocked the bid indefinitely, demanding that the two countries meet additional criteria because of concerns about corruption and organised crime.
MEPs say Bulgaria and Romania already meet all Schengen membership requirements and call on member states to honour their commitments and include the two countries in the Schengen zone.
On Wednesday MEPs will ask Council and Commission if they believe it was "fair" and "legal" to apply extra criteria which were not foreseen from the beginning.
In a resolution to be voted Thursday, the EP says additional criteria cannot be imposed on Member States already in the process of joining the Schengen area. It calls on Member States to include Bulgaria and Romania in the Schengen area on the basis of Schengen requirements and and not to give priority to national populism.
Following the decisions by the Netherlands and Finland, EP President Jerzy Buzek called on "those member states that blocked Romanian and Bulgarian Schengen entry to reconsider their position".
Allowing new countries to join the Schengen area requires the unanimous approval of all 22 EU states who are members. Schengen area Schengen includes 22 EU states (the UK, Cyprus, Ireland, Romania, Bulgaria aren't members), Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland 3 questions to the Council and Commission - Wednesday Motion for resolution to be voted on Thursday Buzek's press release 8 June resolution
Opening of the session: Middle East developments, Tymoshenko sentence
Buzek condemns violence in Egypt Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek welcomed progress towards democracy in the Middle East, but condemned recent violence there, at the opening of this week's Brussels plenary session. He also condemned the 7-year jail sentence imposed on Ukrainian opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko on 11 October.
Mr Buzek welcomed the advent of stability in Libya, albeit with concern for the plight of refugees. He also welcomed the fact that Tunisia seemed to be heading for free elections, and said he would visit it in the coming weeks, to convey Parliament's wishes for neighbourly co-operation.
He condemned recent violence in Egypt, calling on the authorities there not to foment discord and to promote religious tolerance. He also condemned recent violence in Syria and Yemen, calling on the international community to "stand up to their brutal regimes".
Tymoshenko sentence "politically motivated"
The seven-year jail sentence imposed on Ukraine's former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko was a "politically-motivated act" and a case of "selective application of the law" said Mr Buzek, stressing that proper application of the law is a prerequisite for any EU-Ukraine co-operation agreement.

Turbulence among EU's neighbours: MEPs debate Arab uprising, Ukraine
Yemeni anti-government protesters shout slogans and wave flags of Bahrain and Syria during a protest against Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, in Sana'a, Yemen ©Belga/EPA The political situation in many countries surrounding the EU continues to cause concern. On 12 October, MEPs reviewed developments in several neighbouring countries with High Representative Catherine Ashton. "There is a special role for this House to play" helping those defending democracy, she told MEPs in statements ranging across the violent clashes seen in Egypt following a Coptic Christian protest, continuing anti-government protests in Yemen, Bahrain and Syria and the 7-year jail sentence given to Ukraine's opposition leader, Yulia Tymoshenko.
Middle East
Ms Ashton said she was shocked by Sunday's events in Egypt. The Egyptian uprising belongs to the whole population of Egypt who should all have the chance to participate in free and fair elections later this year, she said. She also criticised the use of the death penalty in Bahrain and the use of military, rather than civil courts in cases brought against doctors and nurses who helped people during the demonstrations. The High Representative said more sanctions are in the pipeline against Syria and called on "Yemen’s President (to) match words and deeds" and facilitate peaceful solutions.
For the EPP group Hans-Gert Pöttering said, "many Christians were killed and this must concern us greatly...but let’s not make a mistake, demonstrators on Sunday were not only Christians, there were also Muslims demonstrating in peace."
Kristian Vigenin , on behalf of the Socialists, urged Ms Ashton to contact the authorities and encourage them to prosecute perpetrators. For ALDE Kristina Ojuland said freedom of religion and the right to peaceful protest must be protected, while Barbara Lochbihler , speaking for the Greens, said the EU should focus efforts on civil society and those defending non-violent change. Fiorello Provera for the EFD wants the EU to focus on providing social support to facilitate the development of freedom and democracy.
British Conservative Charles Tannock called on the EU to support the freezing of Syrian assets, while for the GUE/NGL group Marisa Matias warned against the use of double standards, noting that for example there has been "complete silence" about the invasion of Bahrain by Saudi forces.
Ukraine
Turning to the sentencing of Yulia Tymoshenko , Ms Ashton said the ruling was politically motivated. "Selective and politically-motivated justice is not the EU way," she said. Ukraine must understand that it has to respond to the disapproval voiced by the EU, she added, urging the country to move towards a fair and transparent process. She also warned that an EU-Ukraine association agreement could only be signed if it is clear the two sides share common values, a stance strongly supported by MEPs.
Jacek Saryusz-Wolski of the EPP said,"if the Ukrainian government continues to abuse power it will put the European perspective at risk." Socialist Hannes Swoboda added, Kiev isn't meeting the pre-conditions for a higher level relationship.
Rebecca Harms for the Greens said there should be no agreement until democracy is properly established in Ukraine, while Liberal Johannes van Baalen said that the EU must be very clear about what it asks for Ukraine and what it will do if Ukraine doesn't meet its demands.
For the ECR Marek Migalski strongly condemned Ms Tymoshenko's arrest and called on the EU to condemn the government's treatment of the opposition. Catch up on the debate Parliament and human rights
Schengen: Bulgaria and Romania should not be made hostages to populism, says Parliament
Schenge membership must be based on rules - MEPs©Belga/EPA Member States should avoid national populism and allow Bulgaria and Romania to join the Schengen border check-free area solely on the basis of existing membership criteria, says the European Parliament in a resolution passed on Thursday. MEPs call on the European Council to take the necessary measures to enable both countries to join.
Following the Dutch-Finnish decision on 22 September to block Bulgaria and Romania's bid, Parliament voted, by a large majority to reiterate its support for including both countries in the Schengen area.
Bulgaria and Romania "have fulfilled all the criteria" for joining, MEPs insist. They have fully implemented the Schengen rules, which is "the only prerequisite for their accession" to the border-free area.
Parliament urges all Member States to decide on their membership "solely on the basis of the Schengen acquis and procedures". Additional criteria cannot be imposed on these two countries, stresses the EP, asking Member States to honour their commitments and "not to give priority to national populism".
MEPs rejected an amendment that would have asked the Commission to present proposals to strengthen the Schengen acquis, by incorporating in it additional criteria concerning organised crime and corruption.
Border security: Bulgaria and Romania are reliable partners
"Both countries have fundamentally redesigned and reorganised their integrated border management systems by investing substantially in their law enforcement authorities (...) and have visibly reinforced their institutional and legal frameworks", underlines the resolution.
The EP notes the "constant support and solidarity shown by Bulgaria and Romania as reliable partners" in south-eastern Europe, along with their continual contribution to border security in this part of the EU.
"Bulgaria and Romania deserve to be in the Schengen area. They meet all required criteria. Their borders are secure. I urge all Member States to take the decision on enlarging the Schengen area to Bulgaria and Romania solely on the basis of the Schengen acquis and procedures. Bulgaria and Romania should be able to count on solidarity and fairness from their EU partners", said the President of the European Parliament, Jerzy Buzek.
Procedure: Non-legislative resolution
Euro crisis: MEPs demand harmonised actions and reforms
Mr Barroso during the debate Parliament calls for an EU road map to exit the crisis in a resolution passed on Thursday. It advocates recapitalising European banks, further harmonising national tax systems, issuing eurobonds and strengthening EU economic governance arrangements for the eurozone.
MEPs urged the European Commission to table an EU plan to restore financial market confidence, with a clear timetable for putting it into effect. The plan should not use intergovernmental instruments and should operate entirely within the EU institutional framework, they said.
Parliament believes that bank recapitalisation should be carried out at EU level and not be based on national priorities. The reform of European financial market regulation should also be completed, to make the EU economy better able to withstand future crises, and member states should harmonise their fiscal systems and take common measures to combat tax fraud, says the text.
Eurobonds and project bonds
On the growth front, MEPs call for the introduction of project bonds to sustain investments and for a mechanism allowing the Commission to enforce EU market rules quickly.
To tackle the crisis in the euro area, the Commission should report on the feasibility of introducing eurobonds on the basis of joint liability by the end of 2011, say MEPs, stressing that this would help strengthen fiscal discipline and increase eurozone stability through the markets. Finally, EU-level economic governance for the euro countries should be reinforced, says the text.
Next Steps
The resolution will be put to the European Council in Brussels on 23 October. European Council
