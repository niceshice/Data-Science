Hans-Gert Pöttering meets Ecuadorian youngsters in Madrid During a visit to Spain, the manner in which students from Ecuador are integrated into Spanish society was witnessed by Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering. He visited an immigration centre for Latin-American students (CEPI) from Ecuador on 3 October. During the visit he saw firsthand how such centres promote intercultural dialogue by boosting the active and responsible participation of immigrants in society.
The visit took place during an official visit to Spain between 2 and 4 October. In Madrid, Pöttering met a number of leading political figures including Spanish Prime Minister, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Miguel Ángel Moratinos and the leader of the opposition Mariano Rajoy.
Among the items discussed were the Lisbon treaty, the economic crisis and the situation in Georgia. Also discussed was the proposed Mediterranean Union, the Middle East peace process and the Spanish Presidency of the EU in 2010.
Speaking during the visit Mr Pöttering underlined that human dignity is at the core of European values. "When someone is coming from far away and wants to live with us, we should welcome that person like a brother, a close one, and treat him as an equal" he said.
