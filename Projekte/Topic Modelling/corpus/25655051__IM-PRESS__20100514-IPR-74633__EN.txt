The second summit of the Union for the Mediterranean being held in Barcelona on 7 June is taking place in difficult circumstances but MEPs are demanding that the process be given a fresh boost in the form of extra funding. Only in this way can it achieve its goals of bringing countries in the region closer together.
The fresh impetus needed by the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) will require a historic commitment by heads of state and government to provide adequate funding for major projects and consolidate the institutions underpinning the process, says a resolution drafted by Vincent Peillon (S&D, FR) and adopted by show of hands on Thursday. The UfM has undergone a period of political stagnation since the Gaza conflict of December 2008, even though meetings of ministers and senior officials resumed in September 2009.
A major part of the UfM's new projects must be devoted to teaching, school and university exchanges and research, including upgrading the Erasmus Mundus programmes for the Mediterranean and the creation of a Mediterranean "Erasmus Junior", to expand educational exchanges between the Member States of the UfM, believe MEPs.
The UfM, launched in July 2008 in Paris, was intended to revitalise the Barcelona process by structuring cooperation with the Mediterranean countries around six major projects (civil protection, maritime and land highways, de-pollution of the Mediterranean Sea, a Mediterranean solar energy plan, the Mediterranean Business Development Initiative and a Euromediterranean university) and envisaging the creation of a permanent secretariat from the beginning of March 2010.
Adequate funding
Today's resolution proposes that the secretariat be given increased funding to enable it to function properly. The secretariat, headed by the Jordanian Ahmed Maas'deh, with six deputy secretaries-general, of whom one will be an Israeli and one a Palestinian, will have to breathe new life into a process which is currently stagnating. The secretariat will have to liaise with the European Commission and in particular EuropeAid and the EIB, a major funder of the UfM.
In the longer term, MEPs want to see a considerable increase in the resources for the UfM in the EU's next long-term budgetary plans, for 2014-2020. The resolution also proposes the creation of a Euromediterranean investment and development bank.
Strengthening parliamentary scrutiny of the UfM
MEPs also believe that the institutional architecture of the UfM will not be complete without parliamentary scrutiny of the process, which should be devolved to the Euromediterranean Parliamentary Assembly (EMPA).
