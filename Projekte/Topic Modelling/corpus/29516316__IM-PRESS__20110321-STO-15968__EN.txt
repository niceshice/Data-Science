Libyan rebels hoist their flag in defiance of Colonel Gaddafi Â©BELGA/AFP As the crisis in Libya grips the world's attention we spoke to the Chair of the Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, Italian MEP Gabriele Albertini (EPP) about the situation. It comes ahead of a meeting between MEPs on the Committee and the EU's Foreign Affairs chief Catherine Ashton on Tuesday. On 10 March the European Parliament called for a no-fly zone over Libya.
Q. What can we expect from the intervention of the international community in Libya? Can it be called a war?
Gabriele Albertini : The stated aims are to protect the human rights of the civilian population and to stop the use of violence by a bloody dictatorship that is deploying tanks, heavy artillery, even air raids against its own population.
It is not a war because there was not a declaration of war against a State. In this case it's just the international community that allowed means of violence for military operations in order not to conquer territory or depose a dictator like Saddam Hussein, but rather to protect a civil population threatened by its own leader.
Q. European countries were divided during the UN Security Council vote. Could and should the EU have a say in Libya and how?
GA : As Baroness Ashton once said herself referring to the Kissinger question about who to call in Europe, 'now there is a number to call the EU. It's mine. However, we also have to get the French position press one, to get the UK position press two, etc'.
This complexity with 27 European Union States is unavoidable. The Lisbon Treaty didn't determine the same rules for foreign policy as the Maastricht Treaty did for monetary policy - namely abolishing the national currencies and creating a single one.
Nonetheless Mrs Ashton is trying to outline an EU position that will be shaped like a mosaic. If in this first phase of our foreign policy we cannot be present militarily ( as the EU doesn't have its own army) , we have to exercise a humanitarian profile, defend our values and use persuasion and cohesion - and we are doing it.
Q. What do you expect from the exchange of views with Mrs Ashton Tuesday afternoon in the Foreign Affairs Committee?
GA : Mrs Ashton has been elected by the EP - therefore she is accountable to us. Tomorrow she will refer to the Paris meeting last Saturday and the Foreign Affairs Council meeting on Libya today (Monday). However, tomorrow we will also consider the general situation in the Mediterranean, some issues in the Balkans and Japan.
The interview was done in Italian on the phone from Milan.
