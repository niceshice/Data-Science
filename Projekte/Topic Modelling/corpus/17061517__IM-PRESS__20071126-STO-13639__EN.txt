Olympic game in China
As Beijing prepares for the 2008 summer Olympic Games the EU must keep up the pressure on China on human rights. That's the message that emerged from events organised by the European Parliament in November about human rights in China ahead of the Olympics and the situation in Tibet.
China's human rights record seems to be deteriorating due to preparations for the games with media controls, political arrests, widespread slave labour, and oppression of dissidents, a hearing in the EP's Human Rights sub-committee heard on 26 November. Sub-committee chair Hélène Flautre said the absence of a representative from the Chinese embassy during the hearing was"disappointing".
Chinese cyber-dissident and 2007 Sakharov prize nominee Hu Jia , speaking via the internet from his home in Beijing, where he is under house arrest, warned of:
"a human rights disaster" taking place
1 million people being persecuting in jails, camps and mental hospitals
conflicting hopes from the West that holding the games in China "would foster democracy and openness" and the Chinese authorities who want to use the games legitimise their rule
He urged Europe to hold firm to its principles and in particular the arms embargo on China.
Role of the International Olympic Committee
Former Olympic fencing champion, Hungarian MEP Pál Schmitt (EPP-ED), speaking on behalf of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said the "IOC is not in a position to pressure China on issues outside the Games " but agreed that "it is time for a political statement from the IOC." UK Conservative Edward Mcmillan-Scott said the IOC banned apartheid South Africa from the games. This proves "it can take political positions".
Fair play for Tibet?
Earlier, on 8 November, EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering, Buddhist monks, Olympic medallists, MEPs and human rights activists took part in a conference on Tibet, organised by a cross-party group of MEPs. The Conference Declaration reaffirmed support for the dialogue between the Chinese government and Tibetans, and sees the 2008 Games as opportunity for positive change.
Among the key issues discussed were:
importance of world opinion to the Chinese government
the large number of political prisoners
Control of Tibetan Buddhism (through the law giving the Communist party power to recognize reincarnated lamas)
Systematic settlement of Han Chinese, causing social reengineering and environmental degradation.
