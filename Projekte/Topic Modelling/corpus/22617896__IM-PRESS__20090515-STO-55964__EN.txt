The elections are getting closer, have your say! The need for energy that does not come from oil, equality between the sexes and more spending on education are just some of the things people have requested using the Parliament's choice boxes. Situated around Europe people can go into them and voice their opinion on what they want the European Parliament to be concentrating on.
Take the opportunity to voice your opinion. In the UK you can find the choice boxes in the following locations: Edinburgh: Festival Square, 4-8 May. Liverpool: Williamson Square, 30 May-2 June. Glasgow: Buchanan Street, 11-15 May. Newcastle: Grey's Monument, 11-15 May. Manchester: Albert Square, 19-22 May. In the Republic of Ireland the Choice box can be found in Dublin city centre. The boxes are open from 0900 to 1800. A selection of the clips is being shown on a giant screen in Brussels next to the European Parliament's building and on Europarltv. The boxes will be moving around each EU country until polling day. To find out where they will be consult the Parliament's Information Office in your country.
