10% of Europe's GDP is generated by the construction industry ©EPA 12 MILLION EMPLOYED IN SECTOR REPORTS CALL FOR A SINGLE MARKET TO HELP SMALLER FIRMS The construction sector represents one tenth of the EU economy and yet the European market is not completely open due to different standards and barriers that restrain trade among countries. The Parliament is proposing to simplify the procedures on conformance marking (CE), but also to tackle the problem of health and safety of workers. British Labour MEP Catherine Stihler (S&D) presented her report to members of the Internal Market Committee on 11 October.
Construction sector is one of Europe’s biggest industries accounting for 10% of GDP. The sector employs directly 12 million EU citizens and 26 million workers are dependent on the sector.
Approximately 92% of manufacturers are small and medium size enterprises with fewer than 250 employees. Such enterprises are described as the "back-bone of European economy" according to the Stihler report.
However, the economic crisis significantly hit them and the report says that removing the trade barriers should help companies to stay in business.
Catherine Stihler herself made clear : " Good fences make good neighbours, but in the construction sector there are too many fences across Europe. This Regulation should complete this section of the Internal Market, creating a single market where goods can move freely with the knowledge that products meet safety standards, no matter where they are manufactured in the EU".
The report aims at tackling also one major problem of the construction sector, notably health and safety for workers. In Germany alone, 1 construction worker in 5000 suffers a fatal accident during their working life whilst the Italian Institute for Accidents on work (Inail) recorded 1050 deaths on working sites in 2009.
Catherine Stihler said that "safe products are one key to reducing the accident rates, which are particularly high in the construction sector".
The proposals contained in the report include a having a "Declaration of performance" (CE marking) which would provide clear and more specific rules on marking; more flexibility for individually and custom-made products, but ensuring quality and safety standards.
It addition it proposes that there are stiffer steps to help trace hazardous substances and that the EU should support the promotion of recycled construction products which is essential to meeting the Union's climate change targets.
Finally MEPs insist that the construction works must be designed and built in such a way that they will, throughout their life cycle, not be a threat to the hygiene or health and safety of their workers, occupants or neighbours.

The full Internal Market Committee will vote on the proposals on 8 November.
