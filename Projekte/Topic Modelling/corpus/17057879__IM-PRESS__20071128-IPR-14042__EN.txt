In adopting a joint resolution on the proclamation of a European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid, MEPs welcome the fact that for the first time the Council, the representatives of the Governments of the Member States meeting within the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission have agreed to define a common vision, policy objectives and shared principles for the delivery of more effective EU humanitarian aid in third countries.
Parliament approves, therefore, the Joint Statement by the Council and the representatives of the Governments of the Member States meeting within the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission on European Union Humanitarian Aid: 'The European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid".
