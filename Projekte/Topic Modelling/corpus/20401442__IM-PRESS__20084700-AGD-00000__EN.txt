On Sunday 16 and Monday 17 November the European Parliament in Strasbourg will host the first event of EuroMedScola, a programme designed to bring together young people of the Euro-Mediterranean region for a parliamentary debate on the issues covered by the Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean.
Twenty-seven delegations from the European Union - one per Member State - nine member countries of the Euromediterranean Parliamentary Assembly (EMPA)* plus Albania and Mauritania, will take part in the first EuroMedScola days for school students aged 16 to 18.
Launched by the presidency of the European Parliament together with the European Commission, EuroMedScola is part of European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. The main aim of this meeting is to make participants more aware of the importance of dialogue, respect for cultural and linguistic diversity and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
"EuroMedScola is a symbol of hope for the future and Euromediterranean cooperation. It is also proof of its dynamism", said European Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering. "By organising the EuroMedScola days, the European Parliament wishes to highlight the fact that cooperation between the peoples of Europe and the Mediterranean is one of our goals. Living together around the Mediterranean does not simply mean sharing a geographical area. It also means sharing a history of which we can be proud. The Mediterranean is the cradle of great civilisations which over the centuries have constantly exchanged not just goods but also discoveries, ideas and values."
Working parties
Over two days, the students will play the role of members of EMPA. They will hold debates in small groups on matters relating to the Euromediterranean region before presenting their conclusions on Monday from 2.30 to 3.30pm in the Plenary Chamber of the Parliament, before Mr Pöttering, who is also President of EMPA.
The working parties will discuss the topics "Education and Future", "Freedom of Information and Civic Culture", "Migration and Integration", "Equality of Opportunity, a Tool of Democratisation" and "Environment, Transport and Renewable Energy".
The event is open to the press.
