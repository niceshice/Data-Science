Cables for Kabul: MEPs see infrastructure as key to progress
The international community needs to concentrate on improving security and building more infrastructure, according to a group of MEPs just back from Afghanistan. During the visit they met Afghan President Karzai and members of parliament. They also saw for themselves how some European funded projects are progressing. Despite the progress the country has made, the attempted assassination of president Karzai during their stay underlined that the Taliban are not a spent force.
According to French Liberal Philippe Morillon who headed the delegation of 9 MEPs, the purpose was to show the "profound solidarity" the European Union has with the Afghan people. Describing what he thought was needed he said that more infrastructure projects were required to help the overall economy but especially to allow the regions to trade with Kabul.
"More shops" - and "daily shootings" in Kabul
For Bulgarian MEP Nickolay Mladenov (EPP-ED) what is clear is that despite the difficulties the situation for people is getting better. He told us that since a visit in 2006 "there are more shops, the streets are cleaner, but there is less of a feeling of optimism, which was present two years ago". He said "strong political leadership is needed to reignite the process of reconciliation and reconstruction."
However, despite some progress French MEP VÃ©ronique Mathieu (EPP-ED) said "gun fire in Kabul is almost daily."
On the need for non-military actors to be involved in Afghanistan, Estonian Socialist Katrin Saks said that "the unstable situation cannot be solved only by military means. More attention has to be paid to civilian aid and projects which help satisfy peoples' basic needs and projects which help in institution-building".
What next for Afghanistan and the international community?
A donors' conference in Paris on the future of Afghanistan will take place on 12 June. Participants will talk about strategies to help Afghanistan. MEPs are due to vote on a report on the Stabilisation of Afghanistan before the summer recess.
Since 2007 an EU police force has been in Afghanistan to advise and train the Afghani police and interior ministry.
