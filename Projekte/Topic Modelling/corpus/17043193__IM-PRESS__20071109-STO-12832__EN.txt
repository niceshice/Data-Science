MEPs to debate extension of Schengen system to 9 states for Christmas
Schengen
2007-11-13 - 11:38
German and Polish guards open the border in May 2004
The prospect of passport-free travel around Europe took a step closer on 8 November when EU Ministers agreed to enlarge the Schengen border-free zone to 9 new countries. Meeting in Strasbourg today MEPs will debate a report on the new system which would affect land and sea borders by 21 December and air borders in March 2008. This means the days of showing passports when you cross the borders of these states and the existing 13 Schengen countries could soon be over.
The countries affected are those that joined the Union in 2004, namely the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. Cyprus may join in 2009 and Romania and Bulgaria are not likely to join before 2011.
Goodbye passport controls?
In practical terms it means that if you are a Czech citizen working in Finland or a Latvian working in Belgium, you will be able to drive home for Christmas without showing your passport. National law may require you still carry and ID card or a valid passport document but slowing down to show the passport at the border should be at an end.
Parliament's rapporteur on the issue, Portuguese MEP Carlos Coelho (EPP-ED) supports the extension of the Schengen zone but wants EU countries to keep Parliament and the Council informed of the technical steps that some states still have to take to implement Schengen.
The extension of Schengen also means that cooperation between police and customs authorities will be increased. This is to ensure that any security concerns due to the falling of borders are dealt with. Cooperation between different police forces is done mainly through the Schengen Information System (SIS) - a computer database that holds information related to the scheme.
Implications for non-EU citizens
The new system will also allow people from non-EU countries to enter the EU and travel throughout the zone on a single visa.
In practical terms this means that that the 9 new Schengen countries will have to share the burden of dealing with visa applications with other countries in the zone. For example as of 21 December Austria will be able to issue Hungarian visas in Senegal, and Hungary can issue Latvian visas in New Delhi. This kind of interdependence means cooperation between states is important.
Named after a small wine-making town in Luxembourg and set up in 1985 by five states, the Schengen area currently includes 13 EU member states (Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Finland, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden) and two non-EU countries (Norway and Iceland).
The UK and Ireland participate in the area of police and judicial cooperation, but retain border controls.
Watch the debate live Tuesday afternoon from 1500 CET. MEPs will vote on the issue Thursday.
