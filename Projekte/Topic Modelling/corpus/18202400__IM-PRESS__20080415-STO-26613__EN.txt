Burma: EU needs "coherent strategy" ahead of military's poll

What road will Burma and its Monks take?
As the world's attention is focused on Tibet, another Asian country where monks are revered is also under pressure. Burma - held under a firm grasp by it ruling military junta. So total is the regime's power that it thought nothing of renaming the country and moving the capital city. Its next move is a 10 May referendum on a Constitution that will give the military power and keep opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi out of politics. A parliamentary hearing on 2 April discussed what Europe can do.
It is estimated that over 1,800 political prisoners languish in Burma's jails - many of them monks. Dutch Socialist Thijs Berman, who chaired the hearing, called for the UN Security Council to launch an inquiry into human rights violations. He said he hoped it would lead to suspects being brought before the International Criminal Court. He called for parliament to adopt a resolution on Burma when it next meets in plenary session.
Monks barred from voting
The generals' ploy is a "roadmap to democracy", which they hope will lead to a Constitution giving the military 25% of seats in parliament. The military has already barred the 400,000 monks who led the protests in August and September last year from voting in the referendum.
EU support urged for Aung San Suu Kyi
Speaking at the hearing, Portuguese MEP Jos√© Ribeiro e Castro (EPP-ED) called on the EU to give Ms Suu Kyi more support (she has already won the parliament's Sakharov prize). He also called for a coherent strategy in relations to Burma's key neighbours China and India in order to coordinate the international response to the regime. China is one of Rangoon's few international friends.
British Labour MEP Glenys Kinnock said any development assistance to the country (Burma is one of the poorest in the world) should be linked to political progress. It was part of a wider call by many participants for "smarter sanctions" and other measures to bring the regime to heed democratic calls. One solution could be to apply stricter travel restrictions to leading figures in the regime.
Generals rejected UN democracy plan
Economic pressure should also be applied according to Mr Berman, who would like pressure put on international companies who do business with the regime.
The EU's special envoy for Burma Piero Fassino told MEPs that the regime had refused a UN plan that would have led to democracy. He said the plan had stressed the importance of dialogue and recognition but that it had been rejected. As the date of the referendum draws nearer, the pressure within Burma is certain to mount.
