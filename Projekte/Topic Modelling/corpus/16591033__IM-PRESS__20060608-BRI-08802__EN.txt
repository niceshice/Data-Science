European Parliament calls on the US Administration to close Guantánamo Bay detention facility
2006-06-19 - 12:20
In adopting a joint resolution by a large majority on the situation of prisoners at Guantánamo, MEPs reiterated their call on the US Administration to close the Guantánamo Bay detention facility and insists that every prisoner should be treated in accordance with international humanitarian law and, if charged, tried without delay in a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial court of law or international tribunal.
MEPs condemn all forms of torture and ill-treatment and reiterates the need to comply with international law. MEPs also point out that the suicides on 10 June 2006 of three detainees at Guantanamo Bay have raised further international concern about the detention facilities.
Parliament calls on the US authorities to implement the UNCAT recommendations and to ensure the non-use of 'special interrogation techniques', including methods involving sexual humiliation, 'water boarding', 'short shackling' and using dogs to induce fear, that constitute torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.
The House calls on the US Government to grant unimpeded access to the detainees at Guantánamo Bay for the respective UN bodies and international human rights organisations. MEPs note that the Red Cross has been the only international organisation to have official access to the detainees.
MEPs call on the US authorities to ensure that all allegations of torture and other ill-treatment involving US personnel are subject to prompt, thorough and credible investigation and trial. They will also call on the US Government to clarify if minors have been or are still held in Guantánamo in contravention of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
The House calls on the US authorities to ensure that released detainees are not returned to any state where they could face a risk of being tortured or subjected to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.
MEPs call on the EU to have a common approach for the EU-US Summit and to institute a joint action calling on the US Government to close the Guantánamo Bay detention centre and act in accordance with international law regarding the treatment of detainees.
The House also suggests, following the advice of the European Parliament Members' delegation which recently visited Guantánamo, that an ad hoc delegation be sent to Guantánamo when the EP considers it necessary and appropriate. Text adopted

EU-Russia Summit: MEPs regret lack of agreement on energy
2006-06-19 - 12:20
In adopting a resolution on EU-Russia Summit held in Sochi on 25 May 2006, MEPs regret that the summit failed to secure an agreement on energy and stress as a basis for further negotiations the principle of interdependence and transparency as well as the importance of reciprocity in terms of access to markets, infrastructure and investment, with the objective of avoiding oligopolistic market structures and diversifying the European Union's energy supply.
The House calls in this context on Russia to ratify the Energy Charter Treaty and to increase cooperation on energy savings and renewable energy. MEPs stress the importance of a strengthened and enhanced partnership between the European Union and the Russian Federation based on interdependence and shared interests in the development of all four common spaces, but takes the view that the present partnership with Russia is more pragmatic than strategic since it reflects in the first place common economic interests without achieving major results as regards human rights and the rule of law.
Human Rights Dialogue
Parliament calls also on the Russian Government in this framework to contribute to the intensification of the EU-Russia Human Rights Consultations as an essential part of the EU-Russia partnership and to allow the free functioning of domestic and international human rights organisations and other NGOs.
MEPs recognises the importance of the several established dialogues for the better functioning of EU-Russian cooperation and partnership and underlines in particular the necessity of an effective Human Rights Dialogue.
The House urges the Russian Federation as a member of the Council of Europe to improve conditions for prisoners and put an end to difficulties for lawyers to have access to some of them. MEPs point out that, according to the Russian Criminal Code, detainees should be imprisoned either close to their residence or close to where their trial took place, as exemplified by the prisoners Mr Khodorkovsky and Mr Lebedev.
Finally, the European Parliament calls on the Russian Government to honour its responsibility as President of the G8 and as Chair of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe to achieve tangible results in the further development of transparent trade and reliable economic relations and in the establishment of stability, security, democracy and respect for human rights.

Groundwater: our most important natural resource
2006-06-19 - 12:20
"Groundwater is our most important natural resource. Over half of the EU's groundwater sources are polluted. Once polluted they can no longer be cleaned up. Hence the importance of protecting them." This, in the words of Parliament's rapporteur Christa Klass (EPP-ED, DE) is the key issue being tackled by a new European directive.
Ms Klass's second-reading recommendation on the protection of groundwater against pollution was adopted by a large majority. MEPs were not happy with the Council's common position, which they said did not pay sufficient attention to prevention. A number of first-reading amendments were reintroduced.
The text adopted by the Parliament does not impose single standards for all countries, except for nitrates and pesticides, but it does seek to harmonise methods for measuring potential pollutants. MEPs wish to beef up the directive on a number of points, by improving sampling methodologies, tightening up the wording of the legislation and closing loopholes to prevent the directive being undermined. As in the water framework directive, the notion of "deterioration" is absent. Parliament wants to enlarge the scope of the directive by including a definition of deterioration which would mean "any slight, anthropogenically induced and persistent increase in concentrations of pollutants in relation to the status quo in the groundwater". MEPs also want to include two other notions: background concentration and baseline concentration.
Where the rules on nitrates and pesticides would require changes to farming practices, MEPs suggest providing special aid through the rural development plans which will be drawn up under the reformed common agricultural policy. For around ten other substances, the directive leaves it up to Member States to lay down limit values. These threshold must be established by December 2008 at the latest. Arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury and sulphates are concerned. The resultant range of national standards should, however, be the subject of an impact study on the environment and the single market.
The standards adopted should be reviewed five years after the entry into force of the directive (i.e. 2011 if the legislative procedure is completed in 2006) and every six years thereafter. In addition, MEPs want the directive to be the subject of an overall efficiency assessment by 2015.
Among other improvements introduced by the House are the establishment of a common methodology for the protection of spa and medicinal waters and tougher rules, e.g. to ensure that catchment areas for drinking water are indeed protected by the new directive when industrial and urban activities are planned, since in most Member States drinking water is usually taken from groundwater.
Finally, MEPs say this Directive shall not prevent individual Member States from maintaining or introducing stricter protection measures. Text adopted

Ensuring free public access to environmental data
2006-06-19 - 12:20
INSPIRE – or Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community – is a Commission proposal aiming to create a system for access to and exchange of spatial information needed to monitor the state of the environment, in particular the quality of air, water, soil and the countryside. The European Parliament is aiming to ensure free public access to this information as the legislation returns at second reading.
INSPIRE aims to involve citizens more in environmental policy, give a larger role to local and regional authorities in the field and to enable better targeting and efficiency of environmental action at a cross-border level.
At its first reading Parliament aimed to reduce the obstacles in the way of public authorities seeking to share data and to reinforce the subsidiarity principle in the operation of INSPIRE, ensuring Member States and their local and regional authorities all play their proper part. Parliament also decided that intellectual property rights should not prevent the supply of data, although there was room for special access conditions. Altogether, some 49 amendments were adopted at first reading.
When it agreed its Common Position, the Council took account of just ten or so of these amendments, rejecting all of the most significant. The Environment Committee is therefore proposing that Parliament should reinstate them, including the removal of intellectual property rights from the list of exceptions to the general rule of access to data.
Free access, according to the committee, should without payment for members of the public - not only for those searching the data, but also for those consulting the data itself. MEPsare willing to take account of the costs of providing information to other public authorities, but in any case a fee should be limited to the costs actually incurred in processing the request.
The plenary session followed the advice of the Environment Committee and reinstated the main first reading amendments, the issue is therefore likely to go to conciliation. Parliament and Council will have to agree on a joint text before the measure can be finally adopted.
At the July plenary session, Parliament is scheduled to consider a third reading of legislation dealing with the similar issue of access to environmental data, specifically the application of the Aarhus convention to the EU institutions. Adopted text

Better coordination will reduce the risk of floods
2006-06-19 - 12:20
Since almost 80 per cent of European rivers flow across borders and coastlines are shared, MEPs are calling on EU countries to coordinate flood risk assessment and management. Legislation amended on Tuesday, 13 June, says the focus should be on risk rather than floods and urges Member States to draw up flood risk maps. While emphasising the environmental impact of floods, the law leaves it up to Member States to develop specific measures for special areas.
Parliament says that one needed to expand the definition of the territories concerned. It states that one needs to refer to flood risks rather than floods and that the areas which could be subject to erosion of flood terraces and slopes of river valleys and to bank erosion and debris flow deposition needed to be included in the management proposal as the previous version referred only to damage to coastal areas, whereas most flooding in Europe affects river valleys.
MEPs emphasise the importance of the environment as this framework will help to attain the environmental objectives laid down in the Community legislation in force in addition to assessing and managing of flood risks aiming at the reduction of the adverse consequences on human health, the environment and economic activity associated with floods in the Community. They note that flooding per se is not a risk to the environment, but that flood damage to the environment mainly occurs through damages to human property and the release of dangerous chemicals. The House proposes the drawing up of flood maps showing the installations that might cause accidental environmental pollution as a consequence of flooding.
The report says the aim of the Directive is not only the reduction of flood risks, but also the management of such risks. Therefore Member States shall, at the level of the river basin district, prepare flood maps and indicative flood damage maps, hereinafter “flood risk maps”, for the river basins, sub-basins and stretches of coastline identified. Existing maps prepared by Member States which meet the requirements of this Directive may be used for this purpose in order to avoid unnecessary costs. In addition, the Member States should therefore be allowed some discretion as to what investigation period or what likely return period they wish to use as the basis for their high-probability flooding maps.
Concerning areas beyond national borders, MEPs say that in the case of shared river basins, sub-basins or stretches of coastline, Member States shall cooperate in the implementation of the Directive. Parliament also says that Member States shall, at the level of the river basin district, prepare flood maps and indicative flood damage maps, hereinafter “flood risk maps”, for the river basins, sub-basins and stretches of coastline and shall use the flood risk maps to phase out direct or indirect subsidies that have the effect of increasing flood risks."
The report aims to ensure that in the case of shared river basins Member States are required to coordinate when determining the levels of protection. This is a particularly important safeguard for downstream countries. Furthermore, in the case of an international river basin district extending beyond the boundaries of the Community, where one single international flood risk management plan including any third country concerned is not produced, the Member State or Member States concerned shall endeavour to establish appropriate coordination with the relevant third countries, with the aim of achieving the objectives of this Directive throughout the river basin district.
Parliament states that the flood risk management plans shall include measures the flood risk management plan shall also include an assessment of rescue and recovery measures and that the impact of climate change shall be taken into account in drawing up this report. Adopted text

MEPs disappointed with lack of progress on sustainable development
2006-06-19 - 12:20
In adopting a joint resolution on the revised sustainable development strategy, the European Parliament expresses its disappointment at the lack of progress in developing and following up the Sustainable Development Strategy adopted in Göteborg in 2001.
MEPs consider that the Commission's platform for action on the review of the Sustainable Development Strategy is overly cautious and weak, and in its present form will not succeed in mobilising public opinion and policy-makers behind the vital tasks that lie ahead.
The House welcomes, however, the valuable work of the Austrian Presidency in seeking to re-launch the Sustainable Development Strategy, in strengthening the proposals from the Commission, in pulling together existing targets and indicators within a single and more coherent framework, and also in attempting to put forward some new concepts.

Petitions
Call to expand Petitions Committee to meet public demand
2006-06-19 - 12:20
With 1,609 complaints received in 18 months, Parliament is calling for an increase in the number of Members of the Petitions Committee to enable it to meet the demands made on it by the public. It also believes that, to be more effective, its procedures must be streamlined and its work better coordinated with the other EU institutions. It also wants a tougher line to be taken with Member States which do not comply with Community law.
A report by Michael CASHMAN (PES, UK) on the work of the Petitions Committee over the last year was adopted unanimously by a large majority. The report highlights the need to ensure that "response times … become shorter, investigations even more effective and its service … equally available to all citizens of the EU". For this reason, and to enable Parliament "to better respond to the expectations of petitioners", MEPs propose that the committee's numbers be increased to 50 full Members.
MEPs believe the committee plays a "vital role" in reconnecting with the citizens of the EU and contributes to a strengthening of democratic control over Community legislation and its implementation. To find appropriate solutions "to the concerns and problems with which citizens are confronted during their everyday lives", they believe the committee's procedures must be rationalised and coordinated. They also call for better cooperation between Parliament and the other actors involved, in particular the Commission but also the Council.
Between July 2004 and December 2005 the Petitions Committee received 1609 complaints, an average of 90 per month or three per day. However, around one third were declared inadmissible as they had nothing to do with the activities of the EU. The report therefore underlines the importance of nationally led information campaigns to promote better understanding among the public "of the substance of EC legislation, policies and objectives". It also calls for measures to be taken at both EU and national levels to increase the awareness of EU citizens of their right to petition the European Parliament.
MEPs express concern at the "unreasonable and excessive" amount of time which the Commission takes to pursue and conclude infringement proceedings. They also voice dissatisfaction at the frequent examples of non-compliance by Member States with decisions of the Court of Justice. They believe this situation "undermines the credibility of the formulation and coherent application of EC law, and that it brings discredit on the objectives of the EU". They therefore support a firmer policy towards the Member States aimed at bringing them before the Court of Justice so that "lump sums and penalty payments" can be imposed on them. In addition, MEPs stress Parliament's right to turn to the Court of Justice where serious infringements of Community law are revealed in the course of the examination of a petition.
Lastly, the report encourages the sending of fact-finding missions to the Member States to investigate issues raised by petitioners where these would "offer a clearer view of the often complex problems on the ground". Such missions, say MEPs, can help raise awareness among the competent authorities and thereby "increase the pressure to find effective and pragmatic solutions in the interest of the citizens".

Protecting workers against the risk of infection from contaminated needles - sent back to committee
2006-06-19 - 12:20
At the request of Jan ANDERSSON (PES, SE), MEPs voted to send this report back to the Employment and Social Affairs Committee for further consideration.
Every year around a million workers in Europe, mainly in the medical world, suffer injuries from used surgical needles. The consequences can be serious, including infections from HIV or hepatitis B or C. The EP Social Affairs Committee wants to improve existing EU legislation so as to give workers better protection.

MEPs back €50bn programme for research and development
2006-06-19 - 12:20
The EU will spend a greater proportion of its budget on research and development following the adoption of a report on the 7th Framework Programme. Although MEPs would have preferred to see a larger amount spent, the House supported a budget of more than €50bn for 2007-2013 which is a considerable increase compared to the previous research programme. Parliament also set out criteria for the financing of research using embryonic stem cells.
Vote 15 June 2006
The European Parliament adopted two reports by Jerzy Buzek (EPP-ED, PL). The first report on the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development (FP7) comes under the codecision procedure (1st reading), while the report on Euratom research comes under the consultation procedure.
7th Framework programme for Research and Development:
The European Parliament broadly threw its weight behind the Commission's proposals on the future of European research and development for the period 2007-2013. MEPs endorsed the overall structure of the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7), which will consist of four specific programmes (Cooperation, Ideas, People, Capacities) covering a number of thematic areas.
Budget
The Parliament passed an amendment to bring the budget of the programme into line with the agreement on the Financial Perspective: the seven-year programme will have a budget of €50 521 million compared to the €72 726 million originally proposed by the Commission. This is a substantial increase compared to the 6th Framework programme (running from 2002-2006), which had a budget of €16 279 million.
In further amendments to the first-reading report by Jerzy Buzek (EPP-ED, PL), Members modified the allocation of these funds among the different parts of the programme in line with their preferences.
Ethical questions
Turning to ethical issues, which have been lively discussed during the debate, the Parliament followed the line of the ITRE committee, saying that the research on the use of human stem cells, both adult and embryonic, may be financed, depending both on the contents of the scientific proposal and the legal framework of the Member state(s) involved. (amendment 66 adopted with 284 votes in favour 249 against and 32 abstentions) As regards the use of human embryonic stem cells, institutions, organisations and researchers must be subject to strict licensing and control in accordance with the legal framework of the Member State(s) involved.
An amendment demanding that financing of research should be limited to embryonic stem cell lines created before 31 December 2003 was rejected by Parliament (amendment 319, rejected with 255 in favour, 274 against with 35 abstentions) Another amendment calling for a ban of a financing via the FP7 of the use of embryos and embryonic stem cells for purposes of scientific research was rejected (amendment 354 rejected with 238 votes in favour 287 against with 40 abstentions)
But Parliament argues, that FP7 must not finance research aimed at human cloning for reproductive purposes, research intended to modify the genetic heritage of human beings which could make such changes inheritable or research intended to create human embryos solely for the purpose of research or the purpose of stem cell procurement, including by means of somatic cell nuclear transfer.
Support for SMEs, young researchers and women
MEPs are keen to encourage participation in FP7 of small and medium-sized firms (SMEs), and to boost the position of young researchers and women in science.
MEPs want that at least 15 % of the cooperation programme budget will be allocated to SMEs. They also want to ensure that SMEs gain better access to pre-funding. If SME-specific instruments should become oversubscribed, MEPs want the financing of the various FP instruments to be reviewed with the aim of directing funds towards the instruments that are in demand. Members also introduce the new mechanism of "knowledge vouchers" for SMEs, to support the dissemination of knowledge.
Other amendments were adopted to encourage young researchers and support the early stages of their scientific careers, and to introduce measures to reduce the "brain drain" such as reintegration grants. MEPs also want to see efforts to bring more women researchers into the programmes.
Real autonomy for European Research Council
Members welcome the proposed creation of a European Research Council - a new instrument to support investigator-driven “frontier research” - but want to be sure it enjoys real autonomy. They suggest it should initially be set up as an Executive Agency and - after a brief transition phase - become an independent structure. The Commission is therefore asked to present a proposal to Parliament and Council, under the codecision procedure, to "implement the ERC as a permanent, legally independent structure ". By 2008, says the Parliament, an independent review must be carried out of the ERC's structures and mechanisms, following which the structures and mechanisms of the ERC could be modified.
To avoid top-heavy administration, MEPs adopted an amendment calling for administrative and staffing costs for the ERC to account for not more than 3 % of the annual ERC budget.
Priorities for financing under FP7
A wide range of amendments deal with the nine thematic areas which are broadly defined in the Commission's proposal. MEPs support the selection of these nine thematic areas but wish to broaden and clarify the Commission's definitions. They also add for each of the areas a number of activities which they feel merit Community support. The thematic areas of health and energy are priorities for the Parliament. Regarding the energy part (with Parliament wants to allocate with a budget of 2415 million Euro), members want that approximately two thirds of the budget go towards research conducted under the three renewable energy activities and energy efficiency and savings.
Lastly, MEPs want to split the area "security and space" into two separate headings. Thus the following ten areas would be funded via FP7:
-Health
-Food, Agriculture and Biotechnology
-Information and Communication Technologies
-Nanosciences, Nanotechnologies, Materials and new Production Technologies
-Energy
-Environment (including Climate Change)
-Transport (including Aeronautics)
-Socio-economic Sciences and the Humanities
-Security
-Space
Review
Parliament wants the Framework Programme to be continuously and systematically reviewed. It says the Commission should not carry out just one evaluation - in 2010 - but at least two interim assessments (in 2009 and 2011). Specifically on ethical questions, MEPs say the research fields must be reviewed in the second phase of FP7 in the light of scientific progress.
Euratom Framework Programme
The Parliament adopted a second report by Mr Buzek on the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) for nuclear research and training activities (2007-2011) with 457:97:22 votes). The overall budget of this programme will be €2751 million, compared to the original Commissions proposal of €3092 million.
Debate - 14 June 2006
Opening the debate, the European Commissioner for Science and Research, Janez Potočnik said this was an important day for science. While €54.5 billion was less than what the Commission had originally proposed, it was a substantial increase on the current programme. "This programme represents a new mindset in supporting and conducting research in Europe. Our efforts for simplification will help make sure we attract the best participants and get the best value from our science."
Mr Potočnik said the Commission could accept about two thirds of the amendments in the Buzek report, and agreed with the aims of many others.
"The European Research Council is a most exciting new development, and we need to get the structure right." He was opposed to the idea of a review in 2008, which he said was too soon to be meaningful. It would also be wrong to specify future changes in the structure in advance. The important thing was to maintain its independence, he said, proposing an independent review of the ERC in 2010.
Regarding stem cell research, the Commissioner spoke of his "profound respect" for every personal opinion. He said the Commission had learned from the debate on the Sixth Framework Programme, and proposed to continue the same cautious, case-by-case approach in the Seventh Programme. The position of the Industry Committee was in line with the Commission's ideas. A cut off date for which stem cell lines could be used, however, would have no basis in science and could severely compromise European scientists' access to the best quality lines.
Mr Potočnik concluded: "The Seventh Framework Programme is an essential part of Lisbon Strategy - it is important to send the signal that we can deliver on time. With your support will be able to meet target and mobilise researchers to start participating from end of this year."
Parliament's rapporteur Jerzy BUZEK (EPP-ED, PL) thanked all those who had worked on the subject. "This is not our dream budget, but €55 billion does show the way the EU wishes to go on the path towards a knowledge based economy." The basic lines of the Commission's proposal had Parliament's support: setting up the ERC, joint technology platforms, improving links to industry, space and socioeconomic research. "Excellence should be a criterion for all programmes, to exploit to the full our research infrastructure and support the best scientists."
Mr Buzek stressed the importance of continuing to train scientists in Europe and combating the brain train, as well as increasing pressure to improve innovation and links to small businesses.
On embryonic stem cell research, he said he had tried to reach a compromise which could get majority support.
"Parliament's work has been quick and efficient, showing responsibility and maturity. I hope it will be possible to begin on 1 Jan 2007 - everyone expects Lisbon to be a success," he said.
Alyn Smith (Greens/EFA), Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development said: "Research and the upscaling of Europe's economy is Europe's new narrative. Europe used to be about coal and steel, then it was about agriculture and fisheries. For the future, Europe is going to be about research and development, and where Europe adds value in coordinating the two."
From a development perspective I would say that it should be regional development. There is a clear complementarity between the research and regional development agendas. The key partner in actually delivering the grand research agenda that we set at European level are the cities and the regions and the businesses within those cities and regions. Mr Smith continued "I think it is also worth stating that colleagues I and others want to see a lot more synergy in FP7 – and, indeed, FP8 – between structural funds and research funding. While the budget for FP7 is far from what we wanted, it is even more important that we maximize the benefit between the synergies of the two funding streams. "
Political Group speakers
Paul RÜBIG (AT) spoke for the EPP-ED group, congratulating the rapporteur and saying that we all wanted to live long and healthy lives: "It is important to look at the prevention of disease and at improving employment and jobs." He said research was the foundation for any social welfare policy. "After Thursday's vote, he wanted the programme to get started as soon as possible next year.
For the Socialist group Philippe BUSQUIN (PES, BE) said there had been an excellent spirit of cooperation, with compromise amendments from all the groups. "Let me say that as far as ESC is concerned, this is an essential new institution we too want it to work as well as possible, so it needs to be autonomous within scientific community." He said researchers should be given the status they deserved in society.
On stem cell research he supported the Industry Committee compromise, which represented continuity with the approach of the Sixth Framework Programme. He stressed the importance of the programme to link science and society, and regretted that the Council had cut its budget.
Vittorio PRODI (IT), for the ALDE group, said there would be important benefits from the consensus reached: "This represents the search for the attainment of excellence at European level... We need to adjust to continental dimension of research otherwise we will be swept from scientific and political map of world." He also stressed the importance of scientific links to industry and in particular small businesses. Another key issue, he said, was linking science and society, including educating the public on analysing and managing risk.
David HAMMERSTEIN MINTZ (Greens/EFA, ES) believed that the Seventh Framework Programme reflects the European Union's strengths and weaknesses, as it proved that the EU wanted to act but did not succeed, for example in the area of Member States fully committing themselves to financing various programmes. The Greens believed that one ought to invest in renewable green technology in order to create jobs and a sustainable future rather than continuing the path of the dirty, old-style industrialists. Furthermore, Mr Hammerstein continued, the priority should be to create better social cohesion based on shared knowledge of technological data. Finally, he addressed the problem of transparency: the problem with the Sixth Framework Programme was that Parliament neither controlled the expenditure nor knew where it was going into.
After welcoming the Commission's efforts, Umberto GUIDONI (GUE/NGL, IT) continued that the European Union was missing out on an immense opportunity due to the limit on the budget. He continued that industrial research had been giving a too large priority and that one needed more research to benefit a wider group of people. Furthermore, on the issue of medical research and ethical problems, he agreed with the Commission that there was a need to further scientific and medical knowledge and to continue researching preventative measures. Concluding, Mr Guidoni stressed the importance of renewable energy which, according to them, had not received enough importance in the Programme; but in overall the Framework is a significant step forward.
Speaking for the UEN, Umberto PIRILLI (IT) welcomed the so-called creation of a European area of research. He stressed the importance of large-scale research but called on Member States to apply the rules in place in order to maximise research. Concluding, he said, that human beings are to always stand at the centre of research being carried out.
Gerard BATTEN (IND/DEM, UK) focussed on the need for alternative energy, stating that green energy is not enough to supply Britain. He supported France, who has recently built new nuclear reactors in order to supply most of their demand. Mr Batten supported the 50-Year-Plan to create safe nuclear energy as well as research into nuclear fusion. However, he did not agree that all further development of energy sources should be in the name of the European Union but rather that they should be conducted by independent national projects.
Lydia SCHENARDI (NI, FR) called upon the MEPs to support the proposition, in particular research into nuclear fusion and nuclear waste management. However, she pointed out that fourth generation reactors will not respond to all the problems and underscored that "enthusiasm for international scientific cooperation does not mean a lack of competition". Research into energy therefore increases the "strategic fight" more, according to the MEP. "We need to make sure that we don't mortgage our dependency on oil for another dependency", she concluded.
British speaker
John PURVIS (EPP-ED, UK) said that the ethical questions were very difficult and he respected the differing deep held views. It was clearly a matter of personal conscious. As a Christian, Mr Purvis outlined why the EU could fund research on embryonic stem cells citing the story of the Good Samaritan. Throughout history, it has been necessary to challenge the boundaries of scientific research to improve human life. It was "wholly appropriate" for the EU can fund embryonic stem cell research but it must be regulated.
Response to the debate
Rapporteur Janez BUZEK thanked the MEPs for the debate. He said that there was a consensus about the insufficient finds and that the increase in funding compared to the Sixth Framework Programme was not enough, judging this as a missed opportunity. Mr Buzek stressed the need for various objectives in order to succeed in the different areas of research, including excellence and human potential, health and energy. He, however, stated that in the current energy crisis there is a need for renewable energy and that includes green energy as well as nuclear energy and one cannot give either one up.
In his response to the debate, Commissioner Potočnik said that on the budget for FP7, there was only a 2 per cent difference between the institutions and this could be resolved. He welcomed the idea that 15 per cent of the total budget should be for SMEs but the important was to simplify access to this funding. On energy, the Commissioner noted the progress made in this area towards a EU energy market and stressed that the challenges of climate change were often underestimated. On embryonic stem cell research, he said that there was a consensus that the best results would come from a "combination of research efforts across countries". He also cited the latest Eurobarometer poll which indicated that most people were in favour of such research under regulation. The new European Research Council would enable better international co-operation and the Commissioner underlined that the EU faced global challenges in terms of research and development spending and infrastructure. He concluded that the programme "can change European reality". Adopted text

European Council
Romania and Bulgaria: MEPs support conditional 1 January 2007 for accession
2006-06-19 - 12:20
In adopting a joint resolution on the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, MEPs have noted with great interest the reports by the Commission on the state of preparedness of Bulgaria and Romania for their accession to the European Union and pay tribute to the great care and seriousness with which the Commission has monitored the preparatory efforts for and the implementing measures taken by both countries in order to meet the conditions for their entering the European Union by 1 January 2007.
MEPs note with satisfaction that the Commission maintains the deadline for both countries to enter the European Union by 1 January 2007 on condition that the necessary measures are taken to resolve the outstanding problems, and accepts the recommendations made by the Commission with regard to the further procedure for taking a final decision on the date of accession of Bulgaria and Romania.
The House calls on the European Council, at its Summit on 15-16 June, to maintain its commitment to Bulgaria and Romania joining the EU on 1 January 2007 if they are ready. MEPs at the same time, welcome the specialist assistance that has been provided by Member States, particularly in the field of justice and policing, and urges reinforcement of this assistance in the coming months.
MEPs stress that the Bulgarian and Romanian Governments must be aware of the need to make full use of the remaining months and produce concrete results in meeting the requirements for achieving full EU membership by 1 January 2007.
Parliament notes with satisfaction the serious efforts and considerable progress made by Bulgaria and Romania in past months to meet the EU's political and economic criteria and to gradually adopt and implement the acquis communautaire.
MEPs emphasise the need for both countries to continue to consolidate the ongoing reform of their justice systems, by further enhancing the transparency, efficiency and impartiality of the judiciary, and to demonstrate substantive further results in the fight against corruption, with special emphasis on the fight against organised crime. Parliament stresses the utmost importance of taking all the measures required to combat the trafficking of human beings and to substantially enhance the degree of social inclusion of Roma communities, especially with regard to housing, health care, education and unemployment.
The House is aware that a decision on the accession of each country will be taken on its own merits and in the light of each country's achievements, but would welcome it if, on the basis of the progress achieved so far by both countries and their activities geared to achieving further progress in the next few months, Bulgaria and Romania can enter the European Union together and on the same date. MEPs call on all political forces in Bulgaria and Romania to concentrate their activities on meeting the conditions for EU membership by 1 January 2007 and to maintain the political commitment needed to achieve this objective.
Parliament also calls on the Commission, as a matter of urgency, to provide Bulgaria and Romania with the clearest possible guidance on the outcomes that are expected in order to meet its concerns, to ensure that the maximum Community resources are targeted on these areas in order to help produce tangible improvements, and, in cooperation with the Bulgarian and Romanian authorities, to define the nature of and procedures for any possible post-accession monitoring measures and the circumstances under which they might be necessary. Finally, MEPs ask the Member States to complete the ratification process for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania on schedule.

MEPs adopt resolution on the increase in racist and homophobic violence in Europe
2006-06-19 - 12:20
In adopting a joint resolution from the PES, ALDE, Greens and GUE/NGL political groups, by 301 in favour to 161 against with 102 abstentions, Parliament deplores the fact that the Council has been unable to adopt the 2001 Council Framework Decision on combating racism and xenophobia.
MEPs urgently call on the future Finnish Presidency of the Council to the restart the work on it and on the Council to reach an agreement on explicitly extending it to homophobic, anti-Semitic, Islamophobic and other types of offences motivated by phobia or hatred based on ethnicity, race, sexual orientation, religion or other irrational grounds.
MEPs urge all the Member States to effectively implement the anti-discrimination directives and the Commission to bring before the Court of Justice those Member States which fail to do so, and to submit before mid-2007 new legislative tools incorporating all the grounds for discrimination set out in Article 13 of the EC Treaty and having the same scope as Directive 2000/43/EC.
The House strongly condemns all racist attacks, and expresses its solidarity with all victims of such attacks and their families, including:
– the premeditated murder of a black woman of Malian nationality and the Belgian child of whom she was the nurse, perpetrated in Antwerp on 12 May 2006 by a young Belgian right-wing extremist, this same person having a few moments earlier seriously wounded a woman of Turkish origin while trying to kill her;
– the murder of a 16-year-old boy in January 2006 and of a 17-year old boy in April 2006 in Brussels, expressing its indignation at some of the media coverage of these murders, which at times led to unfounded criminalisation of whole communities in the eyes of the general public;
– the rape, torture and assassination of Ilan Halimi in February 2006 in France by a gang of 22 persons of different origins, expressing its deep concern at the anti-Semitic dimension of this crime;
– the assassination of Chaïb Zehaf in March 2006 in France due to his ethnic origin;
– the brutal assault on a German citizen of Ethiopian origin, Kevin K., in the village of Poemmelte, Saxony-Anhalt, on 9 January 2006, in particular because of its racial motive;
– the horrific torture and murder of Gisberta, a transsexual living in the Portuguese city of Oporto, in February 2006, by a group of adolescent and pre-adolescent minors, urging the Portuguese authorities to do everything in their power to punish those responsible and fight the climate of impunity with respect to this and other hate crimes;
– the attack against Michael Schudrich, Chief Rabbi of Poland, which took place in Warsaw, as well as the declarations by a leading member of the League of Polish Families inciting violence against GLBT people with a view to the march for tolerance and equality;
- the increase in the number of racist attacks, calls and chants by fans with neo-Nazi allegiances in football stadiums;
MEPs call on the EU representatives at the upcoming G8 Summit to raise the issue of human rights with Russia as a matter of urgency, in particular the right to demonstrate peacefully. The House also calls on the institutions of the European Union, the Member States and all European democratic political parties to condemn all acts of intolerance and of incitement to racial hatred, as well as all acts of harassment or racist violence.
The House calls on the Member States to give proper attention to the fight against racism, sexism, xenophobia and homophobia both in their relations with each other and in their bilateral relations with third countries. MEPs will call on the Commission to continue developing an anti-discrimination policy alongside its emerging policy on integration.
Parliament stresses the need to support anti-racist and anti-xenophobic initiatives in relation to the current World Cup in Germany, and asks authorities to closely monitor, prosecute and condemn those responsible for racist acts.
Debate on Wednesday, 14 June 2006
The European Parliament debated the increase in racist and homophobic violence in Europe. Many MEPs pointed to the increase of violence in some Member States and pointed to the joint resolution to be adopted on Thursday 15 June 2006.
Hans WINKLER, State Secretary in the Federal Ministry for Foreign Affairs said that the Presidency gave particular importance to the combating of discrimination. The entire security of the EU was threatened and undermined by such violence and discrimination and it needed to be addressed urgently.
He recalled that since the Amsterdam Treaty entered into force, the EU had adopted anti discrimination/ equal opportunities legislation which was passed in 2000. Discrimination on the grounds of gender, belief age and ability was forbidden. Mr Winkler drew attention to the work of the European Agency monitoring xenophobia and racism, but said it was important that the EU create a new agency on fundamental rights which he said, citizens both want and need. Mr Winkler that national governments were taking measures but where education was insufficient, national criminal law should apply.
Leadership, he said, was required in this area and pointed to the work carried out under the Austrian Presidency including the marking of the 40th anniversary on the anti-discrimination day of 25 March. The battle, he said, had not yet been won, but the Presidency to combating such discrimination and violence.
Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities Commissioner Vladimir SPIDLA told MEPs that the Commission condemns all forms of racism and xenophobia and will continue to combat them with every tool at its disposal. "The Commission deeply deplores that Member States have still not adopted 2001 framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia. Its objective is to stamp out all forms of racism including on religious grounds. The Commission urges the Council to adopt it without watering down." The Commission was also supporting the work of the EU Monitoring Centre and initiatives such the Year of Equal Opportunities planned for 2007.
He said the Commission roundly condemns all forms of homophobia, which he said flew in the face of the principles on which Europe was built. He pointed out that the Charter of Fundamental Rights prohibits any discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. In addition to legislative measures, he said, must be accompanied by other measures to stamp out discrimination and denigrating behaviour. "We are firmly convinced that the EU must be a model of the fight against racism, xenophobia and homophobia," he concluded.
Political Group speakers
Speaking for the EPP-ED group, Patrick GAUBERT (FR) said "The EU is founded on a community based on indivisible and universal rights of human dignity, freedom and solidarity. We see on daily basis that struggle against intolerance is far from over. It is upsetting to have to recall that racism is unacceptable in our societies. As Members of Parliament we must firm and roundly condemn it." He said that governments should adopt the framework decision on racism and xenophobia. He regretted, however, that Parliament was missing an opportunity to speak with one voice on these issues. This was not a left or right wing struggle, he said, adding that he understood why his group had not signed the joint resolution.
Socialist group leader Martin SCHULZ (DE) said that when he joined the European Parliament twelve years ago, he would not have thought it possible that such a debate would be needed again. "Racism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia and hatred of minorities is horrifying. It should set alarm bells ringing." All democratic political forces of left and right had joined to created the EU to resolve the conflicts of 20th century, and to abandon movements based on hatred of minorities and those who did not conform. "The idea was to form a community based on fundamental rights for all regardless of belief, nationality, skin colour, origin and how they want to live... we want to organise a society where all have their place."
People riding roughshod over minorities for political benefit had happened before, he said, and this was not just in the new Member States or in one country: "This is not criticism of any nations, but against the intellectual bankruptcy of people promoting such ideas. They don't belong in any society, and certainly not in this Parliament."
For the ALDE group, Sophia IN 'T VELD (NL)said that it was "unfortunate" that it was still necessary to debate this issue. People were still being killed just because of the colour of their skin or their sexual orientation which she described as "barbarian". She welcomed the recent equality marches including the one in Warsaw which she took part in. Subsidiarity was an excuse for national governments not to act and this issue should be discussed at EU level. The EU should aim to be "the world champion" in the defence of fundamental rights.
Jean LAMBERT(Greens/EFA, UK) welcomed the strong statements and expressed her wish for other politicians to be as clear and forthright. She said that "it is clear that no European Union Member State is free from this hatred". "We have to be clear that we won't tolerate this in our Member States", she added. Ms Lambert was disappointed that it took several deaths, even in her own country, for awareness to be raised. A main problem is the media, she concluded.
Vittorio AGNOLETTO (GUE/NGL, IT) described this resolution's presence as a "democratic emergency". He said that this behaviour was incompatible with the European Union, specifying that his party will be asking for sanctions if homophobic and racist actions continue. He closed by saying that the Austrian Presidency has not done as much as it could have done as it has been hindered by the presence of Haider's neo-fascist party in the presidency.
Wojciech ROSZKOWSKI (UEN, PL) stated that justice requires a level-headed approach and one needs to be very careful when generalising about certain actions. He continued that there were too many contradictions within the resolution as well as equalisation on racism and homophobia with ideological differences. He attacked the Netherlands with regards to their "paedophilic party" and said that the other countries ought to look at their own countries before harassing others.
Bogdan PĘK (IND/DEM, PL) stated that this was very significant day for the European Parliament as it could set a new trend in the legislative fight against racism and for minorities. But he believed that his debate was turning into another fight between the political left and the political right. He said that it was unacceptable for Poland to have to be grotesquely slandered by the Left.
Attacking the speaker of the PES directly, Maciej Marian GIERTYCH (NI, PL) said that it would be useful for various MEPs to check their facts before presenting them in the debate. He continued that the former Communists gave the homosexual community protecting. However, the present government is a government of law and order, and order includes moral order.
British and Irish speakers
Bairbre DE BRÚN (GUE/NGL, UK) said that in her constituency in the North of Ireland, there had been an increase in sectarian and homophobic violence including the murder of a 15 year old boy Michael McIlveen. She called on the Council to adopt the 2001 anti-discrimination framework directives.
Eoin RYAN (UEN, IE) highlighted the increase in racism during football matches in many countries including monkey chanting, neo-fascist symbols and the throwing of banana skins. He welcomed the fact that the FIFA would crackdown on this increase and said the World Cup in Germany was a key opportunity not to be missed with an estimated global accumulative audience of 20 billion spectators.
Michael CASHMAN (PES, UK) said he was saddened by the comments of Polish MEPs from the League of Polish Families and the Law and Justice Party. Religion or family values, he said, represented no excuse for the promotion of hatred, discrimination and evil. "What value is there in diminishing the lives of ordinary human beings? There is none," he said. Having taken part in the Gay Pride march in Warsaw, he said that the decent reception it had received from ordinary people there had shown that the two parties he mentioned did not represent the decent, ordinary people of Poland.
Sarah LUDFORD (ALDE, UK) said citizens must be puzzled that the EU had good laws protecting people from discrimination as consumers and employees, but not as people. "Why is there a lack of EU action on hate crimes, when we can agree on pollution crimes?" she asked. She hoped to avoid high blown rhetoric about a union of values, which no action was taken. She also said it was disgraceful for Mr Roszkowski to refer to paedophilia in the context of homosexuality - there was no evidence, she said, that paedophilia was more prevalent among homosexuals than heterosexuals.
Claude MORAES (PES, UK) said being subject to racial or homophobic violence was something that you never forgot. "When my parents arrived in Europe in the 1960s we suffered from it and we have never forgotten." He called for the Council to take action by adopting the framework decision. "Racist attacks can be solved, penalties can be increased. We can send a political signal of leadership. The scar of discrimination is greater today than it was in the 1960s."
Response to the debate
In his response to the debate, Hans WINKLER, in his response to the debate for the Presidency said that he was convinced that it was necessary for the EU to speak with one voice on this matter and not to reproach each other for any shortcomings. He stressed the importance of the media, but recognised that it was impossible to censor the media but rather it was necessary for the media to exercise some self regulation or control.
Commissioner SPIDLA concluded the debate by saying that the notion of tolerance and equality had always been part and parcel of the European Union. He quoted the preface to a Papal Bull from the early 18th century, which noted that the sun shines in the same way over everyone - something that had sometimes been overlooked in periods of intolerance. "When you look at the inequalities which exist, when political action is taken to prevent demonstrations, with some people trading on intolerance as their basic policy plank, you see a loss of the fundamental values of the European project, " he said. He said the debate had shown a firm will in Parliament to back the concepts of equal opportunities and tolerance, while rejecting racism, xenophobia and homophobia.

Vote postponed on transfer of personal data in police and judicial cooperation
2006-06-19 - 12:20
The European Parliament decided to postpone a report endorsing a proposal on the protection of citizens' personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters. Although MEPs believe the proposal will bring more uniformity and consistency to the EU´s data protection principles, they decided to wait until the Council meets again in July, hoping the Finnish presidency will be more willing to take into account Parliament's demands.
Even if the final vote was postponed, MEPs voted through all the 60 amendments tabled, approving them to make clear their support to the position of rapporteur and LIBE members. In broad terms, MEPs endorse the Commission proposal to extend data protection rules to the transfer of information in police and judicial cooperation, an action field which depends directly on Member States and which falls out of the scope of existing community laws to protect data so far. In broad terms, Parliament amendments limit the use and access to personal data to the very necessary cases and when there is a real threat to public security.
The Commission proposal responds to an old claim from the Parliament, who since the creation of the III pillar has been calling for standards on data protection in the context of judicial and police cooperation: The issue is particularly relevant now that the European Court of Justice decided to annul existing agreements between the EU and US government on the transfer of personal data of air passengers flying into the United States. It is a priority of the MEPs to push for a quick adoption of this draft decision by the Council, which would affect future agreements with the USA.
Strict criteria to collect and access data
Data collection and access to national governments or competent authorities must be limited "to specific purposes", only "if strictly necessary", and carried out with the "principles of proportionality and necessity" and for the purpose of "preventing a threat to public security or to a person", say MEPs. This personal data made available to a given Member State might be further transferred to another only with the consent of the authority which made available the information in the first place. MEPs also voted to delete the paragraph allowing access to data to different authorities other than the "competent authorities" established by each Member State.
Sensitive data such us biometrics or DNA information will follow additional specific safeguards to ensure they are accurate and that they can be challenged by the subject of such data. MEPs also demand a different treatment for personal data depending on the status of the person concerned: information related to "non-suspects" will be treated "only for the specific purpose they were collected, for a limited period of time and with adequate limitations on access to them and on their transmission".
Transfers to third countries
One of the main concerns for MEPs is the potential access to personal data that authorities from third countries could ask in the name of fight against terror and organised crime. In this sense, MEPS adopted an amendment forbidding such transfer to competent authorities outside the EU except if the transfer "is provided by a law clearly obliging or authorising it" and if the Member States can ensure that the level of protection afforded by the third country is adequate. This assessment would be based on concrete criteria listed in the text. Only exceptionally, this adequacy decision can be omitted if it is to prevent an imminent serious danger threatening public security.
Finally, Parliament adopted other amendments to give the citizen the right to deny the accuracy of some personal information and mark it on the database, as well as to impose criminal sanctions to authorities in case of intentional offence or gross negligence.

Future of Europe/European integration
MEPs ask the European Council for a clear proposal on constitutional process
2006-06-19 - 12:20
In adopting a joint resolution with 347 votes in favour 212 against and 70 abstentions on the next steps for the period of reflection and analysis on the Future of Europe, MEPs confirm their commitment to achieving without undue delay a constitutional settlement for the European Union as well as its endorsement of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe.
The House warns against any attempts to unravel the global compromise achieved in the Treaty as this would seriously call into question the European political project and create the risk of a weakened and divided Union. Parliament confirms, therefore, its opposition to the piecemeal implementation of parts of the constitutional package deal, as well as its opposition to the immediate creation of core groups of certain Member States as a way of circumventing the constitutional process for the Union as a whole.
Parliament call on the European Council to seek clear commitments from each Member State as to the ways and means by which it proposes to proceed during the remainder of the reflection period and how it intends to intensify public debate on the future of Europe.
MEPs ask the Commission to adjust its Plan D for the second phase of the period of reflection and to provide sufficient funding for the activities envisaged. The House calls on the European Council to invite the Member States which have not yet finalised the ratification procedures to work out by the end of the reflection period credible scenarios as to how they intend to take matters forward.
Parliament suggests that the European Council develop an appropriate framework so as to enable a specific dialogue to take place as soon as the political calendar allows with the representatives of those countries in which the referendum on the Constitutional Treaty had a negative outcome in order to explore whether and under what conditions it would appear possible for them to resume the ratification procedure.
The House calls on the Commission to endorse this approach and to present to the European Council a 'road-map' for implementing it in the best possible manner. MEPs draws the attention of the Commission to the fact that a constitutional order is essential in order to make the Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding, build a European democracy and make the Union more capable of action and more social.
Parliament calls on the Commission to draw up a study of the costs incurred as a result of the fact the Constitutional Treaty will not enter into force as originally hoped on 1 November 2006.
The House draws the following conclusions from the discussions with members of national parliaments of the Union's Member States which took place on 8-9 May 2006 in Brussels:
a) the need to continue the constitutional process of the European Union which is anchored in the concepts of peace and solidarity and other common values has been confirmed;
b) there is no doubt that the Member States of the Union will not be able to cope alone with the major political challenges facing Europe;
c) it is generally recognised that the Constitutional Treaty would provide the European Union with an appropriate framework for addressing these challenges;
d) a deeper analysis will be needed so as to allow proposals to be developed in 2007 which should lead to a settlement before the next European election;
e) the interparliamentary dialogue on the constitutional process in which the European Parliament and the parliaments of the Member States are partners is essential and needs to be continued; welcomes the announcement by the President of the Finnish Parliament that a second parliamentary forum would be held in December 2006;
f) refers in this connection to its own proposals that the debates in the parliamentary forums should be organised in such a way as to enable an intensive and lively exchange to take place;
Finally, Parliament reaffirms its objective that the necessary constitutional settlement should be ready when the citizens of the Union are called to the European elections in 2009.

Is the EU prepared for a bird flu pandemic?

The European Parliament is proposing a leading role for the Commission as well as the creation of a European Influenza Task Force representing all the Member States in order to be able to act rapidly and decisively to control avian influenza.
The report by Adamos ADAMOU (GUE/NGL, CY) adopted with 612 votes in favour, 26 against 7 abstentions on pandemic influenza preparedness and response planning in the EU says that one of the most important aspects of properly dealing with the problem of a possible human avian influenza pandemic is having the correct, scientifically proven, information regarding drugs, vaccines, natural resistance to the disease as well as reliable epidemiological data.
Mr Adamou said "It cannot be stressed enough that there is a strong need to strengthen the co-ordination activities between the Member States. It is empirical to ensure equal access to anti-viral drugs for all Member States irrespective of their size and economic strength. Furthermore, research and development must be promoted in order to make available the pandemic vaccine as soon as possible, and when this happens, equitable distribution of this pandemic vaccine must be ensured. What is important in order to stop a possible pandemic from arising is prevention and not only treatment. Equally important to all the above is the protection of the livelihood of small and medium-sized livestock farmers who have been literary whipped out from bird flu as well as the implementation of Community legislation relating to health and safety at work in order to ensure the adequate protection of workers, particularly those in high infection risk groups. "
MEPs stress that the Commission must play a strong coordinating role between the Member States in all activities relating to pandemic preparedness in the European Union and say that the Commission should take steps to ensure that sufficient antivirals and vaccines are available for those who are exposed to the virus in the event of an outbreak in one or more Member States. Furthermore, Parliament considers that, in the event of an influenza pandemic in the EU or in neighbouring States, the Commission should within 24 hours be able to adopt crisis measures such as quarantine and disinfection measures at airports in connection with flights from certain regions and travel restrictions.
The report therefore suggests the creation of a European Influenza Task Force, coordinated by the Commission, on which the European Parliament is represented and in which all the above-mentioned fields of expertise are brought together at European level.
MEPs emphasise that rapid and decisive action must be taken to control avian influenza and so prevent a human pandemic and must also be taken to prepare for a possible human pandemic, so that the means to control it should it occur, are available. MEPs highlight the need to strengthen surveillance systems, rapid reporting and alerting systems, data analysis and epidemiology for animal and human diseases. The report stresses the importance of education and correct information in the event of crises and that appropriate instructions should cover not only compliance with hygiene rules but also the provision of information in areas such as mobility, transport and employment and accentuated the need for sufficient funds to be made available by the Commission and the Member States in order to provide people with more pertinent, understandable and tangible information and thus raise public awareness.
The report urges the Commission to work for a more coherent international framework in the follow-up of the Beijing pledging conference that goes beyond crisis management and addresses the issues of building up a better infrastructure for animal health in developing countries, as well as advancing research in animal health products that can be used in developed as well as developing countries.

Criticism of Member States, Commission and OLAF on fraud
2006-06-19 - 12:20
MEPs adopted a report on protection of the financial interests of the Communities and the fight against fraud, criticising individual Member States' efforts and the Commission's lack of efforts to improve the situation. They also call upon the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) to reform itself in order to confirm its credibility.
The report by Herbert BÖSCH (PES, AT) stresses that the importance of year-on-year fluctuations in losses reported should not be overestimated and that they may be affected by a wide variety of factors. However it singles out certain members of the European Union in its criticisms: Parliament regards it as completely unacceptable that there are still 'old' Member States (Germany, Greece and Spain) failing to forward notifications on irregularities to the Commission electronically, that those notifications are incomplete and that they are forwarded with several years’ delay and points out that Spain and Germany account for more than 65% of losses. Therefore the House expects a report from the Commission setting out the steps it has taken to prevail upon the Member States concerned to fulfil their Treaty obligations.
MEPs emphasise that falling figures in the area of agriculture are also the result of the effective operation of the integrated administration and control system (IACS) and therefore insist that that system be used in all Member States. The European Parliament highlights that customs, agriculture and external aid have proved to be particularly susceptible to fraud and underscores the fact that OLAF puts the financial loss resulting since 2000 from cigarette smuggling and the marketing of counterfeit products at €1 317 m.
Concerning the groundwork for amending the OLAF regulation, the report stressed that Parliament will endorse no proposal which would restrict the prerogatives it has had to date, and that it will advocate that all OLAF's investigatory powers be grouped together in a single regulation.
Parliament criticises the fact that, to date, the Commission has submitted no interim report on the activities of the 'Eurostat Task Force' despite its having been announced on several occasions. Additionally, MEPs in the committee stated concern, against the backdrop of the current risk of bird flu, that a new trend is emerging involving the illegal import of poultry meat from countries banned by the European Union (particularly China).

MEPs back Slovenia's euro ambitions
2006-06-19 - 12:20
Parliament has given its approval for Slovenia to join the euro zone on 1 January 2007. MEPs adopted a report by 490 votes in favour to 13 against with 63 abstentions drawn up by Werner LANGEN (EPP-ED, DE) which support the Commission's proposal for Slovenia’s accession, adding only a call to the Member States “to allow the Commission to assess compliance with the Maastricht criteria on the basis of definite, current, reliable and high-quality data.”
Parliament’s role in the process of euro zone enlargement is consultative – see the link below for more details on the procedure.
Another, more detailed, report from Mr Langen on the issues surrounding euro zone enlargement in general was adopted at the May II plenary session. See the link below to our press release on that report.

MEPs back the European Rail Traffic Management System
2006-06-19 - 12:20
Parliament is supporting the introduction of the European Rail Traffic Management System, ERTMS. The European Parliament debated the plan to replace the more than 20 different national train protection and signalling systems with one European system.
Parliament is supporting the introduction of the European Rail Traffic Management System, ERTMS. The European Parliament debated the plan to replace the more than 20 different national train protection and signalling systems with one European system.
ERTMS would boost the competitiveness of European freight and passenger railways, since trains could run across borders without changing drivers. The system features two basic components: GSM-R, a radio system used to exchange information (both voice and data) between traffic management centres and the on board crew and equipment, and ETCS (European Train Control System), a computer-based system to control train speed. ERTMS is a fully developed and tested system already available on the market and in commercial use in several Member States. Version 2.3.0 of the system should make it possible to start operating high speed or high capacity international rail corridors in Europe from 2007.
MEPs in the committee say that if ERMTS is to succeed, it should be introduced in particular on six international routes: Rotterdam-Genoa, Naples-Berlin-Stockholm, Antwerp-Basel-Lyon, Seville-Lyon-Turin-Ljubljana, Dresden-Vienna-Budapest and Duisburg-Warsaw, with priority for the route from Rotterdam to Genoa.
The own-initiative report was drafted by Michael CRAMER (Greens/EFA, DE) and was adopted with 527 votes in favour 13 against and 8 abstentions.

Parliament votes on strict rules for "Sky Marshals"
2006-06-19 - 12:20
Parliament is insisting on strict regulation of the use of ‘Sky Marshals’ on board aircraft. This is one of the amendments adopted by MEPs to Commission plans to update the common EU aviation security rules introduced after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. The issue now goes before the plenary session.
The first reading report, drawn up by Paolo COSTA (ALDE, IT), concerns measures aimed to protect against “acts of unlawful interference that jeopardise the security of civil aviation.” The draft regulation aims to ensure common rules regarding checks, searches, surveillance, prohibited items, security patrols and other aspects of airport and aircraft security are correctly applied by Member States, airports and airlines.
For the first time, European rules will cover security measures during flights, including in-flight security officers. ‘Sky marshals’, as they are commonly known, will have to be properly trained and MEPs insist that weapons “shall not be carried on board an aircraft, unless the required security conditions have been fulfilled, and authorisation has been given by the State granting the operating licence to the air carrier concerned”. They demand prior approval by the State of departure, by the State of arrival and, where applicable, by “any State which is over flown or where intermediate stops are made”. No Member State will be obliged to accept in-flight security officers. Among other issues, the House says passengers whose behaviour is “manifestly abnormal and threatens to compromise the security of a flight” will be subjected to appropriate security measures during the flight.
MEPs decided that the costs of the security measures should be met by airline users and Member States, though if a Member State wants to impose even more stringent measures, it will have to cover the whole cost. The report stresses that security taxes and charges must be used “exclusively to meet airport or on board aircraft security costs”. To avoid any distortions in the market, they call on the Commission to propose a uniform system for the financing of airport security measures.

Fisheries
EP calls for more support for inshore fishing
2006-06-19 - 12:20
The EP adopted a report which raises attention of the precarious situation of inshore fishing around the Union. Sean Ó Neachtain's (UEN, IE) own-initiative report on inshore fishing "stresses that inshore fisheries make a vital contribution not only to local economies but also to maintaining the social fabric of coastal communities."
For this reason, it calls for "minimum criteria which are acceptable to all" to be laid down as a way to a common definition of coastal fishing in the Union. The Parliament also calls for community financing of vessel modernisation measures, as well as "specific educational and training programmes" to encourage new entries to the sector.
The EP "believes that it is essential for inshore fishermen and dependent communities to be more directly involved in processing and trading," and that "any new inshore fisheries legislation must pay special attention to the need to establish and maintain a safety culture" which is traditionally very poor in this sector. MEPs also bring attention to the plight of women involved in coastal fishing, as they routinely experience very difficult working conditions without a legal work status and the protections that provides.

Human rights
Human rights in East Timor, Syria and North Korea
2006-06-19 - 12:20
As usual, Parliament ended its session in Strasbourg with three debates on human rights issues from around the world. In this case, the focus was on East Timor, Syria and North Korea. East Timor In its resolution on East Timor, Parliament urges all parties to refrain from violence, to get involved in an all-inclusive dialogue to settle political differences and to participate in the democratic process within the legal and constitutional framework, thus contributing to restoring social and political stability. It welcomes the decision by the authorities of East Timor to call for an international inquiry into the events of 28-29 April, and 23-25 May, when armed confrontations between the East Timorese armed forces and previously dismissed soldiers and their civilian supporters resulted in a disputed number of fatalities. MEPs urge the Government and the President of the Republic of East Timor to take all the necessary steps to put an end to violence and to restore a secure and stable environment in full compliance with the Constitution. They note that the role to be played by the international community, and in particular the United Nations, including the Security Council, is of vital importance to the process of consolidation of the state of East Timor and its independence and sovereignty, and to the consolidation of democracy in this young nation. Parliament stresses that the process of gradual reduction in the UN mission in East Timor over the last four years must be reversed and asks for the urgent deployment of a UN-led police force to help restore stability and a UN mandated peace keeping force as requested by the East Timor authorities on 13 June. It welcomes the extension of the UN’s mandate and calls for peacekeeping units and civilian police units to remain in East Timor until the country's own armed forces and police can take over these tasks themselves. Parliament also recommends, with due respect for the sovereign authorities of East Timor and the specificity of the mandate conferred on each one of the international forces currently in the country under UN supervision and monitoring, the establishment of efficient channels of horizontal communication and cooperation between international forces, in order to serve the best interests of the East Timorese people, the effective restoration of public order and a prompt return to full institutional normality. MEPs welcome East Timor's admission to the ACP group of States and recognise its need for political, technical and financial support in rebuilding the infrastructure and administrative structures which are essential to resume the implementation of its development plan. They call on the European Union and international community to maintain and step up the support required to consolidate democracy and a democratic culture in East Timor, focusing on a multiparty culture and institution-building – namely the parliament, government, judiciary, security, defence and law enforcement forces – and to assist in the urgent extension of media coverage to the whole country, as well as in strengthening the education and health networks, with particular attention addressed to the needs of children and women. Parliament calls on the international community to substantially increase support for effective human rights monitoring in East Timor and to provide assistance for the development of local human rights groups as well as for local services for victims of abuses. It calls on the EU Council and Commission to urge the East Timorese authorities to prohibit and disband any paramilitary groups and armed gangs, and to disarm armed civilians. It wants the EU to raise European concerns over police violence with the Government of East Timor in all official meetings and at the highest level. MEPs call on the East Timor state representatives to uphold international human rights standards and to ensure that the police's and armed forces' treatment of citizens conforms to international human rights norms and standards. They propose to send a European Parliament ad hoc delegation to East Timor next autumn to assess the political situation and examine the adequacy of EU assistance programs. Syria In its resolution on Syria, Parliament notes that after signing a petition for improved Syrian-Lebanese relations in view of UN Security Council Resolution 1680, it was reported that several civil society activists were arrested and tortured, notably including the lawyer Anwar al Bunni and writer Michel Kilo as well as others such as Khalil Hussein, Dr Safwan Tayfour, Mahmoud Issa, Fateh Jammous, Prof. Suleiman Achmar, Nidal Derwiche, Suleiman Shummor, Ghalem Amer, Muhammad Mahfud, Mahmoud Meri'im, Yasser Melhem and Omar Idlibi. Anwar Al Bunni, a lawyer specialising in human rights issues, was arrested on the streets of Damascus when he was on the verge of taking up a post as Director of a Human Rights Centre financed by the European Union As long ago as November 2005, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch reported the arrest and risk of torture of the peaceful activist Kamal Al-Labwani, who is now facing a life sentence for expressing his views. Parliament urges the authorities there immediately to release all activists still detained for signing a petition calling for improved Syrian-Lebanese relations. It further urges the Syrian authorities to reconsider all cases of political prisoners and immediately release all prisoners of conscience, and to:
ensure that the detainees are well treated and not subject to torture or other ill-treatment;
ensure that detained or imprisoned persons are given prompt, regular and unrestricted access to
their lawyers, doctors and families.
MEPs call on Syria to ratify the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. They strongly support the declaration of 19 May 2006 by the EU Presidency on behalf of the European Union regarding the recent arrests in Syria. They point out that respect for human rights constitutes a vital component in any future EU-Syria Association Agreement and call on Syria to respect its commitments within the framework of the Barcelona Process and along the lines of the European Neighbourhood Policy. Parliament reasserts the necessity for the Commission and the Council also to do their utmost to ensure that the Association Agreement with Syria, which has not yet been signed, leads to an improvement of human rights in Syria. Finally, MEPs call on the Commission to annually assess the human rights situation in Syria and its compliance with the obligations under the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement and to report its findings within the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. North Korea On North Korea (the Democratic People's Republic of Korea - DPRK), Parliament deplores the lack of cooperation by the DPRK with international human rights institutions, and particularly its refusal to follow the procedures of the UN Commission on Human Rights. It calls on the government of North Korea to:
abide by the principles set out in the international human rights treaties it has ratified (such as the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) and incorporate these principles into
domestic law;
abolish the death penalty;
release all people detained or imprisoned for the peaceful exercise of fundamental human rights;
guarantee freedom of expression and freedom of movement for all North Koreans;
review existing legislation to ensure that it conforms with international human rights standards, and introduce safeguards to provide citizens with protections and remedies against human rights violations.
MEPs urge the DPRK government to provide information on the case of Mr Son Jong Nam and to stop his execution. They call on the Commission and the Council to do likewise. Parliament also calls on the North Korean authorities to review carefully the situation of all those condemned to death and to grant them a stay of execution, and calls for the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of Human Rights in North Korea, Professor Vitit Muntarbhorn, to be allowed to visit them. The resolution urges the government of the DPRK to end the severe human rights violations, including imprisonment and execution on account of religion or belief, against citizens not affiliated to the state-sponsored religious federations, and to allow religious believers to meet freely for worship, build and maintain places of worship and freely publish religious literature. Parliament recognises that the EU was the first and only party to engage in Human Rights Dialogues with the DPRK, which were discontinued in 2003. It urges both sides to endeavour to restart the dialogue on Human Rights between the EU and the DPRK. It calls on the government of the DPRK to fulfil its obligations under human rights instruments to which it is a party and ensure that humanitarian organisations, independent human rights monitors, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the DPRK and the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief have free access to the country. MEPs welcome the agreement between the World Food Programme and the government of the DPRK to support 1.9 million of the most vulnerable people, especially women and young children. They deplore, however, the ongoing and unnecessary suffering of the North Korean people as a consequence of the government’s policies, stressing that there should always be targeted and fair distribution of food in the country. They urge the government of the DPRK to end discrimination in its distribution of food in favour of high-ranking Workers’ Party officials and military, intelligence and police officers. Parliament calls on the government of the DPRK to hand over finally and completely all information on the citizens of South Korea and Japan who were abducted during recent decades, and immediately to release those abductees still being held in its country. It also calls on the government of the People’s Republic of China to stop repatriating North Korean citizens to the DPRK, where, regardless of their reasons for leaving, they face harsh treatment, ranging from detention to torture, long prison terms and even executions. Finally, MEPs call on the Republic of Korea (ROK) to assume its responsibility for North Korean refugees in China and on the government of the ROK to allow them to travel to South Korea.
