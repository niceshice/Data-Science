Budget 2010: MEPs restore original proposed funding levels - vote on recovery plan postponed to next week
Budget
2009-10-01 - 17:57
After a three-day marathon vote, the Budgets Committee dealt with most parts of next year's budget, including aid for the EU dairy sector, but postponed the vote on the financing of the economic recovery plan to next week.
MEPs voted to restore the figures from the Commission's preliminary draft budget for most of the budget headings, rather than follow the Council's draft budget which cut the payments by € 1.8 billion. In some priority policies and actions they even went further than the figures in the Commission's preliminary draft budget.
Energy, SMEs and social dialogue
Members of the committee voted to increase the payments for the trans-European networks for Energy (adding €10 million to the Council's €6 million) and for Transport (adding € 150 million to Council's €685 million). They also voted to increase by €35 million the amount for the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme — Intelligent Energy (Council's: €40 million).
Regarding the research for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the committee voted to add €30 million to Council's €97.3 million.
To strengthen the social dialogue, the members suggested an increase of €2 million over the Council's €13 million.
Milk crisis - 900 million to the dairy sector
As an answer to the on-going milk crisis, the committee voted for €300 million to be put in a reserve for the EU dairy fund. They considered this sum a more realistic basis for the forthcoming negotiations with the Council than the originally proposed 600 million.
The committee also supported the increase in refunds for milk and milk products, from €9 million in 2009 to €449 million for 2010. This increase was proposed by the Commission in its preliminary draft budget and confirmed in Council's draft budget. In addition, MEPs voted for increased support for school milk, adding €15 million to the €69 million foreseen.
These amendments together with the unchanged support for storage of skimmed-milk powder (€38 million) and storage of butter and cream (€60 million) would increase the support specifically for the dairy industry to €931 million.
Citzenship and communication
In the area of citizenship, covering policies such as Europe for citizens and the European Special Olympics Games, the main goal of the rapporteur László SURJÁN (EPP, HU) was to restore the Commissions original proposal after Council's cuts and several increases were adopted.
Communication with European citizens and journalists is one of the priorities for the 2010 budget procedure. The committee restored or even increased figures from the Commissions proposed budget.
Palestine, Baltic Sea and climate change
Regarding "The EU as a global player", the committee voted for an extra €25 million (over and above Council's first reading) in financial assistance to Palestine, making the total assistance €295m in commitments and €260m in payments.
Another priority was the Baltic Sea Strategy, where the committee adopted an amount of €20 million for coordination and information purposes. Regarding climate change, the committee voted for an extra €50 million in commitments and €20 million in payments in a reserve which can be released for measures confirmed by the Copenhagen Climate Conference in December 2009.
Increased support to Frontex and refugee fund
In the area of freedom, security and justice, the votes followed the general trend, which is one of increasing amounts. The European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at External Borders (Frontex) should receive an extra €5 million, says the committee, in addition to the original €54.4 million and the European Refugee Fund, originally €82.3 million, would get an extra €10 million.
Next steps
The Budgets Committee will continue voting, on Monday and Tuesday next week (5-6 October). It will adopt its resolutions on the 2010 budget on 8 October, which will then be tabled for approval by the full Parliament at the plenary in Strasbourg on 19-22 October. The budgetary conciliation meeting between Parliament and Council is scheduled for November.
