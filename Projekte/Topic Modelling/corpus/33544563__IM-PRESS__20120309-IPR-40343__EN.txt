Most speakers also called on the Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, to take a clear stand against it. Parliament is to vote a resolution on this issue on Thursday.
According to a majority of Parliament's political groups, the website goes against European values and threatens EU citizens' basic rights, such as free movement and non-discrimination.
