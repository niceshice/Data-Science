March 1958: delegates open a new era of debate
The Parliament will celebrate half a century of political debate in Strasbourg this week as it marks the 50th anniversary of the first meeting of the European Parliamentary Assembly. The European Parliament, as it became in 1962, has evolved with the European project. It began as a consultative body in 1958, direct elections in 1979 gave it a popular mandate and it now has a powerful legislative, budgetary and supervisory role.
The anniversary will be celebrated on Wednesday when MEPs will be joined by former Parliament Presidents, national Parliamentarians and leaders of the other European Institutions in the Chamber in Strasbourg. The whole event - which will feature a concert by the European Youth Orchestra - will be opened by Parliament's current President Hans-Gert Pöttering. Commission President José Manuel Barroso will also speak. You can watch the whole event live online from 1500 CET Wednesday here on the Parliament's website.
It was 19 March, 1958, when delegates first assembled as the European Parliamentary Assembly. A Parliamentary Assembly had been set up by under the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), created by the 1951Treaty of Paris. When the Treaty of Rome was signed in 1957, founding the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), it set up a European Parliamentary Assembly common to the three communities, which evolved into today's EP.
