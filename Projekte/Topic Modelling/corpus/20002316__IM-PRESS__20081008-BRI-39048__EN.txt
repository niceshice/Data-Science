"Words can foster and cure" an emotional Ingrid Betancourt tells MEPs
Addressing a formal sitting of the EP, in a passionate speech, Ingrid Betancourt spoke in depth about others around the world incarcerated against their will and the task of raising awareness of human rights violations globally. Ms Betancourt's key message was one of the power of discourse; "the only weapon we can believe in, is the force of words, there is nothing stronger than words." Ms Betancourt expressed her thanks to the EP's efforts in creating a public consensus for her plight.
MEPs debate financial crisis and upcoming European Council
The EU should act in a united fashion to tackle the financial market crisis, and Member States should avoid unilateral steps which cause problems for their neighbours, according to most of the MEPs taking part in the debate on next week's EU summit and the financial turmoil. Most groups welcomed the Commission's plans for a high-level group to consider market supervision policies, though some complained that not enough had been done in the past. French European Affairs Minister Jean-Pierre JOUYET and Commission President José Manuel Barroso participated in the debate.
MEPs advocate a holistic approach to eradicating poverty and a target minimum wage for all Member States
A holistic approach to eradicating poverty, which seeks to ensure adequate incomes, quality jobs and better access to social services, is advocated by the EP in an own-initiative report adopted on 9 October. MEPs call on the Council to agree an EU target for minimum wages to provide for remuneration of at least 60% of the relevant average wage and, further, to agree a timetable for achieving that target in all Member States. MEPs call on the Council to agree an EU-wide commitment to end street homelessness by 2015.
Implementation of social legislation relating to road transport
The European Parliament adopted an own-initiative report by 382 votes in favour to 232 against and 36 abstentions on the implementation of social legislation relating to road transport. MEPs express concern at the shortcomings and delays in the transposition and implementation of social legislation relating to road transport in some Member States. Self-employed drivers should also be included in the scope of the directive, say MEPs.
Together for health: A strategic approach for the EU 2008-2013
In adopting an own-initiative report entitled Together for health: A strategic approach for the EU 2008-2013, MEPs say that disease prevention efforts and vaccination campaigns, where effective products exist, should be stepped up significantly. Parliament therefore urges the Commission to draw up an ambitious plan for preventive actions for the entire five-year period. The report was adopted with 554 votes in favour, 23 against and 21 abstentions.
Water scarcity and droughts in the EU
In adopting an own-initiative report on water scarcity and droughts in the European Union, MEPs urge the Commission and Member States to acknowledge that deforestation and unrestrained urban development are contributing to growing water scarcity. The House calls on the Member States and the authorities concerned to pay heed to water-related considerations in their land-use planning. The report was adopted with 594 votes in favour, 45 against and 12 abstentions.
Reforming the governance of the International Financial Reporting Standards system
Parliament has set out its views on the proposal for a high-level Monitoring Group to oversee the bodies that develop International Financial Reporting Standards. MEPs are supportive of the proposal on the initial membership of the Group, but are doubtful about the value of setting it up until its role and powers have been clarified. In a resolution adopted on 9 October by 568 votes in favour to 27 against with 43 abstentions, Parliament says this Monitoring Group should be entitled to recommend candidates as Trustees and be responsible for approving the selection of Trustees after an agreed nomination process. It calls for the Group to be involved in setting the agenda for the IASB so as to ensure transparency and accountability, while recognising that the subsequent accounting standard setting process should remain free of undue interference and should be done in full consultation with all stakeholders, including investors.
Financial market supervision: Parliament calls for wide-ranging reform
MEPs made a formal call on Thursday (9 October) for the Commission to come up with legislation to improve the supervisory architecture and regulatory framework for financial services in Europe.Parliament adopted a report, drawn up by Ieke van den Burg (PES, NL) and Daniel Dăianu (ALDE, RO), which is a comprehensive overview of areas that need attention in the light of the current crisis and after seven years of operation of the current “Lamfalussy system” It includes recommendations on the structure for the “Level 3” Committees of national financial regulators (CESR for securities, CEIOPS for pensions and insurance, and CEBS for banking) and on the mechanisms for managing systemic risk.
Symbols of the Union to be adopted by Parliament
The European Union flag, anthem and motto have been formally recognised by the European Parliament. A proposal to amend Parliament's Rules of Procedure so as to formalise its use of these symbols was approved by the Chamber by a large majority. The flag, a circle of twelve golden stars on a blue background, will be displayed in all EP meeting rooms and at EP official events, says the report approved by 503 votes in favour to 96 against and 15 abstentions. During the debate preceding the vote, Mr. Carnero said this decision is "a political message to our citizens: the symbols of the union are alive in the institution that represents 500 million inhabitants".
Combating undeclared work: Member States should share knowledge
The European Parliament adopted an own-initiative report on a European Commission proposal to step up efforts to combat undeclared work. MEPs call on the Commission to consider establishing a database on the various approaches and methodologies used to measure undeclared work in the Member States so as to promote the sharing of good practice and knowledge transfer in this area. The report was adopted by 479 votes in favour, 50 against and 40 abstentions. Undeclared work, which in some Member States accounts of 20% of GDP, is a worrying feature of Europe's labour markets, say MEPs.
Belarus: European Parliament says elections fell short of international standards
In adopting a resolution on Belarus by 597 votes in favour to 31 against and 22 abstentions, MEPs regret that the significant progress which the EU had hoped for, in the interests of the Belarusian people, in the democratic development of Belarus did not materialise and that, despite some minor improvements, the 28 September parliamentary elections in Belarus fell short of international standards. MEPs also express satisfaction that the political prisoners Mr Alyaksandr Kazulin, Mr Syarhei Parsyukevich and Mr Andrei Kim have been released.
Doha Round: a successful conclusion could stabilise the economy
Following the WTO Doha Round suspension of negotiations last July, MEPs are concerned over the future of the Round. The House calls on India and the USA to find a political solution on the conditions for the application of Special Safeguard Mechanisms (SSM) over which the negotiations collapsed at the Geneva Ministerial meeting. The resolution was adopted by 567 votes in favour, 37 against and 47 abstentions.
Arctic governance: European Parliament deeply concerned about the effects of climate change
In adopting a resolution on Arctic governance, by 597 votes in favour to 23 against and 41 abstentions, MEPs expressed their concerns at the effects of climate change on the sustainability of the lives of the indigenous peoples, in terms of both the environment (melting icecap and permafrost, rising sea levels) and the natural habitat (the retreating icecap poses problems for polar bears' feeding habits), and underline that any international decisions on these issues must fully involve and take account of all peoples and nations of the Arctic. 20081008BRI39048 Texts adopted 9 October 2008 Draft Agenda - Strasbourg plenary session - 20-23 October 2008

Human rights
"Words can foster and cure" an emotional Ingrid Betancourt tells MEPs
2008-10-09 - 18:03
Addressing a formal sitting of the EP, in a passionate speech, Ingrid Betancourt spoke in depth about others around the world incarcerated against their will and the task of raising awareness of human rights violations globally. Ms Betancourt's key message was one of the power of discourse; "the only weapon we can believe in, is the force of words, there is nothing stronger than words." Ms Betancourt expressed her thanks to the EP's efforts in creating a public consensus for her plight. Ingrid Betancourt is a former Colombian presidential candidate who was freed in July after six years in captivity at the hands of FARC guerrillas. Ms Betancourt, who has frequently spoken out against terrorism, had decided to campaign in an area with a strong guerrilla presence despite warnings not to do so. Along with 14 other hostages, she was rescued by Colombian security forces on 2 July 2008 in Operation Jaque, having spent a total of 2,321 days in captivity.
Introducing Ingrid Betancourt , EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering opened by saying, "The fact that you are with us today is a clear sign that brave people, in their fight for freedom and human dignity, never lost hope. Terrorism, as practised by your abductors, is a direct attack on our values, freedom and democracy. Your example shows us again that democracy should never yield to terrorism; it is our moral responsibility that the rule of law always be defended."
"People have been deprived of their freedom simply because they campaigned for human rights. We want to be able to protect the defenders better in their work".
Admiration for a unified Europe
In the opening section of her speech, Ms Betancourt stressed her admiration for the European Parliament and everything it did in the build up to her release: "Just three months ago I was watching you act from the depths of the jungle and my biggest hope was that people could speak for us as prisoners at the madness of others. It is a miracle that I can share this," she said.
"I am full of admiration that this is a Parliament that I like very much and I dream like all South Americans that we can in our union one day come together in a Latin American parliament in order to find through dialogue the key of a shared destiny which will be a great destiny for our country."
Continuing the fight for those still held hostage
Ingrid Betancourt moved to remind Parliament and its audience of the continuing struggle in Colombia and those who are still incarcerated: "Parliament became aware that more than 3,000 of my countrymen are still suffering. Fifteen comrades and I were able to rediscover freedom and fight for the release of those others in captivity."
Ingrid Betancourt paid tribute to the Burmese leader Aung San Su Kyi and captured Israeli soldier Corporal Galid Shalit.
Ms Betancourt also paid a highly moving tribute to fellow detainees: "I would like to read out their names - please indulge me for a minute. When they hear their names in this House they will respond with a speeding up of their heartbeat within the tomb of the jungle." Ms Betancourt read the list of names with tears in her eyes.
The rhetoric of words- a force for global good
The core of the speech focussed squarely on the power of words: "As you know words are extremely powerful and it's using words that we can combat hatred and violence. You sometimes feel frustrated as you cannot achieve everything you want from your words. This happened to me in the Colombian Parliament.
In a materialistic world something that can't be seen doesn't exist but the parliament is the temple of speech and the freedom of speech and its words that can free.
You can bring about awareness in society and if the governments end up acting because one of you speaks on an issue. Every time one of you takes the floor, evil retreats. Words have an impact on real life. Human beings are beings that use speech. Words can foster and cure, but also hurt, harm and kill. Words are inspired by emotion." [At that stage, a deeply moved Ingrid Betancourt broke down as she spoke as did several MEPs]
Guerrilla fighters and terrorism- a social reflex?
Ms Betancourt was quick to point at larger social problems perpetuating violence as a result of capitalism: "Our society is producing countless guerrilla fighters in Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan. Do we have the right to build a society based on exclusion? We build our happiness based on others' suffering. We should be building rational societies where all are included with an end to conflict. Technology allows us to arrange things differently so we can find our place just by being a citizen. The defence of rights come from a change of habits. We must be more aware that our lifestyle brings pressure on others".
"I want to tell you about this certainty; through words we can irrigate the whole world. This strength in our souls that can lead us to speak to everybody. We can build peace and preserve freedom for everybody and we build a new civilisation of love". audio, 37:18 - Ingrid Betancourt - EN

European Council
MEPs debate financial crisis and upcoming European Council
2008-10-09 - 18:03
The EU should act in a united fashion to tackle the financial market crisis, and Member States should avoid unilateral steps which cause problems for their neighbours, according to most of the MEPs taking part in the debate on next week's EU summit and the financial turmoil. Most groups welcomed the Commission's plans for a high-level group to consider market supervision policies, though some complained that not enough had been done in the past. Council
French European Affairs Minister Jean-Pierre JOUYET speaking for the Council on the financial crisis said that "European co-ordination was a practical reality." Banks, regulators and the European Commission were all working together. "The EU is not a federal state comparable to the US", he said. Minister Jouyet welcomed the co-ordinated announcement of a half point cut by Central Banks across the world and stressed the importance of stabilising the inter-bank market. Specifically, Mr Jouyet welcomed the measures announced by Prime Minister Gordon Brown in the UK. He called on the Commission to show some "flexibility" as regards EU state-aid and competition rules. Finally, Mr Jouyet called on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to act as a real "financial policeman" as, he said, was the intention when it was created.
On the energy and climate package, Minister Jouyet said that he hoped to maintain the ambitious goals set out in the Commission proposals and that a first-reading agreement could be reached.
On the Lisbon Treaty, the Minister recalled that the Irish government should bring forward a "roadmap" that all Member States can sign up to for the December European Council. "We need the treaty more than ever", he said.
Commission
Europe has the rules it needs to tackle the financial market crisis in a European way, but this will be a severe test of its ability to co-ordinate effectively and act quickly, said Commission President José Manuel BARROSO .
Public intervention mostly takes place at national level because that's where the money and expertise are, but Member States must act on common principles, so as to take account of the cross-border effects of rescue operations, he continued, noting that in Europe, "two thirds of banking assets already have cross-border aspects".
Commission proposals on capital requirements, credit rating agencies and executive pay restraint (if better heeded) would help to build confidence, but Member States must show their resolution to act quickly, he said.
Meanwhile, the Commission is setting up a high-level group, chaired by former IMF Director-General Jacques de Larosière, to reflect on how Europe's financial market supervisory architecture can be made to fit its needs. This group will include European Commissioners Neelie Kroes (competition), Joaquin Almunia (economic and monetary affairs and Charlie McCreevy (internal market and services).
Some may say that a downturn is no time to worry about climate change, but progress on remedial measures is in fact central to our future prosperity, said the President.
On EU institutional reform, Mr Barroso avoided prejudging the way forward, but stressed the difficulty of managing crises when the Presidency rotates every six months. "These are unprecedented times, and we need to rise to the occasion", he concluded.
Political group speakers
The financial crisis is very worrying for the economy, jobs, and for millions of people who worked hard to save and see that the fruits of their efforts are vulnerable, said Joseph DAUL (EPP-ED, FR). Europe must manage the crisis and learn lessons, pooling its efforts to minimise the impact on its economies and firms - particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, which need support measures, he continued.
Financial markets are not working properly, credit rating agencies are not able to publish figures showing true levels of solvency, and it is "unacceptable" that the people who brought banks to their knees are not held to account, he stressed.
Mr Daul urged those Member States that have not yet ratified the draft Lisbon Treaty to do so as soon as possible, and hoped that it could be finally adopted in December. The Treaty is needed to enable the EU to take tough decisions, be they about the financial crisis or its own institutions, he said.
On climate change, Mr Daul warned against alarming industrialists, who have enough to worry about already. "We need time to save the planet for our children and grandchildren", he concluded.
"We need Lisbon more than ever" to help us to deal with crises, and we have to win over the Irish people to get it, said Martin SCHULZ (PES, DE).
Mr Schulz thought Commissioner Almunia an excellent choice for the high-level steering group announced by Mr Barroso. He was less happy with that of Mr McCreevy, whom he called an "apologist for untrammelled market capitalism". This would the "arsonist taking over the fire brigade", he said, adding that Ms Kroes "wants to do away with public savings banks".
"We have been hearing for years that the market will sort it out", but "the neo-liberal mainstream has just collapsed in a heap", he continued, stressing the need to think hard about appropriate rules for the new architecture, and suggesting that some forms of speculation should be prohibited by law.
Graham Watson (ALDE, UK) for the ALDE group said "At next week’s European Council you must move forward discussions on the Lisbon Treaty. We need a collective response to the financial crisis. We cannot sustain a situation in which Member States surprise one another with unilateral decisions with multilateral implications. Europe needs coordinated and consistent policies to stem the flow of financial losses, to establish transparency and good practice and to prevent future woes."
There are some who think they can now tap dance on the grave of capitalism, but solutions will not be found in closed markets and command economies. What we witness is not the failure of the market economy. Rather it is the excesses of unfettered, ineffectively regulated markets. Financial markets currently owe less to Adam Smith than to Cincinnati Kid. The greed of individual bankers, traders and short-sellers is certainly to blame, but so too is the failure of governments to ensure transparency and honesty in their dealings. They are not an overnight cure, but they will help to remedy the underlying sickness. It is right to raise deposit guarantee protection to a 50,000 euro minimum across the Union. Family savings will be secure and capital flight discouraged. We also look forward to hearing the Commission’s proposal to promote convergence of deposit guarantee schemes, just as we support rapid adoption of your ideas for improving capital adequacy. When you look at credit rating agencies, look at who pays their fees and at how they are supervised.
But we also need to strengthen the links between national financial regulators. Representatives from the Euro zone central banks sit together in the Governing Council of the ECB. "
Speaking for the Greens/EFA group, Pierre JONCKHEER (BE) said he had three messages, the first being that the European Parliament is split. "It was missing when it came to managing the financial crisis. The financial crisis shows inadequacy of shared European rule. We need more Europe and not less Europe."
His second message concerned the "responsibility of players". He said it is time to pinpoint the guilty. "It is too easy for me to point the finger at the Commission, when a number of Commissioners failed with legislation. It involves self regulation or no regulation at all." He added that people should shoulder their responsibilities.
His final point focused on the link between the financial and ecological crisis. "The financial crisis doesn't mean that the ecological crisis goes away". He said it was crucial that reflection groups should be instructing to ensure long term financing for the energy and climate package is guaranteed.
Brian CROWLEY (UEN, IE) congratulated the Council for its efforts particularly with regards to Russia and Georgia. "It took a lot of strength, a lot of courage and diplomacy to find a peaceful resolution to the difficulties we faced." He added that strong leadership can achieve more than military might or economic wealth.
With regard to the Lisbon Treaty, Ireland was thankful for the period of reflection given to it by Member States, but stressed that it is not different to the period of reflection that France and the Netherlands got when they rejected the Constitutional Treaty. "It takes time to put forward proposals and ideas. We must ensure that we don't hold the gun to anyone's heads as regards as to whether or not it will ratify the treaty."
With regard to the present financial crisis, Mr Crowley said that we must first of all guarantee to protect the ordinary person. The banks, he said, have got a guarantee but with that guarantee comes responsibility for them to now start lending to businesses and people to allow the economies to pick up. Not only, he said, is it about cutting the wages or salaries of executives, it is about ensuring that the economic cycle can get back to where it is supposed to be.
Francis WURTZ (GUE/NGL, FR) said that European leaders had "done away with moderation" and this "increased inequalities between people". "This capitalist system is so brutal and has been for the last decade and European leaders should be held accountable for this brutality."
He called for more honesty and a guarantee that SMEs do not lose their small fortunes. "We have been too shy, too slow and unclear on this front so far." He also stressed the importance of ethics because efficiency alone is not going "to prevent the wizards in the financial industry from drawing profits and creaming off the best from this disastrous situation." He finished by saying that these extreme times demand "reactive and innovative policies worthy of European citizens".
Nigel FARAGE (IND/DEM, UK) noted that European leader's smiles were weak last week as they talked about solidarity because "President's Sarkozy's US-style bailout plan had already collapse into the dust." He pointed to the "hypocrisy" of this notion of solidarity, claiming that countries were acting in "their own interests", a trend that had been started by Ireland "by going their own way".
To stop countries acting on their own interests we need to "take that power away from them", but this would not command public support. "What happened last week marks the beginning of the end", he said but "I see a speck of light. I see a dividend. The possibility of the beginning of the end to this mad and unwanted project."
Jana BOBOŠÍKOVÁ (NI, CZ) warned that "political elites should understand that there is no such thing as a free lunch". She said that governments now are offering to bail out "irresponsible bankers" and this creates a "moral hazard". It gives the impression that "they can rake in the profits without any financial responsibility". She added that this action will only serve to delay a crisis rather than avert it.
British and Irish speakers
Philip BUSHILL-MATTHEWS (EPP-ED, UK) said that taking into consideration the current financial crisis, the rapid appointment of a new Trade Commissioner is so important at this time and he strongly suggested that the hearing for the new appointee be brought forward.
With regard to SMEs, Mr Bushill-Matthews reported that he recently noticed that the end of August was the closure date for consultation on the Late Payments Directive. He asked for that consultation period to be reopened just for a further couple of months, because he believes that fresh message about the lack of working capital is something that we really ought to take on board. Mr Bushill-Matthews was not convinced that a Late Payments Directive review would solve the problem, but he thought that this sort of analysis would contribute to an understanding of the problem.
Proinsias De ROSSA (PES, IE).said that the Irish Government must seek to resolve the Irish roadblock to Lisbon, and should do so by maintaining Ireland as a full member, not as a semi-detached member which opt-outs would relegate us to. "We need Lisbon now more than ever to strengthen Europe globally and to respond effectively to citizens’ concerns. " The euro, he said, is an example of what Europe can achieve when it seriously shares sovereignty. Certainly, if Ireland had opted to keep the Irish pound it would have disappeared, sunk without trace by now.
While President Barroso, he said, has admitted he got little cooperation from Member States in producing a coordinated response to the crisis, he is silent, however, about Commissioner McCreevy's continued resistance to re-regulation. Mr De Rossa expressed concern at the inclusion of Mr McCreevy in the three-person body that President Barroso is establishing.
Colm BURKE (EPP-ED, IE) said that, in his view, there cannot be a second referendum for at least 12 months in order to allow adequate consultation with the Irish electorate. A second referendum, he said, should be called during the autumn of next year, possibly in October. This means that Parliament elections will have to take place under the Nice Treaty, but this is the lesser of two evils in my opinion.
As to the nature of the second referendum, Mr Burke proposed an extended plebiscite to the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland where there would be a constitutional referendum on yes or no to the Lisbon Treaty while on the same day, polling consultative referenda on key opt in, opt out issues such as the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and European Security and Defence Policy. If in the extended referendum Irish voters were to opt out of either of these two areas, the Irish Government could then seek a separate agreement at the European Council to be signed by all 27 Member States. This move would be similar to the precedent of the Edinburgh Agreement sought by the Danes at the Council in December 1992 which granted Denmark four exemptions to the Maastricht Treaty. This allowed them to ratify the Treaty over all. With this plan, Member States who have already ratified the Lisbon Treaty would not have to do so again. This extended plebiscite would offer the Irish electorate a choice as to the extent of the role that they want to play within the European Union.
John PURVIS (EPP-ED, UK). said that it is absolutely essential that the inter-bank market is restarted. The only sure way to achieve this is to have sovereign state guarantees for wholesale inter-bank deposits, as indeed Ireland and Denmark have done in their domestic markets. While the contingent liability is enormous, he said, when the inter-bank market restarts, the banks will stop hoarding, they will start lending again to businesses and individuals and householders, inter-bank rates will return to normal levels and it is an absolute certainty that those guarantees will not need to be used.
He agreed with Mr Jouyet that this has to be done on a global basis. "It is the proper role of the IMF, as you said, to coordinate this action and only with such a bold move and on a global basis will we put out the fire and start to rekindle confidence."

MEPs advocate a holistic approach to eradicating poverty and a target minimum wage for all Member States
2008-10-09 - 18:03
A holistic approach to eradicating poverty, which seeks to ensure adequate incomes, quality jobs and better access to social services, is advocated by the EP in an own-initiative report. MEPs call on the Council to agree an EU target for minimum wages to provide for remuneration of at least 60% of the relevant average wage and, further, to agree a timetable for achieving that target in all Member States. MEPs call on the Council to agree an EU-wide commitment to end street homelessness by 2015. The report was adopted by 540 votes in favour to 57 against and 32 abstentions.
Eight per cent of EU workers are at risk of poverty. Although having a job is the best defence against poverty, it is not always a guarantee, stresses the own-initiative report on promoting social inclusion and combating poverty, including child poverty, in the EU.
An adequate income
Some of the 27 Member States have a minimum income scheme, but others do not. MEPs encourage Member States to provide for guaranteed minimum income schemes for social inclusion.
Minimum income schemes should be complemented by support measures to facilitate social inclusion e.g. in housing, education, training, and lifelong learning, and income support schemes to help cover the costs to individuals and households, say MEPs.
Member States should also provide targeted additional benefits for disadvantaged groups (people with disabilities or chronic diseases, lone parents or households with many children), to cover extra costs such as those of personal support and the use of medical care.
Child poverty
Children and young people make up almost one-third of the EU population and 19 million children are at risk of poverty.
MEPs want child poverty reduced by 50% by 2012, and urge Member States to allocate sufficient resources to achieve this goal. They also back an approach based on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
Homelessness
Lastly, MEPs call on the Council to agree an EU-wide commitment to end street homelessness by 2015. Member States are urged to provide integrated policies to ensure access to quality and affordable housing for all and to devise "winter emergency plans".

The European Parliament adopted an own-initiative report by 382 votes in favour to 232 against and 36 abstentions on the implementation of social legislation relating to road transport. MEPs express concern at the shortcomings and delays in the transposition and implementation of social legislation relating to road transport in some Member States. Self-employed drivers should also be included in the scope of the directive, say MEPs. The aim of Directive 2002/15/EC is to establish minimum requirements in relation to the organisation of working time in order to improve the health and safety protection of persons performing road transport activities, to improve road safety and to align conditions of competition.
MEPs call on the Member States to speed up the process of transposition and to provide for coercive measures in the event of failure.
Self-employed drivers have been excluded from the scope of the directive until at least 23 March 2009. It is important to eliminate disparities between the Member States and to help to ensure fair competition in the road transport sector by including self-employed drivers, say MEPs.
The House calls on the Commission to give consideration to the argument of the European Parliament for the full inclusion of self-employed drivers within the scope of the directive after the transitional period, and to give appropriate priority to the social dimension of road safety and the health and safety of drivers and other road users when drawing up its official impact assessment.

Reforming the governance of the International Financial Reporting Standards system
2008-10-09 - 18:03
Parliament has set out its views on the proposal for a high-level Monitoring Group to oversee the bodies that develop International Financial Reporting Standards. MEPs are supportive of the proposal on the initial membership of the Group, but are doubtful about the value of setting it up until its role and powers have been clarified. International Financial Reporting Standards are developed by the 14-member International Accounting Standards Board, which is appointed and overseen by the trustees of International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation, a private sector, not-for-profit organisation. Earlier this year, Parliament adopted a report criticising these governance arrangements and calling for greater accountability in the system. The IASCF has since proposing setting up a high-level Monitoring Group as part of reforms to address these concerns. In a resolution adopted on Thursday by 568 votes in favour to 27 against with 43 abstentions, Parliament says this Monitoring Group should be entitled to recommend candidates as Trustees and be responsible for approving the selection of Trustees after an agreed nomination process. It calls for the Group to be involved in setting the agenda for the IASB so as to ensure transparency and accountability, while recognising that the subsequent accounting standard setting process should remain free of undue interference and should be done in full consultation with all stakeholders, including investors. Not enough clarity on role and powers? Parliament expresses doubts about setting up the Monitoring Group at this stage, before a further consultation is launched and without a clear overview of the relationship to be established between the MG and the IASCF. It does not agree with the proposed make-up of the group, saying that the IMF and World Bank should not be represented, but should instead include the chair of the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision among others. MEPs say the membership of the Monitoring Group should reflect the balance of the world's most significant currency areas, cultural diversity, and the interests of both developed and emerging economies and of international institutions which have accountability requirements before public authorities. They are supportive of the initial proposal for its membership, but want to ensure EU market regulators are also represented and that no one organisation or country should have more than one representative. No need for an International Accounting Advisory Group Parliament deplores the fact that it was not consulted on the Commission's plans for an International Accounting Advisory Group in addition to the Monitoring Group. MEPs say membership of the Group should become effective only after the bodies represented have committed to introducing IFRS as their domestic accounting standard. Parliament wants to agree a Memorandum of Understanding on the association of legislators with the work of the Monitoring Group.

Financial market supervision: Parliament calls for wide-ranging reform
2008-10-09 - 18:03
MEPs made a formal call on Thursday (9 October) for the Commission to come up with legislation to improve the supervisory architecture and regulatory framework for financial services in Europe. Parliament adopted a report, drawn up by Ieke van den Burg (PES, NL) and Daniel Dăianu (ALDE, RO), which is a comprehensive overview of areas that need attention in the light of the current crisis and after seven years of operation of the current “Lamfalussy system” It includes recommendations on the structure for the “Level 3” Committees of national financial regulators (CESR for securities, CEIOPS for pensions and insurance, and CEBS for banking) and on the mechanisms for managing systemic risk. Solid legal basis for supervision MEPs argue that voluntary arrangements are insufficient to streamline the fragmented structure of European supervisors that need to guarantee the stability of the financial markets and protect the real economy against excessive risks. The Level 3 committees need a legal status commensurate with their duties, and national supervisors should have a commitment to executing the decisions of the committees written into their mandates. Today MEPs stressed the need to have a structure at EU level that would be legally empowered to break deadlocks and solve conflicts between national and sectoral supervisors. This structure should be an "add on" to the existing network of the light coordination structure of national supervisors in the banking, insurance and securities market. It should contain an independent chair and vice chair, that together with the three chairs of those committees on the coordination of national supervisors (for banking, insurance/pensions and securities) would form a sort of "appeal body" and a coordinating structure that could hugely improve the effectiveness and rapidity of action in crisis situations. MEPs encourage the Level 3 Committees to work towards better cross-sector and cross-border integration and coordination. Parliament says that colleges of supervisors dealing with cross-border institutions should become mandatory with a fairly fixed division of competences and a system of qualified majority voting between the supervisors which enables them to make decisions. The plenary agreed on an indication of what could be the key parameters for qualified majority voting inside the European supervisors committees. Not only the size of the Member State and the financial group's headquarters should count, but also the systemic importance of the activities of that group for a member State where it has branches or subsidiaries Role of the ECSB and international representation Micro- and macro-prudential and market supervisors should combine their knowledge of developments in the market. The European System of Central Banks would get a central position to coordinate and to take leadership if necessary. The division of information and tasks should also be streamlined to improve the voice of the European Union at international level, says the report. The EU should have a clear voice in international bodies including the Financial Stability Forum. Transparency: securitisation, complex financial products and rating agencies The report calls for measures to make the securitisation process (the selling on as investment products of loans by those who originate them) more transparent and for credit rating agencies to use appropriate terminology making clear the difference between complex financial products. It says companies should not be able artificially to keep debt vehicles off their balance sheets. Originators of securitised products should be required to assess and monitor risk and ensure debt-backed securities are transparent enough for investors to be able to understand the risks they are taking on. More transparency is also required when it comes to the over-the-counter markets, where clearing houses should be encouraged. MEPs want to see lessons learned from the oversight of auditors to be applied to credit rating agencies, notably when it comes to conflicts of interest. Deposit guarantee schemes MEPs urge the Commission to ensure that deposit guarantees are urgently revised to avoid arbitrage between guarantee levels in Member States that may further increase volatility and undermine financial stability instead of increasing security and depositors' confidence. Moreover, the level of refund should be significantly increased and the availability of refunds to retail clients in case of failing financial institutions should be assured within a reasonable timeframe including cross-border situations. Remuneration disclosed and assessed for risk Financial institutions should disclose their remuneration policy, notably including the packages offer to directors – and market supervisors should assess whether the remuneration policy encourages extreme risk taking when they examine a company’s risk management. Procedural information The report was drawn up under Rule 39 of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, whereby the EP can use its right formally to request that the Commission draw up legislation on a particular subject (Article 192 of the Treaty). The report was adopted with 565 votes in favour, 74 against and 18 abstentions - easily meeting the requirement for an absolute majority of Parliament to support such legislative requests.

Together for health: A strategic approach for the EU 2008-2013
2008-10-09 - 18:03
In adopting an own-initiative report entitled Together for health: A strategic approach for the EU 2008-2013, MEPs say that disease prevention efforts and vaccination campaigns, where effective products exist, should be stepped up significantly. Parliament therefore urges the Commission to draw up an ambitious plan for preventive actions for the entire five-year period. The report was adopted with 554 votes in favour, 23 against and 21 abstentions. The House agrees that spending on health, particularly on prevention and early diagnosis of diseases, is not only a cost but also an investment that could be evaluated in terms of Healthy Life Years (HLYs) as a Lisbon Structural Indicator. The report stresses the importance of carrying out well-organised, comprehensive and effective screening programmes to facilitate the early detection and immediate treatment of disease, thereby reducing the associated mortality and morbidity. Healthy lifestyle MEPs stress that the concept of ‘healthy lifestyle’ (i.e. a healthy diet, the absence of drug abuse and sufficient physical activity) needs to be complemented by a psychosocial dimension (i.e. a balanced approach to work and family life). The European Parliament argues that a healthy lifestyle includes good mental and physical health and that these are also important factors in maintaining a competitive economy. Antibiotics Parliament demands effective measures to combat antibiotic resistance including measures to make antibiotics prescription only, guidelines to decrease the prescription of antibiotics to limit it to cases in which the use of an antibiotic is indeed necessary, efforts to improve marker tests in order to encourage a more cautious use of antibiotics, and, where appropriate, hygiene codes. The report calls for special attention to be paid to the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteria. MEPs point out that the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) should monitor and evaluate the application of the guidelines and codes. The report draws the attention of the Commission and Member States to the need to support research and promote the prevention, early diagnosis and suitable treatment of chronic diseases in order to ensure sufferers' welfare and quality of life. The House says that antibiotics are becoming increasingly useless as antibiotic resistance rises, whereas resistance levels vary across the EU, resulting from different attitudes to the use and control of antibiotics (3 to 4 times greater consumption of antibiotics in some Member States than in other Member States). MEPs point out that antibiotic resistance is a European problem as frequent movements including tourism take place increasing the risk of spreading the resistant bacteria, and inappropriate use of antibiotics should therefore be monitored and prudent use of antibiotics encouraged, whereas the ECDC serves as the appropriate agency to coordinate these activities.

Water scarcity and droughts in the EU
2008-10-09 - 18:03
In adopting an own-initiative report on water scarcity and droughts in the European Union, MEPs urge the Commission and Member States to acknowledge that deforestation and unrestrained urban development are contributing to growing water scarcity. The House calls on the Member States and the authorities concerned to pay heed to water-related considerations in their land-use planning. The report was adopted with 594 votes in favour, 45 against and 12 abstentions. Parliament stresses that any supply of water regardless of the purpose of its consumption must comply with the principle of fair water tarification, thereby encouraging companies especially to use water more efficiently. The report stresses that the cross-regional and trans-border nature of river basins can have a serious cross-border impact on upstream and downstream regions, and that it is thus indispensable for the Member States, as well as regional and local authorities, to cooperate on the issue of water scarcity and drought ensuring sustainable and fair use of water resources. The House considers that the specificity of the water scarcity and droughts issue requires coordinated action at EU and Member State level as well as at regional and local government level. Structural funds The House calls on regional and local authorities to take advantage of the great opportunities offered by the Structural Funds and invest in the improvement or renewal of existing infrastructure and technology (in particular in regions where water resources are wasted due to leakages from water pipes) including, notably, clean technologies that facilitate the efficient use of water and can be linked to integrated water resource management (IRM), in particular to address the challenge of water efficiency (in terms of savings and reutilisation) in the industrial and agricultural sectors as well as on the part of domestic consumers. The report stresses that planning for the European agricultural model should take account of the most frequent and acute environmental hazards as well as water scarcity and drought and that, in that context, an effective crisis management mechanism should constitute a fundamental element of the CAP. MEPs take the view that the environmental value of forests and agricultural production must be reassessed in a context of climate change where it is absolutely vital to balance the increase in greenhouse gas emissions with an increase in forest cover, whose contribution as a carbon sink must be taken into account in all policies on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The European Parliament supports the Commission's commitment to continue to highlight the challenge of water scarcity and drought at international level, in particular through the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Symbols of the Union to be adopted by Parliament
2008-10-09 - 18:03
The European Union flag, anthem and motto have been formally recognised by the European Parliament. A proposal to amend Parliament's Rules of Procedure so as to formalise its use of these symbols was approved by the Chamber by a large majority.
The flag, a circle of twelve golden stars on a blue background, will be displayed in all EP meeting rooms and at EP official events, says the report approved by 503 votes in favour 96 against and 15 abstentions. During the debate preceding the vote, Mr. Carnero said this decision is "a political message to our citizens: the symbols of the union are alive in the institution that represents 500 million inhabitants".
The anthem, based on the "Ode to Joy" from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, is to be performed at the opening ceremony following each European election and at formal sittings.
The motto, "United in diversity", will be reproduced on all Parliament's official documents.
Finally, the celebration of Europe Day on 9 May is also to be formally recognised in Parliament's Rules of Procedure.
Any amendment to the rules of procedure needs an absolute majority of MEPs (i.e. at least 393 votes in favour) to be approved.
UK and Irish speakers who participated in the debate preceding the vote
Jim ALLISTER (NI, UK) said that he was not going to trade his anthem and flag for the "tawdry baubles of Eurofederalism.". "Ode to Joy which we are going to purloin may be a very nice tune, but so is Jingle Bells and like Jingle Bells it heralds a fantasy, the fantasy that the EU is good for you. But unlike Jingle Bells, it will damage your national sovereignty and the right to control your own destiny. More, like code to destroy, than Ode to Joy."
Mr Allister said that his constituents do not want an EU flag and an EU anthem. What they do want, he said, is the right to say yes or no to the Lisbon Treaty.
Richard CORBETT (PSE, UK) expressed surprise "at the storm in a teacup" that this change to Parliament's Rules of Procedure has provoked in some quarters. We know, he said, that the Member States decided some time ago not to elevate the European flag and anthem to treaty status. They decided not to give it such an elevated status but to leave it with its current status. While it has been given recognition by the institutions, we. the European Parliament, have never actually recognised it in our rules. Mr Corbett thought it quite logical that this anomaly be tidied up and a reference to the flag put in the Rules of Procedure.
Geoffrey VAN ORDEN (EPP-ED, UK) said that while there is constant reassurance that the European Union has no ambition to become a state, yet every resolution and piece of legislation through this Parliament takes us further in that direction. In order to try and sell the Treaty of Lisbon, he said, national negotiators decided that parts of the constitution that could be interpreted as impinging on statehood such as the flag and the hymn should be removed.
Concluding, Mr Van Orden said that his constituents in the east of England "do not want a constitution, they do not want the Treaty of Lisbon and they certainly do not want a state called Europe and I think it is an affront to them to try and introduce or give official character to these symbols."
Andrew DUFF (ALDE, UK) found it strange – tragic even – that the symbols are attacked by people who were formerly from the communist states of Central and Eastern Europe. He recalled the flags being waved in the crowds in Tallinn, East Berlin and Budapest as well as the anthem being played at the Brandenburg Gate. These things, he said, were not imposed or prescribed by parliamentary rules of procedure but were inspired by the hearts and emotions of the citizens. The symbols represent our dignified values of peace and solidarity, he concluded. Text, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 9 October)

Combating undeclared work: Member States should share knowledge
2008-10-09 - 18:03
The European Parliament adopted an own-initiative report on a European Commission proposal to step up efforts to combat undeclared work. MEPs call on the Commission to consider establishing a database on the various approaches and methodologies used to measure undeclared work in the Member States so as to promote the sharing of good practice and knowledge transfer in this area. The report was adopted by 479 votes in favour, 50 against and 40 abstentions. Undeclared work, which in some Member States accounts of 20% of GDP, is a worrying feature of Europe's labour markets, say MEPs. Undeclared work risks undermining the European social model and distorting competition on the single market. It also leads to social dumping, notes the report. Furthermore, immigrants, particularly illegal ones, are more exposed to the risks of undeclared work. MEPs ask that Europe's efforts to combat undeclared work be more pro-active and incisive, so as to ensure that the modernisation of labour law in the Union is not confined to the purely theoretical level but is translated into effective, high-quality policies, and to ensure that improved job quality can be achieved in every case in accordance with the 'decent work' objective. Better European co-ordination MEPs call for the EU to play a greater role in promoting co-operation and co-ordination among labour inspectorates, by strengthening the economic and technological resources of inspection services. Undeclared work has various definitions in the national legal systems, and a definition common to all Member States would ultimately eliminate statistical uncertainties. The Commission's proposed distinction between legal and illegal activities can be used as a starting point, say MEPs. Encourage the formal economy The House asks Member States to consider improving incentives to declare work and to impose tough sanctions on employers whom, despite benefiting from incentive measures, continue to employ undeclared workers. MEPs also call for better enforcement of existing minimum wage legislation in each Member State and urge those Member States that do not currently have a decent minimum wage to consider developing one, in negotiation with the social partners and in accordance with national practices. Free movement of workers in the EU Finally, Member States that have applied transitional arrangements to the free movement of workers in the EU are asked to open up their labour markets to workers from all the new Member States, given that restrictions not only run counter to the EU's founding principles, but increase recourse to undeclared work and could create territorial imbalances, stresses the report.

Belarus: European Parliament says elections fell short of international standards
2008-10-09 - 18:03
In adopting a resolution on Belarus, MEPs regret that the significant progress which the EU had hoped for, in the interests of the Belarusian people, in the democratic development of Belarus did not materialise and that, despite some minor improvements, the 28 September parliamentary elections in Belarus fell short of international standards. MEPs also express satisfaction that the political prisoners Mr Alyaksandr Kazulin, Mr Syarhei Parsyukevich and Mr Andrei Kim have been released. The resolution was adopted by 597 votes in favour to 31 against and 22 abstentions.
The House calls on the Council and the Commission to continue the dialogue with and devise a policy vis-à-vis Belarus, subject to strict positive conditionality based on a gradual step-by-step approach, equipped with benchmarks, timetables, a revision clause and adequate financial resources.
The European Parliament calls on the Council and the Commission to consider a selective review and possible suspension of existing restrictive measures, with a view to providing advantages for ordinary citizens and promoting the development of a free society.
The House calls on the Council and the Commission not to lift the visa ban on those directly involved in violating democratic election standards and human rights. MEPs call for consideration to be given to a six-month partial suspension of this sanction for other officials, provided that during that period the restrictive media law adopted at the end of June 2008 is amended before it is fully implemented.
Visas
MEP calls on the Council and the Commission to take further steps towards the facilitation and liberalisation of visa procedures for Belarusian citizens, as such action is crucial to fulfil the main goal of EU policy towards Belarus, namely to facilitate and intensify people-to-people contacts and to democratise the country. The House urges them, in this context, to consider the scope for lowering the cost of visas for Belarusian citizens entering the Schengen Area, which is the only way to prevent Belarus and its citizens from becoming increasingly isolated. The House calls on the Belarusian authorities to end their practice of issuing exit visas to their citizens, in particular children and students.
Abkhazia and South Ossetia
MEPs welcome the approach taken so far by the Belarusian authorities, despite enormous pressure, not to recognise the unilateral independence declared by South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
Death penalty
Finally, MEPs condemn the fact that Belarus is the only country in Europe which still has the death penalty, contrary to European values. Text, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 9 October)

Doha Round: a successful conclusion could stabilise the economy
2008-10-09 - 18:03
Following the WTO Doha Round suspension of negotiations last July, MEPs are concerned over the future of the Round. The House calls on India and the USA to find a political solution on the conditions for the application of Special Safeguard Mechanisms (SSM) over which the negotiations collapsed at the Geneva Ministerial meeting.
The resolution was adopted by 567 votes in favour, 37 against and 47 abstentions. In the context of the economic and financial crisis, MEPs are convinced that a successful conclusion of the Doha Round could be a stabilising factor for the world economy. MEPS thus reiterate their commitment to the multilateral approach to trade policy
The resolution calls on the EU and the USA, as well as the G20, to assume their responsibilities in the current negotiations and to make every effort to reach a deal as rapidly as possible. The progress made during the negotiations so far should provide a basis at the next meeting for achieving a successful outcome.
The Parliament calls on the developed and advanced developing countries to follow the EU Everything but Arms initiative, offering 100% duty-free, quota-free market access for less developed countries.
Reform of the WTO
According to MEPs, difficulties of the Doha Development Agenda highlight the need, once the Round is over, to address the question of reform of the WTO in order to make it more transparent and improve its democratic legitimacy. Parliamentarians should exercise a more vigorous and effective scrutiny in the area of international trade, says the resolution. Text, as adopted by the EP,will be available here (click on 9 October)

Arctic governance: European Parliament deeply concerned about the effects of climate change
2008-10-09 - 18:03
In adopting a resolution on Arctic governance, MEPs say that they are concerned at the effects of climate change on the sustainability of the lives of the indigenous peoples, in terms of both the environment (melting icecap and permafrost, rising sea levels) and the natural habitat (the retreating icecap poses problems for polar bears' feeding habits), and underline that any international decisions on these issues must fully involve and take account of all peoples and nations of the Arctic. The resolution was adopted by 597 votes in favour to 23 against and 41 abstentions.
MEPs underline that Arctic species and societies have developed very specialised adaptations to the harsh conditions found at the poles, thus making them extremely vulnerable to dramatic changes in these conditions. The European Parliament is very concerned for walruses, polar bears, seals and other marine mammals which rely on sea ice for resting, feeding, hunting and breeding, and which are particularly threatened by climate change.
Parliament calls on the Commission to include energy and security policy in the Arctic region on its agenda, and to propose, in particular, in its expected communication on the region, suitable subjects and joint working procedures for the EU and the Arctic countries in, especially, the fields of climate change, sustainable development, security of energy supply and maritime safety.
Special attention in climate negotiations
MEPs draw attention to the fact that the Arctic region, by virtue of its impact on the world's climate and its singular natural environment, merits special consideration as the EU develops its position for the 2009 COP 15 Framework Convention on Climate Change in Copenhagen.
Parliament supports the Arctic Council in maintaining the Arctic region as a region of low tension, open to international research cooperation, so as to allow its potential as a future energy supplier region to be fully developed within a sustainable environmental framework.
MEPs urge the Commission to take a proactive role in the Arctic by at least, as a first step, taking up 'observer status' on the Arctic Council, and consider that the Commission should set up a dedicated Arctic desk;
New Treaty?
The House suggests that the Commission should be prepared to pursue the opening of international negotiations designed to lead to the adoption of an international treaty for the protection of the Arctic. The House believes, however, that as a minimum starting-point such a treaty could at least cover the unpopulated and unclaimed area at the centre of the Arctic Ocean.
Finally, MEPs say that they remain particularly concerned over the ongoing race for natural resources in the Arctic, which may lead to security threats for the EU and overall international instability. Text, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 9 October)
