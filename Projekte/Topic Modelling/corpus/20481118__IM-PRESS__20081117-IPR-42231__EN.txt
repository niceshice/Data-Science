In a resolution on the Convention of Cluster Munitions (CCM) adopted at the end of this week's plenary session, MEPs call on all EU members to "sign, ratify and implement the CCM at the earliest opportunity", and to take steps towards implementation "even before it is signed and ratified". The resolution was adopted with 471 votes in favour, 6 against and 21 abstentions.
Parliament requests that Member States not use, invest in, stockpile, produce, transfer or export cluster munitions until the CCM has entered into force.
Users of cluster munitions to provide support
Member States which have used cluster munitions are called on to provide assistance to affected populations and to provide technical and financial assistance for the clearance and destruction of cluster munitions remnants.
Cluster bombs scatter over a wide area when dropped from the air or used in artillery shells. Many do not explode and it is often children who pick them up - with devastating consequences. The charity Handicap International estimates that 98% of the victims of cluster bombs are civilians of whom 27% are children.
MEPs urge the Commission to increase financial assistance through all available instruments to communities and individuals affected by unexploded cluster munitions.
Member States not to jeopardise the CCM
Member States are also requested to refrain from taking action "which might circumvent or jeopardise the CCM and its provisions". In particular, Parliament calls on all EU members "not to adopt, endorse or subsequently ratify a possible Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW) Protocol allowing for the use of cluster munitions which would not be compatible with the prohibition of such munitions pursuant to Articles 1 and 2 of the CCM".
