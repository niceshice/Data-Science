Protection of the euro against counterfeiting (Pericles programme)

MEPs adopted two draft Council decisions on Pericles, the programme to protect the euro against counterfeiting. The decision would prolong Pericles to 2013 and bring the non-euro zone Member States into the programme. The second report on the extension to States which have not adopted the euro was adopted with 607 votes in favour, 15 against and 17 abstentions.
Pericles was set up on 17 December 2001. Its aim is to support measures by Member States as well as existing programmes to combat counterfeiting of the euro. These include seminars, meetings, workshops and conferences as well as exchanges of technical, scientific and operational expertise.
Pericles has fully achieved its goals: the counterfeiting rate has been minimal. It has even been possible to pinpoint key non-EU countries where counterfeit notes have been produced, such as Colombia. This international projection of the programme has led to the creation in various countries of national anti-counterfeiting offices.
The two Council decisions will allow Pericles to be extended to the EU Member States which have not adopted the euro and also prolong its life to 31 December 2013, thus aligning it with the period of the financial perspective. The annual budget of €1m remains unchanged. Thus total funding to the end of 2013 will be €7m.
