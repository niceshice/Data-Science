Space for improvement of fundamental rights in EU
Despite some positive steps to improve fundamental rights in the European Union, Member States still have a long way to go to become the model for other countries. That is the conclusion of the report drawn up by Network of Independent Experts on Fundamental Rights and discussed in the Civil Liberties Committee on June 19.
The report, presented by Professor Olivier de Schutter, focused on the developments in 2005. One of the main criticisms concerns the practice of removing someone to a country where he or she would face a serious risk of torture or punishment: "Even persons dangerous for national security, even persons who are suspected of being terrorists may not in any circumstance be removed to countries where they face torture or ill-treatment," de Schutter said. The reliance on "diplomatic assurances" from states to which people are extradited is in his opinion "a very disturbing phenomenon".
The EU Network of Independent Experts on Fundamental Rights was set up by the European Commission upon the request of Parliament in 2002. The goal of the initiative is to monitor and report annually on fundamental rights in Member States.
Discrimination against minorities
Following the example of the Netherlands and Belgium the network welcomes the decision of Spain to legally accept same-sex cohabitation as marriage. However experts note that several Member States still have not sorted out the legal consequences of these unions. In the education area, Committee Chairman French MEP Jean-Marie Cavada warmly welcomed the report's focus on children's rights. It strongly criticises the segregation of Roma students in some Member States. In many cases they are falsely placed into special classes or institutions for children with mental disabilities.
Progress has been made
On the other hand the report also talks about the positive developments. Some Member States have gone beyond the minimum requirements of EU legislation and adopted their own national strategies to combat discrimination. Professor de Schutter commended especially the Parliament which has been actively contributing to legislation on personal data and permanently raises the concern of attacks against minorities which are according to British Labour MEP Michael Cashman on the rise since 2004.
