MEPs will debate enforcement of animal welfare rules Thursday Rules to protect animals aren't being enforced properly according to two British MEPs who will raise the issue in a debate in Parliament on Thursday morning. The fate of horses being moved around Europe in lorries is of particular concern. The debate can be seen live online from 1000 am.
The chair of Parliament's Agriculture Committee Neil Parish said that reports he received from organisations contain "significant evidence that the existing legislation is not being enforced in several member states".
Horses: "Packed like sardines into steel lorries"
"My biggest concern is for horses" said Mr Parish. "They are ill-suited to long distance travel and have specific needs. The legislation was designed to protect them, now it just needs to be enforced."
The Liberal Democrat MEP Liz Lynne told us "there is now overwhelming evidence showing EU rules meant to protect the welfare of horses...are being flouted, resulting in inhumane conditions and needless suffering."
The British Member said that "horses are being packed like sardines into steel lorries where temperatures can be above 40 degrees and might be transported for thousands of miles with no food or water, causing injury or even death."
"Nothing seems to be done"
Mr Parish said he had "pressed the European Commission many times on this, yet still nothing seems to be done", while Ms Lynne said "it is vital that EU Governments and the EU Commission act quickly to ensure that existing rules are properly enforced, with punishments to match."
Ms Lynne said "I hope Thursday's debate will raise awareness of the issue, both among my fellow MEPs and among the public in general, and will be a step towards alleviating the avoidable trauma these animals are subjected to."
