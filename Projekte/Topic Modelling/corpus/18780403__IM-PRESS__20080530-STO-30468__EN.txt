MEPs voting in Brussels
Peace, security and prosperity in the wider Mediterranean region were on MEPs' minds as they debated the relaunch of the "Barcelona Process" on Thursday. In the offing is a "Union for the Mediterranean" to upgrade relations between partners around the sea (750 million people, 39 governments). Promoted by French President Nicolas Sarkozy, it is likely to be a priority of the upcoming French Presidency of the EU. MEPs had their first say today.
"Mediterranean friends"
As the debate on EU relations with Mediterranean countries opened, European Commissioner for External relations Benita Ferrero-Waldner spoke of many challenges and opportunities for renewed co-operation with countries she called "our Mediterranean friends".
She said the relaunched initiative would strengthen political partnership, improve the sharing of responsibility in multilateral relations and encourage regional infrastructure and energy projects.
Most MEP welcomed the new impetus for partnership and expressed support for President Sarkozy's and the Commission's initiative. Members also called for a focus on partnership and people rather than structures and underlined the importance of the Euro-Mediterranean assembly. They also supported the Euro-Mediterranean University to be launched in Slovenia on 9 June, the Erasmus Mundus programme and more action on human rights.
People, not structures
Speaking for the EPP-ED group Italian MEP Vito said, "President Sarkozy deserves our applause" for calling for a Mediterranean Union. He also spoke of the importance of multilateral projects, a free-trade area by 2010 and reminded his fellow MEPs of existing tension in the Western Sahara and Middle-East.
For the Socialist group, leader Martin Schulz underlined three central challenges: the need for social stability as precondition for peace, the need for multilateralism and the importance of not launching parallel processes -"we don't need new institutions and more red tape".
Importance of trade, human rights underlined
British Liberal Graham Watson called for joint investment in infrastructure and people to bring them closer, adequate financing and the abolition of agricultural tariffs saying that "if we don’t take what they produce, we will end up taking their people".
For the Greens/EFA French MEP Hélène Flautre spoke of nuclear energy security in Mediterranean basin and urged guaranteed functioning of all mechanisms of control for human rights
Francis Wurtz for the (GUE/NGL) group said "it could be the future of peace that's at stake in this relationship". He regretted the lack of prosperity in the region and spoke of humiliation and discrimination of migrants in Europe.
Eastern dimension not to be forgotten
Konrad Szymański, a Polish Member of the UEN, underlined support for the "southern dimension", but said the EU must not forget policy towards the East.
Outright opposition in some quarters
Finally, Graham Booth for the (IND/DEM) group spoke against freedom of movement extending across the Mediterranean region and called the idea of a Mediterranean Union "an insane attempt, a disastrous idea".
