MEP who headed election mission gives her assessment to fellow MEPs EU Election Observation Mission say election was fair 95% of the polling stations there were present representatives of the two candidates and everybody was satisfied, The only person that saw fraud was the president who refused to leave On 25 January, the final report of the EU Election Observation Mission in Ivory Coast was presented in Brussels, instead of Abidjan, for security reasons. The report, debated yesterday in the Foreign Affairs and Development Committees, says that the elections were fair. "Our clear verdict about the fairness of the elections can prevent a president from keeping the power", said the Chief of the EU Election Observation Mission in Ivory Coast , MEP Cristian Preda (EPP, Romania).
Usually the final report of an elections observation mission is presented in the country where the election took place. Why an exception for Ivory Coast ?
The final report of an election observation mission is usually presented in the country where the election took place. This time, the report in not presented in Abidjan as the elections deepened the already existing political crisis. On the one hand, there are huge security risks. On the other hand, although the international community recognizes as president the one that won the elections - Alassane Ouattara - the situation in the country is still under the control of the ex-president, Laurent Gbagbo. There is a technical problem: we need visas, we cannot ask visas to a president we no longer recognize.
Did you have concerns for your own safety and that of your team during the observation mission?
Between the two rounds there was certain instability in terms of security. Both Gbagbo's and Outtara's supporters rejected the EU observation mission in their country. There were death threats and we had to withdraw the team in Yamoussoukro, which could not observe the second round.
Almost 20 observers spent the night after the elections in UN camps. One of the teams was harassed by military staff at the television. The fear for the mission members' security made us leave sooner than we planned. The observers participated in democratic construction, but we don't have the right to risk their security.
Some 200 hundred people died in the election-related violence. What is the situation now in Ivory Coast ? Is there a risk of civil war?
The situation is difficult. This moment has been expected by the citizens for five years, the elections having been postponed during this time. The people wanted to be out of the crisis. Everywhere I went in the country I heard people say: "Nous sommes fatigu√©s", "we want it to stop": That's why the turnout was 85%. The people were even more disappointed as the elections, instead of putting an end to the crisis, worsened it. The political crisis became a constitutional one.
The tension can lead at any time to violent clashes. Even more so, as the army is split itself, more than 60% of the military staff having voted for Ouattara in the second round. Gbagbo profited from the Constitutional Council's subordination to deny the results published by the Independent Electoral Commission. Happily, Ouattara's supporters didn't react so far. The situation didn't lead to a civil war yet, but this can still happen.
What is the message of the final report of the elections observation mission in Ivory Coast ?
EU had 120 observers, permanent and temporary, from 23 countries, which covered all the territory, all the 19 regions. We observed 1,000 out of the 20,000 polling stations. The conclusions are crystal clear. There were small irregularities, but these didn't lead to fraud. In over 95% of the polling stations there were present representatives of the two candidates and everybody was satisfied, nobody complained of fraud. The other international observers didn't find any fraud either.
The only person that saw fraud was the president who refused to leave. And he saw the fraud after the results. The only fraud that happened was to oblige the Constitutional Council to do an illegal act. This Council used an illegal procedure. It had the right to validate the results or to cancel the entire elections. It's illegal to only cancel part of the votes.
The situation in Ivory Coast shows the importance of the election observation. In this country, a president tries to keep the power and our clear verdict about the fairness of the elections can prevent him from doing this.
